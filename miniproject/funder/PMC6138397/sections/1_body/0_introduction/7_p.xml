<p>Here, we introduce an optimization method for designing robust multi-source epidemic forecasting systems and apply it forecasting seasonal flu in the US. Our framework is intended to be 
 <italic>plug-and-play</italic>, allowing researchers to evaluate large combinations of data sources with respect to their own forecasting model and performance metrics. In our case study, the candidate data sources include thousands of time series data sources from public health surveillance systems, electronic health records systems (EHR), search engines, and other website and social media applications. Our forecasting model is an extension of the flexible Bayesian machine learning method introduced in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], modified to combine multiple predictors. Finally, our objective function considers overall similarity between historical data and out-of-sample forecasts, averaging across 16 recent flu seasons. Unlike recent multi-source forecasting studies (such as [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]), we present a framework to rigorously evaluate much larger sets of candidate data sources both at the national and regional level and select complementary combinations that maximize forecast performance metrics. This approach not only yields more accurate forecasts, but provides quantitative insight into the relative utility of data sources.
