<p>Given the real-time availability of GFT at multiple geographic scales (from city to continental), many of the early forecasting methods used GFT as a test bed. Notably, Shaman et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] pioneers the use of Kalman filters to predict seasonal GFT dynamics from historical GFT and humidity data and Nsoesie et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] couples a simulation optimization method with a network-based epidemiological model to forecast regional influenza peaks. Another study forecasts GFT from a combination of GFT, temperature, and humidity data in a specific metropolitan area (Baltimore), and demonstrates that the integration of multiple data sources can improve forecast accuracy [
