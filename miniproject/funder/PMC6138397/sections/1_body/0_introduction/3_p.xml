<p>Novel data sources for outbreak surveillance are also arising outside of public health. Notably, researchers at Google launched the Google Flu Trends service (GFT) in 2008 to provide real-time estimates of influenza prevalence based on disease-related search activity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They showed that time series tracking the volumes of influenza-related Google searches closely mirrored influenza data from ILINet. However, it failed to capture the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and fell short in subsequent influenza seasons [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], resulting in the termination of the program in August 2015 by the company. Epidemic-related data have also been extracted from not only search engines [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but also interactive web-based applications (e.g., Flu Near You, InfluenzaNet) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and online social platforms such as Twitter (e.g., MappyHealth) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], Facebook [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Wikipedia [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While most of these data sources contain broad information, epidemic related data is 
 <italic>passively</italic> mined and filtered. There are, however, a few participatory systems that 
 <italic>directly</italic> solicit health data from voluntary participants [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For example, InfluenzaNet, has over 50 000 volunteers from ten European countries [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While many of these sources have been shown, individually, to estimate and predict influenza activity, we have yet to build forecasting models based on systematic comparisons and integration of complementary data.
