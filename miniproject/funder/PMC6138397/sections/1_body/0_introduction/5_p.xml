<p>More recent forecasting efforts have directly targeted CDC ILINet, rather than GFT, using a variety of predictor data sources. Brooks et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] apply a novel simulation-based Bayesian forecasting framework to forecast one season of ILINet from prior ILINet data. Their method first constructs prior distributions of seasonal flu curves by stochastically combining and transforming features of past flu seasons. As a season emerges, it updates the posterior distribution based on real-time observations and uses importance sampling to generate forecasts. Two other studies forecast ILINet from alternative data sourcesâ€”one evaluates the predictive performance of Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia, individually [
