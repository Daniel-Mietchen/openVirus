<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics annually result in significant global morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006236.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Early detection and forecasting of both emergence and peak epidemic activity can inform an effective allocation of resources, surge planning, and public health messaging [
