<p>Such data sources vary considerably in both availability and reliability. Some are available in near-real time, whereas others are lagged by days or weeks; some deeply sample geographic or socioeconomic slices of a population, whereas others provide representative but sparse samples of an entire population. In particular, internet and social media data can be misleading, particularly during newsworthy epidemiological events [

Optimization allows us to systematically balance such trade-offs and quantify the informational content and complementarity of different categories of data. We argue that, for a given forecasting task, candidate data sources should be evaluated and integrated based on clear performance metrics, which may include, for example, measures of forecast accuracy or precision at one or across multiple time points.
