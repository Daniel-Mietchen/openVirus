<p>The target data source is a time series in which distinct epidemics (seasons) can be identified and extracted. In our case, the target is ILINet or one of the other influenza-related time series listed above. Each predictor data source is a historical time series that can be aligned with the target. When forecasting a season, we assume that all predictor data sources can 
 <italic>only</italic> be observed for the first 
 <italic>w</italic> weeks of the season, and then make 
 <italic>n</italic> week long forecasts beginning with the 
 <italic>w + 1</italic>st week of the season. The target data source is assumed to be unobserved for the focal season, unless it is also serving as a predictor.
