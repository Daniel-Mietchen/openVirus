<p>When forecasting season 
 <italic>s</italic> from data source 
 <italic>d</italic>, we estimate prior distributions for each of these characteristics from historical 
 <italic>observed</italic> seasonal data, using all seasons of 
 <italic>d</italic> except 
 <italic>s</italic>: a set of possible shape curves, a range of peak height values, a range of peak week values, and a set of noise values. For example, when making an out-of-sample forecast of the 2007-2008 flu season, we build our prior distributions using all seasons for which data are available preceding and following 2007-2008. For ILINet, this would include all seasons between 2003 and 2014, except 2007-2008; for Athena, this would include only seasons between 2011 and 2014.
