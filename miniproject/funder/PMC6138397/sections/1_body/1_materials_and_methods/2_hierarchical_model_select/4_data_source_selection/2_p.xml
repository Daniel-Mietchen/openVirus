<p>The RMSE objective function favors forecasts that resemble the target ILINet data throughout entire seasons. We initially evaluated other objective functions, including minimization of (1) peak week error, (2) peak magnitude error, (3) both peak week and peak magnitude errors, and (4) RMSE values in a sliding window around the peak week. We found that overall RMSE minimization achieves not only the best season-long accuracy, but comparable predictions of peak timing and magnitude as the more targeted objective functions.</p>
