<p>We start by choosing the candidate data source that provides the best forecasts on its own. During subsequent rounds of selection, we evaluate each remaining candidate data source by (a) combining it with the previously selected data sources, (b) fitting a new linear model to the combined set of data sources, (c) for each season, calculate individual Bayesian empirical forecasts for each of the predictors, (d) for each season, derive a target forecast from the predictor forecasts using the fit linear model, (e) calculate the average RMSE (as defined in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006236.e015">Eq 5</xref>) of the resulting forecasts across all seasons. We then select the data source that, when combined with the previously selected data sources, produces the minimum average RMSE. In this way, we can sequentially build a set of complementary predictors that collectively predict the target time series. (See Algorithm in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006236.s001">S1 Algorithm</xref> for our data selection procedure).
