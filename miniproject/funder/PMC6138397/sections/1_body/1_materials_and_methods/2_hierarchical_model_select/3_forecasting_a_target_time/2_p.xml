<p>To obtain the credible intervals for the target data source, we generate an additional 
 <italic>N</italic> = 10, 000 separate target forecasts, each based on an independent sample from the posterior curves of each of the candidate predictors. The 95% credible interval is then constructed using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile value at each week of the forecast.
