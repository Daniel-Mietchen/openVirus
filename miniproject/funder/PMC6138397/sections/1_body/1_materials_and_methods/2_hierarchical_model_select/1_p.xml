<p>We use greedy optimization with forward selection to iteratively identify combinations of predictor data sources that collectively result in the most accurate forecast for a target data source. Our approach consists of three steps, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006236.g001">Fig 1</xref>. First, we individually forecast candidate data sources using an empirical Bayesian framework. Second, we use linear models to combine such individual forecasts into grand forecasts of a target time series. Finally, we build an optimal forecasting system (i.e., collection of predictor data sources) by sequentially adding candidate data sources that most improve the accuracy of historical out-of-sample forecasts of the target. Next sections describe these steps in detail.
