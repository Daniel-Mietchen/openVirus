 <italic>Athena Health flu-related electronic health records data (Athena)</italic>: athenahealth, a for-profit company providing cloud-based services for healthcare providers, supplied weekly data on flu-related patient visits throughout the US from 05/27/11 to 5/16/14. Specifically, we obtained separate time series for six quantities: the numbers of patient visits that included (1) a flu vaccination, (2) flu diagnosis, (3) ILI diagnosis, (4) a flu test (regardless of result), (5) a positive flu test and (6) a flu-related prescription. The data were aggregated at the state-, Health and Human Services (HHS) region-, and national-levels, totalling 435 different influenza-related Athena time series.
