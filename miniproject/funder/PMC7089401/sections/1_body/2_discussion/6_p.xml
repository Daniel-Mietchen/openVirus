<p>The persistence of BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME in the brains of IC-inoculated mice for 22 days, in the face of development of neutralizing antibodies is intriguing. Moreover, the viral antigen distribution observed by immunohistochemistry in these mice is similar to that seen in bovine foetuses and calves persistently infected with the non-arthropod-borne pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus [
