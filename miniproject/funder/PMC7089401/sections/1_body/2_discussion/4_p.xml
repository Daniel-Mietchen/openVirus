<p>Our results were in line with previous findings that a small number of amino acid substitutions can lead to different levels of temperature-dependent attenuation. Indeed, it has been shown that a single amino acid change occurring in WNV NS4B (C102S) resulted in restricted replication in Vero cells at 41Â°C and a highly attenuated phenotype

 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as causing lower morbidity and mortality 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While WNV NS4B is a few amino acids longer than BgV NS4B (255 vs 247 amino acids, respectively), 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis suggest that the two mutations (WNV E249G and BgV N244K) occur at the same position when compared in an alignment (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This confirmed that single mutations in distinct residues of NS4B can be instrumental for viral replication, whether it is temperature-dependent or not. Moreover, it was shown that changes in a conserved PEPE motif just prior to the NS4A/2K cleavage site (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) led to drastically impaired WNV replication and virion production [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The BgV NS4A C-terminal sequence does not include this conserved motif, which could play a role in its host-restriction and in the advent of the compensatory NS4A mutation observed.
