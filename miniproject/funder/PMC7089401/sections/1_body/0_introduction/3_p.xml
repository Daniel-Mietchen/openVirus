<p>In this report, we have assessed the host-restriction of BgV in a wider range of cell lines and animal species. We have generated a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses between BgV and WNV to investigate which BgV genes might be responsible for its host-restriction both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We investigated the effect of temperature on BgV host-restriction 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and then passaged the virus in vertebrate cells at various temperatures, which revealed that BgV host-restriction and attenuation were influenced by specific amino acid substitutions in the viral non-structural proteins. Uncovering the mechanisms involved in the host-restriction and attenuation of flaviviruses is crucial to understanding the mechanisms for emergence of new flaviviral diseases and to designing strategies for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogenic flaviviruses.
