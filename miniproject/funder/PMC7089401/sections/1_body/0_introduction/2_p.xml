<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to characterise flavivirus host-restriction, this study aimed to investigate Bamaga virus attenuation and the mechanisms involved. Bamaga virus (BgV) was recently isolated from archival mosquito samples of the 
 <italic>Culex sitiens</italic> subgroup collected in 2001 and 2004 from Cape York, Far North Queensland, Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and found to be phylogenetically most closely related to Edge Hill virus and other members of the yellow fever group. Despite this close genetic relationship, initial 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> characterisation showed that BgV displayed a restricted host range, as it was only able to replicate efficiently in a subset of vertebrate cell lines, and displayed a host-restricted phenotype in CD1 mice [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In an effort to classify BgV, its genome sequence was analysed for nucleotide composition and dinucleotide usage bias, which demonstrated that this virus most likely alternates between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, we recently reported that BgV could be horizontally transmitted by its only known vector, mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>sitiens</italic> subgroup, since mosquitoes which were blood-fed with an infectious bloodmeal had infectious virus detected in their saliva after incubation, and could interfere with West Nile virus (WNV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and WNV transmission 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since this host-restricted virus was shown to be capable of infecting some vertebrate cells and to be transmissible as part of a classical arbovirus transmission cycle, it is crucial to determine the factors of its apparent host-restriction. Indeed, identifying these restricting factors may help determine the likelihood for this virus to emerge as a major veterinary or human pathogen.
