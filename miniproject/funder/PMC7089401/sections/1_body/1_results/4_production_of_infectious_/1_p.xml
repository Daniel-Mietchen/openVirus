<p>To identify the viral factors associated with BgV host-restriction, we constructed infectious DNAs of BgV as well as chimeric viruses with a genome that contained genes of both BgV and a more promiscuous flavivirus, WNV. The BgV full genome sequence was first completed by sequencing the extreme ends of the BgV UTRs using RNA circularisation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (Genbank accession numbers: 5’ UTR MH257543, 3’ UTR MH257544). With this information, circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was used to generate infectious cDNA of BgV and two chimeric constructs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). One chimera contained the WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> genome as a backbone sequence with its prME genes replaced with those from BgV (WNV/BgV-prME); the other contained the BgV genome as a backbone with its prME genes switched for those from WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> (BgV/WNV-prME) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The C/prM and E/NS1 junctions used to design the chimeras followed the WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> and BgV published annotations. Rescued viruses were passaged in C6/36 cells and their full genomes sequenced and compared to the expected sequences based on their parental viruses. The only amino acid difference observed was a substitution in BgV/WNV-prME NS1-E342G (nucleotide mutation A3338G). All infectious DNA-derived viruses (BgV, WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>, WNV/BgV-prME, BgV/WNV-prME) were compared with native isolates of BgV and WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> in a replication kinetics assay in C6/36 cells. BgV/WNV-prME displayed significantly slower replication than BgV at early time points (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001 at 24h and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0254 at 48h) and so did the WNV infectious clone-derived virus compare to the WNV isolate (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0101 at 24h). Aside from these two instances, all CPER-derived viruses displayed similar replication kinetics in insect cells compared to their parental virus (
