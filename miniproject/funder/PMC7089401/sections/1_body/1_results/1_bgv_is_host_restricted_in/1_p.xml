<p>We have previously shown that BgV replication could be detected in OK, HEK293 and BHK cells but not in Vero, DF-1, or RK-13 cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. BgV replication was assessed in a wider range of insect and vertebrate cell lines at 28°C or 37°C, including in cell lines used in our previous study, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In insect cells (C6/36, MOS55, S2), BgV replicated as well as or better than the WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> reference virus. BgV also replicated in some vertebrate cell lines at 37°C (MDCK, PK15, LLC PK1, ST, OK, BHK, BSR, HEK293 and SW13) or 28°C (VSW, 3CPL), to a similar or lower titre than WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>. However, a subset of vertebrate cells (Vero, DF-1, RK-13, MEF
 <sub>WT</sub>, JU56), did not support BgV replication at 37°C, and another subset also failed to enable BgV to replicate at 28°C (A6, 3CPK, 1LV), despite supporting WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> replication at these temperatures.
