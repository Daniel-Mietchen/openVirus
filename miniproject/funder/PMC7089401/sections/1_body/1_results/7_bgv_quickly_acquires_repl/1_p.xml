<p>BgV was passaged in BSR and Vero cultures in an attempt to select for BgV variants which would grow in all vertebrate cells at 37°C. At each passage, 1mL of supernatant was blindly transferred onto fresh uninfected cells, while the infected cells were split 1 in 10 with fresh medium (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). When we analysed the supernatants from all passaged cultures for the presence of BgV, we found that replication-competent BgV variants had quickly arisen in the majority of Vero-derived samples, with only two BgV-negative samples (red crosses in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) were passaged once more on both BSR and Vero cells at 37°C and RNA extracted from the resulting supernatant was deep sequenced alongside the original inoculum. This revealed three nucleotide mutations (C6671T; C7479A; G7492T) corresponding to three amino acid changes (NS4A-S124F; NS4B-N244K; NS5-G2C) in the replication-competent variants that were not present in the original inoculum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). When viral RNA from all harvested supernatants were sequenced across the regions of these three sites, it was revealed that C7479A and G7492T were quickly selected for, even in cultures held at 34°C, and were always found concomitantly (green M in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). C6671T was always found in combination with the other two mutations as a triple mutation and only in some Vero-derived deep sequenced samples, cultured at 37°C. Based on these results, the following nomenclature was adopted: BgV
 <sub>X-YZ</sub> referring to the nucleotide in position 6671 (X), 7479 (Y) and 7492 (Z), with BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> corresponding to the prototype virus and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> corresponding to a variant with all three sites mutated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The three mutations were found to be in close proximity to a viral protease cleavage site: NS4A-S124F is the amino acid prior to the NS4A/2K cleavage site, and NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C are in positions -2 and +1 respectively compared to the NS4B/NS5 cleavage site (
