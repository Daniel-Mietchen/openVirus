<p>Two knockout strains of MEF cells were included among the cell lines tested for BgV replication in an attempt to elucidate whether BgV host-restriction was due to the anti-flaviviral activity from RNAse L or to the antagonistic effect of an IFN-I response. Neither MEF
 <sub>RNL-/-</sub>, which lack RNAse L, nor MEF
 <sub>IFNAR-/-</sub>, which lack receptors for type I interferons (IFN-I), supported BgV replication, suggesting that these mechanisms were not determinant (
