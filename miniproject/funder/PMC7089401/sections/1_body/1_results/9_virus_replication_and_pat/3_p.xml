<p>By comparison, the mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> replicated in 33% of the IP-injected mice and in 100% of the IC-injected mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g005">Fig 5Aâ€“5C</xref>). The antibody titres in seropositive IC-injected mice were higher on average for BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> than for prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). One BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> IC-injected mouse developed mild clinical signs (growth retardation, bloated abdomen, ruffled coat, hunching). It was included in the scheduled day 5 p.i. cohort cull for harvest of organs for virus isolation (see below). Necropsy revealed a gastro-intestinal tract full of gas and an under-developed spleen. Together these data show that the NS4/5 substitutions in BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> enhance infectivity and pathogenicity in mice compared to prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>.
