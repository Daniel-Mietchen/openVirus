<p>The mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME replicated in 67% IP-inoculated mice and all IC-inoculated mice, suggesting more efficient replication in peripheral tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g005">Fig 5Aâ€“5C</xref>). In addition, one BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME IC-inoculated mouse displayed intermittent clinical signs of disease including mild depression of activity, growth retardation and a weak grip between days 9 and 17 p.i. but never reached a score requiring euthanasia and survived until 22 days p.i.. Thus, mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME displays enhanced infectivity and pathogenicity in mice compared to BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME, due to the introduction of the NS4/5 substitutions. The mutant chimera also replicated more efficiently than mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>
