<p>We further assessed thin sections of organs harvested from inoculated mice for the presence of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry. We used either a cocktail of flavivirus E-protein specific mAbs or serum from mice infected with prototype BgV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for these experiments. This revealed widespread viral antigen expression in the brain of animals in the BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME IC-inoculated group on day 22 p.i., but not in the animals from this group terminated at days three and five p.i., nor in the animals from the BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> groups. The viral antigen positive cells were identified as vascular pericytes and leukocytes in the meningeal infiltrates (
