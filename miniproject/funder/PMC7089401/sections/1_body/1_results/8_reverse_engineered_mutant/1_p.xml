<p>Three BgV variants were generated (BgV
 <sub>T-CG</sub>, BgV
 <sub>C-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>) alongside a prototype BgV (BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>) in order to confirm the effect of the mutations on BgV replication in vertebrate cells. The mutation site sequences were confirmed in rescued viruses passaged once on C6/36 cells. The host-restriction and growth kinetics of these mutants were assessed in C6/36 cells at 28°C and in BSR and Vero cells at 37°C (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). These assays showed that all BgV variants and prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> had similar replication kinetics in C6/36 cells. The prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> and the NS4A single mutant BgV
 <sub>T-CG</sub> displayed similar growth patterns on BSR and Vero cells, with no replication detected in Vero cells, but efficient replication detected in BSR cells, with faster replication for the mutant compared to the prototype virus in the latter (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The double and triple mutants BgV
 <sub>C-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> replicated faster and to higher titres than prototype BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> in both vertebrate cell lines, with a slight advantage for the triple mutant BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The peak titres for all Bamaga virus variants were still lower than for the reference virus WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub> in both vertebrate cell lines (
