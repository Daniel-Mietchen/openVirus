<p>Triplicates of 1x10
 <sup>5</sup> infectious particles of virus were incubated in cell culture medium with 2% FBS at 4°C, 28°C, 34°C and 37°C and harvested at 30min, 24h, 48h and 72h after the start of incubation. The harvested virus was stored at -80°C and titrated on C6/36 cells as described above. Thermostability graphs were plotted in GraphPad Prism 7 with average and standard deviation of the triplicate values for each sample.
