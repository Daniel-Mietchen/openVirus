<p>The growth of virus in embryonated chicken eggs was assessed using a modification of a previously published method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, 50μL of diluted virus were inoculated intravenously into three groups of three 9–12 days old embryonated chicken eggs with the following doses: 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/mL, 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/mL and 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/mL (

 <sup>5.7</sup>, 10
 <sup>4.7</sup> and 10
 <sup>3.7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU/egg, respectively). Embryonated chicken eggs are used for arbovirus isolation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], but they are not routinely used in host-restriction experiments so the inoculum doses were chosen arbitrarily: an undiluted virus stock was used alongside two diluted doses, 1:10 and 1:100. The rationale was to use as much virus as possible in order to facilitate infection and to avoid the effects of interfering particles should they occur. The eggs were incubated at 33–35°C and candled daily. Embryos that died between days 2 and 5 were retained at 4°C and embryos remaining alive at 5 days post infection were culled. Whole embryos were homogenised after removal of their heads in approximately 10 mL of heart-brain-broth, after pooling the embryos inoculated with the same dose and culled at 5 days p.i.. The debris was removed by centrifugation and the resulting approximate 5 mL of clarified egg homogenates were titrated by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> on C6/36 cells as described above, incubated five days at 28°C and analysed by fixed-cell ELISA.
