<p>Virus neutralisation by the sera was also assessed for BgV and WNV
 <sub>KUN</sub>. Sera were diluted from 1/20 to 1/2560 by two-fold dilutions in growth medium. Fifty microliters of each dilution of sera were incubated in duplicate in 96 well plates at 37°C for one hour with 50μL of virus diluted to 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IU per well. C6/36 cells were then added (2x10
 <sup>4</sup> per well) and the plates incubated at 28°C for five days. Neutralisation of the viruses was analysed by fixed-cell ELISA with 4G2 as described above. The neutralisation titre was determined as the highest dilution at which all virus replication was inhibited. The data were statistically analysed using an unpaired parametric t-test and the only two groups that could be analysed (IC-inoculated BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME) were not statistically significantly different.
