<p>Three mutated versions of BgV infectious clone (BgV
 <sub>T-CG</sub>, BgV
 <sub>C-AT</sub> and BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>) as well as a mutated version of the BgV/WNV-prME chimera (BgV
 <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME) were generated using CPER as described above, alongside non-mutated versions (BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub> and BgV
 <sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME), under the Institutional Biosafety Subcommittee number IBC/1178/SCMB/2018. The mutations were introduced using specifically designed primers (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s002">S1 Table</xref>). Successful production of the mutants and infectious clone were confirmed by IFA with 4G2 on P0 transfected cells as well as later passages, and by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of P0 transfected and P1 infected cell supernatants. RNA was extracted from the P1 supernatant of all four viruses produced and the mutation sites amplified by RT-PCR as described above and Sanger sequenced at AGRF as described above to confirm their authenticity.
