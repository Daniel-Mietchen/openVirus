<p>BSR and Vero cells were infected with a stock of BgV generated in C6/36 cells at an MOI of 1 in T25 flasks and directly incubated at 34°C for five days, without removing the inoculum (passage 1 –P1). The P1 Vero cells supernatant was blind-passaged by transferring 1mL to three freshly seeded T25 flasks of Vero cells incubated at 34°C, 35°C and 37°C, respectively, for six days (P2 supernatant). The P1 Vero cells were split by removing cell culture supernatant, washing the monolayer with 10mL of sterile PBS and trypsinizing at 37°C for five minutes. The cells were resuspended in 10mL cell culture medium and 1mL was seeded in three T25 flasks incubated at 34°C, 35°C and 37°C respectively for six days (P2 cells). The P1 BSR cells supernatant was similarly blind-passaged on three T25 flasks incubated at 34°C, 35°C and 37°C, respectively, for six days (P2 supernatant). The BSR cells succumbed to strong cytopathic effect from the infection and could not be passaged. This process was repeated as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref> (P1-4), by passaging supernatant and cells either at stable temperatures (34°C or 37°C) or at increasing temperatures (35°C to 36°C to 37°C). At each passage, an aliquot of cell culture supernatant was harvested and stored at -80°C. After all the passages were completed, all samples were titrated by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> on C6/36 cells, incubated at 28°C for five days, fixed in 20% acetone, 0.02% BSA in PBS and analysed by fixed-cell ELISA using 4G2.
