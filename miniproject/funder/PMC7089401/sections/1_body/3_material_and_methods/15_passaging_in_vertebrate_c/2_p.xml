<p>Selected samples were further passaged (P5, circled in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) in order to confirm replication of BgV. For that purpose, 200μL of P4 supernatant were inoculated on both BSR and Vero cells seeded in a 24 well plate and incubated one hour at 37°C. The inoculum was removed, the cells were washed thrice with sterile PBS, replenished with 1mL of cell culture medium and incubated for five days at 37°C. Similarly to the previous samples, these cell culture supernatants were titrated by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> on C6/36 cells, incubated at 28°C for 5 days, and analysed by fixed-cell ELISA using 4G2.
