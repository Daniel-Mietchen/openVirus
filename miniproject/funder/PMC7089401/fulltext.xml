These viruses contain an RNA genome, prone to mutations, which enhances their potential to emerge as pathogens. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the yellow fever virus group that we have previously shown to be host-restricted in vertebrates and horizontally transmissible by <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Here, we aimed to characterise BgV host-restriction and to investigate the mechanisms involved. We showed that BgV could not replicate in a wide range of vertebrate cell lines and animal species. We determined that the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were independent of the type-1 interferon response and RNAse L activity. Using a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses generated as hybrids between BgV and West Nile virus, we demonstrated that BgV host-restriction occurred post-cell entry. Notably, BgV host-restriction was shown to be temperature-dependent, as BgV replicated in all vertebrate cell lines at 34&#x000b0;C but only in a subset at 37&#x000b0;C. Serial passaging of BgV in Vero cells resulted in adaptive mutants capable of efficient replication at 37&#x000b0;C. The identified mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in NS4A-S124F, NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C, all occurring close to a viral protease cleavage site (NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5). These mutations were reverse engineered into infectious clones of BgV, which revealed that NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C were sufficient to restore BgV replication in vertebrate cells at 37&#x000b0;C, while NS4A-S124F further increased replication efficiency. When these mutant viruses were injected into immunocompetent mice, alongside BgV and West Nile virus chimeras, infection and neurovirulence were enhanced as determined by clinical scores, seroconversion, micro-neutralisation, viremia, histopathology and immunohistochemistry, confirming the involvement of these residues in the attenuation of BgV. Our studies identify a new mechanism of host-restriction and attenuation of a mosquito-borne flavivirus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Mosquito-borne pathogens include flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, which continue to cause disease worldwide. Some of these flaviviruses have only recently emerged as major human pathogens, despite having been discovered decades ago. Determining the mechanisms of host-restriction of viruses with cryptic ecological niches will help us to understand how new viral diseases may emerge. In this study, we investigated the host-restriction of a recently discovered flavivirus, Bamaga virus. We demonstrated that the virus host-restriction observed in vertebrate cells only occurs at 37&#x000b0;C, and that the virus can replicate efficiently at lower temperatures.

Recent examples include Zika and yellow fever viruses, which have caused large epidemics in South America in the 2010s, and dengue virus, which is still the most prevalent disease-causing arthropod-borne virus worldwide. While, most flaviviruses are transmitted through a classical arthropod-borne cycle between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts, and exhibit replication in cells from a wild range of invertebrate and vertebrate host species, some flaviviruses exhibit a more narrow host range. These include flaviviruses that do not infect arthropod hosts (no known vector), fail to replicate in vertebrates (insect-specific) or exhibit host-restriction in vertebrate cells that is cell line- or temperature-dependent [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The mechanisms for emergence of pathogens from enzootic flaviviruses are not clear despite past examples of large-scale epidemics caused by under-studied flaviviruses such as Zika virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The emergence of flaviviruses as pathogens may be linked to the naturally high rate of mutations in the genome of RNA viruses, due to the low proof-reading efficiency of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, flaviviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 11 kilobases (kb), contained in an enveloped icosahedral nucleocapsid [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The viral RNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) coding for a single polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved into three structural (capsid (C), membrane precursor (prM) / membrane (M) and envelope (E)), seven non-structural (NS) proteins and the 2K peptide (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The translated polyprotein is embedded in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum <italic>via</italic> several transmembrane domains. It is cleaved by either a host signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (C/prM, prM/E, E/NS1 and 2K/NS4B) or the viral protease NS2B-NS3 in the cytoplasm (NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, NS4A/2K, NS4B/NS5). Once replication complexes have been established, with the NS5-encoded RdRp at their core, the viral RNA is replicated using a newly generated genome-length negative-sense strand as a template for new positive strands [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>As part of our ongoing efforts to characterise flavivirus host-restriction, this study aimed to investigate Bamaga virus attenuation and the mechanisms involved. Bamaga virus (BgV) was recently isolated from archival mosquito samples of the <italic>Culex sitiens</italic> subgroup collected in 2001 and 2004 from Cape York, Far North Queensland, Australia [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and found to be phylogenetically most closely related to Edge Hill virus and other members of the yellow fever group. Despite this close genetic relationship, initial <italic>in vitro</italic> characterisation showed that BgV displayed a restricted host range, as it was only able to replicate efficiently in a subset of vertebrate cell lines, and displayed a host-restricted phenotype in CD1 mice [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In an effort to classify BgV, its genome sequence was analysed for nucleotide composition and dinucleotide usage bias, which demonstrated that this virus most likely alternates between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, we recently reported that BgV could be horizontally transmitted by its only known vector, mosquitoes of the <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>sitiens</italic> subgroup, since mosquitoes which were blood-fed with an infectious bloodmeal had infectious virus detected in their saliva after incubation, and could interfere with West Nile virus (WNV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and WNV transmission <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since this host-restricted virus was shown to be capable of infecting some vertebrate cells and to be transmissible as part of a classical arbovirus transmission cycle, it is crucial to determine the factors of its apparent host-restriction. Indeed, identifying these restricting factors may help determine the likelihood for this virus to emerge as a major veterinary or human pathogen.</p><p>In this report, we have assessed the host-restriction of BgV in a wider range of cell lines and animal species. We have generated a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses between BgV and WNV to investigate which BgV genes might be responsible for its host-restriction both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We investigated the effect of temperature on BgV host-restriction <italic>in vitro</italic> and then passaged the virus in vertebrate cells at various temperatures, which revealed that BgV host-restriction and attenuation were influenced by specific amino acid substitutions in the viral non-structural proteins. Uncovering the mechanisms involved in the host-restriction and attenuation of flaviviruses is crucial to understanding the mechanisms for emergence of new flaviviral diseases and to designing strategies for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogenic flaviviruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>BgV is host-restricted in some vertebrate cells <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We have previously shown that BgV replication could be detected in OK, HEK293 and BHK cells but not in Vero, DF-1, or RK-13 cells [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

One chimera contained the WNV<sub>KUN</sub> genome as a backbone sequence with its prME genes replaced with those from BgV (WNV/BgV-prME); the other contained the BgV genome as a backbone with its prME genes switched for those from WNV<sub>KUN</sub> (BgV/WNV-prME) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The C/prM and E/NS1 junctions used to design the chimeras followed the WNV<sub>KUN</sub> and BgV published annotations. Rescued viruses were passaged in C6/36 cells and their full genomes sequenced and compared to the expected sequences based on their parental viruses. The only amino acid difference observed was a substitution in BgV/WNV-prME NS1-E342G (nucleotide mutation A3338G). All infectious DNA-derived viruses (BgV, WNV<sub>KUN</sub>, WNV/BgV-prME, BgV/WNV-prME) were compared with native isolates of BgV and WNV<sub>KUN</sub> in a replication kinetics assay in C6/36 cells. BgV/WNV-prME displayed significantly slower replication than BgV at early time points (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0001 at 24h and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0254 at 48h) and so did the WNV infectious clone-derived virus compare to the WNV isolate (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0101 at 24h). Aside from these two instances, all CPER-derived viruses displayed similar replication kinetics in insect cells compared to their parental virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0008166.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0008166.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>A.

When we analysed the supernatants from all passaged cultures for the presence of BgV, we found that replication-competent BgV variants had quickly arisen in the majority of Vero-derived samples, with only two BgV-negative samples (red crosses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

This revealed three nucleotide mutations (C6671T; C7479A; G7492T) corresponding to three amino acid changes (NS4A-S124F; NS4B-N244K; NS5-G2C) in the replication-competent variants that were not present in the original inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

Thus, mutant BgV<sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME displays enhanced infectivity and pathogenicity in mice compared to BgV<sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME, due to the introduction of the NS4/5 substitutions.

In the current study, host-restriction of BgV was defined <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> using a wider range of cell lines and vertebrate species that have been used by others to evaluate the host-range of arthropod-borne viruses such as Zika virus or chikungunya virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We show that BgV host-restriction is temperature-dependent, with all vertebrate cell lines permissive to BgV replication at 34&#x000b0;C, but only a subset of these cells are permissive at 37&#x000b0;C. This phenotype was confirmed to be independent of any potential thermal instability of the virus particles. In addition, recent reports have revealed that the antiviral effects of IFN-I and RNAse L responses could be significantly lower at cooler temperatures than in warmer environments [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, BgV still did not replicate at 37&#x000b0;C in cell lines deficient in IFN-I responses (Vero [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and MEF<sub>IFNAR-/-</sub>) or RNAse L (MEF<sub>RNL-/-</sub>), indicating that BgV host-restriction was not only due to IFN-I- or RNAse L-dependent mechanisms. Despite our data showing that the IFN-I pathways were not likely to be involved in BgV host-restriction, it should be noted that certain IFN-stimulated genes can be activated in the absence of IFN-I stimulus following flavivirus infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Temperature-dependent host-restriction in vertebrate cells has been shown to occur for another flavivirus, Rabensburg virus (RabV), which is a divergent strain of WNV [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. RabV failed to replicate in Vero, BHK, HEK293 and DF-1 cells at 37&#x000b0;C, as well as in house sparrows or chickens, but was capable of replicating in frog cells incubated at 28&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similar to our findings with BgV, the investigators subsequently showed that RabV could replicate in vertebrate cells incubated at lower temperatures [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In a more recent study, the investigators have identified several mutations in the non-structural proteins of replication-competent variants arising as the virus was passaged in vertebrate cells at increasing temperatures [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, specific viral or host factors involved in RabV temperature-dependent host-restriction have not been identified to date.</p><p>In this study, we have identified specific viral motifs associated with BgV host-restriction from BgV replication-competent variants, which arose quickly upon passaging on Vero cells (NS4A-S124F, NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C). The direct involvement of these mutations in BgV host-restriction <italic>in vitro</italic> and BgV attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic> was confirmed using reverse engineered CPER-generated BgV clones. We demonstrated that <italic>in vitro</italic>, the NS4B and NS5 mutations are sufficient to restore BgV replication in Vero and DF-1 cells at 37&#x000b0;C while the NS4A mutation facilitates quicker replication and to higher titres. While the functional significance of these mutations is not yet clear, their position in close proximity to, but outside of the viral protease cleavage sites (NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5) suggests a possible involvement in modulating the cleavage efficiency of BgV viral protease at these sites. Indeed, the prototype BgV sequence is sufficient to mediate efficient viral replication and presumably viral protease cleavage in all vertebrate cell lines at 34&#x000b0;C and a subset of cell lines at 37&#x000b0;C, which suggests that BgV viral protease cleavage must be significantly altered in cells such as Vero, DF-1 or MEF at 37&#x000b0;C. While including the two substitutions flanking the NS4B/5 cleavage site significantly enhanced BgV replication in all cell lines tested, those were only selected for in Vero cells, even in those passaged at 34&#x000b0;C, not in any BSR cells passage. Our data could suggest that these mutations are an essential adaptation to growth in Vero and other vertebrate cells, rather than adapting to replication at 37&#x000b0;C. In contrast, the NS4A substitution only occurred when BgV was passaged in Vero cells at 37&#x000b0;C and in conjunction with the NS4B/5 mutations. The three substitutions observed in BgV could occur in order to compensate for a restricted access to viral protease cleavage sites, due to some variation in the topology of the viral polyprotein in some cell membranes. The NS4A substitution may further optimise viral protein topology in the cell membranes, by regulating membrane remodelling as the temperature is increased to 37&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Our results were in line with previous findings that a small number of amino acid substitutions can lead to different levels of temperature-dependent attenuation. Indeed, it has been shown that a single amino acid change occurring in WNV NS4B (C102S) resulted in restricted replication in Vero cells at 41&#x000b0;C and a highly attenuated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, another report described a mutation in the C-terminus of WNV NS4B (E249G) which attenuated the virus as manifested by smaller plaques, lower growth kinetics and lower RNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as causing lower morbidity and mortality <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While WNV NS4B is a few amino acids longer than BgV NS4B (255 vs 247 amino acids, respectively), <italic>in silico</italic> analysis suggest that the two mutations (WNV E249G and BgV N244K) occur at the same position when compared in an alignment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This confirmed that single mutations in distinct residues of NS4B can be instrumental for viral replication, whether it is temperature-dependent or not. Moreover, it was shown that changes in a conserved PEPE motif just prior to the NS4A/2K cleavage site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008166.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) led to drastically impaired WNV replication and virion production [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The BgV NS4A C-terminal sequence does not include this conserved motif, which could play a role in its host-restriction and in the advent of the compensatory NS4A mutation observed.</p><p>Our results showed that the specific residues in BgV NS4A, NS4B and NS5 identified <italic>in vitro</italic> were directly involved in increased infectivity and pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was revealed by comparing data from prototype-injected mice with mutant-injected mice (BgV<sub>C-CG</sub>
<italic>vs</italic> BgV<sub>T-AT</sub>, and BgV<sub>C-CG</sub>/WNV-prME <italic>vs</italic> BgV<sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME). Our results also suggest that the BgV structural genes (prM and E) might be involved in BgV attenuation in vertebrates. Indeed, our results establish that while the BgV-prME proteins can facilitate infection in vertebrates, as shown by the data from WNV/BgV-prME inoculated mice, the insertion of these genes resulted in attenuated phenotypes compared to the corresponding viruses with WNV-prME. WNV/BgV-prME was significantly less virulent than WNV<sub>FLSDX</sub> when compared to studies performed under similar conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]&#x02013;CD1 mice having received a 10<sup>4</sup> IU IP dose of WNV<sub>FLSDX</sub> all succumb to the infection after 8 days&#x02013;and both versions of BgV seemed to replicate less efficiently than their BgV/WNV-prME counterpart in mice. Taken together, these comparisons suggest that BgV attenuation may be influenced by inefficient binding and/or entering to vertebrate cells, as well as reduced replication efficiency due to the key residues identified in the non-structural viral proteins.</p><p>The persistence of BgV<sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME in the brains of IC-inoculated mice for 22 days, in the face of development of neutralizing antibodies is intriguing. Moreover, the viral antigen distribution observed by immunohistochemistry in these mice is similar to that seen in bovine foetuses and calves persistently infected with the non-arthropod-borne pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This perhaps points to a potentially very different pathogenesis in the, as yet unknown, natural vertebrate host(s) of BgV.</p><p>While components of the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were elucidated in this study, it is pertinent to consider how these may be relevant to the ecology of this virus. It is possible that BgV might be amplified and horizontally transmitted by a cryptic vertebrate host in the wild, potentially a species with a lower core body temperature, based on our results showing higher levels of replication at lower temperatures in all tested vertebrate cell lines. Therefore, the lack of viral replication we observe in avian models (DF-1 cells, embryonated eggs and live sparrows), could be due to the higher core body temperature of these animals. However, no evidence was found that BgV was able to replicate efficiently in reptiles or amphibians despite their lower core body temperature. Our previous publications suggest that BgV may preferentially replicate in marsupial hosts, on which <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>annulirostris</italic> mosquitoes prefer to feed, even though we have shown here that black-tailed wallaby cells do not seem to be particularly permissive to BgV [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Interestingly, a species of possum (Common spotted cuscus&#x02014;<italic>Spilocuscus maculatus</italic>) present in Cape York, where BgV was isolated, maintains the lower core body temperature of 34.6&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition to this, potential hosts for BgV could also include animals such as monotremes, the egg-laying mammals found in Australia: platypus (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) or echidna (<italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>), which have a significantly lower core body temperature compared to other mammals [<xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
