 <p>The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and their human leucocyte antigen (HLA) ligand combinations in different original ethnic populations in China, and thus, to provide relevant genomic diversity data for the future study of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and reproductive fitness. A total of 1119 unrelated individuals from 11 ethnic populations—including Hani, Jinuo, Lisu, Nu, Bulang, Wa, Dai, Maonan, Zhuang, Tu, and Yugu—from four original groups, were included. The presence/absence of the 16 KIR loci were detected, and the KIR gene’s phenotype, genotype, and haplotype A and B frequencies, as well as KIR ligand’s HLA allotype and KIR–HLA pairs for each population, were calculated. Principal component analysis and phylogenetic trees were constructed to compare the characteristics of the KIR and KIR–HLA pair distributions of these 11 populations. In total, 92 KIR genotypes were identified, including six new genotypes. The KIR and its HLA ligands had a distributed diversity in 11 ethnic populations in China, and each group had its specific KIR and KIR–HLA pair profile. The difference among the KIR–HLA pairs between northern and southern groups, but not among the four original groups, may reflect strong pressure from previous or ongoing infectious diseases, which have a significant impact on KIR and its HLA combination repertoires.</p>
