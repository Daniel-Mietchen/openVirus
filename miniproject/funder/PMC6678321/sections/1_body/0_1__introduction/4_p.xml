<p>In the present study, 11 ethnic populations—Hani, Jinuo, Lisu, and Nu, speaking Tibeto-Burman; Bulang and Wa, speaking Mon-Khmer; Dai, Maonan, and Zhuang, speaking Daic; and Tu and Yugu, speaking Mongolian—were selected for HLA and KIR genotyping. The KIR gene’s distribution in Bulang, Nu, Yugu, and Zhuang has been reported previously [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence/absence of the 16 KIR loci were detected and the KIR gene’s phenotype, genotype, and A and B haplotype frequencies, as well as the KIR ligand’s HLA allotype and KIR–HLA pairs, are reported. Principal component analysis (PCA) and phylogenetic trees were constructed to compare the characteristics of the KIR and KIR–HLA pair distributions in the 11 populations.
