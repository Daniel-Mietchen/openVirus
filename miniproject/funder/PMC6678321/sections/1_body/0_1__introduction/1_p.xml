<p>Segregated in different chromosomes, 6p21 and 19q13.4, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, respectively, exhibit diverse polymorphisms and their molecular expressions interact with each other as receptor ligands to ensure the proper role of nature killer (NK) cells in modulating an immune response [

 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several studies on the coinheritance of these two genetic systems have indicated that carrying the appropriate KIR–HLA combination is important for human survival [

During human migration outward from Africa and the successive colonization worldwide, the cooperative KIR haplotypes and activating KIR–HLA pairs are important for humans to adapt to quickly changing environments and to increase population reproduction [
