 <italic>KIR2DL2/2DL3</italic> and its ligand 
 <italic>HLA-C1</italic> specifically control NK cell response. Its combination commonly exists in all the populations, but the frequencies were higher in the southern group (0.978 ± 0.006, 95% CI: 0.966–0.988) than in the northern group (0.860 ± 0.020, 95% CI: 0.833–0.886) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00005). 
 <italic>KIR2DL1</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR2DS2</italic> had a similar binding specificity for 
 <italic>HLA-C2</italic>. The frequencies of 
 <italic>2DL1+HLA-C2</italic> were lower in the southern group (0.211 ± 0.026, 95% CI: 0.162–0.264) than in the northern group (0.472 ± 0.021, 95% CI: 0.443–0.500) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). However, there was no difference in frequencies of 
 <italic>2DS1+HLA-C2</italic> combinations between the southern and northern groups (
