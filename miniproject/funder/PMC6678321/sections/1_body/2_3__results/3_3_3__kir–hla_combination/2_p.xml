<p>The individuals carrying either 
 <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> or 
 <italic>KIR3DS1</italic> and its 
 <italic>HLA-Bw4</italic> ligands, or carrying both 
 <italic>KIR3DL1</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DS1</italic> together with its HLA-Bw4 ligands, were counted for the KIR–HLA combination (
 <xref rid="cells-08-00711-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). 
 <italic>KIR3DL1/3DS1+Bw4</italic> was commonly exhibited in all populations, with frequencies of 0.383–0.700, except in Bulang. The total frequency of the 
 <italic>KIR3DL1/3DS1+Bw4</italic> combination was 0.283, and the frequency of either 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic> or 
 <italic>KIR3DS1+Bw4</italic> pairs was 0.057. The frequencies of 
 <italic>3DL1+3DS1+Bw4</italic> were predominant in Bulang, and 
 <italic>3DL1+3DS1+Bw4</italic> and 
 <italic>3DL1+Bw4</italic> were almost similar in Jinuo; however, 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic> was predominant in other 9 populations. In Hani and Wa, all individuals carried either 
 <italic>3DL1+Bw4</italic> or 
 <italic>3DL1+3DS1+Bw4</italic> together, and no one carrying only 
 <italic>3DS1+Bw4</italic> was observed.
