<p>The frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR3DL2</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-A11/A3</italic> were calculated first. Since the interaction of 
 <italic>KIR2DS4</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR2DS2</italic> with 
 <italic>HLA-A11</italic> has been demonstrated, their combinations have also been calculated [

 <xref rid="B29-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR3DL2+A11/A3</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR2DS4+A11/A3</italic> were from 0.417 to 0.879, while the frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR2DS2+A11</italic> were lower, with frequencies from 0.038 to 0.299 (
 <xref rid="cells-08-00711-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In Nu, the frequency of 
 <italic>KIR2DS2+A11</italic> was only 0.038, though 
 <italic>HLA-A*11:01</italic> was predominant, with a frequency of 0.411(
