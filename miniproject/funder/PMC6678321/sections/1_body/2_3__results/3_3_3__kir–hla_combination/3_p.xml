<p>Further analysis of KIR with the presence of isoleucine at position 80(
 <italic>Bw4-80I</italic>) as well as with the presence of threonine at position 80(
 <italic>Bw4-80T</italic>) was performed. One individual in Dai and Jinuo with 
 <italic>HLA-Bw4</italic> were unable to have their KIR ligands identified, two individuals in Lisu were not able to have their KIR ligands identified, while all the other individuals with 
 <italic>KIR-Bw4</italic> ligands were identified. For the 
 <italic>3DL1/3DS1+Bw4</italic> pair, the frequencies of 
 <italic>80I3DL1+Bw4 80I</italic> were higher than 
 <italic>3DS1+Bw4 80I</italic>. Moreover, in Hani, Nu, Wa, and Maonan, no individuals who only carried 
 <italic>3DS1+Bw4 80I</italic> were observed. There were more individuals only carrying 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80I</italic> than those only carrying 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80T</italic> in Hani, Lisu, Bulang, and Yugu, while there were fewer in Jinuo, Dai, and Maonan, and there was no difference in Nu, Wa, Zhuang, and Tu. There was a similar finding for the 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80T</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DS1+Bw4-80T</italic> pairs. Further analysis of the southern and northern groups indicated that the frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic> were lower in the southern group than in the northern group (0.451 ± 0.120 vs. 0.659 ± 0.018, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001).
