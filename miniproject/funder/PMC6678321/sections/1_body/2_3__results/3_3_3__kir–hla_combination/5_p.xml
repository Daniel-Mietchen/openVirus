<p>The comparison between the two populations indicated that Yugu and Tu did not show any difference in any of the KIRâ€“HLA pairs, while the other populations all showed differences of between 1 and 15 pairs (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-00711">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The 
 <italic>2DL2/3+HLA-C1, 2DL1+HLA-C2</italic>, and 
 <italic>2DS1+HLA-C2</italic> pairs showed clear differences between the northern and southern groups. For other 
 <italic>HLA-Bw</italic> or 
 <italic>HLA-A11/A3</italic> pairs, the difference between the two populations was extensive. For example, Wa showed differences with: every other population except Lisu and Nu for carrying both 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DS1+Bw4</italic> pairs; every other population except Jinuo, Nu, and Maonan for carrying both 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80I</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DS1+Bw4-80I</italic> pairs; and Hani, Lisu, Nu, Bulang, Dai, and Yugu for carrying 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80T</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DS1+Bw4-80T</italic>. For carrying 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic>, Bulang showed differences with every population except Jinuo, and Jinuo, Wa, Zhuang, Tu, and Yugu showed differences with at least five populations. The differences at 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80I</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4-80T</italic> between the populations were not same as for 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+Bw4</italic>. The differences in carrying 
 <italic>KIR3DL2+A11/A3</italic> or 
 <italic>KIR2DS4+A11/A3</italic> among the populations were similar, and Hani, Bulang, Wa, Tu, and Yugu showed differences with at least five populations.
