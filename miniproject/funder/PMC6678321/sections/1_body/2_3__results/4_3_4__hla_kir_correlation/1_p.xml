<p>The correlations of each KIRâ€“HLA receptor and ligand pair were analyzed. The observed frequencies for 
 <italic>KIR2DL3</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-C1</italic> ligands showed a significant correlation (r = 0.637, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.035). Positive correlations were also observed in 
 <italic>KIR3DL1+HLA-Bw4, KIR3DL1+HLA-Bw4 80I, KIR3DL1+HLA-Bw4 80T, KIR2DL2+HLA-C1, KIR2DS1+HLA-C2</italic>, and 
 <italic>KIR2DS2+HLA-C1</italic> pairs, but they were not significant. Negative correlations between 
 <italic>KIR3DS1</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-Bw4</italic>, and 
 <italic>KIR2DL1</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-C2</italic> were observed, but they were not significant neither (
