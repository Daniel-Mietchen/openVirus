<p>On the phylogenetic tree based on KIRs, for the trees constructed either by all 11 KIR genes (

For the NJ tree constructed using HLA genes, Tu and Yugu clustered together as one major branch. Bulang and Wa of Khmer clustered together, and Maonao, Zhuang, and Dai of Daic clustered together with Jinuo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00711-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). When 58 populations were compared on the phylogenetic tree using 11 KIRs frequencies, most populations clustered together according to their geographic location of Asian, European, African, and American (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00711-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the closeness were not displayed clearly as in the NJ tree constructed by the HLA genes, in which the populations clustered according to their evolutional relationship [
 <xref rid="B25-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the Asian branch, on one hand, most Han populations in northern China clustered with Japanese and Korean, but also together with Nu, Yi, and Hani ethnic populations living in southern China. On the other hand, Yugu and Tu living in Northern China clustered with Southern Hans living in Guangdong, Hong Kong, together with Maonan, Bulang, Jinuo, etc., ethnic populations in southern China. The 11 ethnic populations in the present study still did not show a clear origin or linguistic clustering trend.
