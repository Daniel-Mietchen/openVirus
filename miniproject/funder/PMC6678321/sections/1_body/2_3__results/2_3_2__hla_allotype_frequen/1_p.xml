<p>The frequencies of 
 <italic>HLA-A11/A3, HLA-Bw4</italic> (
 <italic>Bw4-80I</italic> and 
 <italic>Bw4-80T</italic>), and 
 <italic>HLA-C1</italic> and 
 <italic>HLA-C2</italic> were calculated from the 
 <italic>HLA-A</italic>, 
 <italic>HLA-B</italic>, and 
 <italic>HLA-C</italic> allele genotyping results (
 <xref rid="cells-08-00711-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 
 <italic>HLA-A11/A3</italic> were predominant in all the populations living in southern China, with frequencies higher than 0.556, and they accounted for around 80% of HLA-A alleles in Bulang, Wa, and Hani. On the contrary, 
 <italic>HLA-A11/A3</italic> were around 40% in Tu and Yugu living in northern China. 
 <italic>HLA-Bw4</italic> existed commonly in Tu and Yugu, with frequencies of 0.700 and 0.688, but only with frequencies of 0.283 in Bulang. 
 <italic>HLA-C1</italic> was observed in all individuals in Jinuo, Lisu, Maonan, and Zhuang, with frequencies around &gt;95% in other southern Chinese populations, but with frequencies of 0.914 and 0.833 in Tu and Yugu, respectively, from northern China. On the contrary, the frequencies of 
 <italic>HLA-C2</italic> were around 50% in Tu and Yugu but was only 0.073 in Maonan. This HLA characteristic reflected the northern and southern Chinese original difference, which has been confirmed in previous studies. Therefore, we divided the present study populations into two groups: the southern group, which included Hani, Jinuo, Lisu, Nu, Bulang, Wa, Dai, Maonan, and Zhuang, and the northern group, which included Tu and Yugu. Differences between the northern and southern groups were observed (data not shown).
