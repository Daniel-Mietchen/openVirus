<p>The frequencies of the group A and B haplotypes in the 11 populations were deduced from the genotype data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-08-00711-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As with most populations worldwide, the A haplotype was predominant. The frequencies of the A haplotype were around 0.657–0.830 in Nu, Hani, Wa, Lisu, Zhuang, Maonan, and Yugu, while they were around 0.576–0.593 in Tu, Jinuo, and Dai. In Bulang, the frequencies of the A and B haplotypes were almost equal (0.491 vs. 0.509). Haplotype differences were identified among Nu and 10 other populations except Jinuo; among Bulang and Hai, Lisu, Nu, Wa, Maonan, Zhuang, and Yugu; and between Hani and Jinuo, and Dai and Tu (
