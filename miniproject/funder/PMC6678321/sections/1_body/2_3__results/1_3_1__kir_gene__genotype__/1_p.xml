<p>The observed KIR frequencies and the estimated gene frequencies for each locus in the 11 populations are listed in 
 <xref rid="cells-08-00711-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The four framework loci (
 <italic>KIR3DL3</italic>, 
 <italic>3DP1</italic>, 
 <italic>2DL4</italic>, and 
 <italic>3DL2</italic>) were exhibited in all individuals in 10 populations, except one individual in Yugu, for whom 
 <italic>2DL4</italic> and 
 <italic>3DP1</italic> were not observed. The non-framework pseudogene 
 <italic>2DP1</italic> was observed in all individuals in Hani, Nu, Dai, Zhuang, and Tu, but not in all other populations, with frequencies of 94.8%–99.1%. The frequencies of 
 <italic>3DL1</italic>, 
 <italic>2DL1</italic>, and 
 <italic>2DS4</italic> were about 90%–100% in 11 populations, with the exception in Jinuo and Bulang, which showed frequencies of 88% and 81% at 
 <italic>3DL1</italic> and 88% and 79% at 
 <italic>2DS4</italic>, respectively. Other activating KIRs, including 
 <italic>3DS1</italic>, 
 <italic>2DS1</italic>, 
 <italic>2DS3</italic>, and 
 <italic>2DS5</italic>, as well as inhibitory KIRs, including 
 <italic>2DL2</italic> and 
 <italic>2DL5</italic>, exhibited diverse distributions in different populations. Bulang was different compared with the other 10 populations at 
 <italic>3DS1</italic> and 
 <italic>2DS1</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 9 other populations except Zhuang at 
 <italic>2DS3</italic>, and 9 other populations except Jinuo at 
 <italic>2DS4</italic>. The following difference was among Nu and others. For all populations, the most diverse was at 
 <italic>2DS3</italic> (
