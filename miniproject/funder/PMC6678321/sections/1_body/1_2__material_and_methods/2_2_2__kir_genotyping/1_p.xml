<p>The 16 KIR genes were genotyped using the Luminex MultiAnalyte Profiling System (xMAP) with a One Lambda KIR typing kit (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA), as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, three separate PCR products were amplified: exon 3, exon 5, and exons 7–9. The PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel to confirm the specificity and efficiency of the reactions. Then, the PCR amplicons were denatured and hybridized with complementary 81-nucleotide oligonucleotide probes that had been immobilized on fluorescent-coated microsphere beads. At the same time, the biotinylated PCR products were labeled with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin and immediately examined with the Luminex 200 system (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). Genotype determination and data analysis were performed automatically using the LABScan 100 platform (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
