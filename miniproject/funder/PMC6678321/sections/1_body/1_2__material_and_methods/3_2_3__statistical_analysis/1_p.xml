<p>Hardy–Weinberg’s equilibrium for each of the alleles was assessed using the Guo and Thompson method [
 <xref rid="B19-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For KIR genes, the observed frequency for each KIR gene was determined via direct counting and corresponded to the ratio of the number within the population that carried the gene to the total population number. KIR locus gene frequencies (KLFs) were estimated by using the formula KLF = 1 −

The genotypes that could not be found in the database were named as unknown. Group A and B haplotypes and frequencies were predicted on the basis of a previous study [
