<p>The extensive diversity of HLA and KIR genes and their interactive roles in the immune response make these genes coevolve in genotypic combination. Disease and population studies have confirmed that they evolved together as specific KIR–HLA pairs to regulate NK cell function and play a vital role in the innate defense against pathogens and early placentation [

In the present study, we analyzed KIR and its HLA pairs in 11 ethnic populations from northern and southern China covering four different linguistic language families that represent the major origins of Chinese ethnic populations. This study not only provides useful genomic diversity data for the future study of viral infections, autoimmune diseases, and reproductive fitness among these populations, but also reveals clues about HLA and KIR interaction and coevolution under the diverse change of pathogen infections.
