<p>The genetic difference between southern and northern Chinese has been confirmed in studies of HLA [

 <xref rid="B43-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], as well as immunoglobulins [
 <xref rid="B44-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], microsatellites [
 <xref rid="B45-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and Y-chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms [
 <xref rid="B46-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Furthermore, population migration from northern to southern China has frequently happened throughout Chinese history [

 <xref rid="B16-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, 
 <italic>KIR2DL2/3+HLA-C1</italic>, 
 <italic>KIR2DL1+HLA-C2</italic>, and 
 <italic>KIR2DS1+HLA-C2</italic> pairs showed clear differences between the northern and southern groups. The frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR2DL2/3+HLA-C1</italic> pairs were significantly higher in the southern group than in the northern group (0.978 vs. 0.860, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.00005). This difference has also been investigated in Han population. The frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR2DL2/3+HLA-C1</italic> pairs were higher in two southern Chinese Han, namely Guangdong Han and Yunnan Han, than in the northern ethnic group, with frequencies of 0.981 and 0.950, respectively. In contrast, the frequencies of 
 <italic>KIR2DL1+HLA-C2</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR2DS1+HLA-C2</italic> pairs were lower than in the northern group, with frequencies of 0.294 and 0.351 for 
 <italic>KIR2DL1+HLA-C2</italic>, and 0.100 and 0.155 for 
 <italic>KIR2DS1+HLA-C2</italic> in Guangdong Han and Yunnan Han, respectively [

 <xref rid="B38-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, the Tu and Yugu formed a cluster and showed a distance from other ethnic populations in southern China in the PCA plot constructed using KIR–HLA pair frequencies. According to historical records, northern and southern China underwent different pathogenic pressures. Regarding malaria (a serious infectious disease prevalent in China since 2700 BC), its epidemic area was focused in southern China, whereas northern China was malaria free or had a very low incidence rate [
 <xref rid="B47-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Historically, Yunnan Province has been the most high-risk malaria area, especially along the China–Myanmar border [
 <xref rid="B49-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the present study, Tu and Yugu are from northern China, while the other populations are all in southern China, the most high-risk malaria areas. Therefore, we deduced that the different distribution between the northern and southern groups in China may have been caused by severe infectious disease epidemics, such as malaria.
