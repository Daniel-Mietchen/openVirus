<p>Except for 
 <italic>KIR+HLA-C</italic> pairs, 
 <italic>KIR+HLA-Bw</italic> and 
 <italic>KIR+HLA-A3/A11</italic> pair differences were diverse in different populations. When considering KIR genes, genotypes, and haplotypes, more diversity was exhibited. It is interesting to note that the HLA gene distributions were in accordance with the population linguistic group and their origins. Both in the PCA plot and neighbor-joining tree constructed using HLA allele frequencies, the same linguistic origin populations clustered together. However, there were no clear cluster trends to distinguish the populations according to their origin or linguistic classification using either KIR, activated KIR, or KIR genotype frequencies among 11 ethnic populations. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree constructed using 11 KIRs frequencies of 58 populations worldwide, there was a geographic closeness among Asians, Africans, Europeans, and Americans, while the 11 ethnic populations in the present study still did not show a clear origin or linguistic clustering trend. Compared with HLA genes, KIR genes have experienced a rapid evolution through a combination of gene duplication and nonhomologous recombination [
 <xref rid="B1-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The extensive diversity of KIR genes in different populations worldwide indicates that distinct diseases have recently acted or are still acting to select on KIR repertoires [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This evolution was thought to be driven by the selective pressure of pathogen invasion, as well as reproduction. Moreover, haplotypes A and B are thought to have maintained a balance selection in human beings. The A haplotypes are associated with an improved response to pathogens, while B haplotypes are associated with reproductive fitness [

 <xref rid="B52-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated that the populations are related to their geographic distribution based on KIR haplotype B but do not show a correlation based on haplotype A [
 <xref rid="B53-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that B haplotypes are more prevalent in Australian Aborigines and Asian Indians, where the possible reason is due to these populations maybe being under strong pressure from infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the present study, the frequencies of haplotypes A and B were almost similar to each other in Bulang, which showed a difference from other Asian populations. On the contrary, in Nu, haplotype A was as high as 0.830, which showed a significant difference from the other 10 populations. This extensive range of haplotype A in the present study, from 0.491 in Bulang to 0.830 in Nu, together with the diverse frequencies worldwide, may be the result of a founder effect, genetic drift, or natural selection [
 <xref rid="B5-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-cells-08-00711" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the distribution of KIR profiles among the present study populations could not be interpreted as a phylogenetic tree.
