  <p>Neighbor-joining tree. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Neighbor-joining tree based on DA genetic distance from 11 KIR gene frequencies. The optimal tree was one with the sum of branch length = 1.166. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Neighbor-joining tree based on DA genetic distance from 
   <italic>HLA-A</italic>, 
   <italic>-B</italic>, and 
   <italic>-C</italic> allele frequencies. The optimal tree was one with the sum of branch length = 0.875.
