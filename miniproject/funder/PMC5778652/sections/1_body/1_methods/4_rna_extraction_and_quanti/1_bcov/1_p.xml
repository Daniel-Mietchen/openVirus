<p id="Par29">RNA was extracted from 140 μl of the Amies medium by the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini QIAcube kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, eluted in 50 μl buffer and stored at −80 °C. RT-qPCR was performed, in duplicates for nasal swabs, using RNA UltraSense™ One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, MA, USA) and the target was an 85 bp fragment of the M protein gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two μl of RNA was used in a total volume of 20 ul containing 200 nM each of forward and reverse primer and 250 nM TaqMan probe. The thermal profile included an RT step at 55 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 2 min and thereafter 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. RT-qPCR was run in a Stratagene Mx3005p™ (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and each run included a positive (RNA from the nostril of a BCoV positive trial calf) and negative control (water).
