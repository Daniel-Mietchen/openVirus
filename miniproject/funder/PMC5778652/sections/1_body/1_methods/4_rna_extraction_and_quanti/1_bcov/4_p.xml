<p id="Par33">The standard curve covered the range from 10.8 to 1.08 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> copies. The curve showed a strong linear relationship with a high coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.996) and a high amplification efficiency (E = 0.965). The limit of quantification represented log
