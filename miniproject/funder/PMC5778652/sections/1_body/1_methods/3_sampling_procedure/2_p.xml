<p id="Par28">Specimens from human nasal mucosa were collected by rotating a swab inside one nostril for a couple of seconds. When a person was sampled more than once, the left and right nostrils were sampled alternately. Sampling of fomites was performed by moistening the tip of the swab with Amies medium before lightly rubbing a defined area (5 cm × 10 cm of coats and boots) without visible contamination. For wristwatches and stethoscopes, the area was approximately 3 cm × 3 cm and 2 cm × 5 cm, respectively. At later time points, new areas were sampled. After sample collection, swabs were stored at 4 °C for no more than two hours and thereafter at −70 °C until use.</p>
