<p id="Par27">A detailed protocol was developed for collection of material from fomites and human nostrils. The same person collected all the material from fomites in each experiment, and instructed the personnel that took part in the human mucosa trial. Specimens were collected with ESwab™ (Copan, Brescia, Italy) and stored in 1 ml of Liquid Amies medium. Gloves were used throughout the experiments.</p>
