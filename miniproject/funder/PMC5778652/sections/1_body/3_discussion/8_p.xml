<p id="Par49">For both viruses, the viral RNA level recovered from boots was lower than from coats, possibly due to the rinsing with water. However, as high genome copy numbers remained, rinsing might not be sufficient to prevent virus transmission. This is supported by epidemiologic data that show an increased risk of seropositivity for BRSV and BCoV in herds that do not provide boots to visitors [

These items are often brought between farms without cleaning/disinfection, and can carry infective virus particles for at least 24Â h after exposure to infected cattle.
