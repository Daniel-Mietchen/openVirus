<p id="Par48">Despite the general view that enveloped viruses are fragile outside the host, several coronaviruses remain infective after drying on surfaces for more than 24 h as reviewed by Otter et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The present study indicates that BCoV has a similar property. Infective BRSV, on the other hand, was not detected in any of the samples, which was similar to HRSV after drying on surfaces for seven hours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies of HRSV survival in cell culture medium and aerosols also showed a higher inactivation rate compared to coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This suggests that BRSV is more susceptible than BCoV to degradation by environmental factors, and that the importance of indirect BRSV transmission after 24 h, is probably low. As demonstrated by Mullis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], viral infectivity is more rapidly lost than viral RNA.
