<p id="Par45">Sellers et al. have shown that human nasal mucosa is a possible vehicle for foot-and-mouth-disease virus even when a high level of biosecurity is implemented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This was refuted by Amass et al. who found a low risk of virus transmission by personnel after hand wash and change of outerwear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Wright et al. found a low risk of prolonged human nasal carriage of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, we aimed to study whether human nasal mucosa is a possible vehicle for transmission of BCoV and BRSV. Based on our results, this is a possibility, but the low level of viral RNA and the failure to detect infective virus after a few hours, indicate a low risk of virus transmission from human nasal mucosa.
