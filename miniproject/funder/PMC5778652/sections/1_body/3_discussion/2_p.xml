<p id="Par43">As high copy numbers of viral RNA on fomites indicated a transmission potential, further investigations were performed in order to assess whether the detected RNA could represent infective viruses. Although infectivity ideally should be studied in live animals, cell culture was used due to practical, ethical and economic reasons. Virus isolation in cell culture may have a low sensitivity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Using this method, we showed that visually clean surfaces of fomites can carry infective BCoV for at least 24Â h after exposure to infected animals.
