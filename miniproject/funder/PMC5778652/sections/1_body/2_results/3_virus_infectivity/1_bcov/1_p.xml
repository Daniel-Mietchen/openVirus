<p id="Par40">RT-qPCR results from cells inoculated with swab material from a wristwatch or a stethoscope indicated a 1000-fold increase in the number of RNA-copies after three days of incubation. Cells inoculated with swab material from human nostrils and from a rubber coat showed no increase in viral RNA during incubation. Positive virus controls were positive, and the Amies medium showed no inhibition of virus replication. No BCoV RNA was detected in negative control wells.</p>
