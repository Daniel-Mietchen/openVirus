<p id="Par38">The positive controls were consistently positive throughout the analyses, and all negative controls were negative. No viral RNA was detected in human nasal mucosa that was sampled prior to exposure to animals, however, positives were found among samples collected after exposure (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The number of BCoV GC per swab is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Estimated half-life of BCoV RNA carriage was less than 90 min and the estimated longest persistence was five hours (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The positive BRSV swabs contained between log
 <sub>10</sub> 1.3 to 3.3 genome copies.
