  <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
  <p id="Par53">The animal experiments were conducted in agreement with national and international guidelines for the care and use of animals. Approval for the BCoV experiment was given by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments, Uppsala, Sweden (protocol no. C45/14) and by the Norwegian Animal Research Authority (approval no. 7468) for the BRSV experiment. Verbal consent was obtained from the personnel participating in the study. Written consent was deemed not necessary, as the aim of the study was purely animal health related, and the Southeastern Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway exempted the study from application (reference no. 2016/2012 A).</p>
