The aims of the study were to determine the duration of viral RNA carriage and the infectivity of viral particles on fomites and human nasal mucosa after exposure to BCoV and BRSV. During two animal infection experiments, swabs were collected from personnel (nasal mucosa) and their clothes, boots and equipment after contact with calves shedding either virus. Viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR or droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR), and selected samples with high levels of viral RNA were tested by cell culture for infectivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">For BCoV, 46% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80) of the swabs from human nasal mucosa collected 30&#x000a0;min after exposure were positive by RT-qPCR. After two, four and six hours, 15%, 5% and 0% of the swabs were positive, respectively. Infective virions were not detected in mucosal swabs (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). A high viral RNA load was detected on 97% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) of the fomites 24&#x000a0;h after exposure, and infective virions were detected in two of three swabs. For BRSV, 35% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) of the human nasal mucosa swabs collected 30&#x000a0;min after exposure, were positive by RT-ddPCR, but none were positive for infective virions. Of the fomites, 89% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38) were positive for BRSV RNA 24&#x000a0;h after exposure, but all were negative for infective viruses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The results indicate that human nasal mucosa can carry both BCoV and BRSV RNA after exposure to virus shedding calves, but the carriage seems short-lived and the transmission potential is likely limited.

The viruses are part of the bovine respiratory disease complex and are endemic worldwide. BRSV and BCoV can cause epidemics of respiratory disease and additionally BCoV cause diarrhea in calves and adult cattle (winter dysentery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The traditional way of handling and preventing these diseases is through metaphylactic antibiotic treatment, use of vaccines, or changes in management to improve calf health in herds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The within-herd prevalence and morbidity of BCoV and BRSV infections are high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and once the virus enters a herd, circulation is difficult to mitigate. An additional preventive strategy is therefore to reduce inter-herd transmission of virus. Movement of live animals between herds is an important transmission route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. If this risk is under control, the next question concerns the contribution of indirect spread of virus between herds. Indirect spread can occur via e.g. personnel travelling between herds, their clothes or equipment.</p><p id="Par18">Important risk factors for indirect spread are the level of virus contamination of relevant surfaces and the infectivity of the viruses. Enveloped respiratory viruses like BCoV and BRSV are generally fragile outside the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, as related viruses like human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human coronavirus 229E remain infective for several hours on contaminated surfaces like countertops and surgical gloves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], there is a potential for indirect transmission. Epidemiological studies also point out the importance of indirect transmission; Ohlson et al. found that lack of boot provision for visitors was a risk factor for infections with both viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Toftaker et al. found that a herd&#x02019;s BCoV and BRSV antibody status was influenced by the status of its neighboring herds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Human nasal mucosa might also be a vector for inter-herd virus transmission, as traffic of personnel between herds is common. Carriage of BCoV and BRSV in human nostrils has not been studied. Generally, there are few studies on indirect transmission of these viruses, and no experimental studies have been performed. Molecular methods and virus isolation in cell culture can be used to study the level of virus carriage and infectivity, which are determinants for virus transmission. Combined, these methods provide sensitive quantification of viral genomes and assessment of virus infectivity.</p><p id="Par20">Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether personnel (nostrils) and fomites carry viral RNA and infective viruses after exposure to BCoV or BRSV infected animals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and animal experiments</title><p id="Par21">The present study was performed during two animal experiments, one with BCoV and one with BRSV, and during a field outbreak of winter dysentery. Swabs were rubbed in the nostrils of personnel and on their coats, boots, wristwatches and stethoscopes at different time points after animal contact, and examined for viral RNA and infective viruses.</p><p id="Par22">The BCoV experiment was conducted in 2014 at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) as described by Oma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A total of ten bull calves between six and twelve weeks of age were included, six were Swedish red and white, three were Swedish Holstein and one Swedish mountain breed. Briefly, four calves at SLU were exposed to a group of six calves brought in from SLU&#x02019;s research farm that experienced an outbreak of winter dysentery. The field outbreak was confirmed by RT-qPCR and serology to have been caused by BCoV. After comingling for 24&#x000a0;h, the calves were housed in the isolation unit within their original groups of four and six animals. As six of the&#x000a0;calves were naturally exposed to BCoV in the field, the dates of infection were unknown. The presented contamination study was conducted within a three week period while the calves showed signs of disease and shed virus as detected by RT-qPCR. The number of BCoV RNA copies in nasal swabs from the ten calves varied between log<sub>10</sub> 2.9 and 10.4 (mean of log<sub>10</sub> 6.9) during the study period.</p><p id="Par23">The BRSV experiment took place at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in 2015 (to be published). A total of eight Norwegian Red calves between two and four months of age were included, six bulls and two heifers. Briefly, six of the calves were infected after contact with two calves inoculated with a field isolate of BRSV, O4-4B/N-11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The calves were housed in isolation units in groups of four including one inoculated calf. The contamination study was conducted on three different days within one week while the calves showed signs of respiratory disease and shed virus. The number of BRSV RNA copies in nasal swabs from the calves varied between log<sub>10</sub> 2.7 and 8.1 (mean of log<sub>10</sub> 5.6) during the study period.</p><p id="Par24">Both experiments were conducted in line with the ARRIVE guidelines for planning and reporting in vivo experiments and the concept of the 3R&#x02019;s (Reduction, Replacement and Refinement) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

Positive control wells were positive, and negative control wells were negative.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par42">This is the first time BCoV and BRSV contamination of personnel and fomites has been described. The PCR results indicate that fomites (like clothes, boots, wristwatches and stethoscopes) exposed to virus pose an infection risk to cattle. For BCoV in particular, fomites seem to represent a high risk, as virus isolation detected infective viruses after 24&#x000a0;h. Consequently, measures to prevent inter-herd transmission should include actions against indirect spread of virus.</p><p id="Par43">As high copy numbers of viral RNA on fomites indicated a transmission potential, further investigations were performed in order to assess whether the detected RNA could represent infective viruses. Although infectivity ideally should be studied in live animals, cell culture was used due to practical, ethical and economic reasons. Virus isolation in cell culture may have a low sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], but the use of integrated cell culture RT-qPCR increases the possibility of detecting infective viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Using this method, we showed that visually clean surfaces of fomites can carry infective BCoV for at least 24&#x000a0;h after exposure to infected animals.</p><p id="Par44">As reviewed by La Rosa et al., related coronaviruses and HRSV can be transmitted by fomites in addition to direct transmission through droplets and aerosols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is therefore plausible that BCoV and BRSV could be transmitted between farms via personnel and fomites. Even if protective clothing is used and changed between herds, personnel might constitute a risk of virus transmission as human nasal mucosa could be a potential hideaway for infective viruses. In addition, BCoV has been isolated from a diarrheic child and is most likely the ancestor of a related human pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], thus the ability to replicate in cells in the human nasal mucosa cannot be excluded. Human nasal mucosa was therefore studied in place of skin, oral mucosa or hair that could also act as passive vectors for the viruses.</p><p id="Par45">Sellers et al. have shown that human nasal mucosa is a possible vehicle for foot-and-mouth-disease virus even when a high level of biosecurity is implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This was refuted by Amass et al. who found a low risk of virus transmission by personnel after hand wash and change of outerwear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Wright et al. found a low risk of prolonged human nasal carriage of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, we aimed to study whether human nasal mucosa is a possible vehicle for transmission of BCoV and BRSV. Based on our results, this is a possibility, but the low level of viral RNA and the failure to detect infective virus after a few hours, indicate a low risk of virus transmission from human nasal mucosa.</p><p id="Par46">In the present study, personnel was sampled during an experimental setting and during an outbreak of winter dysentery in the field. The results showed that nasal carriage of BCoV in humans was less common in the outbreak situation than during the animal experiment. Factors that could have influenced the amount of virus in the two settings were differences in virus exposure, degree of contact between animals and personnel and environmental conditions. Other factors could be repeated swabbing of the same nostril, nose touching and nose blowing.</p><p id="Par47">The finding that neither BCoV nor BRSV could be cultivated from human nasal swabs resembles the rapid inactivation on skin for respiratory syncytial virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and human coronavirus 229E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This could be due to substances or microorganisms in the mucosa that neutralize or inactivate the virus. Although there is a chance of underestimating the risk, due to e.g. freezing and thawing, dilution and filtering of the samples, the virus transmission potential of mucosa is probably low. There were no sign of BCoV replicating in human nasal mucosa, as the amount of BCoV RNA found were low and declining over time.</p><p id="Par48">Despite the general view that enveloped viruses are fragile outside the host, several coronaviruses remain infective after drying on surfaces for more than 24&#x000a0;h as reviewed by Otter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The present study indicates that BCoV has a similar property. Infective BRSV, on the other hand, was not detected in any of the samples, which was similar to HRSV after drying on surfaces for seven hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Studies of HRSV survival in cell culture medium and aerosols also showed a higher inactivation rate compared to coronaviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This suggests that BRSV is more susceptible than BCoV to degradation by environmental factors, and that the importance of indirect BRSV transmission after 24&#x000a0;h, is probably low. As demonstrated by Mullis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], viral infectivity is more rapidly lost than viral RNA.</p><p id="Par49">For both viruses, the viral RNA level recovered from boots was lower than from coats, possibly due to the rinsing with water. However, as high genome copy numbers remained, rinsing might not be sufficient to prevent virus transmission. This is supported by epidemiologic data that show an increased risk of seropositivity for BRSV and BCoV in herds that do not provide boots to visitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The present BCoV experiment indicated that also stethoscopes and wristwatches could serve as vehicles. These items are often brought between farms without cleaning/disinfection, and can carry infective virus particles for at least 24&#x000a0;h after exposure to infected cattle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">Personnel pose a risk in inter-herd transmission of BRSV and BCoV when bringing fomites between herds. In order to control the spread of these viruses, biosecurity measures should be implemented, including herd-specific clothing and equipment and washing/disinfection of fomites. Although personnel may carry the viruses intra-nasally for shorter periods of time, the relative importance of contaminated mucosa for indirect transmission is less than that of contaminated fomites.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCoV</term><def><p id="Par4">Bovine coronavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BRSV</term><def><p id="Par5">Bovine respiratory syncytial virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPE</term><def><p id="Par6">Cytopathic effect</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ct</term><def><p id="Par7">Cycle threshold</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMEM</term><def><p id="Par8">Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FCS</term><def><p id="Par9">Fetal calf serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GC</term><def><p id="Par10">Genome copies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRSV</term><def><p id="Par11">Human respiratory syncytial virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRT</term><def><p id="Par12">Human rectal tumor cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-ddPCR</term><def><p id="Par13">Reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-qPCR</term><def><p id="Par14">Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SLU</term><def><p id="Par15">Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>&#x003bc;l</term><def><p id="Par16">Microliter</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Mamata Khatri, Ingvild Berg Nyman and Elisabeth Furuseth Hansen at the Department of Food Safety and Infection Biology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences for skillful technical assistance.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par51">This study was supported by the Research Council of Norway (NFR-project No 224771/E40), the Norwegian Research Funding for Agriculture and Food Industry and TINE Norwegian Dairies BA.
