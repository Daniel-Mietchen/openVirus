<p>Our study confirms that CHIKV is present in Sindh region of Pakistan and is an important cause of acute febrile illness. Patients with CHIKV infection are more likely to present with severe arthralgia and neurological symptoms. The recent CHIKV outbreak in Karachi highlights the possibility of Karachi having an epidemic potential in future, unless timely preventive interventions are ensured. While the sample size and the study design was insufficient to calculate the actual prevalence of disease in the community, our findings raise concerns for the possible circulation of a virulent CHIKV genotype known for its high rate of CNS involvement.</p>
