<p>Our study is limited by the nested design on a cross-sectional surveillance of febrile patients who presented to health centres. Since there was no follow-up, the outcomes and long-term sequelae of CHIKV infections could not be assessed. Disease severity data was also not collected; hence the subgroup of severe dengue cases could not be compared with CHIKV cases admitted to the hospital. Another shortcoming was the testing algorithm: as only DENV NS1 negative cases were tested for CHIKV, co-infections and specific manifestations in such cases could not be determined.</p>
