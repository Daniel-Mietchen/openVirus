<p>Nucleotide sequencing reports have shown associations of specific mutations at residue 226 of membrane fusion glycoprotein E1 (E1-A226V) region with disease severity and better virus adaptability [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008086.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These mutations have been associated with abrupt epidemic outbreaks of CHIKV. A study from La Reunion reported 34.3% of the total island population infected with viral containing the E1-A226V mutation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008086.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Whole genome sequencing studies are currently underway to identify any mutations in CHIKV isolates yielded from Pakistan.
