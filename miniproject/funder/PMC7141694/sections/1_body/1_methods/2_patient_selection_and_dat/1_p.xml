<p>We recruited patients from 5 district hospitals one in each city. Patients presenting with acute febrile illness to out -patient department (OPD patients) and those admitted with dengue like illness (see details below) were recruited over a period of 3 years from 2015–2017. Appointed medical officers at each field site enrolled patients after taking written consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. In case of children less than 18 years, consent was sought from parents after the patients gave verbal assent to participation and sampling. Consent was taken in local language. Inclusion criteria was patients between 10–60 years of age with a fever &gt;over 38oC (&gt;100.4oF) for 3–10 days, with either of the following symptoms: headache, myalgia, arthralgia, vomiting, macular/ petechial rash, bleeding diathesis, altered mental status, or acute flaccid paralysis. Since the other causes of acute febrile illness had to be ruled out, i.e. typhoid by blood culture, malaria parasite by blood film and CBC to assist clinicians in patient management, in addition to serum collected for the viral studies. Consequently a large volume of blood sample (25 ml) was required, and this was the main reason for not including very young and very old patients. Thus, the exclusion criteria were age less than 10 years and &gt;60 years, presence of chronic liver disease, haematological malignancies or chronic illnesses requiring use of steroids (&gt;20mg/day of prednisolone for &gt; 2 weeks, or other immunosuppressant). Non-probability consecutive sampling was used. Samples were de-identified and stored at -80°C after separation of serum. DENV and CHIKV testing was performed using a commercial IgM Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (CHIKjj Detect IgM, InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Laboratory results, along with epidemiological and clinical data were recorded in a predefined questionnaire.</p>
