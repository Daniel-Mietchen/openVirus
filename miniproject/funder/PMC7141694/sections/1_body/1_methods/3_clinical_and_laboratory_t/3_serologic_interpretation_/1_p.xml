<p>CHIKV and DENV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected via commercial IgM ELISA platforms (CHIKjj Detect IgM, InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA), (DENV Detect IgM, InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA) according to manufacturer instructions. These are sandwich-type immunoassays that detect human antibodies targeting the CHIKV and DENV envelope glycoproteins. Any indeterminate or borderline samples were retested and evaluated in duplicate to verify immune status. Dengue IgM was tested for cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses like West Nile, Japanese Encephalitis and Zika by Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). Dengue subtyping was done by PCR for antigen positive samples and PRNT for IgM positive samples.</p>
