<p>This study examined the relationship between dengue fever epidemics and meteorological factors based on weekly data from the past 9 years in Guangdong province. Our findings showed that an optimal minimum temperature was observed for dengue fever epidemics in Guangdong province. Analysis of data from 2008 to 2016 showed that the majority of dengue cases occurred when the minimum temperature was above 18°C. Studies have reported that when the minimum temperature is &lt;18°C, virus propagation in the vector will be blocked; at &lt;17°C, the mosquitoes will stop ingesting food; and at &lt;16°C, there will be a prolonged mosquito larval stage[

Therefore, we constructed a prediction model for dengue fever that removed values below the optimal temperature to improve the accuracy and timeliness of dengue fever predictions.
