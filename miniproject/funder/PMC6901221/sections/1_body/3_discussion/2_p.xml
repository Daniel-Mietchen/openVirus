<p>In our study, the correlation coefficient between a single meteorological factor and the incidence of dengue fever is low, but when considering the interaction between meteorological factors, the correlation coefficient is high. It also shows that there is a real interaction between meteorological factors. Compared to single average temperature-related factors, the interactive effects led to slower growth in dengue epidemics, instead of sharp exponential growth when considering minimum air pressureandaverage relative humidity. This indicates that when studying the correlation between diseases and meteorological factors, using a single meteorological indicator will lead to poor accuracy. The interactive effects of different meteorological factors should be considered, which will provide a more valuable parameter of dengue fever model.</p>
