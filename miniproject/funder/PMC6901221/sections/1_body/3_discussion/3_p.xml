These studies found that the timing of dengue epidemics was closely correlated with seasonal temperature changes. In addition, Colon-Gonzalez et al[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]used monthly data to analyse the reasons for dengue outbreaks in Mexico and found that dengue epidemics were correlated with El Nino strength and minimum temperatures of the cool and dry seasons; no interactive effects were considered between different factors. However, using weekly data, we found that temperature, atmospheric pressure, and relative humidity had interactive effects on dengue epidemics. There are many factors that affect the incidence of dengue fever, including but not limited to mosquito factors, meteorological factors, and population mobility and so on. At a coarser scale (years), the overall change range of meteorological in same area is not obvious, so it is difficult to determine the relationship between the incidence and meteorological factors. The present results demonstrate that analysis based on weekly data can more precisely reveal the relationship between meteorological factors and dengue epidemics compared to that of monthly or yearly data. This implies that the scale of data analysis played a substantial role in these findings. Therefore, smaller scale data should be selected when analysing the patterns of dengue epidemics.
