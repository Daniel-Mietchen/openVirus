<p>Based on the above analysis, the key meteorological factors (mean temperature, mean relative humidity, mean atmospheric pressure, maximum atmospheric pressure, and minimum atmospheric pressure), interactive effect factors (mean temperature × minimum atmospheric pressure, mean temperature × minimum atmospheric pressure × mean relative humidity), mosquito-vector factor, and importation factor were used to constructan inverse cumulative normal distribution model, which was fitted to the number of cases in 2008–2016. The MLE was used to obtain the optimal parameter estimations: β
 <sub>0</sub>−β
 <sub>9</sub> were 109.2567, 1.7889, −0.0588, −0.0369, 0.2211, −0.0778, −0.0018, 0.0000, 1.6671, and 0.8962, respectively. Moreover, α

 <sub>2</sub>, and α
 <sub>3</sub> were the model construction constants for the mosquito-vector factor, which were 1.6624, 27.2765, and 2.0651, respectively. β
 <sub>0</sub> was the model construction constant, β
 <sub>1</sub>−β
 <sub>9</sub> were the coefficients for the key meteorological factors, interactive effect factors, mosquito-vector factor, and importation factor. The simulation results showed good fit with the actual number of cases and a goodness of fit R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.72 excluding the year 2014 year (including 2014, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9248). Using this model, we predicted the number of dengue fever cases for the first 41weeks of 2017. The predicted values showed good fit with the observed values (goodness of fit R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.60, correlation coefficient = 0.8104)(

The onset of dengue fever is concentrated in the 38th to 42nd weeks of each year and is sporadic at other times, so the actual onset of dengue fever shows periodic outbreaks. Prediction models based on the onset of dengue fever also show intermittent outbreaks.
