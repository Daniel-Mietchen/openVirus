<p>The minimum temperature was determined when given the infectious life of infected mosquitoes and daily survival probability, P, of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When the daily survival probability of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes was 0.850, 0.890, 0.913, and 0.918, given that the infectious life of infected mosquitoes was ≥1 day, the minimum temperatures were 27°C, 21°C, 19°C, and 18°C, respectively. As Guangdong is geographically close to Macao, these locations share similar meteorological factors and mosquito habits. Therefore, we selected 0.918 for the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in Macaoas as the daily survival probability of Guangdong. When the infectious life of a mosquito is at least one day (i.e. 1.196), the corresponding minimum temperature is 18°C, as shown in
