<p>Based on the moving average equation of the minimum temperature interval and the cumulative number of cases, there was a temperature inflection point between the minimum temperature and number of cases at 18–20°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225811.g001">Fig 1</xref>). When the minimum temperature was between 8–18°C, the number of cases only accounted for 2.01% of the total; when the minimum temperature was ≥18°C, the number of cases accounted for 97.97% of the total. We selected dengue fever cases with a minimum temperature ≥18°C for model construction.
