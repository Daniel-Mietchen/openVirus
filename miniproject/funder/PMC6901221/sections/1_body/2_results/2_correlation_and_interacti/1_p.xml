<p>Of the 477 weeks during the period between of 2008 to 2016, 282 weeks had minimum temperatures≥18°C, with the number of cases accounting for 97.91% of the total. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that meteorological factors influencing dengue fever cases in these 282 weeks included mean temperature (r = 0.153, P = 0.010), maximum atmospheric pressure (r = 0.127, P = 0.033), minimum atmospheric pressure (r = 0.125, P = 0.036), mean atmospheric pressure (r = 0.124, P = 0.037), and mean relative humidity (r = −0.221, P &lt;0.001)(

Regarding the lag between meteorological factors and dengue fever incidence, we constructed an ARIMA model to analyse the lag, but no lag was found (p = 0,q = 0).
