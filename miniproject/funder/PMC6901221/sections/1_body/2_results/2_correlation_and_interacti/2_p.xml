<p>The results in 
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicate that there were interactive effects between mean temperature and minimum atmospheric pressure and mean relative humidity (P = 0.05), minimum atmospheric pressure, and mean temperature (P = 0.039). The influence of meteorological factors on dengue fever is not a simple linear model. Taking temperature as an example, temperature will affect every stage of dengue transmission. Raising temperature at suitable temperature is beneficial to increase mosquito infection rate, transmission rate, and bite rate. But when the temperature is too high or too low, the infection rate, transmission rate and bite rate will decrease. This is because temperature, humidity, air pressure, rainfall, and other meteorological factors are interdependent and closely related, that is, there is an interaction between meteorological factors. The meteorological factors with interactive effects were further combined at different levels, and the analysis showed that when mean temperature was in the 25–28°C interval, minimum atmospheric pressure wasin the 997–1002 hPa interval, and mean relative humidity wasin the 73–81% interval, the intensity of the dengue epidemic was the greatest and had the highest number of cases (17,571 cases).
