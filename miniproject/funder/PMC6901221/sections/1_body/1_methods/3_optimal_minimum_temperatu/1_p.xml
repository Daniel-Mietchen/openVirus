 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, using the data above minimum temperature suitable for dengue fever reduces the data noise and improves the data quality of the model. Based on the Ross-Macdonald[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]and Watts[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]models, we searched for the optimal minimum temperature suitable for dengue transmission. In this model, infectious life P
 <sup>n</sup>/(−1nP)≥1day can be used as the minimum temperature suitable for dengue transmission, where P is the daily survival probability. 1/−1nP is the expected life, and P
 <sup>n</sup> is the probability of survival of infected mosquitoes after n days; n is mainly determined by the temperature, with a relationship of n = K/(T−C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], where K is the effective accumulated temperature(165.2 °C) needed for the incubation of dengue virus in mosquitoes and C is the minimum temperature (11.8°C)needed for the incubation of dengue viruses in mosquitoes and T is the minimum temperature required for a mosquito to survive for at least one day. Therefore, n = 165.2/(T−11.8). The daily survival probability, such as P = 0.85[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]or 0.89[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], was obtained under laboratory conditions with constant temperature, humidity, and light, whereas daily survival probability obtained under natural environments were 0.913 in French Guiana[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and 0.918in Macao[
 <xref rid="pone.0225811.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To calculate the minimum temperature suitable for the transmission of dengue fever, we selected the daily survival probability for Macao of P = 0.918, as it is adjacent to Guangdong province.
