<p>In order to explore the relationship between dengue fever and temperature, we divided the average weekly minimum temperature into 2 °C intervals of 8–10 °C, 10–12 °C, 12–14 °C, 14–16 °C, 16–18 °C, 18–20 °C, 20–22 °C, 22–24 °C, and 24–26 °C. The cumulative numbers of cases corresponding to these intervals were then calculated, and the moving smooth curve was used to determine the optimal temperature of dengue fever epidemics. For the different temperature intervals, the corresponding number of cases were 13, 54, 95, 156, 709, 955, 17,956, 17,894, and 13,298, respectively.</p>
