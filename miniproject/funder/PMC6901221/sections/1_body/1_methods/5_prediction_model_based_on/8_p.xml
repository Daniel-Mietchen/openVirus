<p>Due to the large number of imported cases from the Southeast Asia dengue epidemic, there was a major dengue outbreak in Guangdong in 2014. Therefore, the importation factor was added to the model, which was labelled as 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n+2</italic>
 </sub> and was a binary variable, where 2014 was assigned a value of 1 and all other years were assigned a value of 0.
