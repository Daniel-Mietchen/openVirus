 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in a region, that is, the average number of containers for the breeding of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae per 100 households. If the Breteau Index is below 5, it is safe; if it is above 20, it means that once external cases are imported, an epidemic of mosquito-borne infectious diseases may occur in this area. Dengue epidemic risk is related to the Breteau Index, which is closely related to meteorological factors. In this study, due to the lack of Breteau Index, a model of mosquito vectors [

 </sub>. This assumes that there is an optimum temperature, α2, that gives the maximum probability of vector breeding and reproduction, and hence has the maximum density. Each time the temperature deviates from α
