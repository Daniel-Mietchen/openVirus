<p>By comparing the optimal solution with the actual observation value, the loss value corresponding to (α
 <sub>1</sub>, α
 <sub>2</sub>, α
 <sub>3</sub>) can be obtained by using formula (3). If the loss value meets the criteria (this loss value is better than the previous loss value, or no better loss can be found after 300 repetitions), then this (α
 <sub>1</sub>, α
 <sub>2</sub>, α
 <sub>3</sub>) is the approximate optimal solution. If it does not meet the requirements, a new (α
 <sub>1</sub>, α
 <sub>2</sub>, α
 <sub>3</sub>) is generated by random perturbation (α
 <sub>1</sub>, α
 <sub>2</sub>, α
 <sub>3</sub>). The above process is repeated to obtain a new loss value and to check whether it meets the requirements.
