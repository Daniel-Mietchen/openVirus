<p>The goodness of fit index, R
 <sup>2</sup>, can be used to measure the overall effect of the model's prediction. The value range is (−∞, 1) and the closer the value is to 1, the better the predictive effect of the model, and vice versa. Goodness of fit indicates a good fit between the predicted and actual values, whereas the correlation coefficient indicates a consistent trend between the predicted and actual value.
