<p>Dengue fever is an acute infectious disease caused by the dengue virus and transmitted by the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito. It is a serious public health issue in tropical and subtropical zones. According to the World Health Organisation, the incidence of dengue fever has risen sharply over the past few decades. More than 40% of the global population is at risk of dengue fever, with 50â€“100 million cases of dengue infections each year[

Guangdong is a coastal province on the southern tip of China, experiences frequent population movement with Southeast Asian countries, and possesses a subtropical monsoon climate. These conditions are ideal for the breeding of the dengue vector (

Therefore, exploring factors influencing the dengue outbreaks in Guangdong and predicting future epidemiological trends are of great significance to the prevention and control of dengue fever.
