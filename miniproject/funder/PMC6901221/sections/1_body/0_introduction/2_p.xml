<p>Previous studies regarding the epidemiological patterns of dengue fever have focused on the impact of meteorological factors, imported cases, and control measures. However, most studies used monthly or yearly data, and did not consider the interactive effects among meteorological factors, leading to unreliable or even contradictory results. Li et al analysed the epidemiological distribution of dengue fever and the relationship with meteorological factors based on monthly data from Guangzhou in 2007 to 2012 and reported that relative humidity was positively correlated with dengue epidemics[
