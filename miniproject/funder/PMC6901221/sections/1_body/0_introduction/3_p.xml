<p>Therefore, it is especially important to perform correlation analyses between dengue fever and meteorological factors based on a small time granularity and to clarify which meteorological factors play a decisive role in dengue epidemics. It is also important to examine the interactive effects of different meteorological factors on dengue epidemics. Based on the above multiple variables, such as key meteorological factors, interactive meteorological factors, mosquito-vector factors, and importation factors, we aimed to establish an accurate prediction model and to provide support for dengue prediction and warnings.</p>
