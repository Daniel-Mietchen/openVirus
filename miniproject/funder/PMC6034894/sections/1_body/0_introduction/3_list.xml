      <bold>Compartmental models</bold> (e.g., [

      <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]): break down the population into a number of discrete “compartments” describing their characteristics (e.g., age, location) and state (e.g., susceptible to, infectious with, or recovered from a particular disease), and describe how the occupancy of these compartments changes over time, either deterministically or probabilistically. In many of these models, this division describes solely the state with respect to a single disease, ignoring details regarding age, spatial dynamics, and mixtures of ILI diseases, but keeping the number of parameters to infer low.

      <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]): also known as individual-based models, these approaches use more detailed descriptions of disease state and/or individual characteristics and behavior, which are not easily simplified into a compartmental form, typically studied using computation-heavy simulations. These approaches usually include many more parameters than compartmental models, which may be set or inferred by heuristics, additional data sources and studies, or Monte Carlo procedures.

This category includes linear dynamical systems and frameworks such as SARIMAX.
