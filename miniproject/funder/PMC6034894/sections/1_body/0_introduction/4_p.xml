<p>We present a novel phenomenological approach to epidemiological forecasting using “delta densities”, which assumes an autoregressive dependency structure similar to those of some time series models, but uses a kernel density estimation approach to model these dependencies rather than the common choice of linear relationships plus Gaussian noise. This technique is similar to the method of analogues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] in that it uses an instance-based, nonparametric estimation procedure, but provides distributional forecasts of entire trajectories rather than point predictions of individual observations. The kernel conditional density estimation (KCDE) forecasting method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] attacks many of the same issues encountered when applying kernel density estimation methods to seasonal epidemic data, but models the dependency structure of future weeks with a copula, while delta density chains together 1-week-ahead simulations. Compared to approaches that treat the entire season as a unit, such as deterministic, single-strain, fully-mixed compartmental models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or our previous empirical Bayes approach based on modifying past seasons’ data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], this method forms a larger library of possible trajectories by piecing together local models, which appears to help forecast performance, even though the trajectories considered may seem less reasonable on average.
