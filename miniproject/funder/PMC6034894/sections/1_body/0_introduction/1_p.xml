<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics cause widespread illness which is associated each year with an estimated 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and 3000 to 56 000 deaths in the United States alone [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast to influenza “pandemics”, which are rare global outbreaks of especially novel influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], seasonal epidemics (i.e., non-pandemics), while still having worldwide reach, occur annually in the United States and other countries with (generally) temperate climates. Time series of influenza prevalence in these areas are typically low and flat for the majority of the season, but trace a single, sharp peak sometime during winter, with significant variability in timing and intensity. Accurate and reliable forecasts of seasonal epidemics can help policymakers plan countermeasures such as vaccination campaigns, and increase awareness and preparedness of hospitals and the general public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors influenza prevalence with several well-established surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; the recurring nature of seasonal epidemics and availability of historical data provide promising opportunities for the formation, evaluation, and application of statistical models. Starting with the 2013/2014 “Predict the Influenza Season Challenge” [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and continuing each season thereafter as the Epidemic Prediction Initiative’s FluSight project [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], CDC has solicited and compiled forecasts of influenza-like illness (ILI) prevalence from external research groups and worked with them to develop standardized forecast formats and quantitative evaluation metrics.
