 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Changes made to Delphi-Stat throughout the 2015/2016 season are described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006134.s017">S5 Appendix</xref>. These three forecasting systems were ranked as the top three in the 2015/2016 comparison in terms of overall multibin score, with Delphi-Stat at the top. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006134.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the performance of the three Delphi forecasting systems, broken down by evaluation metric and forecasting target. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006134.s001">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006134.s002">S2</xref> Figs. show the multibin scores broken down by location and by forecasting week. Delphi-Stat had consistently strong aggregate multibin scores across different targets, locations, and forecasting weeks, and the best overall multibin log score of all FluSight 2015/2016 submissions. Delphi-Stat’s unibin log score evaluations relative to the other two Delphi systems seem similar to or better than the corresponding multibin log score evaluations, as Delphi-Stat has the best unibin score of the three for each target rather than just overall; this observation seems natural since Delphi-Stat was developed to optimize unibin log score, and may suggest that optimizing for multibin log score rather than unibin log score when selecting ensemble weights or as a post-processing step could produce multibin log score improvements. However, the system’s point predictions, while optimized for the mean absolute error metric, were less accurate than (but still competitive with) the other two when averaged across all predictions.
