 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006134.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows a subset of the cross-validation data used to form the ensemble and evaluate the effectiveness of the ensemble method, for two sets of components: one using all the components of Delphi-Stat, and the other incorporating three of the lower-performance components and a uniform distribution for distributional forecasts. The Delphi-Stat ensemble near-uniformly dominates the best component, extended delta density, in terms of log score, and has comparable mean absolute error overall. The ensemble approach produces greater gains for the smaller subset of methods, surpassing not only its best components, but all forecasting methods in the wider Delphi-Stat ensemble except for the delta density approaches.
