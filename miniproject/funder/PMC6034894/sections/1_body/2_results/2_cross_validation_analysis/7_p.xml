 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006134.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows cross-validation performance estimates for the extended delta density method based on three evaluation schemes: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Ground truth, no nowcast</bold>: the ground truth wILI for the left-out season up to the forecast week is provided as input, resulting in an optimistic performance estimate;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Real-time data, no nowcast</bold>: the appropriate wILI report is used for data from the left-out season, but no adjustment is made for possible updates; this performance estimate is valid, but we can improve upon the underlying method;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Backcast, no nowcast</bold>: the appropriate wILI report is used for data from the left-out season, but we use a residual density method to “backcast” updates to this report; this performance estimate is valid, and the backcasting procedure significantly improves the log score;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Backcast, Gaussian nowcast</bold>: same as “Backcast, no nowcast” but with another week of simulated data added to the forecast, based on a Gaussian-distributed nowcast; and
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Backcast, Student 
     <italic>t</italic> nowcast
    </bold>: same as “Backcast, Gaussian nowcast” but using a Student 
    <italic>t</italic>-distributed nowcast in place of the Gaussian nowcast.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Backcast, ensemble nowcast</bold>: same as the previous two but using the ensemble nowcast (which combines “no nowcast” with “Student 
    <italic>t</italic> nowcast”).
