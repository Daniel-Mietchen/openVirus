 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006134.s013">S1 Appendix</xref>, and the three ensemble approaches specified earlier in the text. Except for the uniform distribution and ensembles, all forecasting methods miss some possibilities completely, reporting unreasonable probabilities less than exp(−10) ≈ 0.0000454 for events that actually occurred. In these situations, the log score has been increased to the cap of −10 (as CDC does for multibin log scores). Delta and residual density forecasting methods (Delta density, Markovian; Delta density, extended; and BR, residual density) are less likely to commit these errors than other non-ensemble, non-uniform approaches, and have higher average log scores. Ensemble approaches combine forecasts of multiple components, missing fewer possibilities, and ensuring that a reasonable log score is obtained by incorporating the uniform distribution as a component. For the full Delphi-Stat ensemble, the main advantage of the ensemble over its best component appears to be successfully filling in possibilities missed by the best component with other models to avoid -10 and other low log scores appears, while for ensembles of subsets of the forecasting methods, there are other benefits;
