 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006134.g005">Fig 5</xref> also includes estimates of the mean log score for each method and rough error bars for these estimates. We expect there to be strong statistical dependence across evaluations for the same season and location, and weaker dependencies between different seasons and locations; thus, the most common approaches to calculating standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis test results will be inappropriate. Properly accounting for such dependencies and calibrating intervals and tests is an important but difficult task and is left for future investigation. We use “rough standard error bars” on estimates of mean evaluations: first, the relevant data (e.g., all cross-validation evaluations for a particular method and evaluation metric) is summarized into one value for each season-location pair by taking the mean of all evaluations for that season-location pair; we then calculate the mean and standard error of the mean of these season-location values using standard calculations as if these values were independent. Under some additional assumptions which posit the existence of a single underlying true mean log score for each method, these individual error bars—or rough error bars for the mean difference in log scores between pairs of ethods—suggest that the observed data is unlikely to have been recorded if the true mean log score of the extended delta density method were greater than that of the adaptively weighted ensemble, or if the true mean log score of the “Empirical Bayes A” method were greater than the extended delta density method. The mean and rough standard error estimates in
