<p>Methods that model wILI trajectories and “pin” past wILI to its observed values have a large number of log scores near 0 because they are often able to confidently “forecast” many onsets and peaks that have already occurred; ensemble methods also have a large number of log scores near 0. Note that these scores are closer to 0 for ensembles that optimize weighting of different methods than for the ensemble with uniform weights. For this particular set of forecasting methods, targets, and evaluation seasons: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>the uniformly weighted ensemble has lower average log score than the best individual component (extended delta density),</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>using the stacking approach to assign weights to ensemble components improves ensemble performance significantly and gives higher average log score than the best individual component,</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>the adaptive weighting scheme does not provide a major benefit over a fixed-weight scheme using a single set of weights for each evaluation metric.</p>
  </list-item>
