<p>Using the heavy-tailed Student 
 <italic>t</italic> nowcasts or nowcast ensemble appears to improve on short-term forecasts without damaging performance on seasonal targets. The performance of the nowcast ensemble is further explored in

The Gaussian nowcast has a similar effect as the other nowcasters except on the “1 wk ahead” target that it directly predicts: its distribution is too thin-tailed, resulting in lower mean log scores than using the forecaster by itself on this target.
