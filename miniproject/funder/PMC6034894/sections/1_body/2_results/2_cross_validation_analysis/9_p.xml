<p>Using the “backcasting” method to model the difference between the ground truth and the available report helps close the gap between the update-ignorant method. The magnitude of the performance differences depends on the target and forecast week. Differences in mean scores for the short-term targets are small and may be reasonably explained by random chance alone; the largest potential difference appears to be an improvement in the “1 wk ahead” target by using backcasting. More significant differences appear in each of the seasonal targets following typical times for the corresponding onset or peak events; most of the improvement can be attributed to preventing the method from assigning inappropriately high probabilities (often 1) to events that look like they must or almost certainly will occur based on available wILI observations for past weeks, but which are ultimately not observed due to revisions of these observations. The magnitude of the mean log score improvement depends in part on the resolution of the log score bins; for example, wider bins for “Season peak percentage” may reduce the improvement in mean log score (but would also shrink the scale of all mean log scores). Similarly, the differences in scores may be reduced but not eliminated by use of multibin scores for evaluation or ensembles incorporating uniform components for forecasting.</p>
