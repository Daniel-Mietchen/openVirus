<p>Recording every case of influenza is not practicable; infections are often asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or symptomatic but not clinically attended [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], laboratory testing may not be performed for clinically attended cases or give false negative results, and reporting of lab-confirmed cases is not mandatory in most instances. Forecast comparisons are instead based on syndromic clinical surveillance data from the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], a group of health care providers that voluntarily report statistics regarding ILI, where ILI is defined as a 100°F (37.8°C) fever with a cough and/or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza. CDC aggregates these reports and estimates the weekly percentage of patients seen that have ILI, %ILI, across all health care providers using a measure called weighted %ILI (wILI).
