   <bold>Geographical resolution</bold>: CDC reports wILI for each of the 10 U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) regions, as well as for the nation as a whole; the wILI for each of these locations is a weighted average of the ILINet %ILI for state-level units based on population.

  <p>
   <bold>Temporal resolution</bold>: wILI is available on a weekly basis; weeks begin on Sunday, end on Saturday, and are numbered according to the epidemiological week (epi week) convention in the United States.

   <bold>Timeliness</bold>: Initial wILI estimates for a given week are typically released on Friday of the following week; additional reports and revisions from participating health care providers are incorporated in updates throughout the season and after it ends.

   <bold>Specificity</bold>: Influenza is just one of many potential causes of ILI. Laboratory testing data [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1006134.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] suggest that influenza is responsible for a significant portion of ILI cases during the flu season, especially for weeks when wILI is high, but only for a very small fraction of cases in the typical flu off-season. Much of the variance and “peakiness” in wILI can be associated with influenza epidemics, but wILI trajectories do not taper off to near-zero values as one might expect in a direct measurement of influenza prevalence.

   <bold>Influence of non-ILI cases</bold>: Since wILI depends on records of both ILI cases and total cases, patterns in non-ILI cases can impact wILI trajectories. We discuss one such pattern in the Holiday effects section.
