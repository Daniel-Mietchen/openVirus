<p>On average, wILI tends to be higher on holidays and during the winter holiday season than would be expected based on interpolating observations from nearby weeks [

Sharp rises and drops in wILI are common from early or mid-December to early January (roughly coinciding with a four week period beginning with epi week 50), with either the seasonâ€™s peak or a lower, secondary peak commonly occurring on epi week 52. This pattern appears to arise from two factors:

   <p>spikes downward in the number of non-ILI visits during the holiday season (corresponding to increases in wILI), perhaps caused by patients choosing not to visit the doctor for less serious issues on holidays, and</p>

   <p>decreases in the average number of ILI visits at the end of the holidays, perhaps due to decreased transmission of ILI during holidays, which make the preceding increases in wILI appear even sharper.</p>
