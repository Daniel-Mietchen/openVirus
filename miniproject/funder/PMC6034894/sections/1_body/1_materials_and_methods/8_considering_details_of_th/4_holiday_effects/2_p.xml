<p>Similarly, there are spikes or minor blips downward in the average number of non-ILI visits (which can result in small increases in wILI) associated with Thanksgiving Day; Labor Day; Independence Day; Memorial Day; Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.; Washingtonâ€™s Birthday; Columbus Day; and perhaps other holidays. The spike upward in wILI at Thanksgiving can push wILI unexpectedly over the onset threshold, and holiday effects may help explain the surprising frequency at which peaks occur on epi week 7 but not neighboring weeks. Additional age-specific patterns may be obscured by this analysis of aggregate ILI and non-ILI visit counts.</p>
