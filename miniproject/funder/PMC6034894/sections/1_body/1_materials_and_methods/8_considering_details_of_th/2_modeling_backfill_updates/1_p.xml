<p>When a wILI value is reported for a given week, it is not set in stone; as ILINet members provide “backfill” reports or revisions for past weeks and data is cleaned, wILI observations are updated accordingly. When generating a retrospective forecast, it is important to use the version of the data that would have been available at the time rather than the final revision in order to get a more appropriate estimate of the future performance of a forecasting system. Furthermore, forecasting performance can be improved by modeling and “backcasting” these backfill updates, accounting for the following sources of error: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Biased early reports</bold>: earlier wILI versions are generally biased downwards early in the in-season, and upwards towards the end of the in-season, which may lead to forecasts of lower, later peaks early in the season, and of longer epidemic duration later in the season;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Overconfident short-term distributional forecasts</bold>: since updates in wILI can cause “observed” data, e.g., of the wILI at the presumed peak week, to shift, ignoring backfill may lead to “thin”, overconfident forecast distributions;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <bold>Revisions of “observed” seasonal targets</bold>: wILI updates sometimes cause large changes in the apparent onset week or peak week when there are bumps or multiple peaks in the trajectory: wILI updates can cause a measurement to change from above the CDC baseline to below (or vice versa), or for an earlier, lower peak to rise above a later peak (or vice versa); ignoring backfill updates can cause models to completely miss some possibilities when these targets appear to be determined. A similar type of error can arise from revisions to the peak height value (regardless of whether the peak week changes); even small updates can result in large unibin log score penalties.
