<p>The backcasting method is modular and can combine with any forecaster expecting ground truth wILI as input. The straightforward approach is to sample a few thousand trajectories from the backfill simulator, feed each of these into the forecaster to obtain a trajectory or a distribution over targets, and aggregate the results. Some forecasting methods in the Delphi-Stat ensemble do not have a simple way to quickly generate single-trajectory forecasts, so we also use alternative approaches to reduce computation, such as randomly pairing backcasts and trajectory forecasts, where the trajectory forecasts are efficiently generated in batch, based on the pointwise mean of the backcasts.</p>
