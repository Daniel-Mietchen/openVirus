<p>Each holiday above occurs at roughly the same time of year every year, falling on one of two possible epi weeks. Thus, models that predict behavior at a given epi week by prioritizing or focusing solely on past behavior at that given epi week will automatically perform a rough adjustment for holiday effects. This factor informs our decision to use historical data only from corresponding weeks in the Markovian delta density method, and a truncated Laplacian kernel with narrower width near winter holidays in the extended delta density method. Specifically, for the extended delta density method, we choose the half-width of the kernel to be
