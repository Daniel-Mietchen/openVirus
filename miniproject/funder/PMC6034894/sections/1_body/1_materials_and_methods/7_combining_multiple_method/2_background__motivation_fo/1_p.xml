<p>Methods that combine the output of different models, called “ensembles”, “multi-model ensembles”, “super-ensembles”, “model averages”, or various other names based on the domain and type of approach, have been applied successfully in many problem settings, improving upon the results of the best individual model. An ensemble approach is motivated in the context of seasonal epidemic forecasting by factors such as:

   <p>
    <bold>Model misspecification and overconfidence in distributional forecasts</bold>: Many methods overlook the possibility of a significant proportion of observed outcomes, or assign otherwise inappropriate probabilities. These omissions and other mistakes are not identical across models; the gaps left by one component can be filled in by another.

    <bold>Leveraging partially correlated errors in point predictions</bold>: The point prediction errors of individual methods can vary in magnitude and are often only partially correlated with each other, allowing ensemble methods to improve performance, e.g., by highly weighting more accurate predictors, or by reducing the variance when combining multiple unbiased estimators.

    <bold>Strengths and weaknesses in different targets</bold>: Some methods may work well for certain forecasting targets, but have poor performance or fail to produce predictions for others; model averages can be smoothly adjusted to account for different behaviors for different targets.

   <p>
    <bold>Changes in performance within seasons</bold>: Making predictions at the beginning, middle, and end of a season can be seen as different tasks, and the relative performance characteristics of the components may change based on the time of season (or whether it is around a holiday). Just as ensemble methods can account for distinct patterns based on forecasting target, they can be tailored to account for changes in behavior within a season.
