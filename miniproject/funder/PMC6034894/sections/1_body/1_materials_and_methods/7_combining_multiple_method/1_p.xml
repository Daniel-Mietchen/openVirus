<p>Forecasting systems that select effective combinations of predictions from multiple models can improve on the performance of the individual components, as demonstrated by their successful application in many domains. For each probability distribution and point prediction in a forecast, we treat the choice of an effective combination as a statistical estimation problem, and base each decision on the modelsâ€™ behavior in leave-one-out cross-validation forecasts. Additional cross-validation analysis indicates that this approach achieves performance comparable to or better than the best individual component.</p>
