<p>When making distributional forecasts, wILI values are discretized into CDC-specified bins and a probability assigned to each bin, forming a histogram over possible observations. The width of the bins was set at 0.5 %wILI for the 2015/2016 comparison and 0.1 %wILI for the 2016/2017 comparison; we use a width of 0.5 %wILI for analysis of the 2015/2016 comparison prospective forecasts, and a width of 0.1 %wILI for retrospective evaluation. CDC typically presents wILI values rounded to a resolution of 0.1 %wILI; some targets and evaluations are based on these rounded values.</p>
