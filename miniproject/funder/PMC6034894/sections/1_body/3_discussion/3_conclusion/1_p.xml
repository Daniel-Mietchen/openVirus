<p>The delta density forecasting method, stacking-based adaptively weighted ensemble, distributional “backcasts” of wILI updates, and nowcasts from ILI-Nearby provide significant improvements upon other individual forecasting approaches that we considered. Promising avenues for further improvements include refining the methodology to rely less on arbitrary and heuristic feature, kernel, bandwidth, and parameter selections, regularization of ensemble weights, incorporating conditional density estimators from statistical literature, and using additional data sources and finer-resolution data models.</p>
