<p>Delphi-Stat forecasts submitted to the 2015/2016 comparison were based solely on wILI observations from the 2015/2016 “pre-season” (EW21–EW39) and season (EW40–EW20) and nonmechanistic models (with a majority of the ensemble weight assigned to the delta and residual density based methods). Additional data and mechanistic models dealing with categories of ILI or type and subtype of influenza, climate, digital surveillance, season-to-season patterns, spatial interaction, etc. were not incorporated. We do think that these types of data are useful, but analyzing their dynamics and effects on wILI is complicated by the fact that the smallest geographical units for which real-time wILI data is readily available for the entire US are HHS regions (on a weekly time scale). We expect that mechanistic components incorporating climate data and separating diseases, types, and subtypes will be more useful when we are able to model, forecast, and validate data at a finer geographical resolution, ideally at the metro area level. Similarly, we believe that digital surveillance data is useful; in fact, we currently use a sensor fusion framework to combine several such data sources and short-term forecasters to produce “nowcasts” for the current week [
