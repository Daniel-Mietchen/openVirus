<p>During development and throughout this manuscript, we have focused on (thresholded) unibin log score as a (near-)proper, simple-to-implement metric for distributional forecasts. CDC FluSight organizers, on the other hand, selected exponentiated mean thresholded multibin log scores over the entire influenza season as the evaluation metric for forecast comparisons to 1. encourage high-quality distributional predictions rather than point predictions, for better understanding of the risk of certain scenarios, 2. make the scoring metric more accessible to policymakers than unibin and non-exponentiated variants, and 3. avoid −∞ scores due to a single forecaster mistake or unmodeled data revisions. We believe that it is up to policymakers to decide whether these forecasts are ready for use in decision support at the current level of accuracy. For other potential users and forecast comparisons, we provide absolute error evaluations for all targets in 2015/2016 in
