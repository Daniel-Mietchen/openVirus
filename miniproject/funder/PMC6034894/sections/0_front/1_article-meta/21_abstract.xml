 <p>Seasonal influenza is associated with 250 000 to 500 000 deaths worldwide each year (WHO estimates). In the United States and other temperate regions, seasonal influenza epidemics occur annually, but their timing and intensity varies significantly; accurate and reliable forecasts that quantify their uncertainty can assist policymakers when planning countermeasures such as vaccination campaigns, and increase awareness and preparedness of hospitals and the general public. Starting with the 2013/2014 flu season, CDC has solicited, collected, evaluated, and compared weekly forecasts from external research groups. We developed a new method for forecasting flu surveillance data, which stitches together models of changes that happen each week, and a way of combining its output with other forecasts. The resulting forecasting system produced the most accurate forecasts in CDCâ€™s 2015/2016 FluSight comparison of fourteen forecasting systems. We describe our new forecasting methods, analyze their performance in the 2015/2016 comparison and on data from previous seasons, and describe idiosyncrasies of epidemiological data that should be considered when constructing and evaluating forecasting systems.</p>
