  <title>Using finalized data for evaluation leads to optimistic estimates of performance, particularly for seasonal targets, “backcasting” improves predictions for seasonal targets, and nowcasting can improve predictions for short-term targets.</title>
  <p>Mean log score of the extended delta density method, averaged across seasons 2010/2011 to 2015/2016, all locations, all targets, and forecast weeks 40 to 20, both broken down by target and averaged across all targets (“Overall”). Rough standard error bars for the mean score for each target (or overall) appear on the right, in addition to the error bars at each epi week.</p>
