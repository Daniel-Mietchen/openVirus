  <title>On average, wILI is higher on holidays than expected based on neighboring weeks.</title>
  <p>Weekly trends in wILI values, as expressed by the contribution of a each week to a sum of wILI values from seasons 2003/2004 to 2015/2016, excluding 2008/2009 and 2009/2010 (which include portions of the 2009 influenza pandemic), show spikes and bumps upward on and around major holidays. (U.S. federal holidays are indicated with event lines.) The number of non-ILI visits to ILINet health care providers spikes downwards on holidays (disproportionately with any drops in the number of ILI visits), contributing to higher wILI. The number of ILI visits generally declines in the second half of the winter holiday season, causing winter holiday peaks to appear even higher relative to nearby weeks. In addition to holiday effects, we see that average ILINet participation jumps upward on epi week 40, and gradually tapers off later in the season and in the off-season.</p>
