<p>A standardised case report form was used to collect data at the eight participating hospitals. Medical records were reviewed to obtain data, which included demographics, comorbidities, physiological data, laboratory tests and influenza-associated data. Importantly, given that the reported influenza epidemic was characterised by a high proportion of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we collected ventilatory parameters and daily fluid status; protective ventilation strategy and dry-lung strategy are key components of the fundamental management of ARDS.
