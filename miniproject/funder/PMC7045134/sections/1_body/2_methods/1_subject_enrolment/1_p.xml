<p>This multicentre retrospective cohort study enrolled patients admitted to the ICUs at eight tertiary referral centres in Taiwan for virology-confirmed influenza who were enrolled during an influenza epidemic. The reported influenza epidemic occurred between October 2015 and March 2016, and the diagnosis of influenza was confirmed by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control based on the rapid influenza diagnostic test, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the eight participating hospitals. Written informed consent was waived owing to the minimal risk, and all patientsâ€™ information was de-identified before analysis.</p>
