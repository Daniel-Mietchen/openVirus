<p>Data were expressed as frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables and as means±SD or median (IQR) based on the test of normality for continuous variables. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to test the normality. Differences between the survivor and non-survivor groups were analysed using Student’s t-test for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used for the variable which is not normally distributed. For the interpretability of the ML approach, feature importance was used to quantify the variable importance of each variable, and the SHAP summary plot and partial SHAP dependency plots were used to illustrate the distribution of the variable importance of individual variables. The score of feature importance was the average gain across all splits of a feature’s used in the construction of the model. The performance of XGBoost, RF and LR for predicting 30-day mortality was determined by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric. The DeLong’s test was used to compare the difference between two area under the curves (AUCs). Python V.3.6 was used in the present study.</p>
