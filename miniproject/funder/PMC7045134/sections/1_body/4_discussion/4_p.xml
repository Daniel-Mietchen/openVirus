<p>In the present study, we found a similar test accuracy between XGBoost (AUC 0.842) and RF (AUC 0.809), whereas the accuracy of LR was poor (AUC 0.701). Indeed, LR is a widely used interpretable algorithm and works well if a single decision boundary exists. However, LR is based on a number of assumptions, including the independence between input variables and a linear correlation between input and output variables, whereas the real-life data set may not meet all the assumptions of LR. We postulate that the assumption of a linear relationship between the input variables and the outcomes might at least partly account for the restively low accuracy of LR in this study, as the complex biological events in severe influenza may be correlated with each other in a non-linear model. Instead, tree-based classifiers, including RF and XGBoost, based on homogeneity appeared to fit the characteristics of the data set in the present study. We thought that the application of regularisation, using Taylor expansion to approximate the loss function, and high flexibility to allow for fine-tuning might enable XGBoost to perform slightly better than RF. Taken together, our findings suggest that the XGBoost approach can illustrate the feature importance and establish a mortality prediction model with high accuracy, and this approach has a high potential for practical implementation because it can be integrated with existing computerised healthcare information systems.</p>
