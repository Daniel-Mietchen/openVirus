<p>Critical care medicine requires prompt decision-making based on clinical data that can be interpreted with the assistance of automated DSS. Increasing evidence has shown the potential of ML-based automated DSS in critical care medicine. Taylor 
 <italic>et al</italic>, using electronic health records and ML algorithms, including the RF model, recently reported that the ML-based approach was superior to traditional logistic regression for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to the emergency department for sepsis.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In line with our ML approach, Allyn 
 <italic>et al</italic> compared an ML-based approach to traditional scoring systems (EuroSCORE I and EuroSCORE II) for predicting mortality in patients receiving elective cardiac surgery and found that the ML-based approach (AUC: 0.795, 95% CI 0.755 to 0.834) outperformed EuroSCORE I (AUC: 0.737, 95% CI 0.691 to 0.783) and EuroSCORE II (AUC: 0.742, 95% CI 0.698 to 0.785).
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In addition to predicting mortality, Horng 
 <italic>et al</italic> recently reported an ML-based model that included vital signs, demographic data and free-text data to identify patients with infection in the emergency department (AUC: 0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86) and proposed a potential automated trigger for sepsis clinical decision support in the emergency department.
