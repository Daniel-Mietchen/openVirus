<p>Using a multicentre severe influenza data set along with XGBoost and SHAP plots, we demonstrated that the ML approach can illustrate key features and establish a mortality prediction model with high accuracy in critically ill influenza patients. The illustration of cumulative domain-specific feature importance and visualised interpretation of feature importance may give physicians an intuitive understanding of the key features within XGBoost. Furthermore, the prediction model, using clinical data in the routine practice of ICU care instead of advanced molecular biomarkers, can potentially be integrated into a computerised clinical decision support system in the future.</p>
