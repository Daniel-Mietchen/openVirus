<p>Consistent with other studies on severe influenza,
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> we found that both APACHE II and PSI had a discriminative power of approximately 0.72 in the ROC analysis, which is generally deemed acceptable accuracy for a single parameter (

The expected finding that the ML approach outperformed PSI and APACHE II in critically ill influenza patients should reflect the capability of ML to establish an influenza-specific weighting model using all of the obtained data. Unlike other critical diseases, which are mainly characterised by shock-associated manifestations, severe influenza is characterised by severely compromised oxygenation, so-called ARDS. Our previous studies have also found that early lung-protective ventilation and early fluid balance were associated with mortality in patients with severe influenza,
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> a result that is consistent with current concepts of the early lung-protective ventilation strategy and dry-lung strategy in the management of patients with ARDS.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> Therefore, it was reasonable to find that the ventilation domain (cumulative feature importance: 0.113) and fluid balance domain (cumulative feature importance: 0.253) were of particular importance in the present study, reflecting the additional weights on these two domains in XGBoost compared with those in conventional severity scores, including APACHE II and PSI. Notably, the parameters in the ventilation domain and fluid balance domain were all recorded on a routine daily basis in the ICU, and hence, the established prediction model should be generalisable to other settings. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the use of an ML approach, mainly XGBoost, in a real-world data set was capable of establishing a practical DSS in critically ill patients with a specific aetiology, namely, severe influenza.
