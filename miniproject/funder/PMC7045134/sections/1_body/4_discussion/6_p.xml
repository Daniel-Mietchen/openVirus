<p>There are limitations to this study that merit discussion. First, the number of subjects was relatively small. Given that only one per cent of patients with influenza-like illness develop severe influenza, the sample size in studies on severe influenza is generally small.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> As the main focus of the study was to determine predictors for mortality in ICU patients with proven influenza, the enrollees in this study actually accounted for 44.2% (72/163) of deaths among patients with severe influenza during the reported influenza epidemic in Taiwan.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> To mitigate the issue of small sample size, we have performed cross-validation (k=5) of XGBoost, RF and LR. The evaluation metric for cross-validation was the error rate of classification (ie, the number of wrong predictions divided by the total number of predictions). The accuracy for XGBoost, RF and LR were 0.792±0.022, 0.786±0.010 and 0.732±0.059, respectively. These findings are consistent with the data in the manuscript. Second, the study employed a retrospective design, though most research on influenza is retrospective, and evidence obtained from retrospective studies, including the present investigation, might be valuable for future epidemic or pandemic influenza preparations.

In the fields of critical care medicine and influenza epidemics, small improvements in the accuracy of predicting mortality may have a major impact on various aspects of healthcare, including patient care and resource allocation. Fourth, we used variables within 7 days as independent variables instead of time-varying variables to predict 30-day mortality. Finally, we did not include hospital-factor in the present study despite a slight increase of accuracy of XGBoost given that we aimed to establish a mortality prediction model with high generalisability in critically ill influenza patients (
