<p>Sepsis is a leading cause of death in the intensive care unit (ICU) worldwide and contributes to approximately 50% of hospital deaths in the USA.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> A number of scoring systems have been developed to predict mortality in patients admitted to ICUs; however, the clinical application remains limited given that sepsis consists of diverse aetiologies and no single scoring system appears to be applicable in diverse patient populations.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3–5</xref> For example, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, a widely used severity scoring system in the ICU,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> has been found to have a limited role in a number of diseases and settings, including severe influenza, pancreatitis, post-cardiac surgery and burn injury.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–12</xref> Similarly, the pneumonia severity index (PSI) is currently a widely used scoring system to assess patients with pneumonia,
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> but PSI might underestimate severity in patients with influenza.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> Currently, influenza infection remains a global health threat that is estimated to affect nearly five million people worldwide, resulting in 250 000 to 500 000 deaths in 2015.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Our previous studies, investigating 336 patients with severe influenza requiring ICU management, showed the impact of an influenza epidemic on the healthcare system due to an abrupt increase in patients with severe influenza and found that lung-protective ventilation as well as fluid balance were early predictors for 30-day mortality in patients with severe influenza.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> These findings highlight the crucial need to develop an influenza-specific mortality prediction model for both the management of patients and the allocation of ICU resources during an influenza epidemic. Taiwan experienced an influenza epidemic in the spring of 2016,
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the Taiwan Severe Influenza Research Consortium was established to survey the management strategies of distinct clinical domains, including the ventilation domain and fluid balance domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and conventional ICU severity score domain including APACHE II and PSI. Current machine learning (ML) models have enabled us to use all of the collected variables among the aforementioned clinical domains to develop an influenza-specific mortality prediction system, which has the potential to be incorporated into a healthcare information system as an automated decision support system (DSS).
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> However, the lack of intuitional understanding of ML models is one of the main obstacles in the implementation of ML in the medical field.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Herein, we employed an ML approach to illustrate the domain-specific feature importance, applied a visualised interpretation of the importance of each feature and compared the accuracy of different ML models using a nationwide severe influenza data set.
