<p>In conclusion, using a multicentre severe influenza data set, we found that the ML approach, particularly XGBoost, outperformed traditional severity scoring systems, including APACHE II and PSI, for predicting mortality among critically ill influenza patients. We used domain-based feature importance and SHAP plots for visualised realisation and these approaches should at least partly mitigate the concern of black-box issue. Future prospective research is warranted to validate the proposed model and to translate the advantages of ML models into improved patient outcomes through automated and real-time DSS.</p>
