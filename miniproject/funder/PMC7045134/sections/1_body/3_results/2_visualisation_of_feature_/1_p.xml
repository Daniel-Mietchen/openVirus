<p>To provide clinicians with a straightforward understanding of feature importance, we categorised the top 30 features by clinical domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). The cumulative feature importance of the fluid balance domain, ventilation domain, laboratory data domain, demographic and symptom domain, management domain and conventional severity score domain was 0.253, 0.113, 0.177, 0.140, 0.152 and 0.165, respectively. Moreover, to allow the visualised interpretation of the selected variables, we used SHAP to illustrate how these variables affect 30-day mortality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, the higher PSI and cumulative day-4 fluid balance were associated with a higher 30-day mortality, whereas a lower PaO2/FiO2 was associated with a higher 30-day mortality, in critically ill influenza patients. SHAP can also be used to illustrate the impact of an individual feature on 30-day mortality. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3A</xref>, PSI mainly contributed to high variable importance when PSI was higher than approximately 130, and this finding is consistent with previous studies on PSI. In line with the results of our previous study, a positive day-4 cumulative fluid balance appeared to be associated with a higher 30-day mortality, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>B.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Taken together, these data showed the feature importance in accordance with clinical domains and illustrated the importance of individual features by using SHAP plots so that physicians might have an intuitive understanding of feature importance.
