<p>A total of 336 patients with virology-proven influenza were enrolled, and 76 variables with complete data of these 336 patients were analysed. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises patientsâ€™ demographic characteristics and other relevant data. The median age of patients was 61 (IQR, 53 to 69) years, and 62.8% were men (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP3">online supplementary dataset</xref> for details). Given that the eight participating hospitals were all teaching hospitals, the enrolled patients had a high severity, including a high APACHE II score (22, IQR 17 to 29) and PSI score (118, IQR 88 to 151) as well as a low ratio of oxygen PaO2 to fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2 (fraction of inspired O2)) (107, IQR 65 to 159.2). To investigate factors associated with hospital mortality, we divided the 336 subjects into survivor and non-survivor groups according to mortality at 30 days. Compared with those in the survivor group, those in the non-survivor group were more likely to have a lower PaO2/FiO2 (85.9 vs 111.2, p&lt;0.01), higher PSI (146.5 vs 108, p&lt;0.01), APACHE II (28 vs 21, p&lt;0.01), serum C-reactive protein (16.3 vs 12.9 mg/dL, p=0.07), blood urea nitrogen (30 vs 20.8 mg/dL, p=0.01) and creatinine (1.5 vs 1.0 mg/dL, p=0.01) and were more likely to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (27.8% vs 12.5%, p&lt;0.01), haemodialysis (23.6% vs 7.2%, p&lt;0.01) and usage of steroid (60.8% vs 42.3%, p=0.01) (
