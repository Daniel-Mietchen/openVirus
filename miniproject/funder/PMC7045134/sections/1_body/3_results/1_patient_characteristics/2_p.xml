<p>Given that patients with severe influenza infection were characterised by oxygenation failure, as evidenced by the low PaO2/FiO2 and a high proportion (78.3%, 263/336) of ARDS, we specifically collected dynamic ventilator parameters and data regarding fluid status in this study (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Compared with those in the survivor group, those in the non-survivor group appeared to require a high FiO2, high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), high peak pressure (P
 <sub>peak</sub>), and a low tidal volume/predicted body weight (V
 <sub>T</sub>/PBW) and these trends tended to be apparent on day 3. The dynamic fluid data showed that a positive cumulative fluid balance on day 4 (3801.2±4128.8 vs 1347.3±3137.4 mL, p&lt;0.01) and on day 7 (4500.7±4997.8 vs 506.8±4385 mL, p&lt;0.01) was associated with high 30-day mortality (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). Taken together, these data highlight the critical role of dynamic ventilatory parameters and fluid status in critically ill influenza patients.
