<p>We then attempted to compare the performance of the three ML models to predict 30-day mortality using data within the first 7 days after admission to the ICU. Using ROC analysis, we found that the AUC value for predicting 30-day mortality in the XGBoost was 0.842 (95% CI 0.749 to 0.928), which was slightly higher than those in RF (AUC: 0.809, 95% CI 0.629 to 0.891) and much better than those in LR (AUC: 0.701; 95% CI 0.573 to 0.825) (

Furthermore, we used DeLong's test to determine the difference between two AUCs and confirmed that XGBoost outperformed RF and LR (XGBoost against RF, p=0.002; XGBoost against LR, p=0.003). Additionally, we examined the use of standard severity scores in the ICU, including APACHE II and PSI, to predict 30-day mortality in critically ill influenza patients, and the performance of APACHE II and PSI was 0.720 (95% CI 0.653 to 0.784) and 0.720 (95% CI 0.654 to 0.7897), respectively (

Collectively, these data demonstrated the value of XGBoost and SHAP plots for giving physicians an intuitive understanding of key features and for establishing a model that predicts the 30-day mortality of critically ill influenza patients with high accuracy.
