<p>A potential source of uncertainty in our study is the role of asymptomatic individuals in viral transmission. Duong et al. have shown that mosquitoes can be infected by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic children [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but key parameters such as their transmission rate to mosquitoes, the transmission rate to humans by mosquitoes infected by asymptomatic individuals and the asymptomatic infectious period, remain unknown. Since the study by Duong et al., asymptomatic transmission has been included in most recent transmission models for dengue as a reduced human-to-mosquito transmission rate arbitrarily fixed between 0% and 50% of the value for symptomatic individuals [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we assumed as a baseline that asymptomatic individuals do not transmit the infection; however, we run two alternative scenarios where asymptomatic transmission occurred as the symptomatic one and also at a relative transmission rate of 50% and we found that in both cases the relative reduction of DENV cases granted by ULV treatment would be similar (see
