<p>To improve the effectiveness of control, a larger area might be treated, but the trade-off between increasing effort and increasing benefits needs to be taken into account. We estimate that increasing the intervention radius to 300m around the triggering case would result in about 143 additionally avoided cases (an increase by 60%) compared to the current protocol but requires treating a total area that is 2.25 times larger. An alternative way to improve the current control strategy would be to target private gardens and/or indoor spaces. An increase in the proportion of killed mosquitoes from 40% to 60–70% would improve the overall effectiveness by a similar amount than that allowed by expanding the treated radius to 300m. A similar efficacy could also be achieved by increasing the frequency of treatment for confirmed cases from 60% (

Alternative approaches towards the reduction of DENV transmission might consider routine preventive interventions, rather than reactive ones, such as deploying larvicides in city areas with highest mosquito abundance [
