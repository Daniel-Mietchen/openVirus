<p>We did not consider the potential effect of treatment on mosquito capture data for the estimation of the mosquito population. This assumption was based on two observations: first, the limited capture rate of sticky traps, combined with the coarse (weekly) temporal resolution of captures and the small ULV-induced mosquito mortality, make it difficult to detect a significant effect of treatment on capture data (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006831.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for details); second, treatment at any given time included a very limited proportion of the study area, so that the expected effect on the total abundance in the area is marginal. As a proof, we re-computed the mosquito abundance by simulating treatments at the time and sites where they were actually administered during 2016, assuming an effectiveness œÅ = 40%; the maximum difference in the total mosquito population compared to the no-treatment scenario was less than 10% at all times.
