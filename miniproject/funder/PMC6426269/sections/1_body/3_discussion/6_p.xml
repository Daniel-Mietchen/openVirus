<p>In the absence of a safe vaccine for DENV in non-endemic settings, the prevention of dengue transmission will continue to rely on the management of mosquito populations. Quantifying how ULV mosquito control translates into a mitigation of the disease burden is a critical but still unanswered public health question [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This study provides a quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of ULV treatment in a non-endemic setting where dengue transmission has established only recently, based on recent insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dengue and on high-resolution entomological, population, clinical and treatment data. Our results can be used to support the design and implementation of future interventions in areas at the margins of the geographical range of DENV (e.g. in Southern Europe, USA, subtropical South America and Australia) which are undergoing a similar epidemiological transition, or are expected to do so in the next future.
