<p>Using a spatial stochastic model informed with geolocated capture data on 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> female adults and with previous estimates on the size of dengue clusters in Porto Alegre, we estimated the effectiveness of implemented control interventions in terms of the reduction of symptomatic dengue cases. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of ULV outdoor spraying on the reduction of DENV transmissibility has never been estimated using observational data in non-endemic areas [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A theoretical assessment of different containment procedures including adulticide spraying has been previously suggested [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while others [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] evaluated indoor spraying effectiveness in regions with high DENV circulation. We found that ULV insecticide spraying in public places avoided approximately one fourth of all secondary symptomatic DENV cases, corresponding to roughly 240 cases in an area of about 100km
 <sup>2</sup> over a full epidemic year. The performance of the intervention was negatively affected by the low estimated efficiency in killing existing mosquitoes in the treated area (about 40%). This value is compatible with field experiments showing that the majority of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> rest within households [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; furthermore, other studies measured the mortality of mosquitoes resting in sheltered locations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or in the vegetation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] at values between 30% and 50%, indicating a moderate effect of ULV treatment on mosquito populations.
