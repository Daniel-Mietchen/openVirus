<p>To face the emergence of DENV, an integrated surveillance and prevention protocol has been put in place that includes entomological, virological, and active epidemiological components [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The reactive control policies implemented to reduce DENV transmission consisted in ULV insecticide spraying in public spaces such as roads and parks (i.e., not indoor or in private gardens), within an area of radius 200m around the residence of the patient triggering the intervention. The decision to treat an area was made depending on lab-confirmation of a case through ELISA immunological tests, previous treatment in the same area, and availability of resources at the time of decision. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports the resulting observed frequency of treatment initiation for imported (

 </sub>) and locally transmitted (
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub>) cases, as classified by epidemiological investigations. Treatments were not systematic for confirmed cases because of limited resources, especially in cases when further transmission was not considered to be likely by public authorities, e.g. when a treatment had already been performed in the previous days in the same area.
