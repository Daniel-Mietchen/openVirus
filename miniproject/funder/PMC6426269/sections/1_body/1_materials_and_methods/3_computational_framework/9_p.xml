<p>We modeled interventions according to implemented control protocols: each symptomatic case had a probability of being lab-confirmed and, in such case, a probability to trigger vector control interventions after a delay since symptom onset Ï„, sampled from a Normal distribution, truncated to positive values. To reflect control protocols implemented in Porto Alegre, we assigned different probabilities of treatment to imported and autochthonous cases.</p>
