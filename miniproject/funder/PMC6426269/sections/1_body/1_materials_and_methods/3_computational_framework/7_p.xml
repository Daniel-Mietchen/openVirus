<p>The spatiotemporal DENV dynamics was implemented by considering a standard SEIR-SEI epidemiological model [

Marquez Toledo, personal communication, November 2017) and cross-serotype ecological interactions, we modelled infection independently of DENV serotype and we assumed that the human population was fully susceptible to the infection. Asymptomatic individuals were assumed to be unable to transmit the virus; however, in a sensitivity analysis we allowed for asymptomatic transmission with different rates [
