<p>To ensure the robustness of results, we simulated for each considered scenario 20,000 transmission clusters by sampling the index caseâ€™s coordinates (with probability proportional to the local population density) and time (uniformly between December 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016). For clusters with at least one secondary transmission, the cluster duration was defined as the number of days necessary for stochastic fadeout since symptom onset of the index case, and the cluster radius as the maximal distance between the location of the index case and all other cases in the cluster.</p>
