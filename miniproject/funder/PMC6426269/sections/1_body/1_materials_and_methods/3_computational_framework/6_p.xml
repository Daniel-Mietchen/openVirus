<p>When a treatment is initiated in any cell 
 <italic>i</italic>, the mosquito abundance of all cells within a distance 
 <italic>r</italic> (the radius of the ULV-treated area) from 
 <italic>i</italic> is rescaled by a factor 1-Δ
 <sub>ρ</sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>). This equation allows us to consider that: i) ULV treatment causes the sudden death of a proportion ρ of adult mosquitoes; ii) following ULV spraying, the mosquito population recovers as new adults emerge from pre-existing immature stages (which are not affected by adulticides), as well as from newly deposed eggs from surviving mosquitoes, as predicted by the entomological model.
