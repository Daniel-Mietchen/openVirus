<p>In Southern America, continental control efforts in the 1970s had come close to eliminate 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, the main vector mosquito, but in the last two decades arboviruses have strongly increased their circulation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] thanks to the intensification of international travels [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], international trade [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and urbanization [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to climatic adaptation of mosquitoes and viruses [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, DENV is expanding its geographic range to areas that were previously free from autochthonous transmission and are now prone to multiple outbreaks each year. A DENV vaccine has been recently licensed, with an overall efficacy of about 60% against its four serotypes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, after deployment in 10 different countries, increased hospitalization rates in children were reported, raising suspects that the currently available vaccine may predispose individuals who were seronegative before vaccination to ADE [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, modeling studies and the World Health Organization recommend the vaccine for high-transmission settings only where the proportion of seronegative vaccinees is very low [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In non-endemic settings, the main strategy for DENV control consists in the management of vector populations via insecticide spraying as a reactive intervention to ongoing local transmission. Despite its popularity, this practice has been rarely evaluated in terms of its impact on DENV transmission in real-life settings [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Such evaluation is made difficult by the inherently complex interactions between dynamics of mosquito populations, viral transmission and insecticide uptake in structured spaces and time-varying environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV transmission and control interventions typically occur over geographic scales of a few hundred meters [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], making it necessary to consider spatial heterogeneities explicitly and at a high resolution [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To estimate the effectiveness of insecticide spraying on DENV containment, we developed a novel mechanistic computational framework, coupling a model for mosquito population dynamics and a disease transmission model over a high-resolution spatial grid. Mechanistic models are widely used to study mosquito-borne pathogens such as DENV, for instance to investigate outbreaks in a previously unaffected area [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], assess vaccine effectiveness [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or to compare transmission of different viruses in the same area [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Many of the available models do not include explicitly the mosquito immature stages [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which need to be considered to accurately reproduce the dynamics of recovery of the vector population after adulticide treatment. Spatial transmission models are another common epidemiological tool that has been used to study DENV control in different parts of the world [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Here, we combine these approaches with recent insights on the spatiotemporal dynamics of DENV [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], to estimate the proportion of cases avoided by Ultra-Low-Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in Porto Alegre, a Brazilian metropolis characterized by a subtropical climate, low DENV incidence and negligible pre-existing immunity.
