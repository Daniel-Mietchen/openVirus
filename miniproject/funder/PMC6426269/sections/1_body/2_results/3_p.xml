<p>We found that the proportion of avoided DENV cases changes significantly when varying the radius of the treated area (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006831.g005">Fig 5A</xref>): from 10.6% (95%CI: 3.1–18.0%) with a radius of 100m to 37.1% (95%CI: 32–42.2%) for a radius of 300m and 50.0% (95%CI: 46.4–53.6%) with a radius of 500m. Treatment effectiveness improved when reducing the average delay after symptom onset to 5 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006831.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), with a proportion of avoided cases of 32.8% (95%CI: 27.2–38.3%), while increasing the average delay to 25 days would reduce the average effectiveness to 16.1% (95%CI: 9–23.2%). Changes in the proportion of mosquitoes killed by ULV resulted in proportional reductions of secondary symptomatic DENV cases, up to an average maximum of 52% (95%CI: 48.2–55.7%) when all existing mosquitoes are killed by treatment under current intervention protocols (
