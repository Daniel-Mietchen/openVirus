<p>In order to reproduce the observed distribution of cluster sizes in Porto Alegre [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the mortality of mosquitoes due to ULV treatment in public spaces was estimated at about 40% (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006831.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>), which is in good agreement with previous experimental estimates [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006831.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In absence of control interventions, our model estimated that the 76 clusters observed in the study area and period would have caused 1055 secondary symptomatic cases (95%CI: 995–1113), which, compared to the observed 815, implies that 240 cases (95%CI: 180–298) were avoided by the implemented protocols. The simulated average cluster size in absence of intervention was 11.9 (95%CI: 10.9–12.9) cases, with a peak of 32.1 (95%CI: 24.9–39.3) for importations occurring in the second week of January, falling to less than one for cases imported at the end of April (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006831.g003">Fig 3B</xref>); the difference in cluster size distributions was significant according to a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test p-value&lt;0.001. Treatment was most effective during the months of highest transmissibility, with a peak reduction of symptomatic cases by 38.0% (95%CI: 36.8–40.4%) for clusters initiated at the end of December.
