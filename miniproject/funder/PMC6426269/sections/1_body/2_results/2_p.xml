<p>Treatment reduced only marginally the average probability of symptomatic local transmission, i.e. the probability that an imported case caused at least one secondary symptomatic case. The estimated probability of symptomatic local transmission from our model, including treatments, was similar to previous estimates in Porto Alegre for 2016 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006831.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Treatment was responsible of an almost negligible reduction of the average outbreak duration (from 13.6 weeks, 95%CI: 13.5–13.7, without ULV spraying, to 13.1 weeks, 95%CI: 12.9–13.2) and of the average cluster radius (from 853m, 95%CI 827-878m, to 806m, 95%CI: 781-831m, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006831.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Outbreak duration and cluster radius were strongly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.62, p-value&lt;0.001, both with and without treatment).
