    <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based control strategies are undoubtedly promising tools for control of  
    <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transmitted viruses. However, the authors should discuss any potential issues that could arise with  
    <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based approaches in the future.

 <italic>&gt;&gt; It is important to consider the possible vector competence of other mosquito species and the possibility of Wolbachia/ virus evolution and lack of interference in this system. If that is the case, other strategies should be consider, as the use of other strains of Wolbachia to try to block virus transmission by that particular mosquito species. We have added this to the end of the discussion. “Lastly, it is important to consider the possible vector competence of other mosquito species and the possibility of Wolbachia/ virus evolution and lack of interference in this system. If that is the case, other strategies should be consider, as the use of other strains of Wolbachia to try to block virus transmission by that particular mosquito species. Integration of complementary strategies are the best solution for arbovirus control.”</italic>
