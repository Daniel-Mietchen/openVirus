<p>Saliva from both groups of infected mosquitoes were collected at 14 dpf. Individual saliva samples (WT or 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel +) were injected into eight naïve (WT) mosquitoes (bars) and, after five days, these injected mosquitoes were analyzed. (

 <italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with human virus. (

 <italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with primate virus. Values below each bar depicts the viral load of each mosquito head and thorax which donated that saliva. Positive mosquitoes were quantified through RT-qPCR and the grey-scale represents the number of YFV copies (0 to 10 
 <sup>6</sup> copies), per mosquito.
