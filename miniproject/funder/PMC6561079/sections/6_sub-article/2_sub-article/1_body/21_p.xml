   <p>What was the justification for using inoculation of mosquitoes and mice to demonstrate transmission? Why not a cell culture based system?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <italic>&gt;&gt; We have tested, in the past, individual saliva samples into cell culture and we were not able to have successful viral growth. Therefore, we have chosen to use these indirect methods (mosquito or mice) to show that the virus was indeed infectious. If the mosquito or mouse became infected it is a good sign that the saliva contained active and infectious virus.</italic>

   <p>In terms of the mice, is there evidence that the strain used was highly susceptible to YFV infection? Why was this strain of mice used?</p>

 </list>
 <italic>&gt;&gt; In this study A129-/-SV129 strain of mice was used. The A129-/- mice strain was chosen based on the fact that they are deficient in important innate immune components, more specifically the type I interferons </italic>

 <italic> receptor. Type I Interferons ( IFN-α/β) plays a significant role in preventing viral replication and protecting against arboviral infections such as Zika, Dengue and Yellow fever viruses (1-5). They are the gold standard models to evaluate virus replication and therapeutical drugs due their elevated susceptibility to infection. </italic>
