<p>Another interesting fact of this work was the increase in viral load observed after the second blood feeding in WT mosquitoes. This same fact was not observed in 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + mosquitoes. This shows that the blocking ability of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> persists even after the addition of extra blood nutrients (through a second blood meal) and that its blocking effect occurs within 7 days after infection. The reason to include the second blood meal was that antibodies to YFV could be present in the blood and therefore, promote negative effect towards the virus in WT mosquitoes, but this was not the case. Caragata 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) 
 <sup>45</sup> studied the effect of cholesterol towards the Drosophila C virus. This mechanism could be present in our experimental mosquitoes, but further studies on this aspect should be developed.
