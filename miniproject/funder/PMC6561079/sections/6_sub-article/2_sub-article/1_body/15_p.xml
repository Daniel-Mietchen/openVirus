 <sup>18</sup> with modifications. Images were obtained using an Olympus microscope model BX51 with DP72 camera and DP-2BSW software. Viral molecular confirmation was performed using RNA extracted from the culture supernatant of each isolate, followed by amplification of the genetic material as described below in the viral detection section according to Domingo 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2012 
 <sup>19</sup>. For mosquito infections, the YFV isolates were replicated in C636 cells ( 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) cultured in Leibovitz 15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) for 5 days at 28°C. Viral load was confirmed by RT-qPCR and later through plaque assays (PFU) in VERO cells (CCL81) grown in DMEM medium (Gibco) and 3% Carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma) supplemented with 2% FBS (Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO
