   <p>In the last sentence, what does the significance level refer to?</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <italic>&gt;&gt; the level of significance was added for all pairwise comparisons in the legend text.</italic>

  <list-item>
   <p>Was this absolute or relative quantification of YFV RNA? Clarify.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <italic>&gt;&gt; as stated on the legend title both the Wolbachia as well as the YFV were done via absolute quantification.</italic>

   <p>Results: The number of saliva samples from WT and wMel+ was 8 for each of the viruses (primate and human). Why was such a relatively low number (especially of the WT) of saliva samples tested? In Figure 3, there was a much larger number of mosquitoes tested. Was transmission not attempted with these mosquitoes? The number of saliva samples tested really was very low compared to what could and should have been tested (especially by mosquito injection, where there shouldn’t really be any limitation to the number of samples processed).</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
 <italic>&gt;&gt; Each saliva sample was collected and processed individually. Each saliva sample was injected into up to 8 naïve mosquitoes. This clearly show how sample numbers are multiplied (up to 64 for each group). It was merely the question of numbers and trying to lower the costs.</italic>
