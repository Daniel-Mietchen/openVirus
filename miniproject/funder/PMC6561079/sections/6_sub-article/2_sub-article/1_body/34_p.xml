   <p>Were only the head and thorax of YFV-infected mosquitoes tested for  
    <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density? One would think not, given they are  
    <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected. Clarify.

 <italic>&gt;&gt; The same samples that were used to evaluate the infection were also tested for Wolbachia quantification in the multiplex assay. The analysis of the results was done by targeting the gene of interest. In this way, it generated the graph 3A for the quantification of Wolbachia in the analyzed tissue that was head and thorax. As Wolbachia is present in practically all mosquito tissues, these analyses are possible.</italic>
