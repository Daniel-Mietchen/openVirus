<p>A fraction (1/20) of the total isolated RNA was used in the reactions. Head and thorax samples from YFV-challenged mosquitoes were analyzed in duplicate through RT-qPCR and viral and 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> quantification were performed in comparison with serial dilution of a standard curve of the respective genes cloned into the pGEMT plasmid (Promega) 
 <sup>16,27</sup>. Therefore, it was possible to calculate the number of copies per tissue. As a mosquito control gene we used the RPS 17S sequence of
