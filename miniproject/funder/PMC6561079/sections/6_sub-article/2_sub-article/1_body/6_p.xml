 <bold>Background</bold>: Yellow fever outbreaks have re-emerged in Brazil during 2016-18, with mortality rates up to 30%. Although urban transmission has not been reported since 1942, the risk of re-urbanization of yellow fever is significant, as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is present in most tropical and sub-tropical cities in the World and used to be the main vector in the past. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply. The introgression of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria into 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations is being trialed in several countries ( 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmosquito.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldmosquito.org</ext-link>) as a biocontrol method against dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Here, we studied the ability of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to reduce the transmission potential of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for yellow fever virus (YFV).
