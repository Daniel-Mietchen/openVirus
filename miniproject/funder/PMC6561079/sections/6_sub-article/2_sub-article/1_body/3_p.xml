 <italic>Â The reason why we have not performed the experiment by feeding infected mosquitoes directly on the mice was because we had no biosafety approval to perform these experiments. Therefore, the saliva samples had to be transported to another institution (UFMG), where the mice were located, and then used there.</italic>
