<p>The deployment of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transinfected with the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a highly promising strategy for suppressing the transmission of a number of globally important arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. In the current manuscript, the authors conducted laboratory-based experiments to assess the ability of the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to inhibit the transmission potential of two outbreak strains of yellow fever virus by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. As has been demonstrated with other flaviviruses in numerous similar studies, 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel inhibited replication and subsequent transmission when compared with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-negative mosquitoes. This is a relatively well written manuscript describing experiments with outcomes of interest to readers of Gates Open Research. However, there are some components of the manuscript that need to be clarified and/or justified.
