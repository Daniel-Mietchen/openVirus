  <title>Indirect evaluation of yellow fever virus (YFV) transmission through mosquito saliva.</title>
  <p>Saliva from both groups of infected mosquitoes were collected at 14 dpf. Individual saliva samples (WT or 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel +) were analyzed into eight na√Øve (WT) mosquitoes (bars) and, after five days, these injected mosquitoes were analyzed. ( 
   <bold>A</bold>) Mosquitoes injected with mosquito saliva or ( 
   <bold>B</bold>) 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with human virus. ( 
   <bold>C</bold>) Mosquitoes injected with WT mosquito saliva or ( 
   <bold>D</bold>) 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with primate virus. Values below each bar depicts the viral load of each mosquito head and thorax which donated that saliva. Positive mosquitoes were quantified through RT-qPCR and the grey-scale represents the number of YFV copies (0 to 10 
   <sup>6</sup> copies), per mosquito.
