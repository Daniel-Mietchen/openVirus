  <title>Saliva from 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive mosquitoes lose its capacity to transmit yellow fever virus

  <p>A129 
   <sup>-/- </sup>mice were inoculated with 1 × 10 
   <sup>4 </sup>PFU of YFV primate (empty blue circles) and human YFV (empty red circles) or with a pool of saliva from wild tipe (WT) YFV primate (full blue circles), WT YFV human (full red circles), 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive ( 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel +) YFV primate (empty blue squares) and 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive YFV human (empty red squares) previously infected with YFV via intraplantar route (50 μl/paw). Control mice (MOCK group) received 50 μl of PBS solution (empty black circle). ( 
   <bold>A</bold>) Body weight analysis shown as body weight (g) of mice. ( 
   <bold>B</bold>) Paw volume measured daily and shown as swelling (mm 
   <sup>2</sup>). On day 4 post-infection mice were euthanized and the following analysis performed. ( 
   <bold>C–D</bold>) Total and differential leukocyte counts in the blood. ( 
   <bold>E–H</bold>) Viable viral loads recovered from paw ( 
   <bold>E</bold>), spleen ( 
   <bold>F</bold>), liver ( 
   <bold>G</bold>) and brain ( 
   <bold>H</bold>) by plaque assay in Vero cells. Results are shown as Log PFU/g of tissue. ( 
   <bold>I–K</bold>) Viral RNA copies recovered from popliteal lymph node ( 
   <bold>I</bold>), liver ( 
   <bold>J</bold>) and spleen ( 
   <bold>K</bold>) by RT-qPCR. Data was presented as mean±SEM or median (n=4 mice for MOCK, n=6 mice for WT P, 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel + P, WT H and 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel + H groups and n=4 for YFV P and YFV H, one-way anova).
