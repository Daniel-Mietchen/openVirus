 <italic>    &gt;&gt; Mosquito saliva is a very complex concoction of mixture of proteins (&gt;100 proteins), which exerts several functions in the host by circumventing, for example, vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, coagulation, and inflammation or host hemostasis. Several works in literature have shown that mosquito saliva by itself exerts profound effects on mouse and human immune systems. For example, Vogt and colleagues (2018), using a humanized mice model, have shown that mosquito saliva alters several human blood leukocytes populations such as hematopoietic, NK, NKT, B and myeloid cells. However, the isolate and specific effect of mosquito saliva in modulating blood leukocyte counts was not observed in our work. This finding leads us to believe that wolbachia infection could be associated with such blood leukocyte counts increase. However, when we look closely at the results, we observe that the increase in blood leukocyte counts in mice that received saliva of wMel mosquitoes occurred especially (statistically significant) only upon exposure to human YFV isolate but not after the primate YFV strain inoculation (Fig 5C, 5D). These results suggest that the leukocyte increase observed in the wMel hYFV group was probably due to an interaction between the wolbachia-infected saliva and the human viral isolate in comparison to mice that received the YFV isolate from primates. However, the mechanisms underlying these findings require further investigation. </italic>
