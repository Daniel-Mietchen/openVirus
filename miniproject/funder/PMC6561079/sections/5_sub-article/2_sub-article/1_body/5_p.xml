<p>Viral load was analyzed at 7, 14 and 21 days post feeding (dpf), via RT-qPCR and the number of mosquitoes analyzed per group are presented in figures 3B, C and D, ranging from 17 to 20. Additionally, a subset of mosquitoes (at 7dpf) received an extra blood meal and were collected at 14dpf, when 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and viral load was determined. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density was analyzed on mosquitoes from the three time-points as follows: 40 mosquitoes on 7 dpf, 39 mosquitoes on 14 dpf and 38 mosquitoes after 21 dpf.
