<p>- Similarly, it is important to clarify the design and data presentation of the transmission assays in mosquitoes. For example, it is not clear if each bar on Figure 4 represents the data combination of 8 mosquitoes injected with the same saliva of a given mosquito (1 x 8 x 8) or if it is the data collected from an individual mosquito injected with the saliva of a given individual mosquito (1 x 1 x 8). This may also cause confusion when interpreting this figure as the Y-axis labels refer to “infected mosquitoes per saliva” while the subtitles refer to “the number of YFV copies…per mosquito”. Additionally, the authors should check the position of the graphs on the right (A and C) and left (B and D) panels as they seem not to match their respective description in the subtitles.</p>
