<p>- Because the WT mosquito population used in this work presented a relatively low vector competence to YFV, on page 10 (Discussion, second column) the authors infer this phenotype as a representation of Brazilian  
 <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>populations. While this is a plausible hypothesis, I would suggest the authors to be more cautious with this statement as vector competence to YFV of many other  
 <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>populations must be tested before one assumes this fact.
