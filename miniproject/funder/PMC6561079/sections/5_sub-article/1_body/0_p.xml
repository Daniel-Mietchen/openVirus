<p>This a very elegant manuscript provided by Rocha and colleagues reporting the effect Wolbachia on yellow fever virus (YFV) transmission by  
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. For testing this, the authors use an already well-known and -established  
 <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>line carrying Wolbachia (wMel mosquitoes) to evaluate its competence for two closely related YFV isolates, one from humans and another from primates. Finally, the efficacy of the wMel  
 <italic>Ae. aegypti </italic>strain to block YFV transmission is tested by assessing the number of infectious viral particles in the mosquito saliva by two independent methods: 1) intrathoracic inoculation of mosquitoes or 2) paw inoculation of immune-deficient mice with the saliva of either WT or wMel YFV-infected mosquitoes. Clearly, Wolbachia has a potent effect against YFV, reducing both the infection level of YFV in the mosquito body and the rate of YFV-infected mosquitoes when comparing wMel mosquitoes orally exposed to YFV to their respective WT control mosquitoes. More strikingly, the wMel strain is shown to be unable to transmit YFV by the two indirect transmission assays carried out by the authors. Suggestions and comments are presented below with the intention to improve the manuscript, especially the clarity and accuracy of the methods/design and data presentation.
