<p>Recent studies have shown that anthropophilic mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus,</italic> as well as Brazilian enzootic mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes albiprivus,</italic> were highly susceptible to American and African YFV strains

 </sup>. Therefore, the possible resurgence of urban epidemics of YFV in South America has to be constantly monitored by public health authorities

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes using insecticides has been a mainstay of vector-borne disease control methods for decades but is undermined by widespread insecticide resistance. A promising innovative strategy, based on a bacterium called 
 <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>, has been trialed in many countries. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a maternally transmitted bacterial endosymbiont and is naturally present in at least 40% of all insect species

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> as a self-sustaining disease control agent on the basis that
