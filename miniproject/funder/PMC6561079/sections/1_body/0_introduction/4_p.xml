<p>Here, we studied the ability of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to suppress YFV infectivity in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Two virus isolates were used: one from a human clinical sample and another one of primate origin. We found that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> had a major impact on virus replication in mosquitoes, as well as reduced the potential of YFV transmission via saliva, as indirectly determined via mosquitoes or a mouse model.
