 </sup>. Monkeys are important reservoirs of YFV in sylvan environments. Encroachment by humans into environments where competent mosquito vectors and infected monkeys co-exist is the commonest reason for spillover of YFV transmission to human populations. Although the last reported cases of urban transmission in Brazil occurred in 1942, in 2016–2017, the country faced major outbreaks of the disease mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, the epidemic also extended to São Paulo State

 </sup>. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, from July 2017 to April 2018, there were 1,127 YFV cases with 328 deaths, with no evidence of urban transmission. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply
