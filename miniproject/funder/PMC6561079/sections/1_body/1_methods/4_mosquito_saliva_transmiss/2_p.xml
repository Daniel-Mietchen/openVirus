 <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were conducted using type I interferon receptor deficient mice (A129 
 <sup>−/−</sup>), SV129 background. A129 
 <sup>-/- </sup>originally from 
 <italic>The Jackson Laboratories</italic> (reference 010830) were obtained from Biotério de Matrizes da Universidade de São Paulo (USP) and kept under specific pathogen-free conditions at Immunopharmacology Lab at UFMG. Mice were housed in filtered-cages of 28x13x16 cm with autoclaved food and water available ad libitum on ventilated shelves (Alesco). A maximum of 4 mice were kept per cage. Mice were housed under standard conditions with controlled temperature (18–23 degrees) humidity (40–60%) and 12/12h dark light cycle. Sample sizes for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were determined using the G*Power 3.1 software package. In each experiment we used 4 mice on YFV377H or YFV127P groups and 6 mice per group on saliva YFV 377H or 127P infected mosquitoes (WT or 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel+) groups. Mice from the same litter were added to either mock- or YFV infected groups, or test or control groups as appropriate. No randomization protocol was utilized. For most of the experiments, no blinding was involved except for body weight and hind paw swelling analysis. Bioanalysis from viral loads and cell count assay experiments was blinded. Groups were divided by codenames on the day of euthanasia. Different researchers performed the euthanasia or analyzed the data. Each experiment was replicated twice and all attempts at replication were successful. For the experiments, adult A129 
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (7 to 9 weeks old, 20-22g) were inoculated with 1 × 10 
 <sup>4</sup> PFU with either YFV377H or YFV127P viruses’ strains or with a pool of saliva samples (n=2) either from the WT or 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel+ groups via subcutaneous (intraplantar) route/50μl paw (right hind paw). Morbidity parameters such as body weight loss, total and differential counts of blood leukocytes and paw edema were evaluated daily. Total cell counts were carried out in Trypan blue-stained cells in a Neubauer chamber and differential cell counts on blood smears stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa using standard morphological criteria. Paw edema was assessed by measuring paw swelling using a pachymeter. Finally, viable viral loads and viral RNA were analyzed in plasma and different tissues of mice upon saliva inoculation, as shown below.
