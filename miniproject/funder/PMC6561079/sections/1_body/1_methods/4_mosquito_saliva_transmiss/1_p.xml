<p>In order to check the ability of mosquitoes to transmit the virus, saliva samples from infected mosquitoes were individually collected at 14 dpf. After removal of legs and wings, mosquitoes had their proboscis introduced into 10 μL tips, containing 50% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 30% sugar solution and allowed to salivate for 30 minutes. Mosquitoes and solution containing the saliva were stored at -70°C until RNA extraction of the heads/thoraces and/or nanoinjection of the saliva into naive mosquitoes (WT). Individual saliva samples were injected into WT mosquitoes, after 2 to 4 days of emergence. Each mosquito received 276 nL and were kept for 5 days before whole body RNA extraction, followed by RT-qPCR. Usually, with one saliva sample it is possible to inject 15 mosquitoes, but due mortality, 8 mosquitoes were analyzed from each nanoinjected saliva sample.</p>
