<p>Template was amplified with end point PCR to increase template concentration following the Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit recommendation and PCR products were cleaned-up using AmpureXP purification beads (Beckman Coulter). Emulsion PCR was performed to amplify the library using Ion PGM™ Hi-Q™ View OT2 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Ion OneTouch 2 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ion Sphere particles (ISPs) were enriched using the Ion OneTouch ES (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Enriched ISPs were sequenced using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) and the Ion PGM Hi-Q Sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with the Ion 314 chip. All procedures above followed manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
