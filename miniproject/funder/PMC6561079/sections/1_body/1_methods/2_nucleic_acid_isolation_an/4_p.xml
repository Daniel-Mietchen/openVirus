<p>Consensus genome sequences from fastq file were produced by alignment of two-direction reads by using a reference YFV genome. Quality control on raw sequence data have been performed using FastQC

  <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup>. Bowtie 2 was used for mapping reads to a reference using Galaxy 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
 </sup>. Only positions with ≥ 20× genome coverage were used to produce consensus sequences. Regions with lower coverage and those in primer-binding regions were masked with N characters.
