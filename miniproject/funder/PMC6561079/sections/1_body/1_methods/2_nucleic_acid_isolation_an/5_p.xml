<p>In order to identify the origin of the YFV genome from the samples, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis using the newly two nucleotide sequences recovered in this study plus 125 reference YFV complete genome sequences from each different genotype (South American I n=84; South American II n=2; West African n=23; East African n=16) already published in peer-reviewed journals, for which sampling year and geographic location is available. Full details of the reference sequences used are provided in Extended data:
