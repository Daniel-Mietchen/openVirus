 </sup>, was applied to both RT-qPCR-positive samples. For these samples, extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using GoScript™ Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer priming. Whole-genome amplification by multiplex PCR was attempted using GoTaq® qPCR Master Mix (Promega), the 500bp sequencing primer scheme and 35 cycles using the adapted protocol
