<p>Wild type 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected in the neighborhood of Urca, Rio de Janeiro-RJ, Brazil in 2018 were reared in the laboratory for five generations and confirmed for the absence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (WT). 
 <italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Mel strain-containing mosquitoes ( 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel +) were obtained from the colony maintained by the World Mosquito Program (WMP) Brazil laboratories in Belo Horizonte, which is backcrossed every five generations with Urca male mosquitoes. They were reared in a controlled environment at 27 ± 2°C and 60 ± 10% relative humidity. Four to six days-old female mosquitoes were starved for 20 to 24 hours and subsequently offered YFV virus culture supernatant mixed with washed human red blood cells (RBCs) (2:1 ratio). The viral titer offered to mosquitoes was 4 × 10 
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL for YFV377H and 1.4 × 10 
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL for YFV127P. RBCs were washed three times for removal of potential YFV vaccine antibodies. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for one hour and then, engorged females were selected and maintained in triple containment, under BSL-2 conditions. Sucrose solution (10%) was offered 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> during the extrinsic incubation period. Viral load was analyzed at 7, 14 and 21 days post feeding (dpf), via RT-qPCR and number of mosquitoes analyzed per group were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3B, C and D</xref> and ranged from 17 to 20. Additionally, a subset of mosquitoes (at 7dpf) received an extra blood meal and were collected at 14dpf, when 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and viral load was determined. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density was analyzed in the three time-points, being 40 mosquitoes at 7dpf, 39 at 14dpf and 38 mosquitoes after 21dpf. The blood used in the infective feedings was obtained from a blood bank (Hemominas) through an agreement signed between both institutions (OF.GPO/CCO-Nr224/16). As a laboratory routine each blood bag is previously tested for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, mayaro and yellow fever, through RT-qPCR to rule out any cross-infection that could interfere with the results.
