<p>The first sample named M377_IV|Human|MinasGerais_PadreParaíso|2017-02-04 (YFV377H) was isolated from human serum, positive for YFV by RT-qPCR (CT = 28.95) in February, 2017 from Padre Paraíso city (northeast of Minas Gerais state). The other sample named M127_IV|Primate|MinasGerais_NovaLima|2018-01-15 (YFV127P) was isolated from the liver of a non-human primate found dead in January 2018, in Nova Lima city, in the center-south of Minas Gerais state, positive for YF via RT-qPCR (CT = 17.19). Sequencing of both isolates was performed and is described below. Viral isolation was confirmed by two methodologies: indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and RT-qPCR. IFA was performed with a monoclonal YFV antibody donated by Evandro Chagas Institute (Arbovirology and Hemorrhagic Fevers Section) and conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein FITC (MP Biomedicals) according to Adungo

 </sup> with modifications. Images were obtained using an Olympus microscope model BX51 with DP72 camera and DP-2BSW software. Viral molecular confirmation was performed using RNA extracted from the culture supernatant of each isolate, followed by amplification of the genetic material as described below in the viral detection section according to Domingo

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) cultured in Leibovitz 15 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco) for 5 days at 28°C. Viral load was confirmed by RT-qPCR and later through plaque assays (PFU) in VERO cells (CCL81) grown in DMEM medium (Gibco) and 3% Carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma) supplemented with 2% FBS (Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO
