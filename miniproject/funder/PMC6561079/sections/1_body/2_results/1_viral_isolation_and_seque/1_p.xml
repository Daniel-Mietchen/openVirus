<p>Two plasma samples (one human and one from a non-human primate) were isolated from the diagnostic service of Fundação Ezequiel Dias, the State Reference Laboratory of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Viral isolation was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), showing the typical signal of fluorescence for both isolates ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Both samples were successfully sequenced with PGM (Personal Genome Machine) technology with adapted overlapping multiplex PCR protocol, as shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolates obtained from the two samples (M377_IV and M127_IV) belonged to the South American genotype I and clustered closely with strong bootstrap support (&gt;90%) with the recent sequences, isolated in Minas Gerais, from the current outbreak (
