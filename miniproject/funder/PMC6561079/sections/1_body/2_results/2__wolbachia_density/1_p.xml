<p>Absolute quantification of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in mosquitoes were analyzed in the heads and thoraces of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive mosquitoes ( 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel +) after challenge with YFV. There was no difference in 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density among heads and thoraces, collected at 7 or 14 days post feeding (dpf), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>. However, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density presented a slight reduction at 21dpf, which was statistically significant in relation to 14dpf ( 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0062, Mann Whitney). The median at 14dpf was 2.04 × 10 
 <sup>6</sup> copies per head/thorax whereas at 21dpf, it decreased to 1.37 × 10 
 <sup>6</sup>.
