<p>In mosquitoes without 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (WT) the prevalence of YFV infection of heads and thoraces was 30–45% at 7dpf, and 80–89% at 14dpf. For those mosquitoes that received a 2 
 <sup>nd</sup> blood meal, the prevalence was 89 to 94% at 14dpf and 85 to 100% at 21dpf. There was no significant difference between infection rates resulting from the human or primate virus isolates ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). In heads and thoraces of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive mosquitoes ( 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel +) the infection rate ranged from 0 to 15% at 7dpf, 11 to 16% at 14dpf, 20 to 32% at 14dpf when mosquitoes received a second blood meal, and 20 to 25% at 21dpf ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Again, there was no major difference between viral isolates.
