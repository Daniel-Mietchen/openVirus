<p>The infection rate observed at 7dpf was low for both viral isolates ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). At day 7, the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was already associated with a marked decrease in viral titers in mosquitoes ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). At 14dpf, there was a significant increase in the number of viral copies in WT mosquitoes ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Further increase on viral load was observed when mosquitoes received a second blood meal 7 days after the infective meal and were analyzed at 14 dpf. This increase was statistically significant for both isolates ( 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.01, Mann Whitney). This may have been due to the fact that the second blood supplied extra important nutrients for viral replication. At 21dpf, the infection reached 100% for the human isolate with a median of 3.15 × 10 
 <sup>7</sup> viral copies. For the primate isolate, although the infection rate was lower (85%), the viral load was higher with a median of 5.61 × 10 
 <sup>7</sup> viral copies per head/thoraces. Regardless of the strain of virus used, viral loads were remarkable lower in presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> at all time points ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). In addition, there was no increase in viral load in 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + mosquitoes after supplying a second blood meal ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>).
