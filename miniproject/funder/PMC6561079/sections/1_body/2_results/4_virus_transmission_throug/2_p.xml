<p>Similar experiments were performed by injecting saliva samples from either the WT or

 </sup>. Results showed that there was no major impact on clinical and laboratory parameters, which is consistent with the relatively low number of viable virus injected ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). However, there were viable viruses, as assessed by plaque assay, recovered from the paw of mice inoculated with saliva from WT mosquitoes. Indeed, there was culturable virus when both P (primate) and H (human) strains were used. In contrast, none of the samples from the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + groups were positive on the plaque assay ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). Consistently with the mosquito saliva findings above, there were higher number of viral RNA copies in draining lymphnode and liver from mice injected with WT saliva than mice inoculated with 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + saliva ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5 I–K</xref>). Virus isolated from the primate (YFV127P) showed greater presence in liver while the human strain (YFV377H) was more localized at the lymphoid tissue (
