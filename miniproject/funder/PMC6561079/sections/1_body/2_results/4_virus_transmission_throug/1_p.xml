<p>Next, we evaluated the ability of orally infected mosquitoes to transmit the virus. We first collected saliva from infected mosquitoes at 14 dpf, from both groups of mosquitoes and virus isolates. We then injected a number of saliva samples into eight naïve (WT) mosquitoes and, after five days, we checked whether those mosquitoes became infected through RT-qPCR, demonstrating that a particular saliva was infectious. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, when saliva samples originated from 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + mosquitoes, no mosquitoes became infected. This assay shows, indirectly, the potential of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to completely abrogate YFV transmission potential of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Nevertheless, saliva originating from WT mosquitoes was able to infect 20% of the naïve-injected mosquitoes.
