<p>In the present study, the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in mosquitoes greatly reduced YFV infection, except for 7dpf, when the infection rate was low in all groups. Further effect of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> towards YFV was verified when individually collected mosquito saliva was injected into na√Øve mosquitoes or into a susceptible mice strain and their infectivity was analyzed. This first technique has been widely used by our group and others

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive mosquitoes, there was no infection in any injected mosquito. Through projection of these results into natural conditions, the YFV transmission could be greatly reduced, as previously modeled for
