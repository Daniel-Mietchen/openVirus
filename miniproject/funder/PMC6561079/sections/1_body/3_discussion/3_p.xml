<p>The blocking ability conferred by

 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup>, the density of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was constant at 7 or 14 days after virus exposure. However, there was a reduction of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel + density at 21dpf, which did not impact the blocking ability towards the virus ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The variation on the density (or titer) of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> within the host has been previously observed, which could be related to the aging of the host
