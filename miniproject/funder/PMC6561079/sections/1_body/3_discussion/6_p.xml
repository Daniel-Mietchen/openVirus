<p>Interestingly, in our experiments, the overall infectivity in mosquitoes was not high, even in control (no 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>) mosquitoes. This shows the reduced vector competence of natural Brazilian 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, which could explain why most of the cases reported on the recent outbreaks in Brazil were in proximity to green areas of parks and forests, where natural YFV mosquito vectors such as 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> are easily found
