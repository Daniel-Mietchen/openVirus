<p>The ability of

 <italic>w</italic>Mel was able to significantly reduce the infectivity of YFV to mosquitoes, independently of the source of the virus (both human and primate). Previously, it has been shown that two strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> ( 
 <italic>w</italic>MelPop and 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel) were able to significantly reduce YFV mosquito infection, although with virus isolated from human cases from Nigeria and Bolivia, in 1987 and 1999, respectively

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> ( 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel strain) towards two recently isolated 
 <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic>, originating from the 2017–2018 outbreaks in Brazil. The 
 <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> isolates used here have different origins, one originating from a non-human primate found in the city of Nova Lima and another originated from a human case in the city of Padre Paraíso, both in the state of Minas Gerais. Although these cities are located more than 500 km apart, they belong to the same genotype. Besides working with recently isolated virus from human and primate sources, the difference in the present study refers to the way in which this population of mosquitoes have been infected. Furthermore, this study was performed with orally infected mosquitoes, which is closer to natural conditions, in comparison to the previous study which infected mosquitoes through thorax injection, in order to improve mosquito infection
