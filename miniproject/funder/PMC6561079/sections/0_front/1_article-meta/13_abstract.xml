  <bold>Background</bold>: Yellow fever outbreaks have re-emerged in Brazil during 2016-18, with mortality rates up to 30%. Although urban transmission has not been reported since 1942, the risk of re-urbanization of yellow fever is significant, as 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is present in most tropical and sub-tropical cities in the World and still remains the main vector of urban YFV. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply. The introgression of 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria into 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations is being trialed in several countries ( 
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmosquito.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.worldmosquito.org</ext-link>) as a biocontrol method against dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Here, we studied the ability of 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to reduce the transmission potential of 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for 
  <italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> Two recently isolated YFV (primate and human) were used to challenge field-derived wild-type and 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected ( 
  <italic>w</italic>Mel +) 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The YFV infection status was followed for 7, 14 and 21 days post-oral feeding (dpf). The YFV transmission potential of mosquitoes was evaluated via nano-injection of saliva into uninfected mosquitoes or by inoculation in mice.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Results:</bold> We found that 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was able to significantly reduce the prevalence of mosquitoes with YFV infected heads and thoraces for both viral isolates. Furthermore, analyses of mosquito saliva, through indirect injection into na√Øve mosquitoes or via interferon-deficient mouse model, indicated 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was associated with profound reduction in the YFV transmission potential of mosquitoes (14dpf).
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> introgression could be used as a complementary strategy for prevention of urban yellow fever transmission, along with the human vaccination program.
