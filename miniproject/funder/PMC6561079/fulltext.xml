<bold>Background</bold>: Yellow fever outbreaks have re-emerged in Brazil during 2016-18, with mortality rates up to 30%. Although urban transmission has not been reported since 1942, the risk of re-urbanization of yellow fever is significant, as
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is present in most tropical and sub-tropical cities in the World and still remains the main vector of urban YFV. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply. The introgression of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria into
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations is being trialed in several countries (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmosquito.org">www.worldmosquito.org</ext-link>) as a biocontrol method against dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Here, we studied the ability of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to reduce the transmission potential of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for
<italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV).</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> Two recently isolated YFV (primate and human) were used to challenge field-derived wild-type and
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected (
<italic>w</italic>Mel +)
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The YFV infection status was followed for 7, 14 and 21 days post-oral feeding (dpf). The YFV transmission potential of mosquitoes was evaluated via nano-injection of saliva into uninfected mosquitoes or by inoculation in mice.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> We found that
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> was able to significantly reduce the prevalence of mosquitoes with YFV infected heads and thoraces for both viral isolates. Furthermore, analyses of mosquito saliva, through indirect injection into na&#x000ef;ve mosquitoes or via interferon-deficient mouse model, indicated
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> was associated with profound reduction in the YFV transmission potential of mosquitoes (14dpf).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> introgression could be used as a complementary strategy for prevention of urban yellow fever transmission, along with the human vaccination program.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Wolbachia</kwd><kwd>Aedes aegypti</kwd><kwd>Yellow fever virus</kwd><kwd>vector competence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322"><funding-source>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>INCT Dengue</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-3" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865"><funding-source>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</funding-source><award-id>OPP1140230</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-4"><funding-source>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Ezequiel Dias</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-5" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593"><funding-source>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-6" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004901"><funding-source>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-7"><funding-source>Brazilian Ministry of Health - DECIT</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Bill Melinda Gates Foundation through Monash University and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (DECIT) [OPP1140230].

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Most recently, the
<italic>Zika virus</italic> re-emerged in 2014, and unexpectedly caused serious congenital infections in pregnant women and Zika fetal syndrome in affected newborns in several American countries in 2016 and 2017
<sup><xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.
<italic>Chikungunya virus</italic> caused massive epidemics in the Americas in 2014 and still circulates in several countries
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>The
<italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> (YFV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and transmitted by sylvan mosquitoes of the genus
<italic>Haemagogus</italic> and
<italic>Sabethes</italic>, in South America and
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in urban settings
<sup><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Monkeys are important reservoirs of YFV in sylvan environments. Encroachment by humans into environments where competent mosquito vectors and infected monkeys co-exist is the commonest reason for spillover of YFV transmission to human populations. Although the last reported cases of urban transmission in Brazil occurred in 1942, in 2016&#x02013;2017, the country faced major outbreaks of the disease mainly in the states of Minas Gerais, Esp&#x000ed;rito Santo and Rio de Janeiro. In 2018, the epidemic also extended to S&#x000e3;o Paulo State
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, from July 2017 to April 2018, there were 1,127 YFV cases with 328 deaths, with no evidence of urban transmission. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that anthropophilic mosquitoes, such as
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and
<italic>Aedes albopictus,</italic> as well as Brazilian enzootic mosquitoes, such as
<italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> and
<italic>Sabethes albiprivus,</italic> were highly susceptible to American and African YFV strains
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the possible resurgence of urban epidemics of YFV in South America has to be constantly monitored by public health authorities
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Population control of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes using insecticides has been a mainstay of vector-borne disease control methods for decades but is undermined by widespread insecticide resistance. A promising innovative strategy, based on a bacterium called
<italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>, has been trialed in many countries.
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a maternally transmitted bacterial endosymbiont and is naturally present in at least 40% of all insect species
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The World Mosquito Program is deploying
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> as a self-sustaining disease control agent on the basis that
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> reduces the transmission potential of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for dengue
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, Zika
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and chikungunya viruses
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Here, we studied the ability of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to suppress YFV infectivity in
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Two virus isolates were used: one from a human clinical sample and another one of primate origin. We found that

The other sample named M127_IV|Primate|MinasGerais_NovaLima|2018-01-15 (YFV127P) was isolated from the liver of a non-human primate found dead in January 2018, in Nova Lima city, in the center-south of Minas Gerais state, positive for YF via RT-qPCR (CT = 17.19). Sequencing of both isolates was performed and is described below. Viral isolation was confirmed by two methodologies: indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and RT-qPCR. IFA was performed with a monoclonal YFV antibody donated by Evandro Chagas Institute (Arbovirology and Hemorrhagic Fevers Section) and conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with fluorescein FITC (MP Biomedicals) according to Adungo

<italic>Wolbachia</italic> (WT).
<italic>Wolbachia w</italic>Mel strain-containing mosquitoes (
<italic>w</italic>Mel +) were obtained from the colony maintained by the World Mosquito Program (WMP) Brazil laboratories in Belo Horizonte, which is backcrossed every five generations with Urca male mosquitoes. They were reared in a controlled environment at 27 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C and 60 &#x000b1; 10% relative humidity. Four to six days-old female mosquitoes were starved for 20 to 24 hours and subsequently offered YFV virus culture supernatant mixed with washed human red blood cells (RBCs) (2:1 ratio). The viral titer offered to mosquitoes was 4 &#x000d7; 10
<sup>5</sup> PFU/mL for YFV377H and 1.4 &#x000d7; 10
<sup>6</sup> PFU/mL for YFV127P. RBCs were washed three times for removal of potential YFV vaccine antibodies. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for one hour and then, engorged females were selected and maintained in triple containment, under BSL-2 conditions. Sucrose solution (10%) was offered
<italic>ad libitum</italic> during the extrinsic incubation period. Viral load was analyzed at 7, 14 and 21 days post feeding (dpf), via RT-qPCR and number of mosquitoes analyzed per group were presented in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3B, C and D</xref> and ranged from 17 to 20. Additionally, a subset of mosquitoes (at 7dpf) received an extra blood meal and were collected at 14dpf, when
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and viral load was determined.
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> density was analyzed in the three time-points, being 40 mosquitoes at 7dpf, 39 at 14dpf and 38 mosquitoes after 21dpf. The blood used in the infective feedings was obtained from a blood bank (Hemominas) through an agreement signed between both institutions (OF.GPO/CCO-Nr224/16). As a laboratory routine each blood bag is previously tested for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, mayaro and yellow fever, through RT-qPCR to rule out any cross-infection that could interfere with the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Mosquito saliva transmission assays</title><p>In order to check the ability of mosquitoes to transmit the virus, saliva samples from infected mosquitoes were individually collected at 14 dpf. After removal of legs and wings, mosquitoes had their proboscis introduced into 10 &#x003bc;L tips, containing 50% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Gibco) and 30% sugar solution and allowed to salivate for 30 minutes. Mosquitoes and solution containing the saliva were stored at -70&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction of the heads/thoraces and/or nanoinjection of the saliva into naive mosquitoes (WT). Individual saliva samples were injected into WT mosquitoes, after 2 to 4 days of emergence. Each mosquito received 276 nL and were kept for 5 days before whole body RNA extraction, followed by RT-qPCR. Usually, with one saliva sample it is possible to inject 15 mosquitoes, but due mortality, 8 mosquitoes were analyzed from each nanoinjected saliva sample.</p><p>
<italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were conducted using type I interferon receptor deficient mice (A129

Mice were housed in filtered-cages of 28x13x16 cm with autoclaved food and water available ad libitum on ventilated shelves (Alesco). A maximum of 4 mice were kept per cage. Mice were housed under standard conditions with controlled temperature (18&#x02013;23 degrees) humidity (40&#x02013;60%) and 12/12h dark light cycle. Sample sizes for
<italic>in vivo</italic> studies were determined using the G*Power 3.1 software package. In each experiment we used 4 mice on YFV377H or YFV127P groups and 6 mice per group on saliva YFV 377H or 127P infected mosquitoes (WT or
<italic>w</italic>Mel+) groups. Mice from the same litter were added to either mock- or YFV infected groups, or test or control groups as appropriate. No randomization protocol was utilized. For most of the experiments, no blinding was involved except for body weight and hind paw swelling analysis. Bioanalysis from viral loads and cell count assay experiments was blinded. Groups were divided by codenames on the day of euthanasia. Different researchers performed the euthanasia or analyzed the data. Each experiment was replicated twice and all attempts at replication were successful. For the experiments, adult A129
<sup>-/-</sup> mice (7 to 9 weeks old, 20-22g) were inoculated with 1 &#x000d7; 10

<italic>w</italic>Mel+ groups via subcutaneous (intraplantar) route/50&#x003bc;l paw (right hind paw). Morbidity parameters such as body weight loss, total and differential counts of blood leukocytes and paw edema were evaluated daily. Total cell counts were carried out in Trypan blue-stained cells in a Neubauer chamber and differential cell counts on blood smears stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa using standard morphological criteria. Paw edema was assessed by measuring paw swelling using a pachymeter. Finally, viable viral loads and viral RNA were analyzed in plasma and different tissues of mice upon saliva inoculation, as shown below.</p><p>All animal experiments involving YFV infection and
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> saliva inoculation were conducted following the ethical and animal welfare regulations of the Brazilian Government (law 11794/2008). The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee on Animal Ethics of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (CEUA/UFMG, permit protocol no. 84/2018). All surgeries were performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Studies with YFV were conducted under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment at Immunopharmacology Lab from Instituto de Ci&#x000ea;ncias Biol&#x000f3;gicas (ICB) at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.</p></sec><sec><title>Viral detection in mosquitoes and mice</title><p>Detection of viral RNA on infected mosquitoes and mice samples were performed through quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) using LightCycler&#x000ae; Multiplex RNA Virus Master (Roche), according to the previously published protocol

<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to reduce the susceptibility of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to disseminated arbovirus infection has been repeatedly demonstrated for dengue
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, Zika
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>, chikungunya
<sup><xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, West Nile
<sup><xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> and mayaro viruses
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. We have shown that
<italic>w</italic>Mel was able to significantly reduce the infectivity of YFV to mosquitoes, independently of the source of the virus (both human and primate). Previously, it has been shown that two strains of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> (
<italic>w</italic>MelPop and
<italic>w</italic>Mel) were able to significantly reduce YFV mosquito infection, although with virus isolated from human cases from Nigeria and Bolivia, in 1987 and 1999, respectively
<sup><xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Here we evaluated the effect of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> (
<italic>w</italic>Mel strain) towards two recently isolated
<italic>Yellow fever virus</italic>, originating from the 2017&#x02013;2018 outbreaks in Brazil. The
<italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> isolates used here have different origins, one originating from a non-human primate found in the city of Nova Lima and another originated from a human case in the city of Padre Para&#x000ed;so, both in the state of Minas Gerais. Although these cities are located more than 500 km apart, they belong to the same genotype. Besides working with recently isolated virus from human and primate sources, the difference in the present study refers to the way in which this population of mosquitoes have been infected. Furthermore, this study was performed with orally infected mosquitoes, which is closer to natural conditions, in comparison to the previous study which infected mosquitoes through thorax injection, in order to improve mosquito infection
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>.</p><p>The use of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> as an arbovirus control strategy has been developed by the not-for-profit initiative, the World Mosquito Program. The approach offers the prospect of a natural and sustainable method for arbovirus control
<sup><xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>. The impact towards reduction of arbovirus has been analyzed
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> and early indication of positive effect has been recently reported
<sup><xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. In Brazil, WMP is expanding its coverage into Rio de Janeiro and Niter&#x000f3;i municipalities and epidemiological studies in order to determine arbovirus reduction is underway.</p><p>The blocking ability conferred by
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> has been directly related to the density of the bacterium within main mosquito tissues such as midgut and/or salivary glands
<sup><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>, where viruses replicate to further produce infectious particles
<sup><xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. In our study, and as observed by Pereira
<italic>et al.,</italic> 2018
<sup><xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, the density of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> was constant at 7 or 14 days after virus exposure. However, there was a reduction of
<italic>w</italic>Mel + density at 21dpf, which did not impact the blocking ability towards the virus (
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). The variation on the density (or titer) of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> within the host has been previously observed, which could be related to the aging of the host
<sup><xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the presence of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> in mosquitoes greatly reduced YFV infection, except for 7dpf, when the infection rate was low in all groups. Further effect of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> towards YFV was verified when individually collected mosquito saliva was injected into na&#x000ef;ve mosquitoes or into a susceptible mice strain and their infectivity was analyzed. This first technique has been widely used by our group and others
<sup><xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>, and it is a robust proxy of the potential of individual saliva towards virus transmission. When the source of saliva came from
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive mosquitoes, there was no infection in any injected mosquito. Through projection of these results into natural conditions, the YFV transmission could be greatly reduced, as previously modeled for
<italic>Dengue virus</italic>
<sup><xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>.</p><p>Another interesting fact of this work was the increase in viral load observed after the second blood feeding in WT mosquitoes. This same fact was not observed in
<italic>w</italic>Mel + mosquitoes. This shows that the blocking ability of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> persists even after the addition of extra blood nutrients (through a second blood meal) and that its blocking effect occurs within 7 days after infection. The reason to include the second blood meal was that antibodies to YFV could be present in the blood and therefore, promoting negative effect towards the virus in WT mosquitoes, but this was not the case. Caragata
<italic>et al.</italic> (2013)
<sup><xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> studied the effect of cholesterol towards the
<italic>Drosophila C virus</italic>. This mechanism could be present in our experimental mosquitoes, but further studies on this aspect should be developed.</p><p>Interestingly, in our experiments, the overall infectivity in mosquitoes was not high, even in control (no
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>) mosquitoes. This shows the reduced vector competence of natural Brazilian
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, which could explain why most of the cases reported on the recent outbreaks in Brazil were in proximity to green areas of parks and forests, where natural YFV mosquito vectors such as
<italic>Haemagogus</italic> and
<italic>Sabethes</italic> are easily found
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>.</p><p>Our results show that the presence of
<italic>w</italic>Mel strain of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> in mosquitoes has the potential to greatly reduce the transmission potential of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> for YFV. It is important for public health agencies of arbovirus endemic countries to have constant awareness of the potential of
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to become an urban vector for
<italic>Yellow fever virus</italic> once again
<sup><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. If that becomes reality,
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes could be a powerful tool for YFV control, along with the currently applied vaccination program
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to consider the possible vector competence of other mosquito species and the possibility of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> virus evolution and, therefore possible lack of interference in this system. If that is the case, other strategies should be consider, as the use of other strains of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to try to block virus transmission by that particular mosquito species. Integration of complementary strategies are the best solution for arbovirus control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><sec><title>Underlying data</title><p>The data underlying

<bold>:</bold>some elements related to this part of the manuscript should be further expanded and detailed for a better understanding and accuracy of the manuscript. Especially, the authors should consider:</p><p>- Improving the description of the YFV infection assays in mosquitoes. For example, it is not clear the number of mosquitoes and replicates used to determine the viral load in the body of WT or wMel mosquitoes.&#x000a0;</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x0003e;&#x0003e; In the section on methods in the item mosquitoes and infection, the requested information was included:</italic>
</p><p>Viral load was analyzed at 7, 14 and 21 days post feeding (dpf), via RT-qPCR and the number of mosquitoes analyzed per group are presented in figures 3B, C and D, ranging from 17 to 20. Additionally, a subset of mosquitoes (at 7dpf) received an extra blood meal and were collected at 14dpf, when
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> density and viral load was determined.
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> density was analyzed on mosquitoes from the three time-points as follows: 40 mosquitoes on 7 dpf, 39 mosquitoes on 14 dpf and 38 mosquitoes after 21 dpf.</p><p>- Similarly, it is important to clarify the design and data presentation of the transmission assays in mosquitoes. For example, it is not clear if each bar on Figure 4 represents the data combination of 8 mosquitoes injected with the same saliva of a given mosquito (1 x 8 x 8) or if it is the data collected from an individual mosquito injected with the saliva of a given individual mosquito (1 x 1 x 8). This may also cause confusion when interpreting this figure as the Y-axis labels refer to &#x0201c;infected mosquitoes per saliva&#x0201d; while the subtitles refer to &#x0201c;the number of YFV copies&#x02026;per mosquito&#x0201d;. Additionally, the authors should check the position of the graphs on the right (A and C) and left (B and D) panels as they seem not to match their respective description in the subtitles.</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x0003e;&#x0003e; The information requested on the number of nanoinjected mosquitoes was introduced in the methods section (Mosquito saliva transmission assay) as shown below:</italic>
</p><p>Each mosquito received 276 nL and were kept for 5 days before whole body RNA extraction, followed by RT-qPCR. Usually, with one saliva sample it is possible to inject 15 mosquitoes, but due to mortality, 8 mosquitoes were analyzed from each nanoinjected saliva sample.</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x0003e;&#x0003e; The panels were indeed misplaced. Thank you for pointing this out. Please see below:</italic>
</p><p>Saliva from both groups of infected mosquitoes were collected at 14 dpf. Individual saliva samples (WT or
<italic>w</italic>Mel +) were analyzed into eight na&#x000ef;ve (WT) mosquitoes (bars) and, after five days, these injected mosquitoes were analyzed. (
<bold>A</bold>) Mosquitoes injected with WT mosquito saliva or (
<bold>B</bold>)
<italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with human virus. (
<bold>C</bold>) Mosquitoes injected with WT mosquito saliva or (
<bold>D</bold>)
<italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with primate virus. Values below each bar depicts the viral load of each mosquito head and thorax which donated that saliva. Positive mosquitoes were quantified through RT-qPCR and the grey-scale represents the number of YFV copies (0 to 10
<sup>6</sup> copies), per mosquito.</p><p>- An important question that was raised is why the authors have chosen to inject mosquito saliva into mice instead of feeding such mosquitoes on mice in order to test transmission directly.</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x0003e;&#x0003e; The reason why we have not performed the experiment by feeding infected mosquitoes directly on the mice was because we had no biosafety approval to perform these experiments. Therefore, the saliva samples had to be transported to another institution (UFMG), where the mice were located, and then used there.</italic>
</p><p>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; 2.&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x000a0;Results/hypothesis/conclusions:- The leukocyte counts are significantly high in mice inoculated with the saliva of wMel mosquitoes orally exposed to YFV (Figures 5C and 5D). Do the authors have any hypothesis to explain why this is happening?
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0;</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0; &#x000a0; &#x0003e;&#x0003e; Mosquito saliva is a very complex concoction of mixture of proteins (&#x0003e;100 proteins), which exerts several functions in the host by circumventing, for example, vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, coagulation, and inflammation or host hemostasis. Several works in literature have shown that mosquito saliva by itself exerts profound effects on mouse and human immune systems. For example, Vogt and colleagues (2018), using a humanized mice model, have shown that mosquito saliva alters several human blood leukocytes populations such as hematopoietic, NK, NKT, B and myeloid cells. However, the isolate and specific effect of mosquito saliva in modulating blood leukocyte counts was not observed in our work. This finding leads us to believe that wolbachia infection could be associated with such blood leukocyte counts increase. However, when we look closely at the results, we observe that the increase in blood leukocyte counts in mice that received saliva of wMel mosquitoes occurred especially (statistically significant) only upon exposure to human YFV isolate but not after the primate YFV strain inoculation (Fig 5C, 5D). These results suggest that the leukocyte increase observed in the wMel hYFV group was probably due to an interaction between the wolbachia-infected saliva and the human viral isolate in comparison to mice that received the YFV isolate from primates. However, the mechanisms underlying these findings require further investigation. </italic>

<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transinfected with the
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a highly promising strategy for suppressing the transmission of a number of globally important arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. In the current manuscript, the authors conducted laboratory-based experiments to assess the ability of the
<italic>w</italic>Mel strain of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> to inhibit the transmission potential of two outbreak strains of yellow fever virus by
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. As has been demonstrated with other flaviviruses in numerous similar studies,
<italic>w</italic>Mel inhibited replication and subsequent transmission when compared with
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-negative mosquitoes. This is a relatively well written manuscript describing experiments with outcomes of interest to readers of Gates Open Research. However, there are some components of the manuscript that need to be clarified and/or justified.</p><p> Below are specific comments as they relate to the reported study:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is difficult to understand the justification for including the mouse component of the work. The final sentence of the introduction is misleading.

<italic>Wolbachia</italic>&#x000a0;is a highly promising strategy for suppressing the transmission of a number of globally important arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. In the current manuscript, the authors conducted laboratory-based experiments to assess the ability of the&#x000a0;
<italic>w</italic>Mel strain of&#x000a0;
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>&#x000a0;to inhibit the transmission potential of two outbreak strains of yellow fever virus by&#x000a0;
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. As has been demonstrated with other flaviviruses in numerous similar studies,&#x000a0;
<italic>w</italic>Mel inhibited replication and subsequent transmission when compared with&#x000a0;
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-negative mosquitoes. This is a relatively well written manuscript describing experiments with outcomes of interest to readers of Gates Open Research. However, there are some components of the manuscript that need to be clarified and/or justified.</p><p>Below are specific comments as they relate to the reported study:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It is difficult to understand the justification for including the mouse component of the work. The final sentence of the introduction is misleading. As it reads, it indicates that mice were used to demonstrate transmission (i.e. that mosquitoes actually fed on mice which were then monitored for evidence of infection). However, mice (along with mosquitoes) were used to indicate whether saliva collected using an in vitro method contained infectious virus and not to demonstrate transmission directly. If mice had been used to demonstrate transmission directly, then this would have added greatly to the novelty and significance of the study by demonstrating that transmission is affected in an animal model and not just using in vitro assessment of transmission (which is what almost all other studies do).</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with this and we have edited the text accordingly. Now the end of the introduction reads: &#x0201c;We found that Wolbachia had a major impact on virus replication in mosquitoes, as well as reduced the potential of YFV transmission via saliva, as indirectly determined via mosquitoes or a mouse model&#x0201d;.</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0;The reason why we have not performed the experiment by feeding infected mosquitoes directly on the mice was because we had no biosafety approval to perform these experiments. Therefore, the saliva samples had to be transported to another institution (UFMG), where the mice were located, and then used there.</italic>
</p><p>&#x000a0;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The actual number of saliva samples tested was relatively low, so interpretation of the findings with regards to transmission blocking should be undertaken with caution, especially when extrapolating to the field.</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; We agree with the reviewer, but we think we were able to have good sampling numbers if we consider that 2 isolates (primate and human) were used and the results are quite similar.</italic>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x0201c;Pluripotency&#x0201d; is not really an appropriate descriptive term in this context.</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; The idea of using the word &#x0201c;Pluripotency&#x0201d; was to describe the ability of Wolbachia to reduce transmission of several different pathogens. If there is no big issue on this, we would prefer to keep it and change Arbovirus to Arboviruses to better illustrate what we wanted.</italic>

<bold>Background</bold>: Yellow fever outbreaks have re-emerged in Brazil during 2016-18, with mortality rates up to 30%. Although urban transmission has not been reported since 1942, the risk of re-urbanization of yellow fever is significant, as
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is present in most tropical and sub-tropical cities in the World and used to be the main vector in the past. Although the YFV vaccine is safe and effective, it does not always reach populations at greatest risk of infection and there is an acknowledged global shortage of vaccine supply. The introgression of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria into
<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito populations is being trialed in several countries (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldmosquito.org">www.worldmosquito.org</ext-link>) as a biocontrol method against dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Here, we studied the ability of

<italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes for yellow fever virus (YFV).</p><p>&#x000a0;

<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; OK. This has been corrected:</italic>

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Results: The number of saliva samples from WT and wMel+ was 8 for each of the viruses (primate and human). Why was such a relatively low number (especially of the WT) of saliva samples tested? In Figure 3, there was a much larger number of mosquitoes tested. Was transmission not attempted with these mosquitoes? The number of saliva samples tested really was very low compared to what could and should have been tested (especially by mosquito injection, where there shouldn&#x02019;t really be any limitation to the number of samples processed).</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; Each saliva sample was collected and processed individually. Each saliva sample was injected into up to 8 na&#x000ef;ve mosquitoes. This clearly show how sample numbers are multiplied (up to 64 for each group). It was merely the question of numbers and trying to lower the costs.</italic>
</p><p>
<italic>&#x000a0;We have collected 20 saliva samples from each group. Eight were used to inject the mosquitoes (as explained above) and the other 12 were used in two (pooled) to inject mice (6 mice per group).</italic>

</p><p>Saliva from both groups of infected mosquitoes were collected at 14 dpf. Individual saliva samples (WT or
<italic>w</italic>Mel +) were injected into eight na&#x000ef;ve (WT) mosquitoes (bars) and, after five days, these injected mosquitoes were analyzed. (

<italic>w</italic>Mel+ mosquitoes, challenged with primate virus. Values below each bar depicts the viral load of each mosquito head and thorax which donated that saliva. Positive mosquitoes were quantified through RT-qPCR and the grey-scale represents the number of YFV copies (0 to 10

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The discussion needs to consider some important factors:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>What are the possible mechanisms causing the&#x000a0;
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated virus inhibition? This is pertinent in this case, because the effect of subsequent blood meals was examined.</p></list-item></list>
</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; In paragraph 5 of the discussion we include this information:</italic>
</p><p>Another interesting fact of this work was the increase in viral load observed after the second blood feeding in WT mosquitoes. This same fact was not observed in
<italic>w</italic>Mel + mosquitoes. This shows that the blocking ability of
<italic>Wolbachia</italic> persists even after the addition of extra blood nutrients (through a second blood meal) and that its blocking effect occurs within 7 days after infection. The reason to include the second blood meal was that antibodies to YFV could be present in the blood and therefore, promote negative effect towards the virus in WT mosquitoes, but this was not the case. Caragata
<italic>et al</italic>. (2013)
<sup>45</sup> studied the effect of cholesterol towards the Drosophila C virus. This mechanism could be present in our experimental mosquitoes, but further studies on this aspect should be developed.</p><p>&#x000a0;

<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based control strategies are undoubtedly promising tools for control of&#x000a0;
<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>&#x000a0;transmitted viruses. However, the authors should discuss any potential issues that could arise with&#x000a0;
<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based approaches in the future.</p></list-item></list>
<italic>&#x0003e;&#x0003e; It is important to consider the possible vector competence of other mosquito species and the possibility of Wolbachia/ virus evolution and lack of interference in this system. If that is the case, other strategies should be consider, as the use of other strains of Wolbachia to try to block virus transmission by that particular mosquito species. We have added this to the end of the discussion. &#x0201c;Lastly, it is important to consider the possible vector competence of other mosquito species and the possibility of Wolbachia/ virus evolution and lack of interference in this system. If that is the case, other strategies should be consider, as the use of other strains of Wolbachia to try to block virus transmission by that particular mosquito species. Integration of complementary strategies are the best solution for arbovirus control.&#x0201d;</italic>
