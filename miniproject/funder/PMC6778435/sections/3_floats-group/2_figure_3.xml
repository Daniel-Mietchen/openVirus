  <title>Differential proteins involved in various biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components in the V/L group.</title>
  <p>(A) These proteins covered a wide range of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, which were exhibited in different proportions in the V/L group. (B, C) Enrichment analysis of GO terms and KEGG pathway. (D) Representative lycorine response to viral replication-related pathway maps of differentially abundant proteins involved in the MAPK pathway in KEGG. Green colored proteins were identified using the TMT approach.</p>
