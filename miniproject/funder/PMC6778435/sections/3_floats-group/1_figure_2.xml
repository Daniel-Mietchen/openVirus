  <title>Differentially expressed proteins in the V/M groupinvolved in various biological processes, molecular functions, and cellularcomponents.</title>
  <p>(A) These proteins covered a wide range of biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, which were exhibited in different proportions in the V/M group. (B, C) Enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms and KEGG database pathways. (D) Representative viral replication-related pathway maps of differentially abundant proteins involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in KEGG. The green colored proteins were identified using the tandem mass tag (TMT) approach.</p>
