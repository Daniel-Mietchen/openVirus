<p>Nine serial samples from each subject and the common reference sample were included in one TMT10 labeling experiment set as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1C</xref>. This labeling strategy avoids the potential for missing value issues resulting from data-dependent MS/MS acquisitions (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Batth, Francavilla &amp; Olsen, 2014</xref>). The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. Buffer A consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 10.0, and Buffer B consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate, 90% v/v acetonitrile (ACN), pH 10.0. Both buffers were filter sterilized. The gradient to perform the separation consisted of several steps: (1) 100% Buffer A for 40 min, 0%–5% Buffer B for 3 min; (2) 5%–35% Buffer B for 30 min; (3) 35%–70% Buffer B for 10 min; (4) 70%–75% Buffer B for 10 min; (5) 75%–100% Buffer B for 7 min; (6) 100% Buffer B for 15 min; and (7) 100% Buffer A for 15 min. The elution process was monitored by measuring absorbance at 214 nm, and fractions were collected every 1.25 min. The collected fractions (approximately 40) were finally combined into 10 pools. Each fraction was concentrated via vacuum centrifugation and reconstituted in 10 µL of 0.1% v/v formic acid. All samples were stored at −80 °C until LC-MS/MS analysis.
