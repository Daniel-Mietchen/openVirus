<p>Cells were homogenized on ice for 20 min in 1 × RIPA buffer with cocktail protease inhibitors (Roche) and then centrifuged at 15,000× g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and then stored at −80 °C. For western blot analysis, equal amounts of proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinyl fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA and then incubated with monoclonal antibody Nup93 (ab168805) and monoclonal antibody anti- β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies) at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline with Tween20 and then incubated for 2 h at RT with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technologies).</p>
