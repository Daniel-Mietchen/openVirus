<p>The proteins co-regulated in V/M and V/L were selected for further analysis. These 71 DEPs were investigated and annotated using GO terms and subjected to GO functional analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-8">Table S4</xref>). Fifty-four proteins were upregulated in the V group but downregulated in the L group; this finding indicated that some of the proteins may participate in viral infections and may be blocked by lycorine to avoid progeny virus budding. Seventeen proteins were downregulated in the V group but induced in the L group, implying that these proteins were downregulated after influenza virus infection but increased after lycorine treatment. A total of 71 proteins showed upregulated or downregulated difference in abundance, and a heat map of these proteins was obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figs. 4A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4C</xref>). All co-upregulated and co-downregulated proteins were further analyzed by GO enrichment analysis, and each protein belonged to at least one term. Among the upregulated proteins, the three main terms in the BP category were cellular process (40 proteins), metabolic process (29 proteins), and organic substance metabolic process (29 proteins). The main terms in the MF category were transcription factor activity (42 proteins) and nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity (33 proteins). The main terms in the CC category were membrane part (49 proteins) and cell junction (41 proteins). In the downregulated proteins, the main terms in the BP category were localization (15 proteins), immune system process (14 proteins), and reproduction (12 proteins). The main terms in the MF category were structural molecule activity (15 proteins) and binding (11 proteins). The main terms in the CC category were extracellular region (16 proteins) and membrane part (16 proteins) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">4D</xref>). The analysis suggested that these biological functions may be affected by the treatment of AIV-infected MDCK cells with lycorine.
