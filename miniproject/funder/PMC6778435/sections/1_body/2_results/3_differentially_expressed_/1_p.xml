<p>The proteome profiles of the infected cells and the infected cells within lycorine treatment were compared (V/L) to determine the effects of lycorine treatment on the infected cells. In total, 258 DEPs were found (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-7">Table S3</xref>). The PPI network was performed to determine whether these DEPs interact with each other and form protein complexes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Fig. S2</xref>). Two-hundred six proteins with at least 1.2-fold upregulation between the lycorine-treated and virus control group were found (V/L), and 52 proteins were significantly downregulated. The GO terms of DEPs were strongly represented by “cellular process, single-organism process, and biological regulation” in the biological process and “binding, catalytic and molecular transducer activities” in molecular functions; the lycorine-treated cells were also assigned to numerous cellular components, of which “membrane-enclosed lumen, organelle and membrane” were dominant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The functional classification of DEPs was conducted by KEGG enrichment analysis, and each protein was assigned to at least one of the following pathways: human T-lymphotropic virus-1 infection pathway (path: ko05166), cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (path: ko04514), epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance (path: ko01521), Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway (path: ko04630), and pancreatic cancer (path: ko05212) (
