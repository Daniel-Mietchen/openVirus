<p>According to our prior study, vRNP is retained in the nucleus under conditions of lycorine treatment to stop the cycle of influenza virus, which leads us to search for the proteins involved in the vRNP export pathway (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2013</xref>). For several pathways relevant to proteins targeting nuclear export were enriched in the “biological process” category. The proteins with the same trend in the V/M and V/L groups were our candidate proteins. Fortunately, a gene directly related to nuclear transport, 
 <italic>Nup93</italic>, was upregulated by 1.29-fold, in contrast to the low expression level (0.8) found in lycorine treatment over controls (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Table S2</xref>). From the GO terms, Nup93 is related with export of material from the nucleus, such as mRNA, tRNA, viral material, and viral transcription (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-8">Table S4</xref>). Given its possible role in viral inhibition (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Muhlbauer et al., 2015</xref>), western blotting assay with specific antibodies was performed to determine if the expression regulation for these proteins is at the protein level. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>, the trends in Nup93 level changes in the infected cells and lycorine treatment groups were similar to the changed patterns as was observed. Moreover, the protein levels of Nup93 in the uninfected cells but treated with the same concentrations of lycorine were not changed as such as the cells treated with lycorine after influenza virus infection. These results indicate that Nup93 expression was induced after influenza virus infection but was dramatically decreased after lycorine treatment at 0.52 µM. This concentration did not exhibit toxicity to the uninfected cells, which was in accordance with the TMT results. As a result, AIV infection may induce Nup93 to complete the viral cycle, and the process of protein targeting into Nup93 after lycorine treatment may partly be explained by the blockage of vRNPs in the host cellular nucleus.
