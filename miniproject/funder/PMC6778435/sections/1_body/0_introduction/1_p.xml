<p>Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses resulting from routine seasonal epidemics and global pandemics continue to circulate in nature. It is an extremely contagious and aggressive disease that causes rapid systemic illness and death in susceptible birds. Moreover, certain strains, such as H5N1 subtypes, are capable of cross-species transmission and thus can infect humans with high morbidity and mortality (
