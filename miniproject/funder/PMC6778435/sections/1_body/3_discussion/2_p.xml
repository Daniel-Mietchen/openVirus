<p>Proteomics is the large-scale study of molecules known as proteins, the critical building blocks of both host and viruses (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">De Castro Martin et al., 2017</xref>); it also regulates the subcellular localization of protein complexes. In the present study, these phenomena were observed in the HPAIV-infected results (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Table S2</xref>) in conjunction with the total number of significantly regulated proteins (340 proteins). On the basis of the numbers of proteins being significantly modulated and the pathways associated with those proteins, the GD178 influenza virus induced more profound responses to ECM–receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K–Akt signaling pathway through KEGG pathway-based enrichment analysis. 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Yek et al. (2016)</xref> showed that the major function modulated by myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 infection is predominantly enriched in the ECM–receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways. 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2012)</xref> showed that infection with a H5N1 HPAIV strain with an MOI of 0.5 cannot infect much of the cells in their study. Thus, 3 MOI or higher infection doses are better for studying one single viral replication cycle. Considering the dose effects and efficiency of lycorine and GD178 infection, we chose 3 MOI for the single cycle. Therefore, a suitable time point (12 h.p.) must be selected to harvest virus-infected cells that have been treated by lycorine and can be used for proteomic analysis.
