<p id="Par34">Definitions of the concept of “integrated care” vary. In the hospital setting, WHO defined integrated care as: “
 <italic>an approach to strengthen people-centred health systems through the promotion of the comprehensive delivery of quality services across the life-course, designed according to the multidimensional needs of the population and the individual and delivered by a coordinated multidisciplinary team of providers working across settings and levels of care (…)</italic>” [

However, this definition is arguably too broad and unspecific, hence, for the purpose of this paper we have chosen to alter the definition of integrated care to “comprehensive set of patient-centered health services that involve the care of chronic infectious disease as a part of coordinated services for people with SUD.” Integrate care models and collaborative health services may improve health outcomes to medical care, as well as reduce the burden of disease among people with physical and mental disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], prevent severe infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], improve engagement in TB services [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and increase patients adherence and staff satisfaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Systematic reviews suggest that the composition of the integrated models must be described in more detail to identify effective integrated care models that can be implemented in various settings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Previous systematic reviews have mostly identified descriptive reports or cohort studies, and only few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Also, a number of these studies have methodological limitations such as short follow up period, loss-to-follow-up rate on more than 30%, unclear design and mixed outcome indicators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In light of the SDGs and the World Health Assembly global strategy for viral hepatitis, TB and AIDS epidemics, a systematic review is imperative to increase knowledge and understanding how to best reach universal coverage of these severe infectious diseases among people with SUD.
