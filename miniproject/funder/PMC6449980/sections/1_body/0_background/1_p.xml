<p id="Par32">Comorbid Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (TB) infections are common among people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to a low level of attention to personal health care needs, treatment of such severe infectious diseases may be difficult for people who inject drugs (PWID). Additionally, PWID have a sustained high risk of transmitting these severe infections [

A systematic search to identify efficacy of integrated care models on treatment outcomes of severe infectious diseases among people with SUD is required.
