<p id="Par35">In this systematic review, we will examine the effect of integrated health care for people with SUD receiving treatment for HCV, HBV, HIV, and TB. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies presenting quantitative comparative estimates will be compared to relevant outcomes for each infectious disease. We hypothesized that integrated care models might be useful to reach marginalized low adherent people with SUD, although a high risk of bias and loss-to-follow-up could underpowered the results. This systematic review will summarize the impact of integrated care models on the treatment of severe infectious diseases among people with SUD and will grade the evidence base on methodological quality.</p>
