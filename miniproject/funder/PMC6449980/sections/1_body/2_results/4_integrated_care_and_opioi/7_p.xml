<p id="Par57">A small randomized controlled trial on HCV evaluated integrated care that included modified DOT compared to self-administrated HCV treatment among patients in OAT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Twenty-one participants were recruited, 12 and nine were randomized to the intervention group and the control group, respectively. The primary outcome was SVR. The modified DOT models were organized in such a way that the hepatitis C medications and the OAT were taken under observation at the same time. Patients got an injection of peg-Interferon weekly and received the morning doses of Ribavirin together with an opioid agonist medicine. To monitor adherence, participants received a take-home evening doses in MEMSÂ®-cap. Six out of ten and one out of four obtained SVR in the intervention group and the control group, respectively. The loss-to-follow-up was 67%, out of a small initial population. In addition to a prone to selection bias, the results were underpowered to evaluate the effect of the intervention in this study. Small sample size, selection bias, and inconclusive outcomes lead to a careful assessment of the results.
