The intervention group was recruited from three districts among patients receiving OAT and outpatients TB treatment. Similarity, the control group was recruited from three districts where people with opioid use disorder were undergoing TB treatment, however, without OAT. Fifty-seven participants were recruited to integrated treatment compared to 53 participants in the control group. DOT was used for TB treatment, and this was integrated with OAT. Basic characteristics were entirely different between the intervention group and the control group, indicating that the study was underpowered or had biases in the randomization. There were differences in the proportion of people above 36 years of age (the intervention group: 61%, the control group: 36%,
