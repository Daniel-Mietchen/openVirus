<p id="Par54">Moreover, a RCT study evaluated a clinic-based integrated treatment model in a HIV clinic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. All included participants received antiretroviral therapy in the clinic and had an opioid use disorder. The study evaluated the effect of assessment and initiation of OAT in the HIV clinic on HIV suppression. All opioid addicted who qualified to induct OAT were randomized. Participants randomly assigned to the control group were encouraged to be referred to the opioid treatment program. Participants randomized to the intervention delivered their OAT medications in the HIV clinic during 12 months follow-up. After 12 months, changes from baseline of HIV RNA and CD4 cell counts did not significantly differ between the groups (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.31 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.16, respectively). However, the clinic-based intervention group had higher participation in OAT over 12 months of follow-up. This study enrolled only 78% of the estimated sample size, which is a limitation of the study’s validity. Also, a relatively high loss-to-follow-up rate on 17% and inclusion of only one single-center impairs the generality of the study’s results.
