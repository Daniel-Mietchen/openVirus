<p id="Par56">Another randomized controlled trial compared an integrated intervention on HIV suppression among people with opioid use disorder to standard treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Integrated care was psychosocial intervention conducted by nurses. Twenty-two participants were randomized to integrated care and 25 participants received standard care. After the participants were included, and 2 weeks before randomization, all participants were stabilized on buprenorphine-naloxone. The outcome was changes in viral suppression 12 weeks after the intervention was initiated. After 12 weeks the number of HIV copies decreased from 58% at baseline to 43% at 12 week in the intervention group, and from 56 to 35% in the control group, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.84 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.27, respectively, probably due to low sample size. The integrated psychosocial interventions were completed by a mean of 3.0 (standard deviation (SD) = 1.2) sessions per months in 3 months with a mean session length of 47 min (SD = 5.3). All participants provided consultation with a physician bi-weekly. The adherence to ART and the buprenorphine-naloxone medications was monitored by a medical event monitoring system, micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS® –cap). Baseline characteristics were equal in both groups, except years of HIV infection among participants (the intervention group: 8.7 (SD = 6.5), the control group: 15.4 (SD = 4.6), 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The loss-to-follow-up was 30%. Some participants received the HIV medication in a different clinical site than that buprenorphine-naloxone was provided, representing a high risk of bias.
