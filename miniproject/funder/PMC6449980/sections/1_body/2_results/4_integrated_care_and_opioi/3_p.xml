<p id="Par53">Batki et al. (2002) conducted a randomized controlled trial showing a significant effect on preventive TB treatment completion. TB and OAT treatments were integrated into DOT models with or without psychosocial interventions with 6 months follow-up. TB treatment completion was defined as 80% or greater of all doses taken. Seventy-seven percent (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27) of participants randomized into the DOT model without psychosocial interventions achieved treatment completion compared to 60% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22) of participants randomized into DOT model with integrated psychosocial interventions. In the control group, 14% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) completed the TB treatment. The two OAT treatment groups had significantly higher TB treatment completion rate compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, there were no significant differences between the OAT treatment groups in the rate of TB completion. Characteristics of participants at the baseline were equal between the groups, except age (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.047), and scores assessing the severity of problems in individuals with SUD (The Addiction Severity Index psychiatric composite score (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.027) and the severity of depression (Beck Depression Inventory scores (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022)). Unfortunately, the loss-to-follow-up rate was 52%. The results may indicate a limited effect of psychosocial interventions add to directly administrated therapy to increase treatment completion of TB.
