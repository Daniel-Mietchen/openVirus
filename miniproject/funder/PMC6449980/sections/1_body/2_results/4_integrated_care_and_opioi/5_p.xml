 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. HIV suppression and self-reported adherence to ART were evaluated in a non-randomized cohort study that compared integrated HIV treatment in an outpatient clinic among OAT patients to providing ART in an HIV outpatient clinic to patients with SUD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thirty-five patients were recruited to receive integrated care, and 175 patients recruited to the control group. The virological response was defined as HIV suppression below 400 copies/mL, and the immunological response as CD4 cell count above 200 cells/μL after at least 6 months. Among patients enrolled in OAT 97% achieved virological response compared to 90% in the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.27). Approximately 69% had an immunological response compared with 57% in the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.93). No significant differences were established among self-reported adherence and virological and immunological response between these groups. Participants in the intervention group received ART weekly and the self-reported number of medications taken the last week was reported. Basic characteristics at baseline and loss-to-follow-up were not significantly different between the groups.
