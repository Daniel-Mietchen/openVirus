 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Nine integrated models in ten studies were identified, whereas two studies assessed a similar integrated model. We did not identify any relevant studies on hepatitis B. The CONSORT 2010 checklist or the NOS were employed for assessing the quality of the included studies (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). All included studies assessed integrated models of care when participants underwent medical treatment for HIV, HCV or TB. Nine studies recruited patients from either a primary health care centers for people with SUD, OAT outpatient clinics or specialist outpatient clinics for HIV or HCV infected [
