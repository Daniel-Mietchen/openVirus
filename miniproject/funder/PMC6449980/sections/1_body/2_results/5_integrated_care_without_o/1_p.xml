<p id="Par58">We identified four studies with integrated care without OAT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Substance use disorders were reported from 46 to 100% of the participants in the included studies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Two of four studies used the terms “substance use disorder”, and “substance use”, however; the studies did not notice the type of substance dependencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These two studies reported that heroin and cocaine were used in 87 and 13%, and 50 and 52% of the participants, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. One study found a significant effect of brief psychological intervention care having 29 (16%) participants in the intervention group and 14 (8%) participants in the control group that achieved SVR (OR = 2.26, 95% CI, 1.15–4.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) on patients that were screened and that tested positive for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or substance use disorder. A post-hoc analysis comparing people with and without SUD did not find a significant effect on SVR, having 20 (11%) in the intervention group and 14 (7%) in the control group that achieved SVR, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.49) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Integrated care seems to improve SVR, but as this study was not powered for subgroup analysis of SUD patients the results are not significant and may also have been achieved by change. In contrast, three studies failed to show any effect at all [
