 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Of those, 58 in the intervention group and 34 in the standard care group initiated treatment, respectively. In the intervention group, 14 participants achieved SVR (OR 2.26, 95% CI, 1.15–4.44, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). To compare people with and without SUD, a post-hoc analysis on 20 (11%) in the intervention group and 14 (7%) in the control group was done. No significant effect on SVR was found between these groups, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.49, but this post-hoc analysis was not powered for this subgroup analysis and the results could be random. Baseline characteristics were equal. Substance use disorder was detected in 66% of the participants, and 47% had active substance use. People loss-to-follow-up was 53%.
