<p id="Par63">In the second randomized HCV cohort study, altogether 79 participants were recruited (
 <italic>n</italic> = 40 in the intervention group and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 39 in the control group) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Of those, only 18 and 9 initiated treatment, and 12 and 8 participants achieved SVR (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.23), respectively. SVR was not significantly different between these two groups. Both studies used a combination of interferon-based treatment and direct-acting antivirals (DAA). Baseline characteristics were equal, except age (intervention group age = 54.0 (SD = 8.7) and the control group age = 57.4 (SD = 7.7), 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Substance use disorder was identified in only 47% of the participants, and in 32% of those using substances actively. Loss-to-follow-up was again considerable at 59.3%.
