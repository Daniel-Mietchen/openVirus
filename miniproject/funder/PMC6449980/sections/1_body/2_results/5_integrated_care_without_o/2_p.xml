<p id="Par59">A RCT in a HIV primary care outpatient clinic compared an integrated care (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The intervention consisted of six one-hour group session, twice monthly, where treatment barriers, ART adherence, and HIV stigma barriers such as a sexual and romantic relationship, substance use and mental health problems were discussed. The control group received standard care and was given social and mental health referrals. The primary outcome was suppression of HIV RNA at baseline, at 3 and 6 months. A post-hoc analysis revealed no significant differences on HIV suppression between baseline, compared to 3 months and 6 months follow up after treatment initiation. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Only half of the study population had a heavy lifetime substance use of either alcohol, cocaine or heroin. Only 59% follow-up at baseline, 65% at 3 months, and 61% at 6 months, reported taking 95% or more of their prescribed medications.
