<p id="Par60">Furthermore, a cohort study evaluated HIV suppression between HIV infected transmitted through substance use (intervention) or intercourse (control) followed up with blood samples at baseline, weeks 48 and 96 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Active and recent people with SUD were recruited to the integrated care group where they received medical care, drug use disorder treatment, and psychosocial support. People transmitted through intercourse were received standard medical support at the infectious diseases unit of the reference hospital. The primary outcome of the study was time to loss of virological response defined as HIV RNA above 500 copies/mL after getting HIV RNA below 50 copies/mL, or not getting an HIV RNA below 50 copies/mL after week 24. Seventy-one people transmitted through substance use and 48 matched infected through sexual transmission were included. HIV suppression was measured by HIV RNA. At week 48, 93% (95% CI, 87 - 99%) of the intervention group and 94% (95% CI, 84 - 100%) of the control group achieved virus suppression, respectively. At week 96, 87% (95% CI, 79 - 95%) and 88% (95% CI, 78 - 97%) achieved virus suppression, respectively. No significant differences between substance users and people transmitted through intercourse were found at week 48 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.13) and week 96 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.24) compared to baseline Kaplan-Meier estimates (log-rank test) of time to loss of virological response and was not significantly different between the groups (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.97). Basic characteristics were entirely different such as CD4 cell count (209 cells/μL, range, 3–427 cells/μL versus 294 cells/μL, range, 29–465 cells/μL, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and psychiatric comorbidities (personality disorder, depression, psychotic disorder, and bipolar disorder, p &lt; 0.01). Loss-to-follow-up was indifferent in the intervention versus control groups, 13 and 8% (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.18), respectively.
