<p id="Par64">Overall, all the included studies, with or without OAT as a part of integrated care model had a high loss-to-follow-up rate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], or the primary outcome was based on self-reporting of adherence to medication and substance use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Five studies had a loss-to-follow rate of more than 30% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and for one study the quantitative rate was not given [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this review, one out of four studies without OAT showed significant effects of the interventions. However, this study also included people without SUD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. When the results were adjusted for people with SUD or alcohol dependence in a post-hoc analysis, no significant effect on the intervention was found. In total, three out of the ten included studies used psychological interventions as a major part of the study intervention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; none of which measured a significant effect on people with SUD compared to the control groups.
