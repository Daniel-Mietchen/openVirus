<p id="Par69">Three of the included studies in this systematic review evaluated DOT as a tool to increase treatment completion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Generally, DOT did not meet our definition of integrated care but was included as one of several approaches on three of the integrated care models. In two of the cases, it is uncertain how much the DOT element per se affected the results. In our review, two studies including DOT in an integrated setting showed a significant effect on TB treatment completion. DOT is a controversial method due to challenges with patient’s autonomy and could leave the patients as a passive recipient of therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, DOT is a part of the WHO strategy, “Directly Observed Therapy Short course,” whose proposing to increase the completion of the TB treatment, and reduce contamination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. DOT has been less commonly implemented in HIV, HBV, and HCV strategies due to lack of compelling evidence in support for this treatment. DOT has been evaluated in a systematic Cochrane review as a treatment modality to affect treatment completion on TB infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interestingly, DOT was compared to self-administration of therapy and compared between PWIDs receiving TB prophylaxis as DOT to standard care. DOT compared to self-administration showed a similar pattern to completion of TB cure, but stratified analyses on people with SUD or marginalized people were not surveyed. Similarity, one study that was included in the Cochrane review compared DOT to standard care among PWIDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Three hundred PWID received TB prophylaxis delivered by DOT or no observation. Treatment completion was not significantly different between DOT compared to self-administration.
