<p id="Par71">The chief limitation of this review is the lack of relevant studies, which fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Thus, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity of these studies and methodological shortcomings also made it more challenging to synthesize clear patterns of evidence. In an attempt to minimize methodological shortcomings, we opted a strict definition for inclusion. A wider definition of search strategy will include a wider range of approaches but also approaches where the health care is not substantially different from more traditional given health care. This could make it more difficult to assess meaningful effects from comparisons. Thus, trying to balance these aspects we have opted for slightly narrower definition of integrated care than Haldane et al. (2017) have used in a review focusing on HIV, substance use and service integration [

Several synonyms and terms applied in the literature, makes it challenging to create a search strategy that identify all terms and synonyms used without using extremely broad search strategies. The additional pragmatic search on references and cross-references of relevant reviews, and RCTs, including two more relevant studies, is a high proportion of studies compared to those identified in the main search. Still, we cannot rule out that some studies lack. Integrated treatment can be seen as a continuous scale from studies comparing models with limited differences from conventional strategies to the studies with pronounced differences. Choosing where to set the exact threshold of the “borderline” studies with limited differences can be difficult. However, the studies with limited differences between more conventional and integrated are unlikely to inform as much on the effects of integrated treatment as studies with more pronounced differences.
