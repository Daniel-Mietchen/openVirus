<p id="Par65">We assessed the impact of integrated care models among patients with SUD and severe infectious diseases. Many relevant studies were excluded due to a low level of collaborative care involvement, or measurements of outcomes that were not relevant to our review. Overall, most of the included studies were considered to have a high risk of biases and both the results and methodology were heterogeneous. A recurrent finding was a high loss-to-follow-up rate, unclear description of the interventions, and underpowered studies. Moreover, differences in potential confounders between groups in cohort studies including age, proportion of homelessness, proportion of people who inject drugs, employment status, level of education, and severe psychiatric disorders to name but a few. Potential confounders may further bias the interpretation of the results.</p>
