<p id="Par66">The impact of integrated treatment among people with SUD on viral suppression, HCV SVR and TB treatment completion is uncertain according to our findings. In our review, a quantitative meta-analysis has not been performed due to limited comparable studies of high quality. Only two studies found an effect of integrated treatment. One of them found an effect of integrated OAT given to hospitalized TB-infected patients on treatment completion and medication adherence [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Other OAT integrated models had uncertain effects. A meta-analysis published in 2016 suggested that OAT was associated with an increase in ART coverage and adherence to ART, and limited evidence for OAT decreasing mortality for PWID on ART [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A similar impact of OAT on adherence to hepatitis C and TB treatment has not been shown. However, Altice, FL, et al. (2011) evaluated in a multicenter study an integrated OAT model in a HIV clinical care settings, and found no association between integrated OAT and viral suppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. An important limitation was the lack of a control group, which was the reason why we did not include it in our review.
