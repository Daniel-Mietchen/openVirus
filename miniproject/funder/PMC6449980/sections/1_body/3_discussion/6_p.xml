<p id="Par70">The etiological treatment for hepatitis C and HIV have improved significantly in the last decade. New DAAs against chronic hepatitis C are better tolerated and have a better efficacy than traditional interferon-based treatment, and could therefore markedly reduce the global chronic hepatitis C epidemic [

From February 1, 2018, however, all chronic HCV patients in Norway have given an opportunity to receive treatment with DAAs regardless of genotype and liver fibrosis level. Among recent advances in ART against HIV are increased potency making single tablet treatment feasible, better tolerance, and improved viral suppression [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In our review, DAAs were not tested systematically in a separate study, and stratified analysis based on this item is not surveyed. However, Norton et al. (2017) have evaluated new DAAs among people who actively use drugs and received OAT in an integrated model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The results of this non-controlled study showed that substance use and OAT are independently associated to a high SVR rate (&gt;â€‰90, 95% CI: 42 - 99%) when DAAs are given in a coordinated service. Due to the small sample size and lack of control group, the results are uncertain and must be confirmed in high-quality studies. Further integrated care models and new antivirals may contribute to ensuring better availability and treatment completion.
