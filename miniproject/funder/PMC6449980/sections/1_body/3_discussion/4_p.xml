<p id="Par68">Three studies that included psychological intervention by clinical psychologists or psychosocial intervention by nurses under clinical guidance of a clinical psychologist as a part of the integrated care were included in this literature review. The effects of psychological intervention on our outcomes are too weak to measure quantitatively. A previous systematic review has measured the effects of psychosocial interventions on people with SUD and severe mental illnesses quantitatively independently of infectious disease treatment [

Overall, the results were affected by low to very low rate of evidence and unclear risk of bias. Based on 32 RCTs, no compelling evidence to reduce substance use or improve mental state in patients with severe mental illnesses was found. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis on collaborative care models have shown to be useful to enhance mental and physical outcomes among patients with mental disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Three studies included people with SUD, but no intervention was qualified to be included as collaborative care models. The main focus of the studies was integrating or coordinating primary care with an ongoing psychosocial oriented substance use treatment program. It is uncertain whether a psychological intervention that is used in the treatment of severe infectious diseases among patients with SUDs improves the viral suppression or treatment completion. Again, there is an urgent need for high-quality RCTs with a detailed description and definition of integrated treatment models effect on quantitatively outcomes measurements, and where the risk of bias is reduced.
