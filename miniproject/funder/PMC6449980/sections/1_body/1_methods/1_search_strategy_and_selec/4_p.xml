<p id="Par42">In this paper, only randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Cross-sectional studies, case reports, commentaries, review papers, modeling analysis, and reports without primary data were excluded, as studies lacking control groups. Studies were included for detailed assessment if sub-groups of participants met or were assumed to meet the criteria for substance use disorder. To further validate the literature search, and particularly to ensure that no papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were overlooked, we also did an additional search on MEDLINE/PubMed to screen for references of relevant reviews, and RCTs. To ensure that all integrated treatment models were taken into account, we did a broad search, which included MESH-terms from two of the three main terms; substance use disorder and severe infectious diseases (Additional file

Studies not including patients with SUD were excluded. The proportion of participants with SUD is given in Table
