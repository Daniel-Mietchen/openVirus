<p id="Par36">We did a systematic search in MEDLINE/PubMed (1946 to 2018, on July 26, 2018) and Embase (from 1974 to 2018, on July 26, 2018) and Embase online search engines. The search was built up of three main terms; 1) infectious diseases (HCV, HBV, HIV, and TB), 2) substance use disorder and 3) integrated treatment. Sources included MeSH-terms and all components in keywords, title and abstract. The following search terms were employed; 1) infectious diseases: “hepatitis C”, OR “hepatitis B”, OR “human immunodeficiency virus”, OR “tuberculosis”, 2) substance use disorder: “substance-related disorder” OR “narcotics agent” OR “withdrawal syndrome” OR “substance abuse” OR “drug” in combination with “dependence”, “abuse”, “use”, “addict” OR “disorder” and, 3) “delivery of health care, integrated” OR “integrated health care system” (Additional files
