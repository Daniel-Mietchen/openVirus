<p id="Par45">Our outcomes were quantitative measures of treatment effect on at least one of the infectious diseases tested in an integrated care model. For HCV, sustained virological response (SVR) at least 12â€‰weeks after the end of treatment was used as a primary outcome. For HIV care, we used HIV viral suppression, and for TB, we evaluated the completion of the recommended treatment regimen. For HBV, we planned to use clearance of HBsAg or HBeAg or suppression of HBV DNA as an indirect measure of intervention effect as outcomes.</p>
