  <title>The maximum likelihood analysis of the partial West Nile virus NS5 sequences (777 nt).</title>
  <p>The tree is constructed using Maximum Likelihood method with the General Time Reversible (GTR) model, Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G+I) for 1000 replications. The sequences characterized in this study are given in bold and indicated with a symbol, GenBank accession number, hosting mosquito species and pool code. Global virus strains are indicated by GenBank accession number, strain/isolate name and country of detection. Viruses previously characterized in Turkey are indicated with blue letters. Bootstrap values higher than 60 are provided. Japanese encephalitis virus strain GP78 is included as an outgroup.</p>
