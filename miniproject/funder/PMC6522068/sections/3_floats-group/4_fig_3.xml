  <title>The maximum likelihood analysis of the partial flavivirus NS5 sequences (355 nt).</title>
  <p>The tree is constructed using Maximum Likelihood method with the General Time Reversible (GTR) model, Gamma distributed with Invariant sites (G+I) for 1000 replications. The sequences characterized in this study are given in bold and indicated with a symbol, GenBank accession number, hosting mosquito species and pool code. Global virus strains are indicated by GenBank accession number, virus and strain/isolate name. Viruses previously characterized in Turkey are indicated with blue letters. Bootstrap values higher than 60 are provided.</p>
