 <italic>aegypti</italic> specimens, sequences identified as cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) were detected. The sequences were partially overlapping 283–695 bp segments, covering the flavivirus NS5 region amplicon. They displayed 86–97.8% identity to the CFAV strain Galveston (GenBank accession NC001564) in pairwise comparisons and formed a well-supported phylogenetic group with CFAV strains of various origins in the maximum likelihood tree (
