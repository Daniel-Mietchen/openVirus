<p>Despite lack of virus isolation in cell culture inoculation of flavivirus PCR positive pools, we could obtain near-complete polyprotein coding region of the AEFV via direct NGS in available aliquots in the mosquito pool, KRD32 (

 </bold>). The assembled sequence comprised 9,931 bp, with the deduced polyprotein of 3310 amino acids, that covered over 99% of the complete AEFV polyprotein. The sequence demonstrated pairwise diversity rates of 1–8.5% and 0.6–2.2% on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively; when compared to AEFV strains Narita-21 (GenBank accession AB488408), Bangkok (KJ741266), SPFLD-MO-2011-MP6 (KC181923) and the recently described La Tina virus isolate 49 (KY320649). Region-specific identities were further determined on the viral polyprotein, which revealed similarity rates of &gt;90% on individual mature proteins (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], was observed as GGATTTT heptanucleotide motif, encompassing the nucleotides 3277–3283 in the AEFV-Turkey genome. Motifs of flavivirus envelope glycoprotein with the central/dimerisation domains (residues 306–478), flavivirus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (879–1,052), NS3 serine protease (1,471–1,607), DEAD-like helicase domain (1,627–1,768), methyl transferase (2,475–2,663) and flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (2,963–3,309) were identified in the deduced viral polyprotein. The envelope fusion peptide motif, involved in viral endosomal fusion and cellular entry [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], was located in 361–374. residues of the deduced viral polyprotein and characterized as NRGWGTGCFEWGLG.
