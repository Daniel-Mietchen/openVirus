 </bold>). Sequences of 777–1,000 base pairs (bp) were characterized. Pairwise comparisons showed diversity rates of 0.2–0.7% and 0.4–1.6% in the nucleotide and deduced amino acids, respectively. In the maximum likelihood tree, all sequences grouped within WNV lineage 1 clade 1a sequences, and formed a distinct cluster with viruses from the American Continent, Israel, Tunisia, Hungary and Aegean coast of Anatolia (Turkey) (
