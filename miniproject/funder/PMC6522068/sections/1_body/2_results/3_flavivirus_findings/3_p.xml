 </bold>). The obtained sequences comprised 283–695 bp of partially overlapping segments of the target amplicon, with 0.9–8.8% intramural diversity in pairwise comparisons. Maximum likelihood analysis using the sequences from the pools KRD1, KRD32 and P11 revealed a separate clustering of these sequences with the closely-related AEFV strains, among other distinct insect flaviviruses, including CFAV (
