<p>Mosquitoes were screened for viruses in 65 pools. Fifteen of these (23.1%) were reactive in at least one screening assay. Generic flavivirus assay was positive in all reactive pools, but the Zika virus specific and alphavirus PCRs were always negative. The only MERDLVT PCR positive was detected in a pool of DNA-barcode confirmed

No cytopathic effect was observed in four consecutive blind passages and culture supernatants remained negative in flavivirus generic PCR. The mosquito species identification in reactive pools were confirmed via COI barcoding (
