<p>Besides pathogenic flaviviruses, our screening provided information on insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) in mosquitoes of the Black Sea region of Anatolia. Forming a major phylogenetic group of 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, the ISFs do not seem to infect vertebrates and replicate exclusively in mosquito derived cell lines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. ISFs demonstrate a widespread geographic distribution and have been detected in a wide range of mosquito species, including those that act as virus vectors. Therefore, they share identical ecologic niches with vector-borne pathogens and frequently co-circulate in given geographical areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We have identified two distinct ISFs, CFAV and AEFV, in this study. They could be detected in several sampling sites during consecutive years in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>), suggesting dissemineated circulation in the region. CFAV was the first ISF to be discovered, initially isolated from an infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> cell line [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has subsequently been detected in several 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes from locations in Asia, Africa and the American continent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and recently reported from Brasil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. AEFV is another ubiquituous ISF, previously also detected in mosquitoes from Italy and United States, following its initial characterization in Japan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Mostly identified in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes flavopictus</italic> mosquitoes, AEFV was also present in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes from Italy, suggesting transspecies infections similar to CFAV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Both viruses were also isolated from laboratory colonies established from mosquitoes collected in Thailand and the United States [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In our study, the local AEFV strain provisionally named as “AEFV-Turkey”, was detected in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as well as in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>). The near complete genome of AEFV-Turkey revealed significant sequence similarities, identical organization with specific regions and functional markers with AEFVs (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007334.g005">Fig 5</xref>
 </bold>). We have previously isolated and characterized several ISFs in Anatolia and Thrace, including 
 <italic>Culex theileri</italic> flavivirus Turkey [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus caspius</italic> flavivirus Turkey [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> flavivirus and evidence for novel ISFs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, AEFV-Turkey becomes the latest addition to the list of ISFs known to circulate in the Anatolian mosquito fauna. Of particular interest is the probable interaction of ISFs with pathogenic flaviviruses, resulting in alterations in vector infection efficiency or transmission dynamics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, currently available information is insufficient for well-supported conclusions and detailed screening is likely to provide epidemiological data required for a better understanding of the ISF-pathogen interactions occuring in nature.
