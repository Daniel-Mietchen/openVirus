<p>Five major WNV lineages have been described according to the genomic phylogenies, where lineage 1 is widely distributed throughout Africa, Asia and America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, other lineages also circulate in Europe where lineage 2 may cause human infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The partial WNV sequences characterized in mosquito pools in this study grouped phylogenetically with lineage 1 clade 1a sequences, which include the majority of the global lineage 1 strains as well as previously characterized sequences in Anatolia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, a significant WNV sequence diversity has also been documented in Turkey [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which is represented in this study as differential clustering of mosquito, avian and equine sequences (

 </bold>). This pronounced diversity, as well as occasional detection of lineage 2 strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], probably results from independent virus introductions and dispersion via migrating birds throughout Anatolia and Thrace [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
