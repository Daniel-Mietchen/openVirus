<p>We screened the field-collected mosquitoes for a diverse spectrum of viruses, including pathogenic flavi and alphaviruses mainly transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, via generic or real-time PCR assays. WNV was noted as the prominent pathogenic agent, detected in 7.7% of the mosquito pools (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>). WNV circulates among various avian species and vector mosquitoes in nature. Humans and horses are exposed to the virus via infected mosquitoes and considered as dead-end hosts, due to the lack of prolonged and high-level viremia required to contribute to virus circulation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. WNV is widespread throughout Anatolia and the virus has been previously detected in field-collected mosquitoes including 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> s.s., 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex perexiguus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], in organ specimens from migratory birds [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as well as in symptomatic humans and equine infections, occasionally presenting as outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], However, most data on WNV circulation originated from Aegean, Mediterranean, Thrace and Central Anatolian locations with scarce information from the Black Sea region. We have identified WNV sequences in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> pools collected from Artvin and Rize provinces in this study (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>), clearly indicating virus circulation in the region. We have previously evaluated mosquito specimens from Artvin province in 2013, comprising mostly 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp., without WNV detection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, WNV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 9.9% of the duck sera originating from the neighboring Kars province, suggesting prior virus exposure in the region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is known that different mosquito species possess highly variable potential to acquire and transmit WNV and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species are accepted as the primary global transmission vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. WNV has been detected several other genera of mosquitoes including 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic>, 
 <italic>Culiseta</italic>, 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic>, 
 <italic>Mimomyia</italic>, 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Uranoteania</italic>, that can serve as bridge vectors for transmission from birds to humans and equines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are competent vectors for WNV, however their contribution to virus circulation in the field is considered as limited, due to their feeding preference for humans and variations in WNV transmission rates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This may explain the lack of documented clinical cases from the screened provinces so far. Of note is the relatively hign WNV incidence in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> pools, which suggests considerable intensity of virus circulation in the sampling locations. Therefore, a detailed surveillance is required to better understand WNV epidemiology in the Black Sea region.
