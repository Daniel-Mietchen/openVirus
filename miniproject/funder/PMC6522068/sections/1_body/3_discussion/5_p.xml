<p>We have further detected MERDLVT in a pool of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> s.s. mosquitoes, also positive for WNV (

  <xref rid="pntd.0007334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>). MERDLVT and closely related MERDV are putative members of the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, identified using NGS without isolation in field-collected mosquitoes from Mexico and Turkey, without succesful isolation of a viable strain [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. MERDLVT has previously been detected in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes from several locations in Mediterranean and Aegean Anatolia as well as from Thrace [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The detection of MERDLVT within a relatively small 
 <italic>Culex</italic> cohort indirectly suggests prominent virus circulation in the Black Sea region. MERDLVT has so far been observed exclusively in 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, mosquitoes with MERDV infection are not limited to 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genera, and partial viral sequences were detected in 
 <italic>Aedes taeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes trivittatus</italic> mosquitoes among seven mosquitoes species in Mexico [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The MERDLVT sequences are generally well-conserved, as observed in the amplified sections of the viral L and N genes in this study, and phylogenetically-related to the previously identified sequences (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007334.g004">Fig 4</xref>
 </bold>). We have previously documented the cocirculation of flaviviruses and MERDLVT, which is also observed in this study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Similar to ISFs, the impact of MERDLVT or MERDV on vector survival and pathogen transmission remains currently unexplored and requires further investigation.
