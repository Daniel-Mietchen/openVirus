<p>Mosquito pools positive in the screening assays and with available aliquots were subjected to direct NGS. Following purification, the nucleic acids were reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers to double-stranded cDNA using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and NEBNext mRNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter Biosciences, Krefeld, Germany) were used for cleanup and estimation of yield and size distribution. Fragmentation, adaptor ligation and amplification were performed according to the manufacturer protocols using the NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing runs were performed on the Illumina MiSeq (Illumina Inc.) instrument in the paired end mode.</p>
