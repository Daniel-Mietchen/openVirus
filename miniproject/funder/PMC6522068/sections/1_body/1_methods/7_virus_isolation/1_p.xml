<p>Aliquots of the mosquito pools positive in the screening assays were inoculated onto semi-confluent monolayers of Vero (ATCC-CCL81) and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (C6/36, ATCC-CRL1660) cells, following filtration through 0.22 micrometer sterile membrane filters (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The cells were incubated at 37°C and 28°C respectively, and monitored daily for cytopathic effects. Blind passages to fresh monolayers and testing for viruses via the screening assays were carried out weekly.
