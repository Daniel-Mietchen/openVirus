<p>Mosquito pools were screened for alphaviruses, using the nested PCR employing degenerate primers targeting the nsP4 region, as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The assay could amplify several medically-important alphaviruses including CHIKV, Sindbis, O'nyong nyong, western equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Semliki forest, Ross river and Barmah forest viruses. The detection threshold of the assay was reported as 1â€“10 copies (cloned fragment) or 25 pfu (cell-grown virus) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. CHIKV strain LR2006-OPY1 cDNA, obtained from the European Virus Archive was used for optimization and as a positive template during screening.
