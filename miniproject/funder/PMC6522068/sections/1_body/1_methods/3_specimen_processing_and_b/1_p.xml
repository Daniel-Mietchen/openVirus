<p>Pooled mosquitoes were disrupted by vortexing following the addition of stainless steel beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 500 microliters of Eagleâ€™s minimal essential medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Subsequently, the pools were cleared by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 4 minutes and the supernatants were collected. They were subjected to nucleic acid purificaton via High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), followed by reverse transcription for complementary DNA synthesis, using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany) by random hexamer priming, as directed by the manufacturer.</p>
