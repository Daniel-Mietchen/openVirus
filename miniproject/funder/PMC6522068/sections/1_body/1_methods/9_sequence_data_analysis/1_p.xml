<p>Raw sequences obtained from virus screening were handled using Geneious software v11.1.5 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Trimmomatic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was used for adaptor removal, trimming for quality and length with a phred score of 33 and a minimum length of 30 base pairs (bp). Acquired reads were aligned to the RefSeq viral nucleotide and protein genome database using MALT (MEGAN alignment tool, v0.3.8) and MEGAN (Metagenome Analyzer, v. 6.12.3) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Aligned reads were extracted and assembled into contigs using Velvet (v.1.2.10) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The contigs were mapped to closely related virus strains, checked for heterogeneity via visual inspection and pairwise identity values using Geneious software v11.1.5 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand).
