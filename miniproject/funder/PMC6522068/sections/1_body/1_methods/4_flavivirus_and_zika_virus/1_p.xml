<p>A nested PCR assay with degenerated primers targeting the NS5 region of the flavivirus genome was used for screening in the mosquito pools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The primers were reported to provide sensitive amplification of all insect-specific and major mosquito-borne flaviviruses including WNV, DENV, YFV, ZIKV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus and Usutu virus, strains with a detection limit of 40 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per reaction [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Assay optimization was undertaken using purified and serially-diluted nucleic acids from WNV NY99-4132 (standard) and T2 (local) isolates, grown on African green monkey (Vero) cells (ATCC- CCL81).
