<p>All pools were further tested individually for Zika virus, using the previously described real-time PCR assay targeting the envelope glycoprotein coding region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The primers ZIKV1086-1162c and probe ZIKV1107 were used for the single step amplification via QuantiNova Pathogen+IC Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) in a Rotor-Gene 6000 instrument (Corbett Research, Australia). The assay was reported to have a detection threshold of 25 copies per reaction [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Zika virus strain UVE/ZIKV/1947/UG/MR766 RNA, obtained from the European Virus Archive, was used for assay optimization and as the positive template during screening.
