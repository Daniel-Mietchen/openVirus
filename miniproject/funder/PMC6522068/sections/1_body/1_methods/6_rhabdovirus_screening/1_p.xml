<p>We further screened the mosquito pools for the recently-characterized rhabdovirus, tentatively named Merida-like virus Turkey (MERDLVT) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Two PCR assays, designed to amplify 481 and 160 base pairs from the L- and N- regions of the MERDLVT genome was used for screening the mosquito pools [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The assays were optimized using previously-collected positive mosquito pools.
