<p>In Turkey, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was initially recorded in eastern Thrace (Edirne province, bordering Greece) in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], along with detections from several Balkan countries including Bulgaria and Romania [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Following DDT-based eradication efforts in the 1950s, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was rarely identified around the Mediterranean basin, with only sporadic later reports from Turkey, Italy and Israel [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, both these invasive species were recently identified at several locations from the coastal Black Sea region of Turkey, with anthropophagic adults and immature aquatic stages in used tyres stored outdoors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Established populations of both species are present in neighboring Republic of Georgia suggesting local encroachment as the source of the Turkish populations. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> populations from various regions around the Black Sea demonstrate a high genetic differentiation and are hypothesized to represent expansions from remnant populations within the area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, a resurgence or reintroduction of viruses vectored by these species must be considered in NE Turkey, along with appropriate strategies for routine vector biosurveillance and control. Among mosquito-borne viral pathogens, West Nile virus (WNV) seems to be ubiquitous in Anatolia and Thrace regions, with several reported cases of human and equine infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, vector screening efforts have identified WNV in both 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in various regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. So far, no human infections due to indigenous transmission of DENV, YFV, CHIKV or ZIKV have been documented in Turkey. However, serological evidence of sporadic exposure to DENV or an antigenically-related flavivirus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as imported cases of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV have been reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007334.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we aimed to detect newly established populations of invasive mosquito species including 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in regions of the Black Sea coast and screen them for viral pathogens known to be transmitted by these species.
