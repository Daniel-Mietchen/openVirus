  <title>Background</title>
  <p>The recent reports of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> populations in Turkey, in parallel with the territorial expansion identified in several surrounding countries, have raised concerns about the establishment and re-establishment of these invasive 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in Turkey. This cross-sectional study was performed to detect 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> in regions of recent incursions, and screen for viral pathogens known to be transmitted elsewhere by these species.

  <title>Methodology</title>
  <p>Mosquitoes were collected at several locations in Artvin, Rize and Trabzon provinces of the Black Sea region during 2016–2017, identified morphologically, pooled and analyzed via generic or specific nucleic acid amplification assays. Viruses in positive pools were identified by product sequencing, cell culture inoculation and next generation sequencing (NGS) in selected specimens.</p>

  <title>Principal findings</title>
  <p>The study group comprised 791 specimens. 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was the most abundant species in all locations (89.6%), followed by 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> (7.8%) and 
   <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> (2.5%). Mosquitoes were screened for viruses in 65 pools where fifteen (23.1%) were reactive. The infecting strains was identified as West Nile virus (WNV) in 5 pools (7.7%) with 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic> or 
   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes. The obtained WNV sequences phylogenetically grouped with local and global lineage 1 clade 1a viruses. In 4 (6.2%) and 6 (9.2%) pools, respectively, cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) and 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> flavivirus (AEFV) sequences were characterized. NGS provided a near-complete AEFV genome in a pool of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>albopictus</italic>. The strain is provisionally called “AEFV-Turkey”, and functional analysis of the genome revealed several conserved motifs and regions associated with virus replication. Merida-like virus Turkey (MERDLVT), a recently-described novel rhabdovirus, was also co-detected in a 
   <italic>Cx</italic>. 
   <italic>pipiens</italic> pool also positive for WNV.

  <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
  <p>Invasive 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are established in certain locations of northeastern Turkey. Herein we conclusively show the role of these species in WNV circulation in the region. Biosurveillance is imperative to monitor the spread of these species further into Asia Minor and to detect possible introduction of pathogens.
