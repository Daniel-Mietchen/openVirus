<p>If the need for a software framework to assess surveillance systems has previously been recognized [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we could find no published precedent for a modular test bed where both case- and outbreak-detection methods can be interchanged. Because adjustments in statistical alarm thresholds are method-specific and their effect on FAR unpredictable, we used simulations to determine the relationship between FAR and detection delay empirically. A graphical representation of this relationship intuitively informed a performance trade-off of key concern to public health practitioners.
