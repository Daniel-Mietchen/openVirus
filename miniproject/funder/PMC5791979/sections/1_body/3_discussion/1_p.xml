<p>In this work, we found that modeling long-term trends and seasonality in disease incidence with SARIMA can improve the performance of EMR-based influenza surveillance compared to EARS, a method that considers the recent past only. The algorithms used to detect single ARI cases impacted both the feasibility of SARIMA modeling and the magnitude of the SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness. Under plausible conditions for our local health system, SARIMA could speed up epidemic detection by several days, a meaningful improvement considering how rapidly influenza can spread through a community [
