<p>We compared a CDA that used diagnostic codes, a staple data type for public health surveillance, to a CDA that took advantage of the EMR to cross-validate diagnostic codes with ARI symptoms documented in related clinical notes [

 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], adding that further timeliness can be achieved by incorporating historical data. Because we had previously measured the performance of these CDAs relative to a large reference record review [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we could augment the realism of our simulations by discounting the injected epidemic according to CDA sensitivity. This simulation framework supplied information that may prove helpful to public health practitioners: 1) insight into the achievable gains in detection timeliness could help justify investing into more complex epidemic detection approaches; 2) AMOC curves could be used to: a) adjust outbreak detection sensitivity according to a local jurisdictionâ€™s capacity to investigate alerts; or b) to estimate how much resources should be reallocated to surveillance activities during periods of increased threat [
