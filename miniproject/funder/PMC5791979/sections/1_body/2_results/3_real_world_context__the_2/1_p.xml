<p>To gain further insight into the practical usefulness of incorporating long-term historical data for ARI surveillance, we extended the CDA2-based surveillance system forward in time to include the summer of 2009, when the first wave of a pandemic of a novel H1N1 influenza strain (pH1N1) reached the US [

We avoided the time period immediately following the public announcement of the pandemic, as this period contained many visits from worried individuals but only sporadic laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases. Our comparison period thus began on May 24 and ended August 22, before the very large second wave of the epidemic reached Baltimore. During this period, there were peaks in laboratory-based surveillance for pH1N1 in Baltimore, MD, but no corresponding local peak of ARI visits observed in CDC's BioSense syndromic surveillance system.
