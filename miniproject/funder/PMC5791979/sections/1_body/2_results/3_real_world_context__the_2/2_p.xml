<p>During the summer 2009 comparison period, SARIMA identified more true-positive alarms than EARS at any FAR below 10% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191324.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The example shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191324.g004">Fig 4B</xref> highlights additional true positive alarms uncovered by SARIMA that were missed by EARS (red dots). Within this FAR range, both EARS and SARIMA identified the first true positive alarm, a large peak of ARI cases occurring 10 days into the comparison period. Thus, for this particular outbreak signal, the more sensitive SARIMA method offered no timeliness advantage over EARS.
