<p>In an initial set of simulations, we utilized either the EARS or the SARIMA outbreak detection methods on synthetic time series that exhibited seasonal increases in case counts typical of ARI. As expected, lowering the statistical alarm threshold decreased the time it took to discover the injected outbreak but increased the false-alarm rate (FAR). As the AMOC curves shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191324.g002">Fig 2</xref> illustrate, the relationship between the detection delay and the FAR was not linear, with a change around a low FAR producing a greater change in outbreak detection delay than a similar change around a high FAR.
