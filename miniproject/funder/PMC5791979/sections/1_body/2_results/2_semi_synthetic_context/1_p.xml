<p>To determine if the performance gains observed with SARIMA in all-synthetic contexts would translate into meaningful real-world benefits, we modified the simulations in two ways: 1) we ran previously validated ARI CDAs on a repository of our own EMR data to generate authentic historical time series of ARI cases [

To gain insight into year-to-year variation in system performance, we performed surveillance simulations over two different one-year time periods: a) 8/2002-7/2003, a year with an average ARI incidence; and b) 8/2003-7/2004, a year with a high seasonal incidence of ARIs.
