<p>Our results are confined to our experimental conditions and do not represent the final evolution of our own surveillance system, as we did not optimize individual system components, such as diagnostic code groupings, text analyses, case- or outbreak-detection approaches. The CDA- and SARIMA-related gains in detection timeliness may be related to characteristics of the epidemic, to the EMR software itself as well as to peculiarities in medical practices, care documentation and reimbursement. The EMR software and the processes of care that it supports could change over time. Thus, the performance of EMR-based systems may be more prone to variations than simpler systems, such as those based on stereotyped emergency room chief-complaints. The methods described in this work lack disease specificity compared to laboratory-based methods. Nevertheless, automated methods can incorporate available laboratory results and identify outbreaks for which diagnostic tests are not available. Their comparatively low costs also allow broad populations to be continuously monitored.</p>
