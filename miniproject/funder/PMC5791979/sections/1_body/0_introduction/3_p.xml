<p>With the EMR fast becoming commonplace [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], long-term EMR-derived datasets will soon be routinely available. In this context, we asked if statistical methods that consider long-term EMR data patterns could benefit ARI epidemic detection. Because most ARI result from viral diseases that exhibit marked seasonality, we hypothesized that fitting multi-year time-series of daily ARI case counts with seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models [

 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] could accelerate epidemic detection, compared to methods that base their forecasting on the recent past only [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used software to recreate surveillance systems operating prospectively on synthetic or authentic historical datasets. Our results suggest that, under realistic surveillance conditions, SARIMA could help shorten outbreak detection delay.
