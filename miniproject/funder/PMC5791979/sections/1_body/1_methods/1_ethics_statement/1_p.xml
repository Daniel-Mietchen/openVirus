<p>The Institutional Review Boards of the Veterans Administration (VA) Maryland Health Care System and the University of Maryland approved this study. The study was granted a waiver of consent, as risks were limited to information confidentiality, because the research-related risks were minimal and did not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants, and because the work would not have otherwise been feasible, given the large number of participants. All EMR information was de-identified prior to simulations and analyses, which used only daily case counts.</p>
