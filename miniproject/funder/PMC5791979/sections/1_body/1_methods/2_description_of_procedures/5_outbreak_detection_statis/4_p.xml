<p>Putative models were explored interactively to search for the most appropriate SARIMA form for each time series. The models coefficients were then estimated and their statistical significance evaluated. Some coefficients of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) at lags of 260 and multiples of 260 were statistically significant, confirming that seasonal model components should be included. Overall model adequacy was assessed by comparing model-generated counts to the actual counts used for model building. SARIMA models were finally retained for surveillance implementation when they best fulfilled the following criteria: 1) minimum Akaike's Information Criterion value; 2) minimum mean absolute deviation of errors; 3) minimum root mean square root error; 4) normality of residuals; 5) parsimony. Each of the sixteen SARIMA models was used daily to forecast the next dayâ€™s case count in their respective times series during the study periods. With each passing day, the models updated themselves to incorporate the latest information into the forecasting procedure.</p>
