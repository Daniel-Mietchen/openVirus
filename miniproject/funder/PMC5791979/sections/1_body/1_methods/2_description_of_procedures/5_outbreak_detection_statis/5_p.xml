<p>The final SARIMA models for weekday ARI counts were of the form SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)
 <sub>260</sub> for CDA1 and CDA2, but were of a different form for the synthetic backgrounds i.e. SARIMA (0,1,1)(1,0,1)
 <sub>260</sub> and SARIMA (1,0,1) (1,0,1)
 <sub>260</sub> for the s17 and the s33 time series, respectively. Models for the weekend ARI counts were all of the form SARIMA (1,0,1)(0,1,1)
 <sub>104</sub>. Case counts retrieved by CDA3 were low, and did not allow SARIMA modeling.
