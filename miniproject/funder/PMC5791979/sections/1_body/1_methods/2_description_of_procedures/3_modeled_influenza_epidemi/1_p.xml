<p>We developed an epidemic model of influenza to supply a plausible outbreak signal with which we could compare alternative surveillance system constructs [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The model includes coupled series of differential equations [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] adjusted to describe an epidemic of severe, 1918-like influenza, propagating through a susceptible population with the size, age structure, and age-specific birth and death rates described for Baltimore, MD [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The proportion of community cases presenting to the VA Maryland Health Care System was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The model, its settings and documentation are provided as 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191324.s002">S2 File</xref>). Prior to injection, the modeled epidemic case counts were first discounted by the known sensitivity of the ARI CDA used to generate the background cases [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191324.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows an example of the modeled influenza outbreak injected into an authentic background.
