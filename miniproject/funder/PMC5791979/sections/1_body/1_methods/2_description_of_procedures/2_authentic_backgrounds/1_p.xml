<p>EMR entries were extracted from Veterans Integrated Service Technology Architecture hierarchical databases (MDE v.6.1.0.0, Strategic Reporting Systems, Inc. Peabody MA) and transferred to relational databases (SQL Server 2008, Microsoft Corp, Redmond CA). We used case detection algorithms (CDA) previously developed against a manual record review seeking reference ARI cases, defined as: [Positive influenza culture/antigen OR Any two of the following, of no more than 7 days duration: cough; fever or chills or night sweats; pleuritic chest pain; myalgia; sore throat; headache] AND Illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We chose the following ARI CDAs: a) CDA1 (sensitivity 63%, positive predictive value (PPV) 13%) retrieved outpatient visits where provider assigned a diagnostic code (International Classification of Diseases, 9
 <sup>th</sup> version) included in an ARI-related set used by a surveillance system of national scope [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; b) CDA2 (sensitivity 69%, PPV 54%) retrieved outpatient visits assigned a diagnostic code that belonged to a grouping modified for increased performance at the VA [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]), and where automated text analysis of the visit-related clinical note(s) identified at least two symptoms from the above ARI case definition [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. CDA2 was chosen because its use resulted in the highest epidemic detection performance amongst eight (8) alternative ARI case-detection methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], illustrating the gains in system performance that could be achieved by combining different EMR data fields compared to using diagnostic codes alone; c) CDA3 retrieved CDA2 patients subset with a core body temperature of more than 37.8°C measured on the day of their index visit (sensitivity 71%, PPV 68%). Our rationale for choosing CDA3 was that while its high performance could translate into timely epidemic detection, low daily case counts could represent a challenging substrate for time series modeling. To generate CDA-specific time series of daily case counts, each ARI CDA was applied to a relational database containing EMR documentation of outpatient clinical encounters [
 <xref rid="pone.0191324.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] over a 7-year period, from January 1999 to December 2005. These time series formed the basis for the authentic “backgrounds” used for the whole-system simulations (see

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191324.t001">Table 1</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191324.s001">S1 File</xref>). EMR data included in CDA 1–3 have been extracted daily at the VAMHCS. Thus, any of the CDA tested could be incorporated in a prospective surveillance system.
