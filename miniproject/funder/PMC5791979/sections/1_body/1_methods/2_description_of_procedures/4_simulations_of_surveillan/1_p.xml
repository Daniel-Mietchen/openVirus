<p>We wrote software to simulate prospective surveillance systems operating on the authentic historical background datasets described above (R v. 2.10.1, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). The software began a surveillance cycle on the day when the modeled epidemic signal was injected into a background time series. Starting on the injection day, and then daily for a total of 80 days, a statistical outbreak detection method (see below) was applied in parallel to the background+epidemic (Combined) time series, and to the “Background-only” time series. The value of the statistic for each day was stored for subsequent analysis. The 80-day surveillance cycle was repeated, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the two, one-year study periods (from August 1
 <sup>st</sup> 2002 to July 31
 <sup>st</sup> 2003, and from August 1
 <sup>st</sup> 2003 to July 31
 <sup>st</sup> 2004). In a final phase, the software applied a family of threshold values beyond which the computed daily statistics would constitute an “alarm”. On a given day and for a given threshold, an alarm that originated in the Background-only time series was considered a “false alarm”. An alarm present in the Combined dataset but absent from the Background-only dataset was considered a “true alarm” (

For a given alarm threshold, the software computed two benchmarks: 1) the “Detection Delay”, the time from outbreak injection to the first true alarm, averaged for the 52 weekly surveillance cycles for a given one-year study period; 2) the daily false alarm rate (FAR), defined as the number of unique false alarms during the evaluation year, divided by 365 days. Corresponding pairs of Detection Delay and FAR were computed over broad ranges of alarm thresholds and used to plot CDA-specific activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [
