  <title>Performance comparisons: More realistic, semi-synthetic context.</title>
  <p>AMOC curves describing the performance of surveillance systems at detecting a modeled influenza epidemic injected into authentic backgrounds obtained by implementing CDA1 in 2002–2003 (panel A) or in 2003–2004 (panel B), and CDA2 in 2002–2003 (panel C) or in 2003–2004 (panel D). Outbreak detection methods were either EARS (open black symbols) or SARIMA (closed red symbols).</p>
