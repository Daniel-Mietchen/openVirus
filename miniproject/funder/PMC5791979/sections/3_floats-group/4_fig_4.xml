  <title>Performance comparisons: pH1N1 pandemic.</title>
  <p>Panel A: Number of true-positive alarms (y-axis) as a function of daily FAR (x-axis) for the full summer of 2009 comparison period. Note that SARIMA (red circles) issued more true alarms than EARS (black diamonds) at any FAR. Panel B: Daily counts of authentic ARI cases (y-axis) during the summer of 2009 comparison period (x-axis). True alarms at a 3% FAR were issued by SARIMA alone on the days highlighted by red circles, EARS alone (black diamond) or by both SARIMA and EARS (green squares). Note that the first alarm of the time period is recognized by both statistical approaches (see text).</p>
