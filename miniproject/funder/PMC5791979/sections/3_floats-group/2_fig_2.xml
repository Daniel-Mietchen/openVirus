  <title>Performance comparisons: Synthetic contexts.</title>
  <p>Activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves showing average detection delay (y-axis) as a function of daily false alarm rate (x-axis) for discovering a synthetic outbreak signal introduced into the s17 (panel A) or s33 (panel B) synthetic background time series of daily case counts. Aberrancy detection was performed using either EARS (open black symbols) or SARIMA (closed red symbols).</p>
