  <title>Comparing surveillance systems performance.</title>
  <p>Y-axis shows daily case counts (panel A) and corresponding EARS (panel B) and SARIMA statistics (panel C) as a function of time (x-axis) for an 80-day period extracted from a multiyear time series of authentic ARI cases (red rectangle region from the blue tracing insert in panel A). Black circles plot values due to background ARI cases only; red diamonds plot values due to background + injected epidemic cases. Note that at equivalent thresholds, corresponding to a 1% FAR (horizontal blue lines in panels B and C), the first true positive alarm (vertical dashed lines in panels B and C) occurs earlier with SARIMA (day 29, panel C) than with EARS (day 46, panel B).</p>
