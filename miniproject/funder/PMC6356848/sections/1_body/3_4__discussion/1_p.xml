<p>Laboratory diagnosis of viral infection is usually done by detection of virus-specific antibodies in the blood, detection of virus antigens or detection of viral nucleic acids. However, for alphavirus infections, nucleic acid detection can only be used in the short viremic phase, which lasts about one week [

To determine the neutralizing activity of antibodies or drugs, conventional neutralization assays, such as plaque reduction assays or the inhibition of cytopathogenic effects, have to be used. These assays are time consuming and rely on the use of fully infectious human pathogens. CHIKV and MAYV have to be handled in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories. The assays are labor intense and are difficult to automate. Pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles have the cell entry capacity of the authentic virus and can be used for the detection of neutralizing antibodies in semi-automated, high-throughput formats and at lower biosafety levels [
