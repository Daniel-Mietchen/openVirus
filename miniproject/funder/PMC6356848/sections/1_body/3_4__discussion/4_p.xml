<p>The assay can easily be expanded to include more envelope proteins of alphaviruses and will enable screening of neutralizing activities against all alphaviruses within one assay. In addition, the alphavirus-neutralization assay will be helpful for alphavirus vaccine development. As CHIKV infections in immunological na√Øve populations can cause large epidemics which decline quickly due to the high infection rates and subsequent development of herd immunity, clinical vaccine efficacy trials are almost impossible. Neutralization titers might be suitable correlates of protection for licensure of vaccines directed against CHIKV or other alphaviruses. </p>
