<p>The neutralization assay might be helpful for determining the global distribution of different alphaviruses particularly since commercial ELISAs are currently unavailable for some alphaviruses. However, this, as well as other assays are unable to discriminate very closely related viruses, as shown here for ONNV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Due to globalization, expansion and adaptation to vectors and air traffic, the spread of alphaviruses is likely and has happened recently with CHIKV, which has spread rapidly in South America [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and recent localized introductions into Europe have been reported [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Screening of patient samples or blood donors might help to identify outbreaks of alphavirus infections. These data might also indicate if alphavirus-specific antibodies cross-protect against another alphavirus infection or even enhance a second alphavirus infection or its disease severity [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Monoclonal antibodies with inhibitory activity against multiple alphaviruses have been identified and were able to protect mice in a challenge model [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, cross-reactive antibodies against multiple alphaviruses might be another desired goal for vaccine development and the assay could be helpful to assess this.
