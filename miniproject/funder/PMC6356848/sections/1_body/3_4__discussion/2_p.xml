<p>Next, we established a semi-automated neutralization assay for four different alphaviruses, using pseudotyped lentiviral vector particles and quantification by luciferase activity. This assay can be performed under BSL-2 conditions in contrast to working with the infectious virus, which requires BSL-3. The assay has a small reaction size of 40 Î¼L, which minimizes the amount of sample material required. The automated performance of the assay, including the seeding of target cells, makes it fast and convenient. The co-screening of multiple alphavirus-pseudotyped vectors enables the identification of the specificity of antisera. In contrast, ELISA assays showed cross-reactivity among different alphaviruses (

The antigens in ELISAs are denatured proteins, while the lentiviral particles display the E3-E1 complex in its native three-dimensional structure and might be superior antigens compared to those used in ELISA assays.
