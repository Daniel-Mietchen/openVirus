<p>In contrast, CHIKV was first described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1953, but since then has been identified in nearly 60 countries worldwide [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. CHIKV spread was rapidly accelerated through a point mutation in its E1 protein, which improved transmission by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is confined to the tropics and sub-tropics, however, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> also occurs in temperate and even cold temperate regions and has spread from Asia to moderate climate zones in Africa, Europe and the Americas [
