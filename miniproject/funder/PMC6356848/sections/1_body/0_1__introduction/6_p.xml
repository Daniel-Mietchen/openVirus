<p>Currently, these alphaviruses are nearly globally distributed, and although their distribution is geographically distinct, there is a serious risk of their worldwide spread due to globalization and air traffic. Evidence for such an explosive spread of an arbovirus in a naïve population was provided by the recent infections with ZIKA in Brazil and CHIKV in Latin America [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, monitoring of alphavirus infections is necessary and requires specific diagnostic methods. Although CHIKV and O’nyong nyong virus (ONNV), MAYV and Una virus (UNV) and RRV and Sagiama virus (SAGV) are closely related, we decided to compare the viruses that cause disease in humans and that are either geographically close such as CHIKV and MAYV or currently geographically distinct such as RRV [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Cross-protective immunity against ONNV and induction of ONNV neutralizing antibodies has been described before for an experimental CHIKV vaccine [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ONNV and CHIKV are 86% identical and this indicates that some closely related alphaviruses cannot be distinguished. RRV, MAYV and CHIKV ELISAs are commercially available and some CHIKV ELISA kits detect MAYV-specific IgG, since CHIKV and MAYV cross-react in ELISAs [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. RRV-specific sera also show some cross-reactivity to CHIKV [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To demonstrate the specificity of antibodies directed against MAYV, RRV or CHIKV, serum neutralization tests are necessary. Therefore we established a neutralization assay and characterized the neutralizing specificity of patient and blood donor plasma samples.
