<p>Alphaviruses are predominantly transmitted by mosquitoes and cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. The Old-World alphaviruses, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV), and the phylogenetically related Ross River virus (RRV) and Mayaro (MAYV) cause arthralgia in animals and humans. In contrast, New World viruses, such as Venezuelan (VEEV), eastern (EEEV), and western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV) are encephalitic. SFV can cause encephalitis in rodents, but only mild symptoms in humans [
