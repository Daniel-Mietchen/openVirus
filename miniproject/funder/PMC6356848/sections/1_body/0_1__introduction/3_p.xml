<p>Although CHIKV, MAYV and RRV are related and cause similar disease symptoms, these viruses show different geographic distributions, dependent upon, hosts and vector utilization. MAYV was first isolated in Trinidad in 1954; since then, sporadic cases, clusters, and small epidemics of Mayaro fever have been reported from remote regions in Latin America especially the Amazon basin, but also from the city of Manaus in northern Brazil [
