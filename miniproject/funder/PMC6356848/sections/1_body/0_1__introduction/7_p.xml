<p>To develop an alphavirus neutralization assay, we extended the use of a pseudotyped lentiviral vector system [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Alphaviruses have a positive-sense single stranded RNA viral genome and enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and a subsequent pH-dependent fusion step. The early steps of infection, such as receptor binding and membrane fusion, are carried out by the viral glycoproteins, which are the major target of neutralizing antibody responses. Pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors with the glycoproteins of alphaviruses generates vectors that acquire the host range of alphaviruses. They enable studies without the need to use the native virus, which usually requires a higher laboratory biosafety level. Pseudotyped vectors are frequently used to study viral entry and to evaluate entry inhibitors [
