<p>The samples were used blinded for the alphavirus neutralization assay. BFV-pseudotyped vectors were additionally included. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined and their reciprocal values are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f006">Figure 6</xref>. All samples except E were able to neutralize RRV-pseudotyped vector particles, indicated by a high reciprocal IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f006">Figure 6</xref>). These data confirmed the ELISA assays, which showed that sample E was negative for RRV whereas all other samples were RRV-positive (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast to the ELISA tests, no cross-reactivity with CHIKV or MAYV was observed, implying a higher specificity of the assay. Additionally, RRV could be discriminated from BFV neutralizing activity.
