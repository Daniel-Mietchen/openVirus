<p>MAYV-specific ELISAs are commercially available but cross-reactivity can be problematic [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and an assay able to quickly identify MAYV neutralizing antibodies is still lacking. Therefore, plasma samples from MAYV-, CHIKV- and DENV-infected patients were used to perform a neutralization assay using MAYV-, CHIKV- or VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors with the intention of determining the specificity of the neutralizing antibodies present in the plasma. Vector particles and serially diluted patient plasma were added to HEK 293T cells in 384-well plates. Transduction of target cells by MAYV- or CHIKV-pseudotyped vector particles could be inhibited with the respective plasma from the infected patients. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the dose-dependent luciferase activity were calculated and their reciprocal values are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f004">Figure 4</xref>, where high values indicate neutralization. Plasma from the MAYV-infected patient showed a strong inhibition of MAYV-pseudotyped vectors and a less efficient inhibition of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). This was reversed with plasma from the CHIKV-infected patient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). There was a slight cross-neutralization detectable between CHIKV and MAYV; however, specificity was indicated by the higher neutralizing activity of the specific serum (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). There was no inhibitory effect on luciferase activity after incubation of VSV-G-, MAYV- or CHIKV-pseudotyped vector particles with plasma from a DENV-infected patient or the normal healthy control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). In summary, MAYV-specific neutralizing antibodies could be discriminated from CHIKV-specific antibodies.
