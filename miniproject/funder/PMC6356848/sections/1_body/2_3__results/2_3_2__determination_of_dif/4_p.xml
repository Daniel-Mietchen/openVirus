<p>To confirm the ability of the assay to determine the specificity of the sera, six plasma samples (marked with letters Aâ€“F) from Australian blood donors were first analyzed by ELISA for antibodies directed against RRV or Barmah Forest virus (BFV) virus. BFV is another Old World alphavirus only found in Australia with clinical signs similar to the other Old World alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Five samples were positive for RRV IgG and three were positive for BFV IgG by ELISA. Testing for CHIKV IgG was performed with kits from two manufacturers and showed divergent results, highlighting the issue of cross-reactivity of antibodies against different alphaviruses in diagnostic tests. In addition, the four CHIKV-positive samples were also positive in a MAYV-specific ELISA, again showing cross-reactivity.
