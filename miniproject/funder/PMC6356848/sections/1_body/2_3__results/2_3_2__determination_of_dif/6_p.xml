<p>Next, we analyzed plasma samples of three patients from Brazil, of whom one sample was included in the study in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Samples of the patients were available from time points before the CHIKV infection. Day 0 of the CHIKV infection was defined as the onset of clinical symptoms such as fever, rash and joint pain. The CHIKV infection was confirmed by ELISA (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All samples were analyzed with alphavirus-pseudotyped vectors and for control with VSV-G pseudotyped vectors. The reciprocal IC

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Between day 11 and 13, a drastic increase in CHIKV-specific neutralizing activity was detectable. Neutralization of MAYV-, RRV- and SFV-pseudotyped vectors increased only slightly. VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors were not neutralized by the patient samples. These data indicate again, that this assay discriminates between alphavirus-specific neutralizing antibodies.
