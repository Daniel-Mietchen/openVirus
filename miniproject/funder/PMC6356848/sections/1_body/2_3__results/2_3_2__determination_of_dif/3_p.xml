<p>The samples were blinded and screened with CHIKV- and MAYV-pseudotyped vectors. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the neutralization assay were determined (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and are given as reciprocal values in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The ratio between MAYV and CHIKV IC
 <sub>50</sub> values is given in the last lane and indicates that a ratio above 1 determines CHIKV-specific neutralization. As a control, the MAYV-specific serum, a naïve human serum and a CHIKV-specific serum were analyzed. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f005">Figure 5</xref>, five of the blinded sera were CHIKV positive, indicated by reciprocal IC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 1000 with CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors (red bars) and values below 800 for MAYV-pseudotyped vectors (blue bars). The reciprocal IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the MAYV-specific serum was 4847 when analyzed with MAYV-pseudotyped vectors and only 774 with CHIKV-psudotyped vectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The plasma from a naïve donor and the two DENV- and/or ZIKV-positive samples had values below 100 and were correctly identified as CHIKV and MAYV negative. Although the MAYV-specific plasma gave a positive signal in a CHIKV-specific ELISA (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00082-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it could be identified here as MAYV-specific. Therefore, the reciprocal IC
 <sub>50</sub> values can be used to determine the specificity of the sera. Very low values in both assays indicate non-specific reactivity.
