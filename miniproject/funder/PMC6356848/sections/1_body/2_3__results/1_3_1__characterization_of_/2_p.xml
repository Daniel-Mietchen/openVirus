<p>Since the cellular tropism of CHIKV, RRV and SFV-pseudotyped vectors has been described previously [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we were interested in determining the cellular tropism of MAYV-pseudotyped vector particles. Tissue culture cell lines were transduced with MAYV-, CHIKV- or VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors encoding firefly luciferase. Transduction efficiency was determined again by luminescence. Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with the VSV-G protein were used as a positive control, since they are known for their very broad cellular tropism. MAYV- and CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors transduced mouse, hamster, and human cell lines, which is in agreement with published data for CHIKV and shows, for the first time, that the MAYV cell tropism is similar to that of CHIKV [
