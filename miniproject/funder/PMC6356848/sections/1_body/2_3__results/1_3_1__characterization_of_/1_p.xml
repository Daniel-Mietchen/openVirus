<p>Lentiviral vector particles pseudotyped with VSV-G, or the MAYV, RRV, SFV or CHIKV glycoproteins (E3-E1) were generated by transfection of 293T cells with the following plasmids: a lentiviral vector genome encoding the firefly luciferase gene, the lentiviral packaging vectors and a plasmid encoding VSV-G, or the MAYV, RRV, SFV or CHIKV glycoproteins E3-E1. Two days after the transfection, cell supernatants, except those containing VSV-G pseudotypes, were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and titrated on 293T cells.

 <sup>8</sup>–10
 <sup>9</sup> RLU/mL and pseudotyping with the CHIKV E3-E1 protein was superior to RRV, SFV and MAYV.
