<p>Next, a neutralization assay was performed with the alphavirus-pseudotyped vector particles, in order to analyze cross-reactivity of antibodies in plasma of CHIKV-infected patients. A volume of vector particles corresponding to 30,000 RLU was used. Neutralization was expressed as a percentage of the untreated transduction control. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, the CHIKV-specific plasma had the highest neutralization activity towards CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors, followed by the specific ONNV-pseudotyped vectors. CHIKV immunization has been described before to cross-neutralize and cross-protect mice from an ONNV infection [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This shows the limitation of this assay, but also a general problem of discriminating closely related viruses. However, the CHIKV-specific plasma also showed partial neutralization of MAYV-, RRV- and SFV-pseudotyped vectors (

 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), the following order of neutralization was established: CHIKV &gt; MAYV &gt; RRV &gt; SFV &gt; VSV. The VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors were only marginally affected (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00082-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Plasma samples that were treated with heparin should not be used for the assay, because heparin inhibits the transduction of alphavirus as well as VSV-G pseudotyped vectors [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore VSV-G pseudotyped vectors were used as a control in further analysis.
