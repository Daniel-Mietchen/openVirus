<p>Transduction of cells for luciferase assays was started by seeding 6000 HEK 293T cells per well in a white CELLSTAR 384-well microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) in a volume of 20 µL DMEM using the MultiFlo Microplate Dispenser (BioTek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, 10 µL of luciferase encoding lentiviral vector particles (pseudotyped with VSV-G, CHIKV or MAYV Env; corresponding to a volume that would give 30,000 RLU if left untreated) plus 10 µL diluted human plasma was added to the cells using a Matrix Multichannel Equalizer Electronic Pipette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany). The amount of 30,000 RLU was chosen because the upper limit of the readout is 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> RLU and the neutralization activity was found to be stabile for vector particles corresponding to 30,000 or 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> RLU/mL. The lowest value was chosen to keep the amount of vector particles as low as possible to save reagents. Plasma dilutions ranged from 1:30 to 1:7290 (1:3 dilutions), and were mixed 1:1 with the vector particles, resulting in a final dilution of 1:60 to 1:14,580 in a volume of 20 µL. Plasma was diluted with DMEM. The vector particle–plasma mixtures were incubated in 96-U-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt) at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently added to the 384-well plates. From every dilution/well in the 96-well plate, 20 µL were transferred to three wells each of the 384-well plate (triplicate assay) and resulted in a total reaction volume of 40 µL. After 16 h of incubation, BriteLite (PerkinElmer, Rodgau, Germany) substrate (20 µL) was added to each well, and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The luciferase signal was detected with a PHERAstar FS microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany).
