<p>The gene for the MAYV E3-E1 envelope polyprotein was synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Darmstadt, Germany) on the basis of the sequence of a virus isolate from the Venezuela outbreak in 2010 (accession number ALI88638, codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells). The gene was first cut with 
 <italic>Pac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Asc</italic>I, blunt ended, and then cloned into the plasmid pIRES2-eGFP (digested with 
 <italic>Sma</italic>I). This plasmid allows expression of genes as a bicistronic mRNA with the eGFP gene under the control of a CMV promoter. A similar strategy was used to insert the codon optimized ONNV (Gulu strain, accession number P22056) or BFV (accession number NP_054024) E3-E1 genes. The plasmids pMDLg/pRRE (encoding lentiviral Gag/Pol), pRSVrev (encoding HIV-1 Rev) [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00082" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were used for the production of vector particles. The expression plasmids for RRV E3-E1 (T48 RRV strain) and SFV E3-E1 (A7 SFV strain) in pcDNA were a kind gift of David A. Sanders, Purdue University, West Lafayette, USA [
