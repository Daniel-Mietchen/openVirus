<p>Determination of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were performed using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software (La Jolla, CA, USA) as nonlinear regression and gives as log(inhibitor) vs. response (three parameter, constrain equal to 0). IC
 <sub>50</sub> values represent the dilution factor of the plasma sample to obtain 50% inhibition of pseudotyped vector transduction and are given without units. The mean values and standard deviations were calculated in Excel.
