<p>The titer of the luciferase-encoding lentiviral vectors was determined by transduction of HEK 293T with serial two-fold dilutions of vector particles in triplicates. After 16 h of incubation, the luciferase activity was measured in each well as described above. The titer was determined as luciferase units/mL. </p>
