<p>HEK 293T cells in 10 cm dishes were cotransfected using Lipofectamine
 <sup>®</sup> 2000 (according to the manufacturer’s protocol; Thermo Fisher, Darmstadt, Germany) with the following amounts of plasmid DNA: 10 µg pCSII-Luc, 6.5 µg pMDLg/pRRE, 2.5 µg pRSVrev, 3.5 µg pHIT-G (encoding VSV-G), and 5.3 µg pIRES2-eGFP-CHIKV, pIRES2-eGFP-MAYV E3-E1, pcDNA-RRV, pcDNA-SFV. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by 5 mL of fresh DMEM per dish. Twenty-four hours later, the supernatant containing vector particle was harvested, sterile filtered with 0.45 µm filters (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany), and ultracentrifuged (1 h at 50,000 rpm, rotor TLA 100.3; Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany) to concentrate the volume 100-fold; the particles were resuspended in DMEM and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors were frozen without concentration by ultracentrifugation.
