  <p>Analysis of plasma samples of three patients. Human plasma samples were tested blinded in serial dilution, incubated with alphavirus- and VSV-G-pseudotyped vector particles and evaluated for neutralizing activity by detection of relative luciferase activities as a percentage of the untreated control. The reciprocal IC
   <sub>50</sub> values are depicted and were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software. The onset of symptoms was on day 0.
