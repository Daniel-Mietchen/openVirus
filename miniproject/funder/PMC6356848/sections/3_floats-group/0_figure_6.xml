  <p>Blinded analysis of patient plasma samples. Human plasma samples (A-F) were tested blinded in serial dilution, incubated with alphavirus- and VSV-G-pseudotyped vector particles and evaluated for neutralizing activity by detection of relative luciferase activities as a percentage of the untreated control. The reciprocal IC
   <sub>50</sub> values are depicted and were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software, (GraphPad, San Diego, USA).
