 <caption>
  <p>Blinded analysis of patient plasmas and graphic presentation of reciprocal IC
   <sub>50</sub> values. The blinded samples (T1â€“T7) were serial diluted, incubated with CHIKV- or MAYV-pseudotyped vector particles, and evaluated for neutralizing activity by detection of relative luciferase activities as a percentage of the untreated control. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software and the reciprocal IC
   <sub>50</sub> value are depicted for samples analyzed with CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors (red) or MAYV-pseudotyped vectors (blue).
