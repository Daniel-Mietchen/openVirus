  <p>Transduction of 293T cells in the presence of human serum from a CHIKV-infected patient. HEK293T cells were transduced with CHIKV (blue), VSV-G (grey), MAYV (black), RRV (yellow), SFV (red) or Oâ€™nyong nyong virus (ONNV) (dark grey) pseudotyped vectors encoding luciferase. Transduction was analyzed as relative luciferase activity and presented as % of untreated control on a log scale. (
   <bold>A</bold>): Plasma from a CHIKV-infected patient (
   <bold>B</bold>) Serum or plasma either treated with citrate, EDTA or heparin from a healthy individual as control. The values represent mean values of triplicate measurements and IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The reciprocal IC
   <sub>50</sub> values from (A) are depicted to illustrate CHIKV-specific neutralization activity.
