  <p>Analysis of patient samples. Plasma from (
   <bold>A</bold>) a MAYV-infected patient, (
   <bold>B</bold>) a CHIKV infected patient, (
   <bold>C</bold>) a dengue virus (DENV)-infected patient or (
   <bold>D</bold>) or a healthy control was serially diluted, incubated with CHIKV-, MAYV- or VSV-G-pseudotyped vector particles and analyzed for neutralizing activity by detection of relative luciferase activities. IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 7.04 software and their reciprocal values are shown as an indication of neutralization activity. The values are the mean values of three independent (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) experiments performed in triplicate. Only two experiments (
   <italic>n</italic> = 2) were performed with the dengue plasma.
