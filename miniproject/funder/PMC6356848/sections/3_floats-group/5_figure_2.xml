  <p>Transduction of tissue culture cells. Different tissue culture cells were transduced with VSV-G (grey), CHIKV (blue) or MAYV (black) pseudotyped vectors encoding luciferase. Transduction was analyzed as relative luciferase activity and is presented as % of transduction of HEK293T cells. The values are averages of the mean for triplicate experiments.</p>
