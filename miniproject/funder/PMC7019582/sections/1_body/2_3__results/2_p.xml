<p>The WHO definition of ILI showed the highest sensitivity (82%) and the lowest specificity (37%), whereas the ECDC ILI case definition showed the lowest sensitivity (58%) and the highest specificity (52%). The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the WHO case definition for ILI, in both all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42–2.99) and in epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90–2.54). The ECDC acute respiratory infection (ARI) definition had the worst performance (aDOR 1.45; 95% CI 1.33–1.58 for all weeks and 1.36; 95% CI 1.21–1.54 for epidemic weeks). The clinical manifestations that were significant positive predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and a sudden onset of symptoms. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38–4.80) and in epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21–3.50;
