<p>To calculate the crude DOR for each case definition and symptom, logistic regression models with the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza were constructed. To calculate the adjusted DOR (aDOR), multivariate logistic regression models adjusted by age, sex, comorbidities, and season were constructed using backward selection. The analysis was performed using the SPSS version 25 statistical package and R version 3.5.0 statistical software.</p>
