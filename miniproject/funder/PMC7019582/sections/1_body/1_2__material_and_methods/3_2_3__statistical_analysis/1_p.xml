<p>To investigate the performance of different case definitions and symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, crude and adjusted DOR, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) [

The analyses were carried out considering all influenza A and B viruses jointly and influenza A and influenza B viruses separately.
