<p>For the WHO and ECDC ILI case definitions, the overall sensitivities were 82% and 58%, and the specificities were 37% and 52%, respectively. A 2009–2014 French study [

The differences may be because we only knew that patients had a temperature of &gt;37.8 °C, instead of the required temperature of ≥38 °C stated in the WHO definition, and because in the French sentinel network, the ARI definition was an inclusion criterion, and nearly all patients included in the dataset had fever [
