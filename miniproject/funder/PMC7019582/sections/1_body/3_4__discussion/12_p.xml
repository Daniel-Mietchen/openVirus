<p>A United States study [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00095" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] found that measured or reported fever had a better capacity to discriminate the risk of true influenza infection than measured fever alone (DOR 1.95; 95% CI 1.73–2.20 and 1.79; 95% CI 1.59–2.0, respectively), with the performance of cough (DOR 6.99; 95% CI 5.60–8.73) being better than for cough and reported or measured fever (DOR 3.18; 95% CI 2.83–3.57).
