<p>We found that sore throat was not a predictor of confirmed influenza in all weeks or in epidemic weeks, and was a discrete predictor only in the &lt;5 years age group (aDOR 1.33; 95% CI 1.09–1.63). Likewise, it was not a significant predictor of confirmed influenza in all age groups in the United States study by Shah et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00095" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in 2009–2011, which found that the most discriminating clinical manifestations, with an aDOR &gt;3, were cough and fever. Our results support the removal of sore throat from the clinical case definition in order to improve performance, as suggested by other authors [
