<p>A 2007–2008 United States study by Woolpert et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00095" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that independent predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza in the 6–49 years age group were cough and fever (aDOR 47.99; 95% CI 6.29–366.13 and 3.84; 95% CI 2.23–6.61, respectively), although acute symptom onset and, to a lesser extent, myalgia, were also predictors of laboratory-confirmed influenza. In our study, myalgia was a predictor in all age groups, but the sudden onset of symptoms was a poor predictor in adults. Unlike our results, where headache had the third best performance (aDOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.78–2.12), other authors found headache had the best performance (DOR 21.2; 95% CI 5.2–86.4) [
