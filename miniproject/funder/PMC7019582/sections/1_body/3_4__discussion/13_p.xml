<p>In the study by Casalegno et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00095" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which was carried out in weeks 40 to 15, but not specifically in epidemic weeks, cough had the best performance (aDOR 2.53; 95% CI 2.23–290), with the best values in people aged ≥65 years (aDOR 5.55; 95% CI 2.67–11.52). In all weeks in our study, cough clearly performed worse than fever, with the best value in people aged 5–14 years rather than in older people.
