<p>Another French study [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] during the 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 seasons concluded that the ILI ECDC definition performed poorly in tracking influenza epidemics, and suggested that the case definition adopted in any country should include fever. Our results support this idea, as the ARI case definition, which does not include fever, had the worst performance in confirmed influenza cases, both for all influenza A and B viruses jointly, and influenza A or B virus separately.
