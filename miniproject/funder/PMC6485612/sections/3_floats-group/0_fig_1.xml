  <title>Chikungunya E and VLP design and verification.</title>
  <p>A] Schematic representation of CHIK gene insertion into bacmid. B] PCR verification of C-E; truncated, N-terminal his-tagged E1, and truncated, N-terminal his-tagged E2 clones. C] Expression of CHIK VLPs were verified by Western blot analysis using anti-E Chk48 monoclonal antibody. D] Soluble, his-tagged E1 was purified via chromatography using NiNTA agarose beads and the different fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE with PageBlue protein staining solution. Purified, soluble E1 was detected by western blot using anti-E1 polyclonal sera generated in C57BL/6J mice. E] Soluble, his-tagged E2 was purified via chromatography using NiNTA agarose beads and the different fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE with PageBlue protein staining solution. Purified, soluble E2 was detected by western blot using anti-E2 polyclonal sera generated in C57BL/6J mice.</p>
