  <title>Chikungunya antigen-specific, IgG antibody responses in adult vs aged mice.</title>
  <p>Vaccine responses in adult and aged C57BL/6J mice were evaluated 8 weeks [three vaccine doses] post-initial vaccination with each VLP-based vaccine formulation delivered via intramuscular [IM] injections, or PBS. ELISAs were performed to evaluate anti-VLP responses: A] total IgG, B] IgG1, C] IgG2c, and D] IgG3. Anti-E1 responses are shown as E] total IgG, F] IgG1, G] IgG2c, and H] IgG3. Anti-E2 responses are shown as I] IgG, J] IgG1, K] IgG2c, and L] IgG3. Mean Â± standard error [SEM] are reported. One-way, two-tailed ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-hoc tests were performed: # significantly different from adult PBS mice, $ significantly different from aged PBS mice, *p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, and **** p &lt; 0.0001.</p>
