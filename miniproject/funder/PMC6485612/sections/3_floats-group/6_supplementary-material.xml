  <title>Initial Assessment of Chikungunya antigen-specific, IgG antibody responses in adult mice.</title>
  <p>Vaccine responses in adult C57BL/6J mice were evaluated 8 weeks [three vaccine doses] post-initial vaccination with each VLP-based vaccine formulation delivered via IM injections, or PBS. ELISAs for total IgG were performed to evaluate A] anti-VLP, B] anti-E1, and C] anti-E2 responses. D] The ability of diluted sera from vaccinated mice to neutralize CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 infection of Vero cells was evaluated 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. The reciprocal serum dilution of the lowest dilution that prevented cytopathic effect in Vero cells is reported as the neutralization titer for individual mice, by group. Mean ± standard error (SEM) are reported. One-way, two-tailed ANOVA, followed by Tukey post-hoc tests were performed: # significantly different from adult PBS mice, *p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, and **** p &lt; 0.0001. E] Mice were infected with 10
   <sup>5</sup> CCID
   <sub>50</sub> per mouse of CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 via subcutaneous injection of the right hind footpad and monitored for 14 days. Right foot size normalized to day 0 measurements are shown by vaccine formulation (Mean ± SEM shown).
