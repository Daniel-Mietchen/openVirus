  <title>CHIKV-associated disease in adults vs aged mice.</title>
  <p>Adult and aged C57BL/6J mice were infected with 10
   <sup>5</sup> CCID
   <sub>50</sub> per mouse of CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 via subcutaneous injection of the right hind footpad and monitored for 14 days. A, D] Weights normalized to day 0 measurements are shown by vaccine formulation and age. B, E] Right foot size normalized to day 0 measurements are shown by vaccine formulation and age. C, F] Normalized left foot sizes are shown. The mean Â± S.E.M are reported. The grey area loosely represents measurement variabilities observed in the non-infected left foot size of adult mice.
