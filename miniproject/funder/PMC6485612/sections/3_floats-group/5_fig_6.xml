  <title>Baseline inflammation in the aging.</title>
  <p>Pools of naïve sera from adult or aged mice were tested for inflammatory cytokines: A] TNF-α, B] IL-6, and C] IL-1β. Two tailed t-tests were performed between adult and aged groups and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant (* p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.001). D] Vero cells were infected with 200 CCID
   <sub>50</sub> in the presence of TNF-α at range of 5–80 ρg/ml. 
   <sup>a</sup> Wells were counted if there was at least 95% CPE.
