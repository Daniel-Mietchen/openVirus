   <italic>In vitro</italic> neutralization of CHIK LR2006-OPY1 by mouse immune sera.
  </title>
  <p>The ability of diluted sera from vaccinated mice to neutralize CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 infection of Vero cells was evaluated 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. The reciprocal serum dilution of the lowest dilution that prevented cytopathic effect in Vero cells is reported as the neutralization titer for individual mice, by group. Group neutralization titers are shown as mean ± S.E.M. The dotted line indicates the limit of detection of the assay. Kruskall-Wallis group analysis was performed for neutralization assay results, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test [* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, and **** p &lt; 0.0001].
