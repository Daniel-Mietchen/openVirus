<p>Vaccinating elderly individuals presents a special challenge since they are more prone to severe illness and vaccine efficacy drops in this population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The age-associated changes in the immune system are collectively termed immunosenescence and include fewer circulating antigen presenting cells and tissue-associated dendritic cells, decreased phagocytosis, decreased toll-like receptor signaling, reduced naïve B and T cells, and chronic basal level of inflammation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Elements of the immune system that remain intact include tissue macrophages and CD8+ T cell-mediated responses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Different vaccine approaches to counter immunosenescence in the aging include the use of higher vaccine doses, booster vaccinations, adjuvants, and vector-based vaccines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many vaccine delivery platforms are in development for a chikungunya vaccine, including formalin-inactivated viral vaccines, live-attenuated viruses, chimeric alphaviruses, DNA-based vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, and virus-like particle [VLP]-based vaccines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The most promising candidates, including a non-adjuvanted CHIK VLP vaccine, are being tested in Phase I and II clinical trials in adults between the ages of 18–60 years of age [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, we will continue to have a gap in knowledge regarding 1) CHIKV vaccine efficacy in the elderly and 2) understanding the vaccine characteristics needed to elicit a protective immune response in this population.
