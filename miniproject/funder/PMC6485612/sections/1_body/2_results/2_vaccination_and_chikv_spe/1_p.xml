<p>Adult C57BL/6J mice were vaccinated at weeks 0, 3, and 6 with VLP alone or coupled with one of three different adjuvants: QuilA, R848, and Imject Alum. Preliminary studies identified CHIK VLP, VLP plus QuilA, and VLP plus Alum formulations as the top vaccine candidates in adult mice when delivered intramuscularly based on CHIKV antigen-specific IgG responses [S1A-S1C Fig], neutralizing antibody responses [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007316.s001">S1E Fig</xref>]. Thus, these top candidates were also assessed in aged mice, following the same regimen. All adult and aged miced vaccinated with CHIK VLP formulations seroconverted after 3 doses as determined by ELISA for anti-VLP total IgG [

 </bold>], and anti-VLP total IgG levels were statistically significant when compared to both, adult and aged PBS control sera. However, anti-VLP total IgG titers were significantly higher in adult mice vaccinated with VLP alone in comparison to aged mice vaccinated with VLP alone (abs 0.9211 to 0.512, p = 0.0439). Morever, adult vaccinated with VLP plus Alum had higher anti-VLP total IgG titers then any of the aged mice vaccinated with VLPs (all p &lt; 0.01). The aged CHIK VLP-vaccinated mice were able to mount anti-VLP IgG1 responses that were comparable to adult CHIK VLP-vaccinated mice [

 </bold>], but significantly lagged in their anti-VLP IgG3 responses [

 </bold>]. Anti-VLP IgG2c responses were insignificant in CHIK VLP-vaccinated adult and aged mice [

 </bold>]. The IgG responses against CHIK E1 protein were robust in all adult mice vaccinated with CHIK VLPs, but were insignificant in aged mice vaccinated with CHIK VLPs [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2Eâ€“2H</xref>
 </bold>]. For adult mice vaccinated with VLP alone, the anti-E1 IgG subclass responses was dominated by IgG2c [abs 0.805] and IgG3 (abs 0.792), followed by IgG1 (abs 0.621) antibodies. For adult mice vaccinated with VLP plus QuilA, the anti-E1 IgG subclass responses consisted of IgG1 (abs 0.943), followed by IgG3 (abs 0.732), and finally IgG2c (abs 0.547). In contrast, adult mice vaccinated with VLP plus Alum largely consisted of IgG1 antibodies [abs 0.733], less IgG2c [0.354], ad no IgG3. The strongest anti-E2 total IgG responses were elicited in adult mice vaccinated with VLP plus QuilA or VLP plus Alum [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2I</xref>
 </bold>]. Vaccination with VLP plus QuilA in adult mice resulted in a strong anti-E2 IgG3 response [abs 0.751,

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2L</xref>
 </bold>], followed by anti-E2 IgG1 [abs 0.527, 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2F</xref>
 </bold>], but no significant anti-E2 IgG2c [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g002">Fig 2G</xref>
 </bold>]. In contrast, the VLP plus Alum vaccination only elicited significant anti-E2 IgG1 (abs 0.324) antibodies. Adult mice vaccinated with VLP alone elicited significant anti-E2 IgG3 (abs 0.861) and IgG2c antibodies (abs 0.313), but no significant anti-E2 IgG1. CHIK VLP vaccinations in aged mice did not elicit any significant anti-E2 IgG responses.
