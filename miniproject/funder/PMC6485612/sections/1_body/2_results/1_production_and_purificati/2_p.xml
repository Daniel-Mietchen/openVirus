<p>VLPs self-assembled from C-E proteins and were recovered from Ac-C-E VLP-infected SF9 cell culture medium. These particles were purified from non-particles by ultracentrifugation through a 20% glycerol cushion, as we previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The purified particles were probed using the Chk48 anti-E2 monoclonal antibody and a 50 kDa band representing the CHIKV E2 protein was detected by Western blot [

 </bold>]. Five of six batches of purified VLPs [4/12/17-4/17/17] were pooled and used for vaccination. These lots were compared to a batch produced two years earlier [3/25/15] that were stored at -80°C, demonstrating stability of VLP over time, when frozen. Zika subviral particles (SVP) were not detected using the Chk48 anti-E2 antibody. Like the VLP, HIS-tagged E1 and E2 proteins were secreted into the culture media of Sf9 cells infected with their respective baculoviruses: Ac-6×His-E1
 <sup>ΔTM</sup> and Ac-6×His-E2
 <sup>ΔTM</sup>. These E1 and E2 proteins were purified via affinity chromatography using NiNTA resin. For each set of purifications, unbound protein flow-through, three separate washes, and two separate elutions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, with PageBlue protein staining. Untagged proteins were removed by the second and third washes as shown by SDS-Page analysis [

 </bold>]. E1 protein was recovered in the elutions and then pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated. Anti-E1 mouse polyclonal sera reacted strongly with a~48 kDa band by Western blot analysis. Elutions 1 and 2 containing a 44 kDa recombinant E2 protein [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g001">Fig 1E</xref>
 </bold>] were pooled together, dialyzed, and concentrated. Anti-E2 polyclonal sera recognized the purified, recombinant E2 band.
