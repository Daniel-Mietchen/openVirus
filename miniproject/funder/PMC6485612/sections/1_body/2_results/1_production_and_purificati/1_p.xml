<p>CHIK VLPs, as well as CHIKV E1 and E2 proteins were produced and purified, as vaccines or reagents to analyze the immune responses elicited against CHIKV antigens. Multiple AcMNPV bacmids were generated to encode CHIKV C-E genes for expression and subsequent VLP assembly and for 6×His-E1
 <sup>ΔTM</sup> and 6×His-E2
 <sup>ΔTM</sup>. CHIKV gene insertions were verified by PCR analysis [

 </bold>]. Three bacmid clones (c1-c3) were chosen for each construct. The C-E [3765 bp] insert plus flanking sequences (2300 bp) resulted in a 6065 bp band and all three CHIK C-E VLP bacmid clones contained the correct insert as determined by electrophoresis through 1% agarose in tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) [

 <sup>ΔTM</sup> (1266 bp) plus flanking sequences, including upstream HIS-tag region (2430 bp) resulted in a PCR product of 3696 bp and these constructs were also verified by gel electrophoresis [

 <sup>ΔTM</sup> (1122 bp) plus flanking sequences, including upstream HIS-tag region (2430 bp) resulted in a PCR product of 3552 bp [

 <sup>ΔTM</sup>, and Ac-6×His-E2
 <sup>ΔTM</sup> capable of expressing CHIKV VLP and E proteins [
