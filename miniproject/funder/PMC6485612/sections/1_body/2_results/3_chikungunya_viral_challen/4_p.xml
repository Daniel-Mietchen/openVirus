<p>The resistance to CHIKV infection observed in naïve, aged mice may be associated with chronic low-grade inflammation that accompanies aging [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To test this theory, sera, collected from naïve adult mice and aged healthy mice, were assayed for the presence of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β [

 </bold>]. TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β were below levels of detection in healthy, naïve, adult mice. Pooled sera from groups of aged mice that appeared otherwise healthy had significantly elevated basal levels of TNF-α at 5.971 ± 3.82 pg/ml in comparison with adult mice [

 </bold>]. However, two groups of pooled sera from healthy, aged mice had high IL-1β levels of 15.4 and 56.9 pg/ml. Overall, naïve aged mice have elevated basal levels of inflammatory cytokines in comparison to naive adult mice. Moreover, the presence of TNF-α inhibited infection of Vero cells infected with CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 as measured by reduced CPE in the monolayers with as little as 5 pg/ml [
