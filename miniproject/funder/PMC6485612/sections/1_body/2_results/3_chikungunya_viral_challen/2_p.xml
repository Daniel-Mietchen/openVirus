<p>We also measured the size of the infected right hindfeet and the uninfected left hindfeet were measured as additional controls. Any foot size deviation beyond 15% of the intitial foot size was considered a significant change. Adult mice vaccinated with PBS experienced significant swelling of the CHIKV-injected right hind foot. Swelling was visible by day 6 post-infection. Peak right foot swelling occurred on day 7, reaching approximately 170% of the initial foot size, before gradually returning to normal size by day 12 post-infection [
