<p>Another unexpected feature of the aged mice was their resistance to chikungunya viral infection and disease [

 </bold>]. We speculate that this resistance may be associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines present in aged mice, but not in adult mice. Chronic, low-level inflammation associated with aging has been coined “inflammaging”. The elevation of some cytokines, such as IL-6, are associated with longevity, while elevation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, are associated with higher rates of mortality in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The role of inflammaging is complicated because while enhanced inflammation leads to disease, mortality, and poor vaccine outcomes, inflammation can help the immune system resist virally-induced disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Healthy aged mice with detectable levels of inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-6 [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>
 </bold>] were resistant to CHIKV-associated disease [

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007316.g005">Fig 5</xref>]
 </bold>. Furthermore, addition of exogenous TNF-α to Vero cells inhibited CHIKVinfection
