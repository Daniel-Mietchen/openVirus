<p>Basal inflammation in the naïve, aged mice may have been helped these mice resist CHIKV infection, but it may also have contributed to the poor immune responses to vaccination with CHIK VLPs. Reduction of vaccine efficacy due to inflammation has been observed in elderly people vaccinated with standard vaccines against influenza virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated plasma levels of TNF-α correlate with lower antibody titers generated in post-menopausal women following vaccination with influenza vaccine. Thus, it is possible that the basal levels of TNF-α observed in age mice, but not in young mice, contributed to the decrease antibody responses observed after vaccination with CHIK VLP-based vaccines. A recent publication suggests that this problem may be circumvented by pre-treament of elderly patients with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Losmapimod, a small molecule p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor [
