<p>Two of the most promising vaccines against CHIKV infection, a CHIK VLP vaccine and a measles-vectored vaccine expressing CHIK VLPs, have cleared Phase I trials with positive outcomes. These vaccines 1] are overall safe and tolerable, and 2] elicit CHIKV neutralization titers in adults 18–50 years of age. These two candidates are now being tested in healthy adults of 18–60 years of age in five Caribbean island nations. Based on results from Phase I trials, at least two immunizations with the live-vectored or CHIK VLPs are needed for 100% seronconversion and induction of neutralizing antibodies in healthy adult subjects [

The goals of our study were to improve these vaccines by adding adjuvants, and also show that these formulations would be efficacious in an aged model of infection. R848/resiquimod was used as a TLR7/8 agonist to induce a Th1 biased response [
