<p>In summary, CHIK VLPs alone elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers that protect 100% of mice from CHIKV infection and disease. However, more research is needed to identify a vaccine that will protect the elderly and people with chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes against CHIKV disease. If the current measles-vectored an CHIK VLP-based vaccines make it through all phases of clinical trials, licensing of these vaccines should be limited to the aged groups in which they were tested in, until further research can be conducted. It is possible that a completely different set of vaccine formulations or regimens may need to be developed for the elderly.These would need to be thoroughly vetted in preclinical studies to ensure that older people are not put at further risk for severe CHIKV infections. Finally, relevant models of severe CHIKV disease in adults and aged animals are needed to evaluate these vaccines.</p>
