<p>While our study suggests that na√Øve, aged, female mice are resistant to CHIKV infections, infections in aged people are much more complicated. Comorbidities may increase the risk of developing more severe CHIKV disease upon infection. CHIKV infection may be complicated by pre-exisiting comorbidities or may exacerbate chronic renal, respiratory, cardiac diseases [

Thus, perhaps CHIKV infections in diabetic mouse or non-human primate models may provide a better understanding of CHIKV infection, spread, and virus-induced disease pathology observed in severe CHIKV-induced disease. In addition, it would be important to investigate these preconditions in both female and male animals. These models could then be used for preclinical testing of vaccines and antivirals against CHIKV.
