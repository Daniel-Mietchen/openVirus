<p>The complete sequence encoding structural proteins (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) of the Chikungunya virus S27 strain [accession #AF369024] was codon-optimized for expression in 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> and synthesized by Genewiz [South Plainfield, NJ, USA]. The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system [Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA] was subsequently used to generate recombinant baculoviruses expressing CHIKV structural proteins. Briefly, the structural gene sequence was inserted into the pFastBac1 vector, under the control of the 
 <italic>Autographa californica</italic> multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) polyhedrin for high-level expression in insect cells. The CHIK C-E VLP/pFastBac1 construct was then transformed into DH10Bac 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic>, where C-E genes flanked between mini-Tn7 sites on the pFastBac1 plasmid and the LacZ gene flanked between mini-
 <italic>att</italic>Tn7 target sites on a AcMNPV bacmid are transposed to generate recombinant bacmid. The presence of C-E genes was verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using primers that hybridize to sites flanking the mini-
 <italic>att</italic>Tn7 site: pUC/M13 forward 5’-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3’ and pUC/M13 reverse 5’-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3’. Baculovirus was generated and passaged in Sf9 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>frugiperda</italic> insect cells, maintained in serum-free, SF900 II SFM medium [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. To generate the initial recombinant viruses, 8×10
 <sup>5</sup> Sf9 cells per well were seeded onto a 6-well plate and allowed to adhere for 15 min. The cells were then transfected with 1–2 μg bacmids using Cellfectin transfection reagent [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. The cells were observed for cytopathic effect and supernatants were harvested and clarified after 72h post-infection. The P1 virus was then passaged in a 30ml, spinner-flask culture of Sf9 cells at a cell density of 2×10
 <sup>6</sup> c/ml, and harvested 72h post-infection to generate P2 virus. For expression, Sf9 cells were cultured in spinner flasks to a density of 2×10
 <sup>6</sup> c/ml in a total volume of 250 ml and infected with recombinant baculovirus at a MOI of 1. Cultures were harvested once cell viability was reduced to roughly 80% or 72-96h after infection, and the cells were pelleted at 500×g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.22μm pore membrane before sedimentation via ultracentrifugation. CHIK virus-like particles (VLP) were sedimented through a 20% glycerol cushion at 100,000×g for 4h. The sedimented VLP pellets were resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Similarly, E1 and E2 genes, designed as transmembrane-truncated versions, were synthesized and cloned into the pFastBac HT vector. The pFastBac HT vector adds an N-terminal 6×His tag and and tobacco etch virus (TEV) proteolytic site to each gene. Recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were generated as described above and soluble E1 and E2 proteins were expressed in Sf9 spinner flask cultures.
