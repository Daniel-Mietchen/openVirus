<p>Adult C57BL/6J mice [6-8-week old] were challenged with CHIKV Reunion Island isolate LR2006-OPYI, which is of East Central South Africa lineage [ECSA] as previously described.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Mice were observed for 14 days following challenge. Prior to infection, the mice were anesthetized with a 100μl cocktail of 10 mg/kg xylazine plus 100 mg/kg ketamine in via intraperitoneal injection, and initial weight and hind foot measurements were recorded. Foot size was defined as width × breadth (mm
 <sup>2</sup>) and measured using a digital micrometer with 0.001mm resolution. The virus was subcutaneously injected into the right hind footpad at 50μl/mouse, while the mice were still under anesthesia. Pilot viral dose challenge experiments were conducted in naïve adult and aging mice to determine optimal challenge conditions. Mice were observed twice daily and weight and foot measurements were recorded once a day. Blood samples were collected on between days 1–5, and at day 14 post-infection. Based on these initial studies, a 10
 <sup>5</sup> CCID
 <sub>50</sub> challenge dose of LR2006-OPY1 CHIKV was used to test vaccine efficacy, and blood collections were reduced to 2, 4, 6, and 14 days post-infection. Approximately 40–60 μl of blood was collected from mice on sampling days, except on day 14 when the mice were anesthetized and terminally bled.
