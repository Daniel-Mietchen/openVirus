<p>Mouse sera from immunized or naïve mice were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Two-fold serial dilutions of the sera were prepared in 10% FBS-DMEM and added to 96-well, cell-culture plates. CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 strain was then added at 200 CCID
 <sub>50</sub> per well, and virus-antibody solutions were incubated together for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The final serum dilutions ranged from 1:20 to 1:2560. Each plate had two sets of assay controls: one column of wells contained virus only and a second column contained medium only. Vero cells were added at 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were fixed for 20 min with 10% formalin in PBS and stained with crystal violet for 5 min at room temperature. Neutralizing titers were measured and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that inhibited cytopathic effect.
