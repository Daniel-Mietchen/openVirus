<p>Vero cells [ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA] were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium [DMEM, Mediatech, Manassas, VA, USA] supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100μg/ml streptomycin [10%FBS-DMEM] and maintained at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. C6/36 mosquito cells [ATCC] were cultured at 28°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Eagle’s mimimum essential medium [EMEM, Mediatech] supplemented with 10%FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100μg/ml streptomycin [10%FBS-MEM]. CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 virus was obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA). Upon receipt, this virus was passaged twice in C6/36 mosquito cells. Virus concentration was determined in Vero cells and reported as the 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID
 <sub>50</sub>) per volume [ml].
