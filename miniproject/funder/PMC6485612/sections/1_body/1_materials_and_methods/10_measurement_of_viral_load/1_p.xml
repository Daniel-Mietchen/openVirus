<p>A two-step assay was used to measure viral loads in serum samples of mice challenged with CHIKV. C6/36 cells were grown to 100% confluence in T75 culture flasks, detached by scraping, and divided equally into four 96-well plates per T75 flask. The next day, ten-fold serial dilutions (10
 <sup>−1</sup>–10
 <sup>−8</sup>) of the mouse sera were prepared in 10%FBS-EMEM and used to inoculate 96-well plates of confluent C6/36 at 100μl /well. The cells were allowed to incubate for 3 days at 28°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2.</sub> Vero cells were seeded at 2×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a total volume of 100μl 10% FBS-DMEM per well and 25μl of C6/36 culture supernatants were transferred into triplicate wells containing Vero cells. Vero cells were incubated for 4 days at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were then fixed with 10% formalin for 20 minutes and stained with 1% crystal violet solution for 5 minutes at RT. Cells with 95% or more cytopathic effect were counted for each dilution and viral loads [CCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml] were calculated using the Spearman-Karber equation.[
