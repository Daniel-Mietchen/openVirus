<p>The cultures containing soluble E1 and E2 proteins were harvested and cells were sedimented at 500×g for 5 min at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.22μm pore membrane and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin [Thermo Fisher Scientific]. Briefly, the clarified cultures were incubated with Ni-NTA resin with shaking for 2.5-3h at room temperature before they were added to the columns. The medium was allowed to flow through and the Ni-NTA resin was washed three times with PBS containing 10mM imidazole. His-tagged proteins were then eluted twice with PBS containing 250mM imidazole. Upon verification of eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE analysis, E1 and E2 proteins were dialyzed and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filters [Millipore, Burlington, MA] with a 10 KDa molecular weight cut-off and sterile 10% glycerol in PBS as the exchange buffer. Total protein concentrations for E proteins and VLPs were measured using the Micro BCA protein kit as per manufacturer’s protocol [Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA].</p>
