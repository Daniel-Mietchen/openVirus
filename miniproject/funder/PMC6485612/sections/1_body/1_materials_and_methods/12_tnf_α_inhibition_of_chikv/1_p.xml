<p>Recombinant mouse TNF-α [Life Technologies] was diluted in 10% FBS-DMEM and mixed with 200 CCID
 <sub>50</sub> CHIKV LR2006-OPY1 virus per well, and virus-antibody solutions were incubated together for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The final TNF-α dilutions ranged from 5–80 ρg/ml. Each plate had two sets of assay controls: one column of wells contained virus only and a second column contained medium only. Vero cells were added at 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were fixed for 20 min with 10% formalin in PBS and stained with crystal violet for 5 min at room temperature. Wells with 95% or more cytopathic effect were counted for each TNF-α dilution and reported as the percentage of wells with CPE.
