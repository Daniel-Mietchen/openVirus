<p>Samples from each step of the purification process were prepared by combining 30μl of samples with 6μl 6×Laemmli buffer with beta-mercaptoethanol [βME] and heating to 100°C for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a Bolt 10% Bis-Tris Plus gel [Thermo Fisher Scientific] at 200V for 30 min and protein bands were stained with PageBlue protein staining solution [Thermo Fisher Scientific] and destained with distilled water.</p>
