<p>Mouse TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β ELISA MAX kits from BioLegend [San Diego, CA, USA] were used to detect inflammatory cytokines in sera of adult and aged mice, as per manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated coated overnight at 4°C wit 100 μl/well of anti-mouse TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β diluted to 1:200 in carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. After washing once with PBS-T, all subsequent steps were performed at room temperature, with shaking. Plates were blocked with blocking buffer (1% BSA in PBS). TNF-α and IL-6 standards were diluted and used at final concentrations 3.9–500 pg/ml, while IL-1β was used at 15.6–2000 pg/ml in blocking buffer. Pooled sera from adult or aged naïve mice were prepared by mixing 10 individual serum samples together. Pooled sera and standards were added to plates [100 μl/well] and incubated for 2 hr. Plates were then washed four times with PBS-T and incubated with biotinylated detection antibody at 1:200 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 hr. The plates washed 4 times with washing buffer and 1:1000 diluted avidin-HRP was added and incubated for 30 mins. After 5 washes, TMB substrate solution was added (100μl/well) and plates were incubated in the dark for 15 mins. The reaction was stopped with 100μl/well stop solution (2N H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) and plates were read using the PowerWave XS microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm.
