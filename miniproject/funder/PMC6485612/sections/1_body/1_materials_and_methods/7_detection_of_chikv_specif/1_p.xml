<p>Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates [Thermo Fisher Scientific] were coated overnight at 4°C with 10μg/ml E1, E2, or VLP in PBS. The plates were then washed three times with PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 200μl 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 hr at room temperature. Serum samples from individual mice were diluted to 1:100 in blocking buffer and added at 100μl/well in duplicate wells. The sera were allowed to react for 2 hr at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with PBS-T and bound sera were reacted with goat anti-mouse IgG-Fc [1:50,000], IgG1 [1:10,000], IgG2c [1:10,000], or IgG3 [1:10,000] antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase [Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA] for 1 hr at room temperature. The plates were washed three more times and allowed to develop for 20 min following the addition of 100 μl para-nitrophenylphosphate substrate [SeraCare, Milford, MA, USA]. The plates were read at a wavelength of 405nm using a BioTek PowerWave XS plate reader with Gen5 version 2.07 software [BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA].</p>
