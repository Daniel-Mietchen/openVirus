<p>To build the dataset used for the analysis, all available whole CHIKV genomes (334 genomes) plus all available E1 sequences that spanned the 1,044bp consensus fragment under study (384 sequences) were obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Due to our focus on evolution in the Asian lineage, we built our final dataset using E1 sequences from partial genomes only if they belonged to the Asian lineage (101 strains), as determined by the initial tree (aLRT = 1 for the monophyletic Asian lineage node). Sequences from all other lineages were from whole genomes. In addition, the following strains were removed due to suggestions of laboratory contamination, assembly error or high passage as suggested by the initial tree and previous studies[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]: Angola/M2022/1962, India/MH4/2000, India/ALSA-1/1986, India/STMWG01/2011, India/STMWG02/2011, Ross and S27. Finally, strains with missing information on sampling year were removed. The final dataset consisted of 420 strains: 12 West African, 17 non-epidemic ECSA, 142 IOL and 249 Asian strains.
