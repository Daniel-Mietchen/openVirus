<p>Phylogenetic analyses of CHIKV have identified three main lineages: the West African, East Central South African (ECSA) and Asian linage[
 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2004, an epidemic of the ECSA lineage re-emerged in Africa and the Indian Ocean and evolved into a novel Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL)[

The first autochthonous cases of CHIKV in the Western Hemisphere were reported in Martinique in December 2013; rapid epidemic expansion followed throughout the Caribbean and Latin America leading to over 30,000 laboratory confirmed cases by April 2015[

 <xref rid="pone.0209292.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]); a novel Caribbean genotype has been described in isolates from across the Americas containing a transmission-facilitating 3’ untranslated region duplication[
