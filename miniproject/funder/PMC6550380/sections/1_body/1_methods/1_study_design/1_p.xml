 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

We explored motivations for caregiversâ€™ actions in response to illness, explaining delays in seeking and accessing appropriate treatment for their children. Our approach was mainly deductive in nature, driven by the hypothesis that delay in seeking appropriate care was a risk factor for severe malaria.
