 </bold>) based on key themes agreed upon by the study team based on observations noted during the primary study. The interview guide was pilot tested and modified by the lead interviewer, improving on sequencing of questions. Interviews lasted less than 2 hours and were conducted in the local language. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed in the language in which they were conducted before translation into English by an experienced interviewer. The interviewer did not repeat any of the interviews, nor were transcribed interviews returned to study participants for comment and correction. Additionally, upon completion of each interview, the interviewer noted a summary of key observations during the interview. Patient responses were categorized into three phases: 1) illness recognition, 2) response to illness and 3) actions.
