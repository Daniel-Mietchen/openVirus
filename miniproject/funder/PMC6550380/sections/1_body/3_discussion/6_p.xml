<p>Regardless of limitations, policy makers must acknowledge that drug shops are a popular point of care and can be mobilized to treat acute febrile illnesses among rural populations. In Tanzania [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] interventions including provision of subsidized packs of pediatric ACT to retail outlets, training of retail outlet staff, and community awareness activities resulted in significant increases in ACT coverage for reported fevers. In-appropriate use of antimalarials by drug shops remains a concern. However, provision of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in the private sector could minimize this problem as was demonstrated in a study in Ghana [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], where introduction of RDTs resulted in reduced dispensing of antimalarial to patients without malaria, and did not reduce prescribing of antimalarials to true malaria cases. Additionally, by applying principles of commercial marketing to social health problems, drug shops have the potential to serve as an effective mechanism for promoting socially beneficial behavior change [

Key is finding the right balance, supporting drug shops to provide much needed services, but maintaining acceptable standards of care.
