<p>Outside homes, drug shops were the preferred choice of care, a finding consistent with results of other studies in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Drug shops have proliferated in both rural and urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. As reported previously, short distance from home, lower cost of obtaining care compared to health centers, short waiting times, and ease of accessing medicines were reasons for preference of drug shops [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, caregivers sought care at drug shops for symptoms deemed mild and not serious, suggesting that they were aware of the shortcomings of these shops. The popularity of drug shops offers an opportunity for promoting timely access to appropriate antimalarial treatment [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, limitations of drug shops, including lack of provider knowledge on management of malaria [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], poor referral practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], lack of diagnostic capacity [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and profit driven behaviors [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], remain major hurdles. Programs directed at improving services at drug shops have yielded mixed results [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Publications from the ACT Watch group, a multi-country research project designed to fill evidence gaps in malaria treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], suggest that despite efforts to improve care, appropriateness of antimalarial treatment at drug shops remains sub-optimal [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In Tanzania, the Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlet program for regulating and training drug shops to provide affordable and quality medicines was successful in promoting appropriate antimalarial treatment [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, sustaining gains has proven to be a problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], with reports indicating providers returning to poor dispensing practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Rapid Diagnostic Tests have been introduced at drugs shops to rationalize use of antimalarials, but amidst resistance from providers given the desire to profit through the sale of anti-malarial treatments, and from caregivers due to high costs [
