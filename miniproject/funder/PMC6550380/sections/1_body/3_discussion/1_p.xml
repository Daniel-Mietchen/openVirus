<p>We studied contexts that contributed to delays in appropriate care for children who eventually developed severe malaria. Consistent with previous reports[
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], mild fevers led to delays in response. Caregivers responded to what they perceived as mild illness with ineffective home interventions. When care was sought outside the home, drug shops were preferred over public facilities, but because the care was often sub-optimal, there was delay in accessing appropriate treatment.
