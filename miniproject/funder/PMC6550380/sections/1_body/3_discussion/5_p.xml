<p>What is the best approach for improving delivery of health services amidst constraints of the public health system and the popular private sector? One approach is to strengthen the public health system which, despite its challenges [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], has the infrastructure and human resources for effective delivery of health services [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Beyond focusing on patient care, efforts should to be directed at improving hospitality services at public facilities. Studies in Uganda and Malawi have shown that abusive and disrespectful health workers were barriers to accessing care at public facilities [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This may partly explain why caregivers initially seek care at drug shops, whose hospitability services are likely far better due to the need to maintain customers [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Strengthening the quality of services at drug shops is an alternative option. However, achieving quality services at drug shops is limited by multiple challenges including sub-optimal drug dosing, use of medicines not in national treatment guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], limited diagnostic capacity and inconsistent referral practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and the desire for profits [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Additionally, despite laws that provide for standards of operations, many drug shops operate illegally [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], with poor quality of health services [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], including inappropriate provision of parenteral artesunate [
 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. This situation calls for policymakers to embark on programs of action to empower and strengthen regulatory frameworks and instruments in relation to drug shops [
