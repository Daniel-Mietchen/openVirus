<p>Caregivers ably explained the cause of malaria and were aware of the common manifestations of severe malaria; appreciating the fact, that malaria could cause death. However, their understanding did not appear to have a bearing on how they responded to illness and on the time to seek appropriate care, suggesting that response were influenced by other factors, such as the contexts within which they lived [

 <xref rid="pone.0217262.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], contributing to delay in seeking appropriate care for malaria. Home remedies may suffice for common childhood viral infections, which are often self-limiting [
