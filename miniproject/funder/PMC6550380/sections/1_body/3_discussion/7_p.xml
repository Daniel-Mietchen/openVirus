<p>In conclusion, we report on delays in seeking appropriate care by caregivers of children eventually diagnosed with severe malaria. Lack of action for perceived mild fever contributed to delays in care. Social networks including grandmothers and mothers-in-law, whose influence often resulted in inappropriate treatment options, led to further delays. Despite the opportunity, drug shops have been shown to contribute to delay in seeking appropriate care [

Unfortunately, caregivers often sought care at public health facilities only when interventions at home or at drug shops had failed and illness had progressed from mild to severe. To address these gaps, there is need for a multipronged approach, starting with prioritization of health education programs sensitizing communities living in endemic areas, not only on recognition of symptoms of malaria, but emphasizing the significance of fever, irrespective of grade as an indicator of malaria [

Once defined, shop attendants should be trained and regulated to operate appropriately. For the public health sector, governments and partners need to direct efforts towards improving quality of hospitality services, a neglected area deserving attention.
