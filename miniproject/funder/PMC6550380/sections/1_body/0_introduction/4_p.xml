<p>Understanding caregivers’ health seeking behavior while taking into consideration contextual factors that govern behavior is a prerequisite for formulating policies targeted at optimizing response to illness [

However, policy efforts continue to focus on provider factors such as increasing availability of ACTs to communities at risk, while neglecting demand side factors such as how caregivers interpret and respond to symptoms of illness. Sensitizing communities to availability of services and providing classical biomedical descriptions of symptoms of malaria have had little impact on caregivers seeking care promptly [

Utilizing interviews with caregivers of children who presented with severe malaria in Jinja, Uganda, we explored the social and environmental constraints that shape when and how caregivers respond to illness, and sought to explain delays in accessing appropriate treatment for malaria.
