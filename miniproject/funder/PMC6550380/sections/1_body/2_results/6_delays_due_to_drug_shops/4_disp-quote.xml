   <bold>A308</bold>:”the private clinic where we started, they ‘ate’* a lot of money. Because whatever they told us, we would do. They would tell you buy this, you would go and buy. They would tell you buy a syrup, you would go and buy. Even others I just left them behind. Because initially they gave us syrup but when I went with them to Lulyambuzi, they sorted them, we went with 7 syrups. New ones. They sorted them and we threw away 5 of them. They left us with 2 and said those are the ones we should use for this illness. Because all the person was chasing back there was money. Just wanting to get money. But we didn’t know what was wrong with the child. But when we gave him those two syrups and threw the 5, he started getting back in line. But when we combined with the others, it would be as if you are increasing the sickness. But he has ‘eaten’ money; I don’t even know the amount. For a long time, this child has not been well.”
