<p>Some parallelism can be established between in vitro and in vivo models of CHIKV replication. CHIKV propagates and grows to high titers in mosquito and mammalian cells. In nature, CHIKV quickly disseminates and viral genome reaches up to 10
 <sup>7</sup>−10
 <sup>9</sup> copies per milliliter of blood or per infected mosquito, as early as 2 days after infection. Comparable effects of 3’UTR deletions on CHIKV replication were also observed in C6/36 cells and mosquitoes (Figs
