<p>RNA recombination is driven by blocks of repeated sequences and is the main mechanism underlying genome plasticity at the 3’UTR in both mosquito and mammalian hosts. While positive selection favors the replication of advantageous viral variants, RNA-recombination does not always produce beneficial rearrangements of the viral genome. In fact, RNA recombination yields both viable viruses and non-replicative viral RNAs that are packaged into defective interfering particles [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] [see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g008">8B</xref>)]. The Cbn strain missing DR3a and DR3b copies isolated in BHK cells is an example of those non-replicative RNAs. In turn, viable viruses are subjected to positive selection processes in each host, according to specific requirements for viral replication. Direct repeats at the 3’UTR are under different host-selective pressures. While they are advantageous for replication in mosquito cells, they are rather redundant in mammalian cells. These conflicting requirements explain why viral variants enriched in DR copies are positively selected in mosquito cells, and then cleared out when the virus switches to mammalian cells. However, the cause for selection of viral variants with disparate 3’UTRs in different hosts still remains unclear. In the case of DENV, we discovered that host adaptation modulates the species of non-coding RNAs derived from the 3’UTR (known as sfRNA) that are accumulated in infected cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A number of studies have revealed important functions of sfRNAs, including the evasion of immune responses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidence so far suggests that during CHIKV infection no sfRNAs are produced [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In turn, alphavirus 3’UTR in the context of the complete viral genome appears to be the target for antiviral responses in mammalian cells: (i) CHIKV 3’UTR is specifically recognized by RIG-I receptors, that sense viral infection to initiate and modulate antiviral immunity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and (ii) Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) contains at its 3’UTR a binding site for a vertebrate-cell specific miRNA that restricts viral replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that loss of DR copies at the 3’UTR serves as a mechanism to evade host antiviral response in mammalian cells. Future work is required to elucidate whether immune escape is the driving force for CHIKV 3’UTR evolution.
