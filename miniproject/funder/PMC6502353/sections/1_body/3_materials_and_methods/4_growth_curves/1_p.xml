<p>Sub confluent BHK-21,C6/36 cells and human fibroblasts in a in a six-well plate were infected with equal amounts of CHIKV-Cbn, CHIKV-LR or mutant viruses recovered from C6/36 cells. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in 500 μl of PBS was used. One hour post-infection, the cells were washed 5 times with PBS and 2 ml of growth media were added. At each time point, cell supernatants were collected and frozen at -70°C. For virus quantification, supernatants were serially diluted and plaque assay was performed on Vero cells as described above.</p>
