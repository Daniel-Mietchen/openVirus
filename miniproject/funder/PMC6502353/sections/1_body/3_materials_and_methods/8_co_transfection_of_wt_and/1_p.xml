<p>Two independent RNA transfections were performed for each parental/chimeric mix. Viral RNAs of CHIKV-LR, CHIKV LR/3’Cbn, CHIKV-Cbn and CHIKV-Cbn/3’LR were obtained by in vitro transcription and quantified. Based on the RNA concentration, mixes of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV LR/3’Cbn (9:1), or CHIKV-Cbn and CHIKV-Cbn/3’LR (1:9) were used for transfections into C6/36 cells. Viruses recovered from supernatants were used to re-infect fresh cells. As described above, RNA was extracted, used as template for RT-PCR reaction and ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector. For each experiment, 26 Individual clones were sequenced by Sanger method and ratio of viral variants was calculated.</p>
