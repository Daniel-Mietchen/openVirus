<p>To facilitate mutations within the 3’UTR of CHIKV-Cbn [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and CHIKV-LR [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] infectious clones, a unique 
 <italic>SacI</italic> restriction site was introduced downstream of the stop codon of the viral structural proteins. To this end, the PCR product generated with primers sense 94 and antisense 92, and the product of a second PCR generated with primers sense 93 and antisense 95, were fused by overlapping PCR. The 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I- 
 <italic>Not</italic>I fragment of CHIKV-Cbn or CHIKV-LR was replaced by the 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I- 
 <italic>Not</italic>I fragment of the overlapping PCR products to generate CHIKV-Cbn 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I or CHIKV-LR 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I, respectively. A 3’UTR cloning cassette between unique 
 <italic>SacI</italic> and 
 <italic>NotI</italic> restriction sites allowed us to exchange the wild type sequences by mutant 3’UTRs, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s006">S1 Table</xref>. Nucleotide sequences of primers used for PCRs are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s007">S2 Table</xref>.
