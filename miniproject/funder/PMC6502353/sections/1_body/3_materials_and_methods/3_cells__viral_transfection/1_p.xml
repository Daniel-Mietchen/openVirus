<p>Mammalian BHK-21 cells (
 <italic>Mesocricetus auratus hamster kidney</italic>, ATCC, CCL-10) were grown at 37°C in MEM alpha medium. A primary line of human skin fibroblasts was established at the Instituto de Medicina Translacional e Ingeniería Biomédica [CONICET, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires,[
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]] and grown at 37°C in D-MEM medium. Mosquito C6/36 (
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, ATCC, CRL-1660) cells were grown at 28°C in Leibovitz L-15 medium. For RNA transfections, cell lines were grown to 60–70% confluence and transfected in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Viral stocks were obtained by transfection of 500 ng of in vitro transcribed viral RNA and harvested from the cell culture supernatant at different times post-transfection. Viruses were quantified by plaque assays. To this end, 10
 <sup>5</sup> Vero cells (
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops kidney</italic>, ATCC CCL-81) per well were seeded in 24-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Viral stocks were serially diluted and 0.1 ml was added to the cells and incubated for 1 h. Then, 1 ml of overlay (1X D-MEM medium, 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 U of penicillin/ml and 0.4% methylcellulose) was added to each well. Cells were fixed 3 days post-infection with 10% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet.
