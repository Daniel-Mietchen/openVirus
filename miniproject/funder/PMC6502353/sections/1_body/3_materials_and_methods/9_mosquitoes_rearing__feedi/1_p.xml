<p>Laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were established from field collections in 2011 in Phu Hoa, Ben Cat District, Binh Duong Province, Vietnam. All the experiments were performed within 19 generations of laboratory colonization. The insectary conditions for mosquito maintenance were 28°C, 70% relative humidity, and a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle. Adults were maintained with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution. Adult females were offered commercial rabbit blood (BCL) twice a week through a membrane feeding system (Hemotek Ltd.). 6–8 days old female mosquitoes were fed with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of CHIKV diluted in preached human blood (iCareB platform, Institut Pasteur). Mosquitoes were offered the infectious or control blood meal for 30 min through a membrane feeding system (Hemotek Ltd) set at 37°C with a piece of desalted pig intestine as the membrane. Following the blood meal, fully engorged females were selected and incubated for 2 and 8 days at 28°C, 70% relative humidity and under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle with permanent access to 10% sucrose. Viral titers in individual mosquitoes were determined by plaque assay. Also, total RNA was extracted with TriZol reagent and the composition of the 3’UTR in the population was analyzed as described above.
