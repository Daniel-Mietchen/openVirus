<p>A mixture of in vitro transcribed Cbn-WT and Cbn-
 <italic>Sac</italic>I/
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I RNAs was transfected into BHK or C6/36 cells. Two independent RNA transfections were performed in each case. As before, viral RNAs were Trizol-extracted from culture supernatants at day 3 and used for RT reactions with primer 115. PCR reactions were carried out using primers 115 and 123 and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. For each experiment, 14 individual clones were analyzed. To assess the presence of 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and/or 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction sites in individual clones, 3’UTRs were amplified by PCR reactions using primers M13F and M13R (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Then, PCR products were digested with 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I or 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction enzymes and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. Because the M13F and M13R primers anneal at different distances from the insertion site in pGEM-T Easy, the size of the bands generated by digestion depends on directionality of the cloned insert. For confirmation, 3’UTRs were also sequenced by Sanger method.
