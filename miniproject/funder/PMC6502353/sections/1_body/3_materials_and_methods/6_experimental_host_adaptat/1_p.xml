<p>Two independent RNA transfections were performed for each adaptation experiment. In vitro transcribed CHIKV-LR or CHIKV-Cbn RNAs were transfected into BHK-21 or C6/36 cell lines. Viruses were harvested at 2 days and five successive infections were performed in the same cell line using a MOI of 1. Viral RNAs were Trizol-extracted from culture supernatants and used for RT-PCR reactions with primer 115, complementary to the poly(A) tail plus the last 7 nucleotides of CHIKV genomes. PCR reactions were carried out using primers 115 and 116. Products were ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and used to transform XL1-Blue bacteria. For each passage 5 population, 26 individual clones were analyzed. The length of individual viral 3â€™UTRs was estimated by resolving the product from the 
 <italic>EcoR</italic>I plasmid digestion in 2% agarose gels. Individual plasmid clones were sequenced by Sanger method using M13R and M13F primers.
