<p>CHIKV 3’UTR sequences were downloaded from GenBank database and aligned using ClustalW2 and MAFFTs programs. Strains with incomplete 3’UTRs were excluded from the analysis. Internal duplications were identified using LALIGN, the pairbase sequence alignment tool available at ClustalW2 site. Structure of the 3’UTR was predicted using RNAalifold software.</p>
