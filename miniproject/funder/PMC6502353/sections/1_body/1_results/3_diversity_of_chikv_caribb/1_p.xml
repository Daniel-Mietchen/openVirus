<p>Our observations regarding the differences in the replication of CHIKV bearing the 3’UTR of LR or Cbn lineages raise the questions of why does a less advantageous 3'UTR become fixed and how is diversity in the 3'UTR generated. To address these questions, we investigated whether viral populations of re-emerging CHIKV are prone to change during passaging in cell culture. We first followed the evolution of the 3’UTR of viruses restricted to replicate in mammalian or mosquito cells. Viral RNA molecules were obtained by in vitro transcription from CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone and used to transfect C6/36 and BHK cell lines in two parallel experiments (

Then, total RNA was extracted from culture supernatants and used as a template for reverse transcription reactions with an oligo(dT) primer. The pool of viral cDNAs was used to amplify fragments corresponding to the 3’UTR ends and then cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. Individual plasmid clones were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced using Sanger method. Also, the 3’UTR from in vitro transcribed input RNA was RT-PCR amplified, cloned, and used as reference.
