<p>To unequivocally address the effect of new 3'UTRs on virus replication, we introduced into the parental CHIKV-Cbn backbone one of the 3â€™UTRs that was isolated with high frequency (Clone 25) and another with a drastic deletion (Clone 15). Then, we followed the production of infectious particles in both mammalian and mosquito cells. Clone 25, which carried the deletion of DR3a, showed delayed growth kinetics in mosquito cells while it did not affect viral replication in mammalian cells. Instead, Clone 15, which carried the complete deletion of both DR3 copies, was not able to replicate neither in mammalian nor mosquito cells (

On the other hand, some of the variants obtained from mammalian cells bear deletions that delay viral replication solely in mosquito cells, posing a constraint to host-switch.
