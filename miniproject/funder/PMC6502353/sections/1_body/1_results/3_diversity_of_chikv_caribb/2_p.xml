<p>As expected, the size of the 3’UTR clones generated from in vitro transcribed RNA was uniform, and corresponded to the full-length Cbn 3’UTR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, upper gel). Unlike the 3’UTR of input RNA, the frequency of full-length Cbn 3’UTR changed from 100% to 78% and different viral variants with shorter 3’UTRs emerged in mosquito cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper chart). Interestingly, the CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells showed a more drastic change in the composition of viral population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, bottom gel). A reduction of the input variant frequency from 100% to 41% and the emergence of new 3’UTRs with a frequency of about 60% were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, bottom chart). Sequencing of 3’UTR variants revealed that they contained deletions of DR regions located at different positions of the 3’UTR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, 13 clones for each sample are shown). For instance, in mosquito cell passaged viruses we found a clean deletion of DR(1+2)a in Clone 6 and a deletion of DR3b in Clone 12. In mammalian cells, viral variants with different deletions throughout the 3’UTR appeared in the first experiment. In the second experiment, the majority of the variants isolated carried the same deletion, corresponding to one copy of DR3. In addition to deletion variants, a viral variant with an 80-nt insertion emerged in cell culture (clone 5). Nucleotide sequences of variants are shown in
