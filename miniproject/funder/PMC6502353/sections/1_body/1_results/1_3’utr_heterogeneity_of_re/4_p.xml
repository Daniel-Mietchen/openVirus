 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows that re-emergent CHIKV-isolates display different number of DR-copies at their 3’UTRs and that, despite certain nucleotide substitutions and deletions, many regions of the DRs are conserved between Asian and ECSA derived viruses. Importantly, CHIKV from different phylogenetic origins and bearing distinct 3’UTRs co-circulate in the same countries or nearby areas. This opens the question of how this complex mixture of variants will evolve in the near future to define the course of CHIKV epidemics.
