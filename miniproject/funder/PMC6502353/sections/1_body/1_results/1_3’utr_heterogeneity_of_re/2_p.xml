<p>To study the 3’UTR diversity of contemporary re-emergent strains, we aligned and compared the 3’ sequences from 17 different natural isolates involved in recent CHIKV outbreaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In 2005, a CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage expanded the infection in La Reunion Island and then passed to the European continent. More recently, in 2016, a new autochthonous transmission of CHIKV derived from ECSA lineage was described in Brazil and Haiti [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ECSA-derived isolates contain simple 3’UTRs, with only two copies of DR 1 and DR2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In contrast, Asian-derived isolates, which arrived to America in 2013, contain longer 3’UTRs. Some American CHIKV isolates (such as the Caribbean) bear 3’UTRs that have never before been described in nature [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These novel 3’UTRs display a 177-nt duplication corresponding to the 3’ portion of the DR(1+2)a region plus an extra copy of the complete DR(1+2)b region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). It has been proposed that this duplication confers an advantage for viral replication in mosquito cells compared to the original Asian strain [
