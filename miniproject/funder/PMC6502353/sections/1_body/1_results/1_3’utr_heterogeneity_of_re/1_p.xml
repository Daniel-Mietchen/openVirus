 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ECSA and Asian strains have disseminated globally during the last decade, while the West African is confined to a sylvatic circulation in less populated areas of Africa. Interestingly, ECSA and Asian CHIKV lineages differ at their 3’UTRs. ECSA lineage contains two DR elements at the 3’UTR, namely DR1 (two copies) and DR2 (three copies), while the Asian 3’UTR accumulated insertions and point mutations around the DR1 and DR2 [hereafter designated as DR (1+2)], plus the duplication of an entire region (DR3) (
