<p>Even though we found that CHIKV is prone to loose DR copies by genome recombination, conservation of replicated DR copies is a common feature of alphavirus 3’UTRs, suggesting a functional role for duplication of DRs in CHIKV replication. To examine the requirements of DRs for replication in mammalian and mosquito cells we have deleted one, two or three copies of DR (1+2) or one DR3 copy from the CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone [Δ(1+2)a, Δ(1+2)ab, Δ(1+2)abb’, Δ3a respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>]. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts for WT and mutant genomes were transfected into cells, and replication was followed by immunofluorescence staining of viral antigens as a function of time. We observed a direct association between the number of DRs and viral replication in mosquito cells. While deletion of one DR(1+2) copy had no effect compared to the WT, deletion of two or three DR(1+2) copies resulted in a moderate and a clear disadvantage for replication in mosquito cells, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). One day post-transfection, the number of CHIKV positive cells were 33%, 35%, 5% and 0% for WT, Δ(1+2)a, Δ(1+2)ab and Δ(1+2)abb’, respectively. By day 4 post-transfection, the complete cell monolayer was infected with all viruses except for Δ(1+2)abb’; which only infected 10% of the cells. Because replication of Δ(1+2)abb’ virus was only evident after 10 days, we asked whether the virus recovered at this time showed any evidence of recombination at the 3’UTR. Analysis of clones corresponding to the Δ(1+2)abb’ population showed that the 3’UTR remained stable, suggesting that a minimum of DR copies may be maintained to favor recombination. In agreement with the immunofluorescence results, assessment of virus replication by growth curves showed that Δ(1+2)ab and Δ(1+2)abb’ exhibited delayed replication kinetics, resulting in 300 and 10,000 fold lower titers as compared to the WT, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Deletion of one DR3 copy was also evaluated in mosquito cells and it was found to delay viral replication, with 10% of the monolayer infected at day 1 and 100-fold reduction in viral titer compared to the WT. Replication of all mutants and WT viruses was similarly investigated in mammalian cells and interestingly, deletion of DR copies had no significant effect on viral fitness (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate a remarkable difference for replication requirements in mosquito and mammalian cells, with an evident positive correlation between the number of DR copies and replication rates in mosquito cells. In addition, DR(1+2) copies cannot compensate for the deletion of DR3, suggesting that DR(1+2) and DR3 copies are functionally different. In fact, DR1 and DR2 do not fold into stable RNA structures. Because DR3 folds into a stable SLY (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that this structure plays a role on viral replication in mosquito cells.
