<p>Collectively, these findings indicate that CHIKV 3â€™UTR is a major determinant for rapid adaptation to host switching. DRs are redundant in mammalian cells and thus, deletion mutants generated by RNA recombination are rapidly selected. In turn, because there is a requirement for DR duplication in mosquito cells, negative selection of deletion mutants occurs.</p>
