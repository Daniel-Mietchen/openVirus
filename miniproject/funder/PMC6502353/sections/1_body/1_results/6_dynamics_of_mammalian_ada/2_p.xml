<p>Additionally, we used the mammalian-grown population to infect 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Two and eight days after infectious blood meal, viral titers were estimated and the frequency of viral variants in individual mosquitoes was assessed by analyzing 20 clones of the 3’UTR for each mosquito. Virus titers confirmed that the 8 mosquitoes have been infected (

While deletion variants represented 30 to 80% of the population at day 2, they were drastically outcompeted by viruses carrying full-length 3’UTRs by day 8 (
