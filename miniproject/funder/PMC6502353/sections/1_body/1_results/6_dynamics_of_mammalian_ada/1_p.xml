<p>CHIKV populations are subjected to diversification during host cell adaptation. Since redundant DR copies do not provide an advantage for viral replication in mammalian cells, selection of viruses that rapidly loose DR copies is favored. On the other hand, duplication of DRs enhances replication in mosquito cells and thus, there is a positive selection pressure on DRs that explains the lower frequency of deletion variants in this host. We reasoned that host switch by alternate passaging of the virus in mammalian and mosquito cells would impact on the frequency of deletion variants. The CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells, where 64% of the viruses bear deletions in the 3’UTR was used to infect mosquito cells (Host Switch I, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Then, the 3'UTR of individual clones was analyzed as described previously (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As expected, the 3’UTR from the viral progeny released from mosquito cells showed a drastic change in the composition of viral population, with a prevailing of parental CHIKV-Cbn at a frequency of 85%. In addition, the viral variants that had arisen during adaptation to mammalian cells (Experiment II in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) changed their frequency from 64% to 5%, and new mosquito-adapted variants emerged at a frequency of 10% (in orange, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, when this mosquito-grown population was switched back to mammalian cells such as BHK or human fibroblasts (Host Switch II and III, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), the deletion variants became nearly 60% of the population.
