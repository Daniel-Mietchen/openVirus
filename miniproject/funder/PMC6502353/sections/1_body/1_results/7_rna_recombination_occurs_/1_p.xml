<p>We demonstrated that emergence of viral variants in mammalian cells by RNA recombination results in a significant fitness cost in mosquito cells, posing a constraint during host switching. Then, we asked whether positive selection and RNA recombination act concertedly to rescue viral replication in mosquito cells. Given the fact that variants of CHIKV carrying different but relatively conserved 3’UTRs co-circulate in the same geographic areas (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we hypothesized that RNA recombination between lineages could occur to generate chimeric variants with enhanced viral replication in mosquito cells. To investigate this possibility, we mixed CHIKV-LR with the chimeric virus containing the 3’UTR from CHIKV-Cbn in a 9:1 ratio in order to give a quantitative advantage to the virus with the shorter 3’UTR, and grew viral populations in C6/36 cells.
