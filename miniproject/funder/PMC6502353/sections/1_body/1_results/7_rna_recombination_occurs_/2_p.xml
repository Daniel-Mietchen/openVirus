<p>As expected, adaptation to mosquito cells deeply modified the relative abundance of each virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7</xref>). By two viral passages, the frequency of CHIKV-LR changed from 90% to less than 10% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), while the frequency of the chimeric virus increased from 10% to 80%. In addition, new viruses with 3’UTRs of intermediate length arose in cell culture with a frequency of 20%. Similar results were obtained when CHIKV-Cbn was mixed with the chimeric virus carrying the 3’UTR from CHIKV-LR in a 1:9 ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The parental CHIKV-Cbn completely displaced the Cbn/3’LR after two passages and viral variants with 3’UTRs of intermediate lengths appeared with a frequency of about 20%.
