<p>Altogether, our results demonstrate that (i) viruses that have duplicated DR elements at the 3’UTR rapidly outcompete those with less copies of DRs in mosquito cells, (ii) displacement of variants with shorter 3’UTRs can be unequivocally attributed to the impact of the 3’UTR region in viral fitness and is independent of the backbone, and (iii) RNA recombination by copy-choice mechanism occurs when a host cell is infected by two or more molecules of CHIKV. Template switching of viral polymerase takes place either between viruses from the same or from different lineages.</p>
