<p>Ongoing CHIKV epidemics are caused by viruses from ECSA and Asian lineages, which contain differences both in their coding and non-coding regions. As mentioned, the CHIKV responsible for 2005–2006 epidemics in La Reunion Island (
 <underline>CHIKV-LR</underline>; ECSA-derived) contained a single mutation in the envelope protein gene (E1-A226V) that increases viral fitness in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which is not present in the CHIKV that arrived to America [
 <underline>CHIKV-Caribbean (Cbn)</underline>; Asian-derived]. Besides, both linages largely differ at their 3’UTRs. To identify sequence repetitions at the 3’UTR from these two distinct re-emergent viruses, RNA matrix comparisons were performed. Local alignment plots confirm the presence of multiple DRs at both 3’UTRs, but with distinct repetition patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Firstly, we studied the impact of distinct 3’UTRs on replication by comparing growth kinetics of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn in mammalian (BHK and human fibroblasts) and mosquito cells. Growth curves in mammalian cells showed that both viruses replicated similarly, despite a slight advantage of CHIKV-LR over the CHIKV-Cbn for replication in human fibroblasts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In contrast, CHIKV-Cbn exhibited enhanced growth kinetics in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells, resulting in 10-fold higher titers compared to CHIKV-LR. To assess the contribution of the 3’UTR to the differential behavior in insect cells, we designed chimeras containing the 3’UTR from CHIKV-LR in the context of the CHIKV-Cbn genome and vice versa. Equal amounts of RNA transcripts from parental and chimeric viruses were individually transfected into BHK or C6/36 cells. Then, virus replication was monitored by immunofluorescence as a function of time and virus growth curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In BHK cells, similar levels of replication were observed for parental and chimeric viruses of both LR and Cbn lineages, demonstrating that neither the virus backbone nor the 3’UTR play lineage specific functions and that the 3’UTR may be swapped between viral isolates. On the other hand, in mosquito cells the 3’UTR from CHIKV-Cbn provided CHIKV-LR a net advantage for replication, displaying increased percentage of infected cells at two days after transfection and enhanced growth kinetics compared to the parental virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In contrast, the 3’UTR from CHIKV-LR disfavored replication of CHIKV-Cbn in the same cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). So far, our results indicate that CHIKV-Cbn contains a 3’UTR advantageous for viral replication in C6/36 cells but without benefit for replication in different mammalian cells.
