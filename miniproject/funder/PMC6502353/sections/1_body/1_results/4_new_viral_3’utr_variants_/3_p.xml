<p>Overall, these results are the first evidence that RNA recombination occurs at the 3â€™UTR of CHIKV by means of template switching driven by sequence homology of DRs, and provide a molecular mechanism for the generation of viruses with deletions in the DR regions. Despite differences in frequency, RNA recombination was observed in both mammalian and mosquito cells, suggesting that it is a general mechanism of genome variability.</p>
