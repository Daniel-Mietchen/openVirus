<p>Viral variants carrying deletions at their 3’UTR appeared in CHIKV populations. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism responsible for the generation of these new viral variants. It is accepted that RNA recombination contributes to genetic diversity of many RNA viruses, impacting on their evolution, epidemiology and re-emergence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RNA deletions are often generated during RNA recombination by a copy-choice mechanism. This process involves dissociation of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the nascent strand from the RNA template, and their re-association at a different position of either the original RNA or template switch to a homologous RNA, guided by sequence similarities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, i and ii, respectively). Template switching from a donor to an acceptor strand generates a chimeric RNA molecule. Given the fact that CHIKV contains various copies of sequence repetitions at its 3’UTR, we reasoned that 3’ variability could be originated by a copy-choice mechanism. To differentiate between re-association on the same or an alternative template molecule, we introduced point mutations into CHIKV-Cbn infectious clone in order to generate recognition sites for two unique restriction enzymes at the boundaries of the 3’UTR. Thus, when the RNA marked with the restriction sites is mixed with parental unmarked RNA, recombination between homologous RNAs by template switching will generate a chimeric 3’UTR carrying only one of the marker sites. We engineered 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction sites at positions 1–6 and 858–863 after the translation stop codon. The recombinant CHIKV-Cbn 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I
 <italic>/Nhe</italic>I was infective in both mammalian and mosquito cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). To visualize the presence of 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I sites, fragments corresponding to the last 1,500 nucleotides of the viral genome were obtained by PCR and separately digested with the two restriction enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007706.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The fragment amplified from the recombinant virus was sensitive to both 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion, and the introduced mutations were stable in cell culture even after 5 successive passages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, right panels). Then, to evaluate template-switching events, equal amounts of RNA transcripts for the parental and CHIKV-Cbn 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I
 <italic>/Nhe</italic>I were co-transfected into cultured cells. At day 3 after transfection, total RNA was extracted from culture media, used as a template for reverse transcription reactions and cloned. The presence of 
 <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I sites was assessed by enzymatic digestion of PCR products amplified from individual clones. For confirmation, the 3’UTRs were also sequenced and relative abundances of viral variants were calculated. About 15% and 50% of the viruses recovered from mosquito and mammalian cells, respectively, contained full-length 3’UTRs with only one of the two restriction sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). The emergence of these new recombinant variants, that were absent in the input mixture of RNAs, strongly suggests that they were products of a template switching mechanism generated by a polymerase that jumped from a RNA to the same position of a homologous RNA.
