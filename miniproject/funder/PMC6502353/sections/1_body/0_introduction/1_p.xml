<p>RNA viruses occur in genetically diverse populations that allow viruses to replicate under unfavorable conditions, evade immune responses, and alternate between different hosts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rapid adaptation depends on the generation and positive selection of beneficial changes; and relies mainly on two molecular mechanisms: point mutations and genomic recombination [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007706.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Point mutations arise from the introduction of nucleotide changes by viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerases that lack proofreading activity. In turn, genomic recombination does not produce new changes at the nucleotide level. Instead, the rearrangement of existing genomes creates novel lineages and strains and it has resulted in re-emergence of many RNA viruses.
