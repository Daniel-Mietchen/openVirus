 <p>An emergent virus is a virus that has adapted to new hosts or environments through changes in its viral genome. Using as model chikungunya virus, which had explosively spread in the Americas and Europe during the last decade, we studied viral adaptability to mosquito and mammalian hosts. Natural isolates from recent outbreaks display highly different 3’UTRs, which result in different fitness in mosquito cells. Importantly, drastic changes in viral populations occur when the virus jumps between hosts, with different viral variants being positively and negatively selected according to fitness parameters. Frequent events of RNA recombination, in which the viral polymerase switches templates during RNA synthesis, were observed at the viral 3’UTR. RNA recombination explains the high plasticity of this part of the genome and the subsequent emergence of new viral variants that allows the virus to replicate in disparate systems. Our findings support a new model where viral diversity generated by RNA recombination is a potent viral strategy to overcome the fitness barriers imposed during host switching.</p>
