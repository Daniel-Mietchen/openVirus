   <bold>(A)</bold> Left, schematic representation of the organization of the 3'UTRs of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn. DRs are indicated with the same color code as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Right, RNA matrix comparison of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn 3’UTRs, where each 3’UTR sequence was compared to itself, in order to search for repeated sequences patterns. Lines parallel to the central diagonal line evidence direct repeats. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Comparative growth kinetics of CHIKV-LR and CHIKV-Cbn in BHK, human fibroblasts, and C6/36 cells. Cells were infected with MOI = 0.1. Infectious viral particles were titrated by plaque assays at the indicated time points. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean, n = 3. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni´s test using PRISM5 (GraphPad Software). At 20h and 30h, p&lt;0.01 in C6/36 and p&lt;0.05 in human fibroblasts. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Expression of CHIKV proteins in C6/36 and BHK cells transfected with RNAs from CHIKV-LR and a chimeric CHIKV-LR carrying the Cbn-3’UTR (LR/3’Cbn), or the CHIKV-Cbn and a chimeric CHIKV-Cbn carrying LR-3’UTR (Cbn/3’LR). Viral replication was monitored by immunofluorescence assay as a function of time after RNA transfection using specific CHIKV antibodies (left) and virus growth curves (right). Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean, n = 3. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni´s test using PRISM5 (GraphPad Software). At 20h and 30h, p&lt;0.05 for Cbn/3’LR compared to the Cbn, and for LR/3’Cbn compared to LR.
