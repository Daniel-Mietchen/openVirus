  <title>Replication kinetics of CHIKV-Cbn WT and Δ(1+2)abb’ in human fibroblasts.</title>
  <p>Top, schematic representation of the 3’UTR corresponding to the CHIKV-Cbn wild type (Cbn WT) and the recombinant virus lacking three copies of DR (1+2) [Cbn Δ(1+2)abb’]. DR copies are represented with colored blocks and DR deletions are indicated with light grey blocks. Bottom, comparative growth kinetics (left) and immunofluorescence at 2 days post-infection (right) of Cbn WT and Cbn Δ(1+2)abb’in human fibroblasts. Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean, n = 3.</p>
