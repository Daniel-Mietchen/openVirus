  <title>Dynamics of the 3’UTR of viral populations during host switch.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref>, Experiment II) was used to infect C6/36 cells (Host Switch I; n = 2). Then, viral population released from mosquito cells was switched back to replicate in BHK cells (Host Switch II) or human fibroblasts (Host Switch III). Pie charts with frequencies of viral variants are shown (3’Cbn, grey and New 3’UTRs, red). Viral variants with New 3’UTRs after switching to mosquito cells are indicated in orange. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Oral infection of 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes with CHIKV-Cbn grown in mammalian cells. On days 2 and 8, individual mosquitoes were collected for RNA extraction, 3’UTR analysis and virus titration. Pie charts with frequencies of 3’UTR variants (3’Cbn, grey and New 3’UTRs, red) obtained for each mosquito are shown. Virus titers for individual mosquitoes are shown. Lines represent the medians.
