  <title>Nucleotide sequences of CHIKV 3’UTRs during adaptation to mosquito cells.</title>
  <p>Alignment of nucleotide sequences corresponding to the 3’UTR during adaptation experiments to C6/36 cells from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3</xref> is shown. Input Cbn-WT sequence is presented as reference. Numbers on the left correspond to those of the clones schematized in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g003">Fig 3C</xref> (left). Nucleotide changes are indicated in orange. Position 1 refers to the first position after the translation stop codon.
