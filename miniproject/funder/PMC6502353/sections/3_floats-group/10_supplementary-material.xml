  <title>Strategy for detection of 
   <italic>Sac</italic>I and 
   <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction sites in individual clones.
  </title>
  <p>Individual clones of pGEM-T Easy containing CHIKV 3’UTRs were used as template for PCR reactions with M13F and M13R primers. The 3’UTR insert and pGEM-T Easy vector are represented in red and grey, respectively. Then, amplified fragments were digested with 
   <italic>Sac</italic>I or 
   <italic>Nhe</italic>I restriction enzymes. Because M13F and M13R primers anneal at different distances from the T-overhangs in pGEM-T Easy, directionality of the insert impacts on the band sizes generated after digestion of the PCR products. The expected sizes of the bands are indicated for an insert in the two possible orientations of DNA ligation (A or B).
