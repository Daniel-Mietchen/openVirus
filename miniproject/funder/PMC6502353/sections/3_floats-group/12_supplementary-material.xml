  <title>Nucleotide sequences of the chimeric 3â€™UTRs produced by a copy-choice mechanism.</title>
  <p>Alignment of nucleotide sequences of recombinants generated by template switch from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7</xref> is shown. Input LR-WT and Cbn-WT are presented as reference. Lineage-specific nucleotides from LR-WT and Cbn-WT are shown in red and blue, respectively. Sequence labels matches the numbering of individual clones 8 and 16 in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007706.g007">Fig 7</xref>. Changes detected in chimeric RNAs are indicated with the respective colors. Sites of template switching are marked with orange arrows. Position 1 refers to the first position after the translation stop codon.
