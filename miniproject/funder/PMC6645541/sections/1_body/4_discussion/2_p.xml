<p>Since 2015, Queensland Health, in collaboration with local government, has developed the Queensland Dengue Management Plan 2015–2020 (DMP) which focuses on key areas of dengue management that are international best practice such as vector surveillance and control, outbreak management, case surveillance and public health management, and public awareness and community engagement. Further, Eliminate Dengue is conducting open field trial a novel bio-control strategy that will reduce the ability of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>Aegypti</italic> to transmit dengue virus. The approach is centred on releasing 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with selected strains of the bacterial endosymbiont 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Field release trials in north Queensland have demonstrated that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be rapidly driven to fixation in populations by a process of selective inheritance, known as cytoplasmic incompatibility. This process impaired the mosquito to transmits dengue virus with ultimate reduction of dengue cases. This might be the reason for low number of local dengue cases in the last 2–3 years.
