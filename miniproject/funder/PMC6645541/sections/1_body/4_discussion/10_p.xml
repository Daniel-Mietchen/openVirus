<p>Potential limitations to this study could firstly be underreporting and misreporting of both autochthonous and overseas acquired cases due to asymptomatic infection. Secondly, the exact place/location (i.e., residential address) where dengue cases were notified may vary from those where they were infected/ acquired, particularly during holiday periods. Use of relatively short time frame for the spatio-temporal distribution may subject to bias.</p>
