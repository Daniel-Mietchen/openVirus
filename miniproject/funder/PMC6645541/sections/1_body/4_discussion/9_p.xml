<p>The strengths of the study are as follows: most of the previous spatio-temporal studies of dengue in Australia [

 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as well as other countries such as in Bangladesh [

 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Sri Lanka [
 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] largely focused on autochthonous cases. However, this study has included both autochthonous and overseas acquired cases at fine spatial scale with special focus on recent outbreaks. Thus, this study has provided more specific information on clusters for local health departments facing the different risks of autochthonous and overseas acquired dengue cases. Secondly, we considered three different indices (previously but not currently affected areas, both previously and currently affected areas, and newly affected areas) to show the geographic expansion of dengue infections at fine spatial scale. This will allow for the easy identification of geographic expansion of disease activity for resource allocation and mosquito control program.
