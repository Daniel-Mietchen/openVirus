<p>Our results seem to reflect similar patterns observed in the previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], albeit at a fine spatial scale. Hu et al. (2012) showed high-incidence LGA (Local Government Areas) clusters for locally acquired infections were in north Queensland where as high-incidence clusters for overseas acquired cases were in north and south-east Queensland. Therefore, the patterns seem consistent over time and method of analysis.
