<p>Considering the lack of research focusing on recent dengue outbreaks in Queensland, and the lack of analysis at fine spatial scale, this study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal trends of both autochthonous and overseas acquired dengue cases during 2010â€“2015 in Queensland to identify high-risk areas at small geographical scale and thereby help in planning resource allocation for dengue prevention and intervention. Further, this study will help to understand the effect of the release of Wolbachia as a vector control strategy in Queensland.</p>
