<p>Since 2005 Queensland has experienced an increased number of overseas travels and visitor arrivals [

 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] from dengue endemic countries, the arrival of

 <italic>Aedes</italic> vector incursions in Cairns and Brisbane [
 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is also projected that the spatial range of dengue vectors will expand into south and west of the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], even all over Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0220134.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] under adaptive measures of inevitable climate change. Thus, it is necessary to further investigate the spatio-temporal trend of both overseas acquired and autochthonous cases at fine spatial scale taking special consideration of recent outbreaks for prioritising resource allocation and dengue control management. Besides, Eliminate Dengue with the support of World Mosquito Programme (WMP) (

Under this mosquito control programme whether the spatial and temporal patterns have been changed needs to be investigated.
