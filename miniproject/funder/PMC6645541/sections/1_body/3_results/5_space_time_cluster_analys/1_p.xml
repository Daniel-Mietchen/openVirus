 <xref rid="pone.0220134.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the spatio-temporal cluster analysis, stratified by autochthonous and overseas acquired cases. Using a maximum spatial cluster size of ≤50% of the total population, only one statistically significant cluster of autochthonous cases was detected, which included 50 SLAs around the Cassowary coast (RR = 54.52, radius = 225.83km, p&lt;0.001) during 2013–2015.
