<p>Transmission of TB occurs via infectious aerosols, where upon exposure individuals can either clear the infection, develop active disease or remain latently infected [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The complex dynamics of TB infection and disease are determined by the environment, the host and the pathogen [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Seven main phylogenetic lineages of the 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> complex (MTBC) (Lineage 1–7) cause TB in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These lineages are phylogeographically distributed, partially reflecting human migration histories [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Genomic differences among the MTBC strains translate into relevant biological and epidemiological phenotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Epidemiologically speaking, these phenotypes are demonstrated by indicators such as transmission potential, disease severity and progression rates from infection to disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In general, strains of the widely distributed lineages, Lineage 2 and 4 or “generalists”, appear to be more virulent than those of the geographically restricted lineages, Lineage 5 and 6 or “specialists” [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
