<p>In this study, we applied for the first time a robust SNP typing method to classify the largest so far nationwide representative collection of clinical isolates to gain insights into unknown patterns of MTBC diversity in different regions of Tanzania. Given that only few studies have assessed and identified lineage-specific differences in clinical settings, we then looked for potential associations between the MTBC lineages and the available clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients in the study population.</p>
