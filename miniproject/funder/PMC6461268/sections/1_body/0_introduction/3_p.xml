<p>Studying genotype-phenotype relationships requires understanding the genetic diversity of MTBC clinical strains in a given clinical setting. In Tanzania, few studies have described the genetic diversity of the MTBC [

 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These previous works used conventional genotyping tools such as the spacer oligonucleotide typing (spoligotyping) technique and revealed the presence of mainly the East African Indian (EAI), Central Asian (CAS) and Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) spoligo families, and the Beijing family reported only at the lowest frequencies. Based on phylogenetically robust techniques, which include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the spoligo families correspond to Lineage 1, 3, 4 and 2, respectively. These previous studies from Tanzania are limited as they only focused on few specific geographical locations on the country and only one study profiled MTBC on a countrywide scale albeit with low sampling coverage [

Moreover, despite the invaluable contribution of techniques like spoligotyping in the molecular epidemiology field, such techniques are suboptimal for phylogenetically robust strain classification due to high rates of convergent evolution [
