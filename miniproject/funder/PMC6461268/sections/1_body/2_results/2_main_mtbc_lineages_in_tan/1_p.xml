<p>Using SNP-typing, we detected four of the seven known MTBC lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206334.g001">Fig 1</xref>), albeit at varying proportions. In our study population, Lineage 4 and Lineage 3 were the most frequent (866, 42.5% and 681, 33.4%, respectively) followed by Lineage 1 (336, 16.5%). Lineage 2 was the least frequent (92, 4.5%). The remaining 64 clinical isolates (3.1%) could not be assigned to any of the MTBC lineages possibly because there was insufficient amount of DNA in the samples (below the detection limit). Of the seven geographical zones, four (Coastal, Northern, Lake and Southern Highlands) were highly represented with more than 100 clinical strains each (
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The distribution of the MTBC lineages varied within the geographical zones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206334.g001">Fig 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206334.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Our findings reveal that Lineage 1 strains were more frequent in the Lake zone compared to the overall average frequency (20.9% vs. 16.8%), whereas the frequency of Lineage 3 in this zone was lower (27.6% vs. 34.3%) compared to other geographical zones. By contrast, Lineage 4 was the most predominant in all geographical zones and showed relatively similar frequencies across the zones.
