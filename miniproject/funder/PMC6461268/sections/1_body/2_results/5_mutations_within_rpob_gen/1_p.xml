<p>To investigate whether drug resistance was linked to a particular lineage, we included in total 144 out of 321 retreatment cases for drug resistance genotyping of the 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene that confers resistance to rifampicin. Out of these, 112 (77.8%) had no mutations compared to the H37
 <italic>Rv</italic> reference gene and 15 (10.4%) contained at least one mutation, either synonymous (3/15) or non-synonymous (12/15) (

 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene of 17 (11.8%) retreatment cases due to PCR and sequencing failure. Among the 12 strains detected with non-synonymous 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> mutations, five belonged to Lineage 2, four to Lineage 4, and three to Lineage 3 (
