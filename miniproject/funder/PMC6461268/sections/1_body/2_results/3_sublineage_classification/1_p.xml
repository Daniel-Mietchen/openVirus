<p>After we detected four main MTBC lineages, we next explored the respective subfamilies on a subset of Lineage 1, 3 and 4 strains using spoligotyping. Lineage 2 strains were excluded from this analysis since the global strains almost exclusively belong to one spoligotype family, Beijing with almost identical fingerprint pattern. We identified 24 spoligotypes (SITs; Spoligotype International Type) among the 107 clinical strains analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206334.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Twenty six (24.3%) of the spoligo patterns had not been previously reported in the SITVITWEB database and therefore we assigned them as orphan spoligotypes. Several spoligotypes were identified within each of the three lineages. EAI5 was the common spoligotype among the Lineage 1 and CAS1_Kili spoligotype among the Lineage 3 strains. Within Lineage 4 strains, LAM, T, and H families were detected and the LAM subfamily, particularly LAM_ZWE was the most frequent.
