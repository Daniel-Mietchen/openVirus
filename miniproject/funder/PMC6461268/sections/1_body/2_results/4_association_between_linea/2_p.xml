<p>Lineage 2 has previously been associated with retreatment cases, drug resistance and lately also with female sex [

 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We therefore investigated if similar associations exist in our study population using a subset of TB cases with complete clinical and demographic information (n = 1,535). To assess these associations we performed logistic regression analyses comparing Lineage 2 to all other lineages pooled together (

Our analyses revealed Lineage 2 to be independently associated with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.31 – 3.50, p = 0.002) and retreatment cases (aOR 1.67; 95% CI 0.95 – 2.84, p = 0.065). We did not detect any association between the lineages and patients’ age and the HIV status.
