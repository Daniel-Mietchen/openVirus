<p>Having described the circulating main lineages of the MTBC we then assessed the relationship between these lineages and patients’ characteristics in the study population (
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We detected a higher proportion of female sex among TB patients infected with Lineage 2 (52.1%) compared to those infected with the other three lineages (range from 31% to 34.5%, p = 0.009). Moreover, we observed that retreatment cases were frequently infected with Lineage 2 strains (26.8%), which was twofold higher compared to Lineage 1 and 4 strains (p &lt; 0.001). We found no evidence for association between lineages and patients’ characteristics such as age and HIV status (
