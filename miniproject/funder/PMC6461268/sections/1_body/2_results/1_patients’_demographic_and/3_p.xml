However, the male-to-female ratio observed in our study population was higher than the national estimates for the two years of sampling (2.2:1 vs., 1.4:1). The striking gender imbalance among TB cases seems to peak at adolescence onwards and is less pronounced among pediatric TB cases (

In contrast, TB/HIV co-infected cases were more likely to be female (44.5%, CI 38.3–50.7% vs., 25.8%, 95% CI 20.6–31.0%) which is consistent with HIV being generally more prevalent in females than males in Tanzania [

Finally, more than half (51.6%, 1029/1996) of the TB patients in our study population were diagnosed in the Coastal zone of Tanzania and about 40% were either diagnosed in the Lake and Northern zones. In addition to higher TB notification rates, the three former mentioned geographical zones contain the country’s zonal TB reference laboratories. The remaining 10% of the patients were diagnosed in any of the remaining four geographical zones of Tanzania.
