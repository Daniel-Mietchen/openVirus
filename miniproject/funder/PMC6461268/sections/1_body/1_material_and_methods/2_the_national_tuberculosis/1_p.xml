<p>Our study was based on a nationwide convenience sample of sputum smear positive new and retreatment TB cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2013 in Tanzania. The collection was obtained via a platform established for routine TB drug resistance surveillance by the National Tuberculosis Leprosy Program (NTLP) of Tanzania, covering health facilities in all geographical regions of the country. Briefly, smear positive sputa specimens from approximately 25% of new TB cases and from all retreatment cases were obtained for the drug resistance surveillance. To obtain 25% sputa from new cases each region was allocated four months per annum, where the respective health facilities in the region submitted sputa samples to zonal reference laboratories for culture. The zonal laboratories include the Central Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory (CTRL) in Dar es Salaam, Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in Mwanza and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC) in Kilimanjaro, which serve the Coastal and Southern zone, the Lake zone, and the Northern zone, respectively. Isolates from the two zonal laboratories, BMC and KCMC were then sent to the CTRL for drug susceptibility testing (DST). For this study we included all the isolates we could retrieve from the culture archives at the CTRL.</p>
