<p>For statistical analysis, we applied descriptive statistics to delineate patients’ characteristics. We used Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for assessment of differences between groups in categorical variables, whenever applicable. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to assess for the association between MTBC lineages and patients’ clinical and demographic characteristics. The associations were assessed for Lineage 2 compared to all other lineages (Lineages 1, 3 and 4), adjusting for age, sex, disease category and HIV status. All statistical analyses were performed in R 3.5.0 [
