<p>We then classified the MTBC clinical isolates into main phylogenetic lineages by TaqMan real-time PCR according to standard protocols (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, USA) and as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, the TaqMan PCR uses fluorescently labeled allele-specific probes for singleplex SNP-typing that are specific for each MTBC lineage. For comparisons, we also performed 43-spacer spoligotyping on a membrane for a subset of representative MTBC clinical strains following standard protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], since spoligotyping is still widely used as a gold standard for genotyping in similar settings. We randomly selected 107 samples out of the 2,039 representative of three lineages, Lineage 1, 3 and 4. We excluded Lineage 2 strains for this analysis given that such strains almost exclusively belong to the Beijing family. The clinical strains were assigned to spoligotype families using the online database SITVITWEB [
