<p>The smear positive sputa samples were cultured on Löwenstein Jensen (LJ) growth medium according to laboratory protocols. For this study, we included MTBC clinical isolates retrieved from archived LJ media. We then prepared heat inactivated samples for the retrieved clinical isolates by suspending MTBC colonies into 1ml sterile water and heat inactivate at 95°C for one hour.</p>
