<p>We selected a subset of 144 clinical isolates from the 321 retreatment cases to perform molecular drug resistance testing. We used a previously described multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to target the rifampicin resistance determining region of 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The PCR assay targets both the tuberculous and non-tuberculous 
 <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> (MTBC and NTMs, respectively) 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene, so we could also rule out the presence of non-tuberculous isolates in our study sample using the assay. The amplified 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene product was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and sent for Sanger sequencing. We analyzed the resulting sequences by Staden software package [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and using MTBC H37Rv 
 <italic>rpoB</italic> gene as reference sequence.
