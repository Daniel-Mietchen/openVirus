<p>Our study is limited by focusing on a convenient collection of MTBC clinical isolates that could be retrieved from the culture archives, representing 1.6% of all TB cases notified in 2012 and 2013. Given that our findings are based on a limited number of TB cases, the results particularly those related to associations between lineages and patientsâ€™ characteristics should be taken with caution as the strength or lack of such associations could likely be affected by the sampling. In addition, most of the geographical zones were underrepresented which could in turn underestimate the respective regional lineage composition and the overall countrywide distribution. Unfortunately, data on drug susceptibility based on other methods such as Xpert MTB/RIF, phenotypic DST and Line Probe Assay (LPA) were unavailable, which could have complemented the drug resistance genotyping performed on a limited subset of the retreatment cases. Systematic sampling would allow for better resolution on the distribution patterns, the frequencies and on epidemiological features of MTBC lineages, which might partially determine the regional specific epidemics.</p>
