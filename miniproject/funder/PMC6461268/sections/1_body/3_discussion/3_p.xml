<p>The burden of TB disease is generally higher in males [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], rendering male sex as a potential risk factor for TB. Furthermore, the male bias among TB patients is also observed in settings with no obvious sex-based differences in health-seeking behavior [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Whilst we show similar trends in this study, our findings reveal that the proportion of females was higher among TB patients infected with Lineage 2. This finding is consistent with several other previous studies conducted in different settings [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Social and physiological factors predisposing males to higher risk of TB have been indicated [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. On the one hand, these include risk behaviors such as substance abuse (alcoholism, tobacco smoking) and gender specific roles such as risk occupations (e.g., mining) that are male dominated and known to increase the risk for TB. On the other hand, genetic makeup and sex hormones might contribute to the differences in TB susceptibility among females and males, as epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested female sex hormones to be protective [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These observations would propose that the sex imbalance in TB emerges after the onset of puberty. Of note, we observe less sex imbalance in “child” age group (&lt;15 years) which also corroborates the national notification rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, this observation can be confounded by BCG vaccination which might be most effective in this age group. Despite the high prevalence of HIV among young females in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and HIV being the strongest risk factor for TB, TB burden remains higher in males. While social and physiological aspects play an important role, findings from this study and others previously conducted in Nepal and Vietnam [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] suggest that bacterial factors could disrupt the trends towards male bias in TB, a finding which warrants further investigation. Our hypothesis is that because of higher virulence, Lineage 2 strains are able to overcome the resistance poised by female sex which could explain the less pronounced sex imbalanced.
