<p>Among the 7 human–adapted MTBC lineages, Lineage 4 is the most broadly distributed and occurs at high frequencies in Europe, the Americas and Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study, we observe that TB epidemics in Tanzania are also predominated by Lineage 4, which is regarded as the most successful of MTBC lineages [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In general, the wide geographical range of Lineage 4 is postulated to be driven by a combination of its enhanced virulence, high rates of human migration linked to its spread and ultimately its ability to infect different human population backgrounds [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In contrast, Lineage 1 and 3 are known to be mainly confined to the rim of the Indian Ocean [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is consistent with our observation that nearly 50% of the MTBC strains included in the study belong to these two lineages. This high frequency of Lineage 1 and 3 likely reflects the long-term migrations between Eastern Africa and the Indian subcontinent [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, the distribution and frequency of Lineage 1 and 3 in the mainland subset did not vary from that of the coastal region, suggesting spread via internal migrations. Lineage 1 was proposed to have evolved in East Africa prior disseminating out of the continent [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on this, one might expect higher frequencies of Lineage 1 in the region. Instead, the so called “modern” (TbD1−) lineages (4 and 3 in this case) could be dominating in Tanzania despite presumably being introduced into the African continent only after the first European contact [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This perhaps illustrates the ability of “modern” lineages to thrive in co-existence with the pre-existing “ancient” (TbD1+) lineages such as Lineage 1 in our case, perhaps because of the comparably higher virulence [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The neighboring countries of Tanzania on the other hand show comparable MTBC lineage composition to our study [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], suggesting common demographic histories and ongoing exchanges that resulted into distinct MTBC populations. Our findings would suggest the frequency of Lineage 2–Beijing in Tanzania, like in most parts of the continent except for South Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] to be relatively low, despite the long-standing African-Asian contacts [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidence from recent studies show that Lineage 2–Beijing was only recently introduced into Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
