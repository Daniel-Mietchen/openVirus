<p>Finally, based on the age distribution of TB cases in our study, recent or ongoing transmission in high burden countries is implicated as the main contributor to the TB burden rather than disease reactivation (following longer latency periods) [

 <xref rid="pone.0206334.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this study, we did not detect any differences in median age of TB patients infected with different lineages (
