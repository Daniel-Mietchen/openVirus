<p>In this study, we classified the countrywide collection of 2,039 MTBC isolates representing 1.6% of all smear positive new and retreatment TB cases notified during 2012 and 2013 in Tanzania. Our findings show that the MTBC strains among the study population are diverse, comprising four main phylogenetic lineages (Lineage 1–4) which occur throughout the country. Specifically, we found that Lineage 4 was the most frequent, followed by Lineage 3 and 1. Despite Lineage 2’s recent global dissemination [

Finally, our analysis on the relationship between MTBC lineages and patients’ characteristics revealed associations of Lineage 2 with female sex and retreatment TB cases included in the study population.
