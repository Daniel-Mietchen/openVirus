<p>In addition to its association with female sex, we found that retreatment TB cases were more likely infected with Lineage 2. A retreatment case in our study population represented recurrent TB case either due to relapse or reinfection. We hypothesized that this observation was possibly linked to drug resistance, given the previous reported association between Lineage 2 and drug resistance [

However, we detected only 8.3% (12/144) of strains among the retreatment subset tested to contain mutations conferring resistance to rifampicin, five of which belonged to Lineage 2. These findings would suggest that retreatment cases included in this study are mainly driven by reinfection as opposed to treatment failure or relapse.
