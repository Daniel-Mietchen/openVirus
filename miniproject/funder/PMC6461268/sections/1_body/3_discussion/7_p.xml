<p>In conclusion, this study addresses for the first time the countrywide MTBC population structure based on robust SNP-typing. We show that MTBC population in Tanzania is diverse with four of the seven known lineages detected. This study sets the stage for further in depth investigations on epidemiological impact of MTBC lineages in Tanzania.</p>
