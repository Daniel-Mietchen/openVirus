<p>The most challenging of these relate to human behaviour. Prevention of HIV infection usually requires people to continually make positive health choices. Social context affects individual behaviour and often negatively influences the effectiveness of biomedical preventive interventions. Even if HIV prevention efforts were optimally implemented to achieve a new infection rate of near zero, ‘disinhibition’ could revert this success. Cultural factors have probably slowed adoption of male circumcision - less than one quarter of the targeted 20 million African men have undergone the procedure

TasP is similarly complex, given that only a fraction of HIV-infected people benefits of the care continuum to achieve an undetectable viral load with ART. TasP would have a maximum efficiency if ART were provided during the early HIV infection phase, which remains a challenge in most countries.
