<p>Health officials and funders may be tempted by impressive reductions in HIV infections by decreasing funding and attention paid to control programmes, with the negative consequence of resurgence of the HIV epidemic, particularly in the absence of a sustainable solution like a vaccine. Therefore, although it might be possible to control and even end the HIV-AIDS pandemic using existing interventions, in order to reach this goal more quickly and to sustain the success, a safe and at least moderately effective HIV vaccine may remain essential. However, the ultimate choice of combined prevention interventions should remain adaptive to the evolution of the epidemic and to their cost-benefit analysis.</p>
