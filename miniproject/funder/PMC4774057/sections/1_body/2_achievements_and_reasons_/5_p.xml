<p>Significant advances have been achieved in HIV vaccine development. A community-based Phase III trial (RV144) provided the first evidence that an HIV-1 vaccine might prevent HIV infection in humans
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The vaccine regimen conferred a 31.2 per cent efficacy after 42 months of follow up. In a 
 <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis, vaccine efficacy was significantly higher (60%) at 12 months post-vaccination, suggesting an early, but non-durable, vaccine effect. The RV144 immune correlates of risk analysis showed that IgG antibodies to the V1V2 region of gp120 correlated with decreased risk of infection while IgA antibodies to Env were directly associated with infection risk. These correlates were supported by a “sieve” analysis of breakthrough viruses suggesting that genetic mutations away from V2 sequences found in the vaccine were associated with altered efficacy
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Whether various envelope immunogens eliciting V2 antibodies are functionally strain-specific, region-specific or universal in a cross-clade manner and universal correlates of risk in populations with various modes of transmission remain to be demonstrated in future efficacy trials. Other vaccine approaches for a globally effective vaccine including immunogens derived from conserved or mosaics sequences expressed by various vectors are being developed
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Our current understanding of the immune correlates of protection suggests that no specific vaccine approach should be privileged over the other and that all reasonable vaccine approaches deserve to be pursued.
