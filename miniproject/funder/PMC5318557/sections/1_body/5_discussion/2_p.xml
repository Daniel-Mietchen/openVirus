They interpret an undetectable viral load as a demonstration that recent missed doses are not significant. The extent and impact of medication side effects were also consistently under-reported to clinicians, and possibly within the trial. Some participants had come to perceive these side effects as inevitable and not worthy of mentioning to clinic staff. Further research with young people on EFV-based medication is urgently needed to understand how side effects might affect their adherence and their perceptions of themselves, health and HIV.
