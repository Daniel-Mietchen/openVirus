<p>A key limitation of our study is the narrow population on which these findings are based (relying on those agreeing to participate in the clinical trial and then also in the qualitative substudy). Also, being in the trial may have been conducive to better adherence, due to the increased support and monitoring in the study, particularly in contexts with little or no routine access to this level of care. So far we have not explored the acceptability of SCT among those who refused to take part in the trial or were not eligible. It will be vital to include these young people in the future to address acceptability of SCT more broadly and robustly.</p>
