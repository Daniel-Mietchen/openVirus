   <p>Including a qualitative study in the trial has enriched our understanding of the impact and influence of Short Cycle Therapy (SCT) on young people's experiences of adherence. Understanding their perspectives and experiences is crucial for the intervention to be effective beyond the trial.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>By specifically acknowledging adherence challenges in childhood and adolescence, if framed thoughtfully, healthcare staff can use SCT to show a greater contextual understanding about the reasons why and ways in which treatment can get disrupted.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>A key limitation of our study is the narrow population on which these findings are based (relying on those agreeing to participate in the clinical trial and then also in the qualitative study).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Being in the trial may in and of itself have been conducive to better adherence, due to the increased support and monitoring in the study, particularly in contexts with little or no routine access to this level of care.</p>
