<p>The qualitative study employed a longitudinal, mixed-methods design and took place in the UK, Ireland, the USA and Uganda. All young people recruited into the BREATHER trial in these countries, and aged 10–24, were eligible to participate in our study. This was subject to self-awareness of HIV infection (for at least 6 months), since not all trial participants were aware of their HIV-positive status. Children under the age of 10 were not deemed old enough to participate meaningfully in our qualitative research. In addition to consent procedures for the clinical trial, we carried out separate consent and assent procedures as appropriate and participants were reimbursed at rates in line with standard local research practices.</p>
