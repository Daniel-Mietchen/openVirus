<p>We report on the experiences of participants from both arms (rather than just those on SCT) to address the question of acceptability of the intervention to the patient target group. Given that they were randomly assigned to the intervention or control arm, they all had equal chance of being put onto SCT. Hence, all participants had important insights to share about how they perceived SCT as an intervention for young people living with HIV. It is critical to note that we did not find significant differences in experience or attitudes to SCT by gender, age or country site. The slight differences we noted were limited to the style of accounting across countries and ages, but there was no variation by content.</p>
