<p>We conducted four FGDs in Uganda after the trial findings had been reported to the study participants by clinicians. At this point, trial participants had moved into a follow-up phase of the trial and were continuing in their same assigned treatment arms. In addition to including a theoretically informed subsample of the interview sample, we invited six further trial participants, who had not previously been involved in the qualitative study, to take part in the FGDs to broaden our understanding of the acceptability of SCT across the trial patient group.</p>
