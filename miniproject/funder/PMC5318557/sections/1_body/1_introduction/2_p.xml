<p>We report on the findings from a qualitative study undertaken as part of BREATHER (PENTA 16). BREATHER is a global, phase II, randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority trial testing the efficacy of Short Cycle Therapy (SCT) (5 days on /2 days off) for young people living with HIV (aged 8–24) on an efavirenz (EFV)-based combination.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Among the inclusion criteria for the BREATHER trial were: having an undetectable viral load and being on an EFV-based combination for the prior 12 months. Treatment interruption interventions, including SCT, aim to encourage long-term adherence by offering patients regulated time off medication. The trial design to test having the weekends off treatment was informed by anecdotal evidence suggesting that managed interruptions can ameliorate the challenges of adhering continuously.
