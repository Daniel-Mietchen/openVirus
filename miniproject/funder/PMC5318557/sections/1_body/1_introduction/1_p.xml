<p>Rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence tend to be lower among young people (aged 10–24) living with HIV compared with their adult counterparts in all settings, despite important geographical variations.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–3</xref> Multiple social aspects of adherence for the paediatric HIV population need to be taken into consideration alongside the specific contexts of local HIV epidemics.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Lack of disclosure of their HIV status and, commonly, insufficient discussions about the implications of HIV and ART often fail to adequately support young people's ongoing adherence.
