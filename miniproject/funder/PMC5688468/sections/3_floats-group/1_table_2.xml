     <sup>d</sup> (i.e. who are either part of a population with high HBV seroprevalence or who have a history of exposure and/or high-risk behaviours for HBV infection);

     <sup>f</sup>;
     <break/> • Health-care workers: in all settings, it is recommended that HBsAg serological testing be offered and hepatitis B vaccination given to all health-care workers who have not been vaccinated previously (

   <sup>a</sup>The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to categorize the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional (based on consideration of the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, resource use and programmatic feasibility) and the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>b</sup>A threshold of ≥2% or ≥5% seroprevalence was based on several published thresholds of intermediate or high seroprevalence. The threshold used will depend on other country considerations and epidemiological context
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>c</sup>Many countries have chosen to adopt routine testing in all pregnant women, regardless of seroprevalence in the general population, and particularly where seroprevalence ≥2%. A full vaccination schedule including birth dose should be completed in all infants, in accordance with the WHO position paper on hepatitis B vaccines 2009
   <sup>g</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>d</sup>Includes those who are either part of a population with higher seroprevalence (e.g. some mobile/migrant populations from high/intermediate endemic countries, and certain indigenous populations) or who have a history of exposure or high-risk behaviours for HBV infection (e.g. PWID, people in prisons and other closed settings, MSM and sex workers, HIV-infected persons, partners, family members and children of HBV-infected persons)
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>e</sup>Features that may indicate underlying chronic HBV infection include clinical evidence of existing liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or where there is unexplained liver disease, including abnormal liver function tests or liver ultrasound
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>f</sup>In all settings, it is recommended that HBsAg serological testing with hepatitis B vaccination of those who are HBsAg negative and not previously vaccinated be offered to all children with parents or siblings diagnosed with HBV infection or with clinical suspicion of hepatitis, through community- or facility-based testing
