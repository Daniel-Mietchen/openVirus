   <sup>a</sup>The GRADE system (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to categorize the strength of recommendations as strong or conditional (based on consideration of the quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, acceptability, resource use and programmatic feasibility) and the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>b</sup>This may include fourth-generation combined antibody/antigen assays
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>c</sup>Includes those who are either part of a population with higher seroprevalence (e.g. some mobile/migrant populations from high/intermediate endemic countries, and certain indigenous populations) or who have a history of exposure or high-risk behaviours for HCV infection (e.g. PWID, people in prisons and other closed settings, MSM and sex workers, and HIV-infected persons, children of mothers with chronic HCV infection especially if HIV-coinfected)
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>d</sup>Features that may indicate underlying chronic HCV infection include clinical evidence of existing liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or where there is unexplained liver disease, including abnormal liver function tests or liver ultrasound
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>e</sup>A threshold of ≥2% or ≥5% seroprevalence was based on several published thresholds of intermediate and high seroprevalence. The threshold used will depend on other country considerations and epidemiological context
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>f</sup>Routine testing of pregnant women for HCV infection is currently not recommended
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>g</sup>Because of historical exposure to unscreened or inadequately screened blood products and/or poor injection safety
