<p id="Par2">In late 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which contains 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The SDGs represent a shift away from the disease–specific goals of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) era and have adopted an approach where health related goals are embedded across the SDGs. There is also a focus on integration and the aspiration of universal health insurance cover. SDG 3.3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages, and highlights the need to combat viral hepatitis [

 <italic>Global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis, 2016–2021</italic>, which was endorsed by the World Health Assembly in May 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. WHO’s vision is for “a world where viral hepatitis transmission is halted and everyone living with viral hepatitis has access to safe, affordable and effective prevention, care and treatment services” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The strategy also includes targets for the elimination of hepatitis B and C as public health threats - a 90% reduction in new chronic infections and a 65% reduction in mortality by 2030 from 2015 levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Achieving these targets will require reaching ambitious service coverage milestones across seven prevention and care interventions, that includes diagnosing 80% of people with chronic viral hepatitis by 2030 and treating eight million people by 2020, and 80% of those eligible for treatment by 2030.
