<p id="Par4">As part of this broader global response to viral hepatitis, and to complement existing care and treatment guidance for HBV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and HCV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], WHO has now developed guidelines on hepatitis B and C testing for low and middle-income countries (LMICs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). In recognition of the need to substantially increase viral hepatitis testing to meet the 2030 elimination targets (particularly in low and middle-income countries), but also of the substantial cost to health budgets of increased testing, the guidelines take an evidence-based but pragmatic, low-cost approach. Their primary target audience are policy makers responsible for development of national hepatitis testing and treatment programmes in LMICs. A particularly challenging aspect in the guidelines’ development was the limited direct quantity and quality of evidence available to guide the development of recommendations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] based on the use of the GRADE process. In addition, very few rapid diagnostic serological tests for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibody have undergone formal quality assurance approval process by WHO (pre-qualification) or another recognised stringent national regulatory programme.
