<p>Similar to previous studies investigating the structure and dynamics of HIV transmission networks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we linked two individuals (nodes) in networks whenever their 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were ≤1.5% distant (TN93 distance measure). This relatively conservative genetic distance cutoff was determined based on previous within host evolutionary rate estimates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] where HIV sequences from mono-infected participants collected after almost a decade had less than 1% divergence from baseline.
