<p>The degree (connectivity) of each individual was defined as the number of links (edges in the transmission network) to other individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We also have explored the potential impact of drug resistance mutations (DRM) on network inferences by excluding codons associated with DRM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To prevent spurious sequence linkage due to nucleotide ambiguities, genetic distances between ambiguous nucleotides and known nucleobases were averaged (i.e., R was considered as 50% A and 50% G) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Dyads and clusters were defined as connected components of the network comprising 2 nodes and &gt;2 nodes, respectively. Singletons were defined as individuals without an identified phylogenetic connection.
