<p>All available data including demographics, HIV risk factor, baseline CD4 count, viral load and HIV-1 subtype or CRF were compared between individuals who clustered and those who did not and analyzed to determine if these factors changed over time. Categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test, and continuous variables were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank test. p values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. The calculations of all statistical tests were performed by using Graph-Pad Prism 6.0c software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and the computing RÂ environment.</p>
