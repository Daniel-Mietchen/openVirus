<p>The identification of significant migration pathways was performed using discrete non-reversible diffusion models and a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We first applied a discrete diffusion model and geographic locations were recorded at the tips of 
 <italic>pol</italic> phylogenies. To quantify the dissemination process, we estimated the number of viral migrations among locations using ‘Markov Jump’ counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] of location-state transitions along the posterior tree distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In an attempt to maximize spatial information and put spatiotemporal dynamics in a demographic context, we compiled location information into 10 equally populated areas (regions 1–10). We also included sequences originating from French overseas departments (region 11).
