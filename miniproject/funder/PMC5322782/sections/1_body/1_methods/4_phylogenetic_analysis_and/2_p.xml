<p>The age of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA, years) and the ancestral geographic movements were jointly estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework as implemented in BEAST v1.8.1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We used a discretized gamma distribution (GTR + 4Γ) to account for among-site rate variation. Time scales of the trees were calibrated with the sampling dates available. The temporal scale of evolutionary process was estimated from the sampling dates of the sequences using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model and a gamma prior on clock rate. Different parametric demographic models (a constant population size, exponential and logistic growth) and a nonparametric Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) were compared, and the best models were selected as confirmed by a higher Bayes Factor (BF) support implemented in BEAST [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. MCMC simulations were run for 50–200 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> chain steps, sub-sampling parameters every 20,000 steps. After removing 10% of burn-in and combining evolutionary parameters and trees using LogCombiner. Convergence of the chains was inspected using Tracer.v.1.5. The TMRCA estimates were expressed as mean and 95% highest posterior density (HPD) years before the most recent sampling dates.
