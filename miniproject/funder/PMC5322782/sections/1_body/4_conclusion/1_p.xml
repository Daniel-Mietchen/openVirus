<p>In summary, this study showed the rapid evolutionary dynamics of subtype B and CRF02_AG among PHI in France since the late 1990s. While subtype B remains the most prevalent lineage, the rapid diffusion of CRF02_AG in highly connected networks of MSM could lead to a substantial and rapid reshaping of the HIV epidemic in Western Countries. Combined with a short turnaround time for sample processing, our findings also show that identifying hotspots of HIV transmission and near real-time monitoring based on phylogenetic analyses can be an effective prevention intervention in combination with Public Health Recommendations for early treatment introduction, enhanced adherence support and partner tracing for immediate diagnosis, provision of PrEP and counseling.</p>
