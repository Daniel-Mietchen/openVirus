<p>A total of 1356 individuals with PHI enrolled in the ANRS PRIMO cohort CO6 between 1999 and 2014 were included. Participants were preferentially Caucasian (85.9%), male (86.7%) and MSM (71.4%). More than one-third (37%) were diagnosed in Paris (n = 348) and its surrounding areas (n = 167). The median age was 35 years (range from 17 to 79 years), and a vast majority (69%) was between 20 and 40 years old. Over this period, the proportion of HIV-infected individuals reporting MSM risk increased over the study period from 66% (n = 309) in 1999–2005 to 77.7% (n = 310) in 2011–2014 (Chi square test for trend, p &lt; 0.01). The socio-demographic characteristics of 1356 individuals are summarized in Table
