<p>The HIV-1 
 <italic>reverse transcriptase</italic> sequences generated from each participant were used to infer the transmission network. Overall, the mean genetic distance between pairs of sequences was 6.5% (s.d. ± 2%) and 5.9% (s.d. ± 2%) among subtype B and CRF02_AG infections, respectively. We used a pairwise distance below the threshold of 1.5% to define a link between individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Using this threshold, 387 individuals (28.5%) were connected to at least one other study participant. Exclusion of DRM codons did not impact the observed HIV transmission network. Connected nodes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) were arranged in 44 large clusters (i.e., connected to more than one other individual) ranging in size from 3 to 41 individuals (median = 4) and 78 dyads (i.e., connected with a unique participant). Then, we evaluated the factors associated with clustering. Comparison between people in clusters (i.e. connected) versus people not in cluster (i.e. singletons) revealed that individuals who are linked in a cluster were more likely men (95.9 vs 83%, p &lt; 0.01) and significantly younger (median age = 32.5 vs 36.0 years, p &lt; 0.01) than singletons. MSM (85.8% clustering vs 65.6% non-clustering, p &lt; 0.01) and white participants (91.5 vs 83.7%, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly more likely to cluster. There were no significant associations between clustering and: baseline CD4 T cell count (p = 0.25), baseline viral load (p = 0.15) or being diagnosed in Paris and its suburban area (37.0 vs 38.4%, p = 0.66) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Individuals infected with CRF02_AG viruses were also more likely to be connected to another participant than other subtype infections (20.4 vs 13.4%) (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). As might be expected, the probability that an individual was connected with another individual increased significantly during the study period (from 1999 to 2014) (p &lt; 0.01).
