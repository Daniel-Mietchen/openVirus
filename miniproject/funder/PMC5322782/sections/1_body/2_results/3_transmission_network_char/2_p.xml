<p>Within the transmission network, three distinctly large viral clusters B1 (subtype B), AG1 and AG2 (CRF02_AG) were identified with a respective size of 9, 14 and 41. Cluster B1 included nine white MSM (median age: 32 years old [21–37]). It was first identified in 2001 with no additional cases since 2010, mostly originating from the Nantes area (West coast) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Cluster AG1 was composed of fourteen white MSM (median age: 31 years old [20–48]) infected with CRF02_AG-related variants. It was first identified in 2011 and had a peak identification of individuals in 2013. Individuals in this cluster were mostly originating from the Marseille area (South-East) but more widely spread throughout the country (Fig.

Finally, cluster AG2 was composed of forty-one white men (median age: 32 years old [21–45]) mostly originating from Paris and its suburban area (n = 34, 83%). It was first noted in 2000 and accrued individuals relatively steadily throughout the observation period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All but one reported MSM sexual risk exposure. To further evaluate the timing of these clusters, we found that the cluster B1 had a TMRCA in 1997 (95% HPD: 1995–2000) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), and the CRF02_AG clusters AG1 and AG2 had a TMRCA in 2003 (95% HPD: 2000–2008) and 2000 (95% HPD: 1998–2001) respectively (Fig.
