<p>Overall, the HIV-1 subtype B (72.5%, n = 983) was largely predominant. Among the non-B viral strains, CRF02_AG was the most prevalent (56% of non-B, n = 209) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). MSM individuals were significantly more likely to be infected with subtype B (80%) than CRF02_AG (12.2%) and other non-B lineages (p &lt; 0.001). Among heterosexuals, subtype B clade was also the most prevalent (42%) but prevalence of CRF02_AG (27%) and other non-B subtypes (30.7%) increased overtime. We also showed a significant increase of non-B subtypes among MSM over the study period (p &lt; 0.001).
