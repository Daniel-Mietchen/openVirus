<p>Similarly, we evaluated the dynamics of the three main clusters of subtype B and CRF02_AG lineages. The most probable root location for phylogeny of cluster B1 was the Western region R3 with posterior state probability of 0.72. The most probable root state probabilities were South Eastern regions with posterior state probability and Paris region R1 with posterior state probability of 0.95 for the AG1 and AG2 clusters, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results showed that the diffusion of the larger CRF02_AG cluster (AG2) ignited in the most densely populated region (Paris, R1) and thereafter spread to other areas (Fig.
