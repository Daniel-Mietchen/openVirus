<p>By combining methods from classical and molecular epidemiology, we were able to infer and characterize the HIV-1 transmission networks among identified PHI individuals in France over 15Â years. Similar to previous data showing that the HIV-1 networks derived mostly from populations of MSM [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], we observed that MSM were significantly more prevalent in connected individuals than singletons. We also showed that non-B subtypes were frequent in primary infected individuals (28.5%), although slightly less than among all new HIV diagnoses in France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We observed that 57% of the individuals infected with CRF02_AG variants reported MSM sexual risk exposure. These results are in line with reports from other European countries showing an increase in proportion of non-B clades in the MSM population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] suggesting that the sociodemographic boundaries between HIV-1 subtypes globally are diminishing in Western Europe.
