<p>As the epidemic has matured, patterns of HIV transmission have changed, albeit MSM represent a large proportion of the affected populations in many countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In Western Europe, the incidence of HIV-1 among MSM has increased or at least has remained constant over the last decade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The increased proportion of MSM is also observed among all new HIV diagnoses in France (up to 43% in 2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Consistent with these observations, we found that the proportion of MSM among all PHI enrolled in the ANRS-PRIMO cohort significantly increased over the last 15 years (from 66% in 1999–2005 to 77.7% in 2011–2014). However, the high frequency of MSM among recently HIV-infected patients can also be partially explained by targeted and repeated screening of MSM populations. For example in the United Kingdom, the proportion of individuals tested for HIV among people attending to STI clinics was the highest among MSM and increased overtime (86% in 2013 vs 78% in 2009) [
