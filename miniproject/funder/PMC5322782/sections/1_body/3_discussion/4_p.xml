<p>By applying Bayesian phylogeographic inference using discrete non-reversible models to 
 <italic>pol</italic> geo-referenced sequences, we also investigated the spatial patterns of subtype B and CRF02_AG clades in France among PHI individuals. We found that these two distinct epidemic lineages have ignited in the most urbanized region of Paris (R1, “Ile de France”) as illustrated by the most probable location state of the descendant nodes with over 90% of all viral lineages movements originating from Paris area (i.e. viral dispersal 
 <italic>from</italic> Paris) for both lineages (96.5% [95% CI 95.1–97.5%] and 94.1% [92.2–95.6%] for subtype B and CRF02_AG respectively). These results suggest the key role of Paris as a hub for new HIV infections and the potential spatial expansion from this region to the rest of the country. This might be explained by the high prevalence of MSM in the ANRS-PRIMO cohort, who are more likely originating from urbanized and highly-densified area [
