<p>Understanding the dynamic of HIV transmission is crucial in the design of effective interventions and recently Individuals contributes disproportionately to the spread of the HIV epidemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Here, the extensive collection of samples along with demographic and clinical data of the 1356 PHI participants from the PRIMO ANRS cohort allowed us to better time the observed transmission clusters. It also helped to better evaluate the direct effect of theoretical prevention interventions at an individual level rather than relying on population effect of the intervention (i.e. indirect effect).
