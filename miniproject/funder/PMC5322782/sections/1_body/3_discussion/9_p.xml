<p>Second, recent HIV infection accounts for 39% of new HIV diagnoses in France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Here, we did not take into account the contribution of transmissions from chronically infected individuals to partners diagnosed after the PHI stage, which is also likely to have an important impact on epidemic spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] and rely on convenient sampling. Hence, individuals who are not tested or disengaged from care are not represented in this cohort and may also contribute to the epidemic. Though the number of early diagnoses has increased since 2011 in France, the number of late diagnoses has remained stable among MSM, and 25% of the estimated 6220 new HIV diagnoses in 2013 in France were still diagnosed at a late stage (&lt;200 CD4 or AIDS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Another limitation of all convenience based sampling methods is that the presence of a directed link between two individuals simply reflects recent relatedness of the virus, possibly through a series of unobserved intermediaries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Finally, the use of HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> region for HIV subtyping may have led to potential misclassification of CRF forms. However, it should not impact the HIV network inferences and the dynamic of CRF02_AG clade within the HIV transmission network presented in this study.
