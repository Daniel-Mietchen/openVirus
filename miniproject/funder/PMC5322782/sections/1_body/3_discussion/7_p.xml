<p>Given that the French 2013 guidelines for ART of HIV-1 infection in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] recommend that ART should be initiated in any HIV-positive person, whatever his/her CD4 T cell count, even when &gt;500/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, we first considered a prevention intervention strategy based on immediate ART introduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We found that an intensified intervention targeting all clustering participants with PHI diagnosed before 2010 (n = 223 index cases) would have prevented 60 out of the identified 143 onward transmissions identified between 2010 and 2014. Given the depth of sampling and structure of the transmission network, we evaluated intervention strategies based on network connectivity. We found that prevention targeted to newly infected individuals belonging to intermediate and high density clusters (density ≥ 2, n = 79 index cases) would have potentially prevented 33 onward new infections linked to these index cases. In light with a recent study showing that near real-time phylogenetic monitoring of routinely collected HIV genotypes are a promising resource for public health intervention on localized outbreaks of HIV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], our results also emphasize the need of an efficient sample processing, a rapid turnaround time on HIV sequence generation and a near real time based monitoring of clustering analysis. Beyond the rapid identification of the index cases, an effective and efficient prevention strategy would require a combination of interventions targeting these indices (i.e. immediate provision of ART and enhanced adherence support services), and the identification and immediate provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to the contacts of these index cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Identifying and monitoring HIV clusters should be also an invaluable method to (1) determine the leading edge of local HIV transmission, (3) characterize potential correlates of HIV transmission (i.e. recreational drug use, high risk venues) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], (3) investigate hotspots of transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and (4) further intensify HIV screening, providing PrEP and partner tracing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] in population with high rates of transmission.
