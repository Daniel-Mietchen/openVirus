<p>Interestingly, the three larger clusters of HIV-1 subtype B (cluster B1, n = 9) and CRF02_AG (clusters AG1, n = 14 and AG2, n = 41) identified displayed also very distinct evolutionary patterns. While cluster B1 did not increase since 2010, both clusters AG1 and AG2 continued to grow up to end of the follow up period in late 2014. Altogether, these observations suggest that CRF02_AG clade was introduced and disseminated within highly connected networks of MSM, which may explain the successful rapid dissemination and increased prevalence of CRF02_AG subtype [
