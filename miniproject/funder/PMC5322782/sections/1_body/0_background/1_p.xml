<p>Identifying and monitoring HIV-1 transmission networks can be important in understanding the evolutionary patterns and geospatial spread of the epidemic. Recent advances in molecular epidemiology have greatly enhanced our ability to characterize the dynamics and the structure of HIV transmission networks over space and time using HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences generated for routine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A better understanding of the dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic can assist preventive measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the past decade, there has been an increase in the circulation of non-B strains and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) of HIV-1 in Europe and North America. In France and other European countries, HIV-1 subtype B is still predominant but the proportion of non-B infected individuals has progressively increased [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This increase of non-B viral infections has been reported in both newly diagnosed chronic HIV-1 infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and individuals with primary or recent HIV-1 infection (PHI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among HIV-1 non-B subtypes, CRF02_AG is one of the most prevalent recombinant forms in the world, responsible for at least 8% of total infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Though CRF02_AG is predominantly transmitted within heterosexuals in Sub-Saharan Africa, it has been increasingly reported among men who have sex with men (MSM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In a recent study conducted in newly diagnosed patients living in Europe, the proportion of circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG increased significantly between 2002 and 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A similar trend was also observed in Western and Central Europe, with an increased proportion of CRF02_AG from 5% in 2000–2003 to 8% in 2004–2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In France, recent data showed a spread of non-B subtypes in individuals of French origin and that the MSM group are particularly involved in this dynamic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Altogether, these reports emphasize the need for a better understanding of the spread of various HIV-1 subtypes through these transmission networks. The recent advances in molecular epidemiology have greatly enhanced our ability to evaluate the dynamic of these transmission networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Several recent studies have also used clustering approaches to characterize potential correlates of HIV transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and there is a growing interest in using these approaches to implement and evaluate prevention interventions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
