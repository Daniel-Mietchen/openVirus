<p>In this study, we analyzed HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences generated over a period of more than 15Â years from individuals enrolled during PHI in France in the National Agency for Research on AIDS and hepatitis (ANRS) PRIMO Cohort to reconstruct the broad molecular epidemiology of the HIV epidemic in France. We then determined if clustering analyses could be used efficiently to target prevention interventions in newly diagnosed PHI individuals belonging to an active cluster of transmission (index cases).
