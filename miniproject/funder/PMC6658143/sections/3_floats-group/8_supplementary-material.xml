  <title>Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score for the relationship between the community membership of free-ranging dogs in two rural settlements in Chad and their attributes; sex, age and household membership.</title>
  <p>NMI scores closer to 1 imply a greater overlap between community membership and attributes. Community membership is calculated from observed binomial and weighted contact networks and calculated using both the edge betweenness (EB) and Greedy (G) algorithms.</p>
