  <title>Relationship between the proportion of simulations to have an epidemic and the seeded individualâ€™s ranked centrality measures (eigenvector, degree and betweenness) when disease transmission is simulated through the contact networks of free-ranging dogs from two rural settlements in Chad.</title>
  <p>The scatter plots include the results for the random, binomial and weighted networks of each settlement (Kakale and Magrao), and are for each R
   <sub>0</sub> value modelled (1.2, 1.8 and 2.4). GAMs are fitted to the data to identify non-linear trends.
