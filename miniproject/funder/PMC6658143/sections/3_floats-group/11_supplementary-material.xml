  <title>Relationships between the strength of contacts among free-ranging dogs in two rural settlements in Chad and the distance between their respective households.</title>
  <p>Scatter plots show the logged daily average edge weights between observed dyads in the settlements Kakale and Magrao against the distance (m) between their households. The histograms show the distribution of r coefficients calculated from permutations where edges were randomly shuffled. The red lines on the histograms indicate the observed r coefficient. For all plots, edges for individuals in the same household were excluded.</p>
