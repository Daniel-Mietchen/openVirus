  <title>The relationship between epidemic outcomes simulated on contact networks of free-ranging dogs from two rural settlements in Chad and the seeded individual’s ranked network position.</title>
  <p>Scatter plots for each settlement (Kakale and Magrao) show the seeded individual’s ranked centrality measures (Eigenvector centrality (second order contacts), degree (total number of contacts) and betweenness (contribution to number of shortest paths)) plotted against the proportion of simulations that resulted in an epidemic (the disease was transmitted to at least one individual) and mean epidemic size. The mean epidemic sizes exclude simulations where the infection did not spread beyond the seeded individual. The data include the results for the random, binomial and weighted networks, and are for simulations when R
   <sub>0</sub> was set to 2.4. GAMs are fitted to the data to identify non-linear trends.
