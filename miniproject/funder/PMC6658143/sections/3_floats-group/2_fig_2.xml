 <caption>
  <title>The contact networks, degree distribution, edge weight distribution and probability density distribution of contacts between free-ranging dogs for two settlements in Chad.</title>
  <p>In the networks, the circles represent individuals and the colours indicate the village that the dogs belong to: Kakale-Mberi in green, Awine in orange, Magrao in purple and Sawata in pink. The lines connecting individuals indicate that they have been in contact and the thickness of the lines are proportional to the logged daily average contact time between individuals. The red line of the degree distributions (probability that a randomly chosen node has degree â‰¥ k) indicates the mean degree (number of connections).</p>
