  <title>The relationship between the mean epidemic size of simulations and the seeded individuals ranked centrality measures (eigenvector, degree and betweenness) when disease transmission is simulated through the contact networks of free-ranging dogs from two rural settlements in Chad.</title>
  <p>The scatter plots include the results for the random, binomial and weighted networks of each settlement (Kakale and Magrao), and are for each R
   <sub>0</sub> value modelled (1.2, 1.8 and 2.4). The means exclude simulations where the infection did not spread beyond the seeded individual. GAMs are fitted to the data to identify non-linear trends.
