<p>Collecting high resolution data on the contact rates between individuals is a major challenge, particularly for free-ranging animals. This lack of empirical data has meant that stochastic models have relied on assumptions that contact rates are density dependent or have included a frequency dependent function in the form of spatial and/or social scaling parameters to generate variation in the probability of contacts [
