<p>To date, there has been only one study published that integrated observed contact rates of free-ranging dogs into a model for the transmission of rabies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], in which the contact network of dogs was characterised over 3.5 days in an urban environment. They found that urban dogs formed communities that were defined by roads, which acted as a barrier to movement. When simulating outbreaks of rabies, the authors observed that major epidemics were avoided when 70% of the population were vaccinated and targeted management based on network measures increased the effectiveness of vaccination. However, it is unclear if this would also apply to rural dog populations, where the landscape and dog-human relationships are likely to be different to that in an urban environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], where unowned dogs are rare, roads are few and where hunting, subsistence farming and fishing are more prevalent.
