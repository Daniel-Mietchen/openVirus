<p>Dogs 
 <italic>Canis familiaris</italic> are among the earliest domesticated animals and they share 16% of their known pathogens with humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 47% with wild mammals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Amongst these pathogens is rabies, a viral zoonosis that poses a significant public health risk, responsible for approximately 59,000 human deaths annually [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and primarily transmitted to humans through the saliva of an infected dog when they are bitten [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mathematical models can be applied to inform management efforts by predicting epidemics and, for rabies, these models are relatively well developed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, one of the challenges identified in controlling rabies is a lack of information on dog ecology [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and variation in contact rates has been identified as being especially influential for epidemic outcomes in a number of modelling studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is unsurprising given that dogs are social animals that exhibit pronounced between-individual variation in their behaviour [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
