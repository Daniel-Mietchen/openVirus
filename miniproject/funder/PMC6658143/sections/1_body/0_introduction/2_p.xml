<p>The number of infectious disease emergence events in humans has been increasing over time, and the majority of these are zoonotic in origin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may, in part, be associated with the domestication of animals, as evidence suggests that the number of shared pathogens (between humans and non-human animals) increases with the time since a species was domesticated [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is because domestication increases the exposure of people and animals to a greater range of pathogens, and increases the risk of humans acquiring zoonotic infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. If domestic animals are free-ranging, they are also more likely to interact with wild animals, further facilitating the transmission of disease between people and wildlife [
