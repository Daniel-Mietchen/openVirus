<p>In this study, we used automated proximity loggers to generate high-resolution contact networks of free-ranging dogs in an area of rural sub-Saharan Africa, where dogs are susceptible to a number of zoonotic infections. We use these data to model the transmission of an infection that is epidemiologically similar to rabies. We test the effect of including observed heterogeneities in contacts between free-ranging dogs on predictions for epidemic size. Using a network model we simulate epidemics through random networks, the observed network characterised as binomial (present/absent) interactions and the observed network when weighted by the duration of interactions. The observed binomial network introduces non-random structures while maintaining uniformity and the observed weighted network adds non-random and non-uniform mixing. In addition, we investigate the effect of seeding different individuals with the infection. If contact heterogeneity influences epidemics it may be possible to predict epidemic outcomes using the network position and/or associated traits of the seeded individual.</p>
