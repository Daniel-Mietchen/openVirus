<p>Heterogeneity in contact rates is influential in the epidemiology of both human and non-human animal diseases. In principle, variation in the contact rates among individuals affects their risk of acquiring and/or transmitting infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Relationships between host social behaviour and the distribution of infections have been demonstrated in several wild animal host-pathogen systems, from tuberculosis in badgers

 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One driver of these relationships is the variation in contacts between individuals, which can influence the flow of infection through populations [
