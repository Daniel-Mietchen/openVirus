<p>For both settlements, there was no notable difference in epidemic size between simulations using the observed binomial and weighted networks. This result would suggest that including non-random mixing (whom individuals contact) in disease models is more important than including non-uniform mixing (contact duration/frequency). However, heterogeneities in edge weights are likely to be important and have been shown to further limit epidemic sizes when they are allowed to be dynamic in time [

To further understand the effect of non-uniform mixing, future research should try to describe the temporal dynamics of free-ranging dog contacts over a timeframe relevant to the disease in question. Specifically, investigations should look for daily and seasonal differences in network structure and identify whether or not individuals occupy stable network positions.
