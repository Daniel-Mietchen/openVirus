<p>In simulations with all but the lowest R
 <sub>0</sub> value, the risk of a large epidemic was higher when infection started in dogs with a higher ranked eigenvector centrality, and this was further emphasised where the distribution of eigenvector centralities paralleled that of epidemic sizes for each settlement. The importance of an individualâ€™s eigenvector centrality in disease dynamics has also been shown in models for the transmission of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> in badgers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and observed parasite infection in Japanese macaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], where this measure was positively correlated with infection status. It appears that eigenvector centrality is a robust predictor of epidemic size and infection status because it describes how an individual is rooted into the network beyond their immediate connections.
