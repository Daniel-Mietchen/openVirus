<p>We show that ranging behaviour was correlated with eigenvector centrality, but this was only true for dogs in Kakale. Both range sizes and eigenvector centralities were higher for dogs in Kakale than those in Magrao. This is likely due to anthropogenic variation in dog behaviour whereby during the study some people in Kakale moved with their dogs back and forth between a permanent residence and a seasonally-occupied homestead, while people in Magrao tended to stay at one. The dogs that accompany their owners in travelling between permanent and seasonal homesteads will have larger ranges and this would influence the dogâ€™s network position by creating new contact opportunities. Nevertheless, the relationships between dog network position and epidemic outcomes were the same in both settlements. We also show that the distribution of dog owning households is important in determining contacts between dogs, with dogs more likely to have been in contact with and having stronger connections with dogs from closer households. However, it is important to note that this distance effect cannot fully explain the structure of the contact networks as many dogs from households in close proximity did not come into contact (

Although the dogs in this study were free-ranging, they were owned and anthropogenic influences on dog contact rates and ranging behaviour should not be overlooked, and understanding these would provide insight into disease management approaches.
