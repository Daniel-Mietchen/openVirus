<p>We have gathered high-resolution data on the contacts among free-ranging domestic dogs living in two rural settlements in Chad, an area where rabies infection is endemic and regularly causes human fatalities. Using these data we have demonstrated the importance of including observed contact patterns when simulating the transmission of an infection comparable to rabies. We show that the observed contact rates between dogs are heterogeneous and that interactions were dominated by contacts that were short in duration and between dogs from the same household. In our model, for the transmission of infection, the inclusion of observed contact rates resulted in fewer epidemics occurring compared to when random mixing was assumed and, for all but the lowest R
 <sub>0</sub> values, epidemics were smaller in simulations using the observed networks. We also show that the seeded individualâ€™s first and second order contacts were strong indicators of epidemic outcomes, verifying that individuals differ in the risk they present for the transmission of infections. Furthermore, for dogs in one settlement, second order contacts were correlated with ranging behaviour, suggesting that observable traits exist which could inform targeted management strategies.
