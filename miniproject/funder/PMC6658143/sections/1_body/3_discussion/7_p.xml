<p>The inflation of predictions for epidemic size in models that do not account for observed contact heterogeneities are of particular concern when public health resources are limited [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This is the case for dog-mediated rabies in developing countries, where epidemics are preventable through vaccination but a major challenge is the high incidence of dog infections and human cases, combined with limited public health resources [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Currently it is advised that successful vaccination campaigns require 70% coverage of the dog population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, through targeted management this might be reduced, helping alleviate costs. Further to work on urban dogs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], our results show that even in a rural context, epidemic risk is not equal among individuals and suggest that, by identifying the network position of individuals and correlates thereof, targeted management could be feasible. We find evidence to suggest that the spatial ranging behaviour of dogs was associated with their network position, though anthropogenic influences clearly have a role in determining free-ranging dog movements and this deserves further investigation. Our research illustrates how a greater understanding of the social contact network of free-ranging dogs can help better inform the management of diseases such as dog-mediated rabies.
