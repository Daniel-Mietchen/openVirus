<p>The transmission probabilities associated with the lowest R
 <sub>0</sub> value rarely resulted in an epidemic and, when one occurred, no more than a few individuals were infected. This meant that there was little difference in the overall mean epidemic size between simulations of random and observed networks. However, heterogeneity in contacts was still important in determining epidemic outcomes whereby the seeded individualâ€™s ranked degree was positively correlated with the proportion of simulations that resulted in an epidemic, and this was echoed in simulations with higher R
 <sub>0</sub> values. This finding demonstrates that, regardless of the transmission probability, dogs that are in contact with more individuals relative to the rest of the population are at higher risk of causing an epidemic should they become infected.
