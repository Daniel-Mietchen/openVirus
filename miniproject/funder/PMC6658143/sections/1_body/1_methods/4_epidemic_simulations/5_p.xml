<p>The weighted act rate (α

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0007565.e005">Eq 5</xref> which is modified from Reynolds et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Here we assumed that α
 <sub>ij</sub> was positively associated with the daily average of the total duration that individuals were in contact (

 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>), and in so doing, we applied a sigmoidal scaling function. This value was then multiplied by two to shift the mean of β
 <sub>ij</sub> to β. The use of this scaling function is justified where biting is the main method of rabies transmission and only a short contact time is required. Once a transmission event occurred, a random draw from a gamma distribution was used to allocate an incubation period (shape = 1.1; scale = 20.1; see [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) and infectious period (see above for parameters). During the incubation period individuals were considered to be in the exposed category. Once the incubation period was over, the individual was classed as infected and could transmit the disease until such time as the assigned infectious period was over and the individual, along with its associated edges, was removed from the network. For this study, an epidemic was defined as disease transmission to at least one other individual.
