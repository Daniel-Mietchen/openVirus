<p>The package ‘Epimodel’ v1.3.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used to build a Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed (SEIR) network model of infection spread. Simulations were run on the observed binomial network, the observed weighted network and the null model (random networks). Random networks are traditionally used in network analysis to overcome the non-independence nature of contacts, and are typically constrained to biologically plausible scenarios. The null model for this study was that individuals mix randomly and so random networks were generated using the Erdős-Rényi model, conserving the observed number of nodes (individual dogs) and edges (connections). Every individual in the binomial and weighted networks was seeded with the infection and, for each seeded individual, 100 simulations of the model were run. For the null model, the same procedure was conducted, however, each simulation involved a different random network and all seeded individuals experienced the same set of 100 random networks. Simulations were run over 300 time steps (days). The network model assumed that (a) there was no recruitment or loss of individuals to the population (except the eventual removal of those infected), (b) the edges and weights of the network did not rewire over time or in response to infected or removed individuals and (c) individuals do not change their behaviour when infected.
