<p>All dogs had clear ownership and were associated with a specific household. They were all sexually intact. With the consent of owners, dogs were collared with standard nylon dog collars (Ancol Heritage). Puppies (less than 6 months of age) were not collared. Collars were fitted with two devices; (1) an i-GotU GT-600 GPS unit (Mobile Action Technology Inc., Taiwan) and (2) a wearable proximity sensor based on a design developed by OpenBeacon project (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openbeacon.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.openbeacon.org/</ext-link>) and the SocioPatterns collaboration consortium (

The GPS units were configured with a fix interval of 10 minutes and a sleep mode to extend battery life. The proximity sensors exchange one ultra-low power radio packet per second in a peer-to-peer fashion and, have been successfully deployed in several studies on humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The exchange of radio-packets is used as a proxy for the spatial proximity of individuals wearing the sensors [

The attenuation threshold used in this deployment was selected to detect close-contact events (within 1–1.5 m), during which a communicable disease infection might be directly transmitted, either by airborne transmission or by direct physical contact. Additional data collected on the individual dogs included sex and body condition score (BCS; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Due to low frequencies of some scores, we categorised them into poor (BCS ≤ 2) and moderate (BCS ≥ 3). Interviews using a standardised questionnaire were carried out at households to record the number of dogs owned and the dogs’ ages, as recalled by the owner. A single observer estimated BCS and another conducted all household interviews. Dogs aged 12 months or less were classified as juveniles, dogs aged between 13 and 24 months were classed as sub adults and dogs older than 24 months were regarded as adults [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since all households known to have dogs in the settlement were visited, the dog population size (excluding puppies) was calculated for each settlement by summing the reported number of owned dogs from each household.
