<p>Differences in ranked network position (degree, strength, eigenvector centrality and betweenness) between nodal attributes (sex, age, BCS and home ranges) were identified by calculating t-statistics, using either t-tests or linear models. Observed statistics were compared to the distribution of test statistics from null models to identify if they were significantly different to those expected had individuals mixed randomly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Null models consisted of 10,000 random networks generated by randomly shuffling the node attributes while keeping the structure of the observed network the same. Homophily within the attributes age, sex and household was investigated by calculating the assortativity (r) coefficient using the ‘assortnet’ package in R. Again the observed coefficients were compared to the distribution of coefficients from null models. To see if community membership was determined by the dogs’ sex, age or household, we used the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) score to scale the results between 0 (no mutual information) and 1 (perfect correlation). To investigate if there was a correlation between edge existence/weight and the distance between households, the ‘sna’ package v.2.4 in R was used to perform a quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) with 1000 permutations.
