<p>Generalised additive models (GAMs) were used to identify non-linear relationships between the averaged epidemic outcomes of simulations for seeded individuals and their ranked network position (degree, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness). Models were fit with family set to Gaussian and included a smoothing term (k = 3). Strength was not investigated in these models since no difference in epidemic size between weighted and binomial simulations was observed. Since measures of network position are often correlated, separate models were fitted for each measure of centrality and type of network. Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) and adjusted r
 <sup>2</sup> values were extracted and used to identify which centrality measure best explained epidemic outcomes.
