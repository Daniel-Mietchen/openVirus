<p>Networks were treated as undirected symmetric networks. Since dogs were not collared for the same number of days, the weights for the weighted networks were converted to the average number of seconds the dogs were in contact per day monitored. This was done by dividing the total duration in seconds over which a pair was in contact, by the shorter of the two periods in days for which the two dogs were collared. These weights were then log
 <sub>10</sub> transformed. The global and local network metrics were calculated using the R package ‘igraph’ [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], including: degree (the number of unique connections of an individual), strength (the summed strength of all connections for an individual), betweenness (the number of shortest paths between other individuals upon which the focal individual lies), and eigenvector centrality (a measure of second order contacts whereby a higher score is assigned to individuals if they associate with highly connected individuals or many moderately connected individuals). To compute the probability density distribution of contact durations and the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of edge weights, we used the Python package ‘Powerlaw’ v1.4.1. Community membership describes individuals that are closely associated/clustered together and these groups were identified using the edge betweenness and Greedy algorithms in the Python package ‘igraph’ v0.7.1.
