<p>The proximity data were extracted from devices and cleaned by identifying corrupted sensors (where no data were available) or anomalous signals (such as continuous bursts of data). The GPS data were cleaned by removing erroneous fixes with speeds greater than 20 km/hr between locations. For both GPS and proximity data we discarded records collected on the first and last day of collar deployment in each village; providing time for the dogs to habituate to collars at the start and to account for the collection of the collars at the end of the field study.</p>
