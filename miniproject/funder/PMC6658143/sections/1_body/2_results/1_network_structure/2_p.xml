<p>The global structure of both networks revealed high levels of clustering and short average path lengths (

Furthermore, community analysis using the edge betweenness (EB) and Greedy (G) algorithms showed the dog populations in both settlements exhibited high modularity in the binomial network (Kakale: EB = 0.48, G = 0.51; Magrao: EB = 0.56, G = 0.57) and the weighted network (Kakale: EB = 0.57, G = 0.603; Magrao: EB = 0.60, G = 0.617). Magrao was the larger of the two networks and had a wider degree distribution (k
 <sub>min</sub> = 1, k
 <sub>max</sub> = 17) than that of Kakale (k
 <sub>min</sub> = 2, k
 <sub>max</sub> = 14). In both networks the degree distribution was homogenous (Kakale: coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.49, Magrao: CV = 0.48) while the distributions for the duration of contacts were highly heterogeneous (Kakale: CV = 1.88, Magrao: CV = 1.85), and the probability density distribution declined as contact durations increased (
