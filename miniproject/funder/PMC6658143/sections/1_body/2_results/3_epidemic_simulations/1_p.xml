<p>For both settlements, larger R
 <sub>0</sub> values resulted in an increased risk of epidemics occurring and larger epidemic sizes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007565.s005">S3 Fig</xref> for the frequency distributions of secondary cases). In simulations when R
 <sub>0</sub> was 1.8 or 2.4, mean epidemic size was higher for random networks than that of simulations with observed contacts. Epidemic sizes for simulations using these random networks had a bimodal distribution, whereby epidemics either involved a large number of individuals or very few. In contrast, the distribution of epidemic sizes for observed networks had multiple peaks at intermediate sizes. The distributions of epidemic sizes differed for the two settlements, whereby Kakale had more intermediate peaks. Simulations with the lowest R
 <sub>0</sub> value (1.2) showed no discernible difference in mean epidemic sizes between the random and observed networks.
