<p>The seeded individual’s ranked eigenvector centrality and ranked degree were positively correlated with the mean epidemic size in simulations on the binomial and weighted networks for both settlements (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007565.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). Ranked eigenvector centrality was the best predictor of mean epidemic size (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and for simulations of Magrao at larger R
 <sub>0</sub> values, mean epidemic size plateaued for individuals with a higher ranked eigenvector centrality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007565.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The distributions of eigenvector centralities for dogs in each settlement (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007565.s008">S6 Fig</xref>), were similar to the distribution of epidemic sizes in respective settlements. No correlation between the seeded individual’s network position and mean epidemic size was found in any of the random networks.
