<p>For the observed networks for both settlements, the seeded individual’s ranked centrality measures (degree, eigenvector centrality and betweenness) were all positively correlated with the proportion of simulations that resulted in an epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007565.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). The seeded individual’s ranked degree was the best predictor for the proportion of simulations to result in an epidemic (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and at larger R
 <sub>0</sub> values the relationship between ranked degree and an epidemic outcome began to plateau for higher ranked individuals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007565.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As expected, the seeded individual’s observed centrality measures did not correlate with the proportion of simulations to result in an epidemic in any of the random networks.
