<p>Dogs in Magrao had substantially smaller ranges than dogs from Kakale, and the distribution of ranges was right skewed for both settlements (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007565.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Dogs in Kakale that had larger ranges had higher ranked eigenvector centralities and this was significantly different to null models (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the home ranges of dogs in Kakale were positively correlated with their ranked degree, and this correlation was significantly greater than that of null models. In both networks, comparisons to null models revealed no significant association of any ranked network measures (degree, strength, eigenvector centrality or betweenness) with sex, age or body condition.
