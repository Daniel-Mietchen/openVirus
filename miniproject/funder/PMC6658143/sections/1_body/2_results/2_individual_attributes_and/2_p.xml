<p>All measures of community membership were strongly correlated with household membership in both the binomial networks (Kakale: NMI
 <sub>EB</sub> = 0.622, NMI
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.625; Magrao: NMI
 <sub>EB</sub> = 0.739, NMI
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.649) and weighted networks (Kakale: NMI
 <sub>EB</sub> = 0.674, NMI
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.70; Magrao: NMI
 <sub>EB</sub> = 0.725, NMI
 <sub>G</sub> = 0.713). Community membership had no significant relationship with either the dogâ€™s sex or age (

When compared to null models, dogs in both settlements had a strong preference to associate with individuals from the same household and no assortative mixing patterns were found between dogs of a different/similar age or sex (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007565.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). QAP tests found a significant negative correlation for the distance between households and the existence of an edge (Kakale: r = -0.23, p &lt; 0.001; Magrao: r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.001). A negative correlation was also found for the relationship between household distance and edge weight (
