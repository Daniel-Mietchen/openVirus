  <title>The evolution of articles produced with scientific collaboration among the top 10 most productive countries on Zika production using only articles found in WoS.</title>
  <p>The closer the dots are to 0.5 (highlighted by the black line), the articles produced with collaborations are proportional to the articles produced without collaborations. The value corresponding to the year 2015 represents the sum of all work produced by the selected country up until 2015. Points on the zero line correspond to publications that had no international collaboration. The size of the dots for Global WoS articles are divided by 1,000 in order to fit the scale.</p>
