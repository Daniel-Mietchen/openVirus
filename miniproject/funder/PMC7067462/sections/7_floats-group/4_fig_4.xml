  <title>Collaboration networks among the 10 most productive countries.</title>
  <p>Each node corresponds to a country and the size of the node is related to the number of international collaborations they have within that group. The thickness of the lines represents the number of collaborations between any two countries and an approximation of those numbers are presented by the box on the top right. The colour scheme emphasizes link differences between countries since the colour of a line is a mix of the colour of the nodes it connects. The node distribution in the figure has been chosen only to facilitate visualization. The two countries with the fewest number of publications are positioned at the centre of the graph and the most productive to the least from top to bottom and left to right.</p>
