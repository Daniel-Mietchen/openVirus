  <title>Dendrogram of the clusters obtained with IRAMuTeQ.</title>
  <p>The dendrogram is divided into 6 clusters formed of branch divisions. The first branch divides Group A, and Group B. Group A is further divided into two subgroups called Group A1 and Group A2. The size of each bar corresponds to the percentage of words in that cluster. The associated name for each cluster appears on its bar, and the colour scheme has been chosen to facilitate visualization. In front of each bar, there is a square word cloud of words with the highest chi-square value to aid the understanding and the representation of each cluster.</p>
