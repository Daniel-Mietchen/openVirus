  <title>Chi values for the top 10 countries for each cluster.</title>
  <p>The results are calculated taking the observed value (number of text segments) within a cluster minus the expected value for that cluster and country divided by the square root of the expected value. This is the Chi value (not squared) to show negative (or less than expected) values. For each cluster (1 through 6) we have all ten countries and their respective chi value.</p>
