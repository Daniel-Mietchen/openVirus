<p>In the factorial analysis, the studied publications were distributed into four temporal groups: &lt; = 2015 (3.2%), 2016 (20.2%), 2017 (37.0%) and 2018 (39.6%). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229790.g007">Fig 7</xref> we see that publications up to 2015 were mostly related to entomology research, those published in 2015 up to 2016 were related to public health. For 2015, we observed a higher than expected presence of the cluster 3 "Epidemiology". Publications related to "Diagnosis" (cluster 2) surged between 2015 and 2016. The top right quadrant has publications from 2016 mostly, where the clusters "Diagnosis" and "Clinical Aspects" are present. The clusters from Group B, identified as the areas of research "Molecular Biology" and "Cellular Biology", appeared only in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
