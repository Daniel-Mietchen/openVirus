<p>We identified that 165 of 252 possible WoS categories were present in the studied articles. Each article is classified in one or more categories. The name (words) of these categories also appear distributed in the clusters defined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229790.g005">Fig 5</xref>. The ten most frequent categories were: Infectious Diseases; Public Environmental Occupational Health; Tropical Medicine; Virology; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Microbiology; Parasitology; Immunology; Biochemistry Molecular Biology; and Medicine General Internal. Anther six categories, among the 10% most frequent, were not included in the top ten list, but were significant to categorize the clusters, these were: Entomology; Cell Biology; Health Policy and Services; Clinical Neurology; Pediatrics; and Diagnosis. Based on these sixteen categories, we associated WoS categories with the abstract clusters defined by IRAMuTeQ. We found the following results for Group A: Public Environmental Occupational Health category in the “Epidemiology” cluster (cluster 3); Parasitology category in "Entomology" (cluster 4); and Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine in both "Diagnosis" (cluster 2) and "Entomology" clusters. Considering that Diagnosis, Epidemiology and Entomology categories from WoS were in cluster 2, 3 and 4, respectively, each cluster was named after these categories. Cluster 1, “Clinical Aspects”, had none of the top 10 high-frequency categories of WoS in it.
