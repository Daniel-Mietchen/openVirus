Brazil, the country with the second-highest scientific production, has mainly focused its publications on "Clinical Aspects" of the disease, while it is almost absent in "Cellular Biology". On the other hand, China is present in two clusters mainly: "Cellular Biology" and "Molecular Biology". While France is present in "Clinical Aspects", “Diagnosis” and “Entomology”, England showed a relevant number of studies published in “Epidemiology” and “Entomology”.
