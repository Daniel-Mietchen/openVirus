<p>In the first subsection of the results section, we conducted a descriptive analysis of the articles retrieved from the three different sources: WoS, Scopus and PubMed. Based on the results found we restricted our further analysis using only WoS articles since the difference in the corpora were quite small compared to the benefits of the categorization and classification methods used by WoS (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229790.s001">S1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0229790.s003">S3</xref> Figs). Overall, WoS provides a complete information for each article. For instance, information about authors' institutional affiliation country is not fully present in PubMed. Moreover, WoS provides summarized subject categories, and although Scopus also presents subject categories, they are not aligned with those of WoS. From that on, using only the WoS database, we performed two separate analyses, which we describe below: a descriptive analysis to understand how countries collaborate towards Zika knowledge; and, a textual analysis of research on Zika using knowledge mapping over time and space (i.e., countries). In order to summarize the findings in this manuscript, we present our results for the top ten countries with the most publications.
