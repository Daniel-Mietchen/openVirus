<p>Reply 1.2: We thank the editor for this comment. In order to account for your suggestion, we performed searches in two additional databases: Scopus and PubMed. Descriptive analysis on the databases WoS, Scopus and PubMed was incorporated in the text and knowledge maps of words extracted from titles and abstracts of articles on WoS, Scopus and PubMed are presented in supplementary figures S1 Fig to S3 Fig. They were obtained using VOSviewer software. We can see that the clusters found from VOSviewer software for the three databases are very similar. This results support our choice to carry out textual analysis only with the WoS database.</p>
