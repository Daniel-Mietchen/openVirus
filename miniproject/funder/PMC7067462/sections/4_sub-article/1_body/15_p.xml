<p>Reply 2.1: We believe that the success of the scientific collaboration is hard to measure but the utility of each manuscript, on the other hand, can be partially estimated by its citations. Nevertheless, in this manuscript, due to the limited time frame in which Zika research is available, we opted for not evaluating citation metrics. Please, see also the Reply 1.1 for the editor comment. </p>
