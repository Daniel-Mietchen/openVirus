<p>The data presented in this study are interesting. They confirm already known results: the leading role of the USA in biomedical research, the strong involvement of countries directly affected, the need to establish collaborations for more basic research. This work is very descriptive. It does not determine what has worked well and what has not worked in terms of international research and collaboration. This greatly limits the scope of this study. Indeed, we do not see what lessons could be learned for a future epidemic of this type.</p>
