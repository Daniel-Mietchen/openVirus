<p>As you will gather from the reviewer comments, the data presented in your manuscript are particularly interesting and offer a wide and global vision on the scientific efforts that were made during the last ZIKV epidemic. I also express this view after careful examination of your study, which I find well suited for the journal. However, both the reviewer and myself found that a (final) section discussing what can be learned from the general conclusions of your data and the preparation for futur epidemic is currently lacking and needed. Specifically, even if poorly provided in data, a discussion on what was perceived by the community as not or poorly effective during the epidemic (
 <italic>e.g</italic>. Funding availabilities, timing of international programs, data collecting...) would greatly benefit your manuscript.
