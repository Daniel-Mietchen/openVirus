Abstract</div> <p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a human pathogen that causes hand, foot, mouth disease and neurological complications. Although EV71, as well as other enteroviruses, initiates a remodeling of intracellular membrane for genomic replication, the regulatory mechanism remains elusive. By screening human cDNA library, we uncover that the Golgi resident protein acyl-coenzyme A binding domain-containing 3 (ACBD3) serves as a target of the 3A protein of EV71. This interaction occurs in cells expressing 3A or infected with EV71. Genetic inhibition or deletion of ACBD3 drastically impairs viral RNA replication and plaque formation. Such defects are corrected upon restoration of ACBD3. In infected cells, EV71 3A redirects ACBD3, to the replication sites. I44A or H54Y substitution in 3A interrupts the binding to ACBD3. As such, viral replication is impeded. These results reveal a mechanism of EV71 replication that involves host ACBD3 for viral replication.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the <i>Picornaviridae</i> family, is a causative agent of the childhood exanthema known as hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). In particular, infection with EV71 is often associated with neurological complications, ranging from aseptic meningitis, brainstem and cerebellar encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis<a href="#b1">1</a><a href="#b2">2</a><a href="#b3">3</a>. Young children and infants are especially susceptible to EV71 infection. Since initial isolation of EV71 in the United States<a href="#b4">4</a>, severe infections or outbreaks have been reported worldwide<a href="#b3">3</a><a href="#b5">5</a><a href="#b6">6</a><a href="#b7">7</a>. Recently, large epidemics of HFMD have occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, which raises a public health concern on EV71<a href="#b5">5</a><a href="#b7">7</a><a href="#b8">8</a><a href="#b9">9</a>. Currently, no specific antiviral drugs are available against EV71 infection.</p> <p>EV71 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The viral genome is approximately 7,500 nucleotides in length, with a single open reading frame that encodes a large precursor protein. After virus infection, the precursor is processed into four structural (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) proteins which are crucial for virus entry and encapsidation<a href="#b10">10</a>. In addition, the precursor is cleaved into seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) which mediate viral RNA transcription and translation, as well as autocatalytic polyprotein processing by 2A and 3C. The 2C, 3A and 3D proteins are required for the viral RNA replication, and are located at the RNA replication complex<a href="#b11">11</a><a href="#b12">12</a><a href="#b13">13</a><a href="#b14">14</a>.</p> <p>Several studies suggest that enterovirus 3A plays a critical role on the formation of replication organelles<a href="#b15">15</a><a href="#b16">16</a><a href="#b17">17</a>. It is generally believed that 3A promotes assembly of the RNA replication complex through its interaction with ARF1 or GBF1. For example, the 3A protein of poliovirus (PV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) interact with the large guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1<a href="#b18">18</a><a href="#b19">19</a><a href="#b20">20</a><a href="#b21">21</a>. However, the 3A-GBF1 interaction does not seem to correlate with RNA replication<a href="#b22">22</a><a href="#b23">23</a><a href="#b24">24</a>. This suggests that additional factors may participate in picornavirus RNA replication. Nonetheless, the host cellular partners needed for EV71 replication are unclear.</p> <p>Here we report that EV71 3A targets ACBD3, which occurs in EV71 infected cells as well. Genetic deletion of ACBD3 inhibits viral RNA replication whereas restoration of ACBD3 repairs the defect. A site-specific mutation that interrupts the 3A-ACBD3 interaction severely impairs viral replication. Further experiments reveal that GBF1 and ARF1 play a minor role on EV71 RNA replication and protein expression. Our results demonstrate that EV71 3A selectively utilizes ACBD3 to facilitate viral replication.</p> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

ACBD3 is a cellular target of the 3A protein encoded by EV71</div> <p>To identify host proteins that mediate EV71 genome replication, we screened human cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. With 3AB, 3C and 3D of EV71 as probes, we obtained 96 positive clones. Among those, ACBD3 was identified as a 3A interacting partner. To evaluate the interaction between EV71-3A and ACBD3 in mammalian cells, 293T cells were transfected with plasmid expressing Flag-ACBD3 along with GFP-2B, 2C, 3A, 3C, 3D or 3B. GFP was used as a control. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibody against Flag. The data in <a href="#f1">Fig. 1a</a> show that GFP-3A was co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) with ACBD3, but not with 2B, 2C, 3B, 3C or 3D. To further confirm the interaction between ACBD3 with 3A, purified GST-ACBD3 was incubated with lysates of cells which express EV71 2B, 2C, 2BC, 3A, 3AB, 3C and 3D, respectively. We observed that 3A and 3AB were pulled down by GST-ACBD3, but not by GST alone (<a href="#f1">Fig. 1b and c</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that EV71 3A specifically interacts with ACBD3.</p> </div> <div class="ev713ainteractswithendogenousacbd3invirus-infectedcells" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
EV71 3A interacts with endogenous ACBD3 in virus-infected cells</div> <p>To investigate whether EV71 3A interacts with endogenous ACBD3, we set out a series of experiments. As such, GFP or GFP-3A was expressed in HeLa cells. At 24 h after transfection, we examined the localization of 3A with respect to the endogenous ACBD3. In GFP-expressing cells ACBD3 primarily condensed at the Golgi apparatus (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>, upper), which is analogous to normal cells where ACBD3 typically co-localizes with a Golgi-resident protein Golga5 (<a href="#S1">Fig. S1A</a>). However, in GFP-3A-expressing cells ACBD3 dispersed into the cytoplasm and co-localized with 3A (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2a</a>, lower). Consistent with this result, ACBD3 was immunoprecipitated by GFP-3A, but not by GFP (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2b</a>). Meanwhile, the localization of endogenous ACBD3 and 3A in EV71 infected cells was determined by laser confocal microscopy. Although aggregated in the Golgi in mock infected cells, ACBD3 spread out in the cytoplasm upon EV71 infection (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). Notably, ACBD3 co-localized the 3A protein of EV71 in discrete regions (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2c</a>). Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that 3A and 3AB was pelleted by anti-ACBD3 antibody in EV71 infected cells (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2d</a>). Western blot analysis verified the expression of ACBD3 both in mock and virus infected cells (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2d</a>). Furthermore, time course analysis reveals that ACBD3 was pelleted by anti-3A antibody as early as 4 h after EV71 infection (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2e</a>). These results suggest that 3A interacts with and redirects ACBD3 to distinct regions in EV71 infected cells.</p> <p>To further test the 3A-ACBD3 interaction, we assessed EV71 strains from Beijing (BJ), Anhui (AH), and ShenZhen (SZ) of China. In immunoprecipitation assay, the 3A proteins from these strains were immunoprecipiated by anti-ACBD3 antibody after virus infection (<a href="#f2">Fig. 2f</a>). Furthermore, we detected the interaction of three 3A proteins with ACBD3 by immunofluorescence staining. The results indicate that at 4 h post infection, ACBD3 dispersed to cytoplasm and partially localized with 3A (<a href="#S1">Fig. S1B</a>). As infection continued, a notable fraction of ACBD3 co-localized with 3A (<a href="#S1">Fig. S1C</a>). We conclude that the 3A protein mediated translocation of ACBD3 is not limited to a specific EV71 strain.</p> </div> <div class="acbd3isnecessaryforreplicationofev71" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
ACBD3 is necessary for replication of EV71</div> <p>Based on the above results, we hypothesized that EV71 3A mediates viral replication through its interaction with ACBD3. To test this, we performed siRNA knockdown assays. RD cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ACBD3 or a control. As expected, ACBD3 expression was significantly reduced in cells transfected with ACBD3 specific siRNA but not in cells with scramble siRNA (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3a</a>). This reduction had no apparent cytotoxicity as measured by cell viability assay (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3b</a>). Next, we determined the effect of ACBD3 on EV71 replication. Cells were infected with EV71 at 48 h after transfection with siRNA targeting ACBD3. Total RNAs were prepared at 24 h post infection and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in <a href="#f3">Fig. 3c</a>, siRNA knockdown of ACBD3 resulted in 70% decrease in the level of EV71 RNA compared to the control, indicating an inhibition of viral replication. In line with this, knockdown of ACBD3 reduced viral yield (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3d</a>). As corroborative approach, we carried out plaque assay. <a href="#f3">Figure 3e</a> shows that ACBD3 knockdown sharply reduced plaque formation. Moreover, these phenotypes were seen with different EV71 strains (<a href="#f3">Fig. 3f and g</a>).</p> <p>To define the role of ACBD3 unambiguously, we generated an <i>ACBD3</i><sup>−/−</sup>cell line by CRISPR-mediated disruption (<a href="#S1">Fig. S2A and S2B</a>). As illustrated in <a href="#f4">Fig. 4a</a>, viral RNA replication was readily detected in wild type cells. Nevertheless, it was severely impeded in <i>ACBD3</i><sup>−/−</sup> cells. This was not due to a defect in viral entry (<a href="#S1">Fig. S2C</a>). Congruently, the efficiency of plaque formation was drastically reduced in the absence of ACBD3 (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4b</a>). In addition, viral protein synthesis was barely visible in <i>ACBD3</i><sup>−/−</sup> cells (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4c</a>). When ectopically expressed, ACBD3 restored viral protein synthesis and the efficient of plaque formation (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4c and d</a>). Similarly, addition of ACBD3 restored viral growth in <i>ACBD3</i><sup>−/−</sup> cells infected with different EV71 strains (<a href="#f4">Fig. 4e</a>). These experimental results demonstrate that ACBD3 is indispensable for EV71 replication.</p> </div> <div class="isoleucine44andhistidine54of3aarefunctionallyimportant" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Isoleucine 44 and histidine 54 of 3A are functionally important</div> <p>Given that 3A interacted with ACBD3, we sought to define the interaction domains. First, we mapped the 3A interacting domain of ACBD3 to the C-terminal GOLD (Golgi dynamic) region (<a href="#S1">Fig. S3</a>). Next, we investigated region of 3A protein responsible for the ACBD3 interaction. As EV71 3A is a small protein, of 86 amino acids, we constructed a panel of plasmids expressing 3A mutants (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5a</a>). These include the four N-terminal fragments (1–30, 1–40, 1–50, 1–60aa) and three C-terminal fragments (21–86, 41–86, 61–86aa). 293 T cells were transfected with flag-ACBD3 along with mutants of GFP-3A or GFP. Cell lysates were prepared for Co-IP assays using anti-flag antibody. As shown in <a href="#f5">Fig. 5b</a>, the full length 3A was co-precipitated with ACBD3. Similarly, the 21–86 mutant was also co-precipitated with ACBD3, indicating that amino acids 1–21 is not critical. However, the 41–86 mutant only weakly bound to ACBD3, which suggests a requirement of this region. The 3A mutants with deletions of amino acids 30–86 were unable to bind ACBD3. These data suggest that at least the region of 3A encompassing amino acids 41–86 is required to bind ACBD3. In additional, we performed secondary structure analysis via Phyre2 computer protein analysis program. It seems EV71 3A may potentially form 3α-helix (amino acids 19–28, 31–39, and 48–60). While H54 falls in the third a-helix, I44 sits in a random coiled region. A relevant structure is not apparently evident. Additional work is needed to elucidate the structure-function relationship.</p> <p>Alignment of amino acid sequences shows that 3A from enteroviruses is homologous but with notable variations (<a href="#f5">Fig. 5c</a>). It has been reported that isoleucine 12 in 3A of CVA17 is critical for binding to GBF1<a href="#b19">19</a>, but plays no role in binding to ACBD3<a href="#b25">25</a>. And valine 44 and histidine 57 of 3A from CVB3 are functionally linked to PI4KB in viral replication<a href="#b26">26</a><a href="#b27">27</a>. To define the role of these residues in EV71 replication, we constructed mutants of EV71 3A, with L12I, I44A, or H54Y substitution. To evaluate the 3A mutations on ACBD3 binding, 293 T cells were transfected with ACBD3 along with 3A variants and subjected to immunoprecipitation. As illustrated in <a href="#f5">Fig. 5d</a>, like wild type 3A, L12I was able to bind ACBD3 (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting leucine 12 is not required. Although expressed at comparable levels, I44A lost its ability to bind ACBD3 (lane 4) whereas H54Y bound ACBD3 weakly (lane 5). These results argue that isoleucine 44 and histidine 54 dictate the interaction of EV71 3A and ACBD3.</p> <p>To assess 3A mutations on viral replication, we generated recombinant EV71. RD cells were infected with 3A variants and lysates of cells were processed for Western blot analysis with anti-VP0. As shown in <a href="#f5">Fig. 5e</a>, similar to wild type virus, the 3A-L12I mutant expressed VP0, suggesting normal viral replication (lanes 1 and 2). In sharp contrast, 3A-I44A and 3A-H54Y barely produced any VP0 (lane 3 and 4). Herein, either I44A or H54Y substitution was important to EV71 replication. These results suggested that 3A-ACBD3 interaction is critically important for viral replication.</p> </div> <div class="gbf1andarf1haveaminoreffectonviralgenomereplication" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
GBF1 and ARF1 have a minor effect on viral genome replication</div> <p>The formation of replication organelles of enteroviruses is dependent on GBF1 and ARF1<a href="#b13">13</a><a href="#b18">18</a><a href="#b20">20</a><a href="#b28">28</a>. To investigate whether EV71 replication relies on GBF1or ARF1, we analyzed viral RNA and proteins. As shown in <a href="#f6">Fig. 6a</a>, depletion of ACBD3 by siRNA severely impeded viral replication, with 75% of reduction in viral RNA synthesis. At 24 h post-infection, depletion of GBF1 exerted partial inhibition viral RNA replication (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6a</a>), although siRNA specific to ARF1 or GBF1 was functionally active (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6b and c</a>). Under these experimental conditions, siRNA treatment was not toxic to the cells (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6d</a>). Depletion of ACBD3 sharply reduced VP2 production (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6e</a>). However, Depletion of ARF1 or GBF1 marginally inhibited VP2 production (<a href="#f6">Fig. 6f and g</a>).</p> <p>Next, we asked whether ARF1 or GBF1 interacted with viral replication machinery. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that GBF1 spread out as speckles in mock infected cells (<a href="#S1">Fig. S4a</a>). At 4, 6, and 8 hours after infection, the localization coefficient between GBF1 and 3A are less than 0.35. Similarly, the localization coefficient between ARF1 and 3A are less than 0.3 at 4, 6, and 8 hrs post-infection (<a href="#S1">Fig. S4b</a>). EV71 infection induced their accumulation at 12 hrs post-infection (<a href="#S1">Fig. S4a and S4b</a>). To further corroborate this, we carried out immunoprecipitation analysis. RD cells were mock infected or infected with EV71. At different time points post infection, lysates of cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-3A antibody. Although ACBD3, EV71 3A and 3AB were precipitated with 3A neither GBF1 nor ARF1 was associated with 3A in virus infected cells (<a href="#f7">Fig. 7a</a>). This coincided with the fractional analysis by size-exclusion chromatography assay. The elution peaks of GBF1 and ARF1 has not changed after EV71 infection compared to mock infection (<a href="#f7">Fig. 7b and c</a>). Taken in combination, these data suggest that ARF1 and GBF1 have a minor role in the replication EV71.</p> </div> </div> <div class="discussions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussions</div> <p>Enterovirus 71 is a human pathogen that causes hand, foot, and mouse disease and neurological complications. Although members of enteroviruses are extensively investigated, the mechanism of viral replication is unclear. Here we demonstrate that the 3A protein of EV71 mediates viral replication through host ACBD3. ACBD3 is crucial in Aichi virus replication, yet its relation with enteroviruses is a puzzle<a href="#b29">29</a><a href="#b30">30</a>. A number of studies showed that ACBD3 physically interacts with 3A encoded by enteroviruses, but is dispensable in viral replication<a href="#b13">13</a><a href="#b23">23</a><a href="#b24">24</a><a href="#b25">25</a><a href="#b31">31</a>. This is evident in cells infected with rhinovirus, poliovirus and coxsakievirus B3. The results present in this work uncovered that EV71 3A associated with and directed ACBD3 to discrete regions in the cytoplasm. This is different from a report that no interaction between EV71 and ACBD3 was detectable<a href="#b30">30</a>. The basis for this discrepancy is not known. Our work suggests that is probably a prerequisite to initiate sites or platforms necessary for RNA replication. Consistent with this interpretation, depletion or knockout of ACBD3 precluded viral RNA replication, protein synthesis and plaque formation. Furthermore, these phenotypes were also noted with several different strains of EV71. Strikingly, a site-specific mutation in 3A of EV71 disrupted the 3A-ACBD3 interaction and viral replication. Therefore, besides an ACBD3 binding site an additional cis-element in 3A may be required. Collectively, these results support the argument that engagement of EV71 3A with ACBD3 dictates viral replication. It remains obscure why ACBD3 is differentially involved in viral replication. As 3A from picornaviruses exhibits only about 42% homology, amino acid sequence variations may have a role. An attractive hypothesis is that 3A may bear distinct features that require or bypass ACBD3. Another possibility is that a separate viral protein may substitute for the function of ACBD3.</p> <p>Enterovirus replication is reported to involve ARF1 and GBF1<a href="#b11">11</a><a href="#b32">32</a>. In this model, membrane-bound 3A modulates ARF1/GBF1 to recruit PI4KB, resulting in a replication complex. Intriguingly, knockdown of ARF1 or GBF1 had a minor inhibitory effect on EV71 replication. However, depletion of ARF1 had a marginal effect on VP2 production. Further, in cells infected with EV71 ARF1/GBF1 was not recruited to form replication organelles. While 3A/3AB formed complex with ACBD3, no ARF1/GBF1 was detectable. These results are consistent with the notion that EV71 replication only partially dependent on ARF1 or GBF1. In line with this, GBF1 and ARF1/ARF3 was necessary for EV71 replication at 6 hrs<a href="#b32">32</a>, suggesting that GBF1 and ARF1/ARF3 may play a role in the early stage of viral replication. It seems that EV71 has evolved an alternative mechanism to hijack ACBD3, which substitutes for ARF1/GBF1. In this regard, it is notable that depletion of ACBD3, GBF1 and ARF1 does not affect the formation of replication complex in coxsakievirus B3 infection<a href="#b24">24</a>. It remains an open question why distinct mechanisms are operative within enteroviruses.</p> <p>In summary, enteroviruses remodel cellular membranes into specialized structures where viral replication complexes are assembled coordinately. This study highlights an essential role of ACBD3 in the replication of EV71. This is probably relevant to the biology different picornaviruses. It is likely that the ACBD3 pathway is not only important in Aichi virus but also in EV71 replication.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
