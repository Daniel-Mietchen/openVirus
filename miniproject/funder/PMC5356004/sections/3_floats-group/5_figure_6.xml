  <title>GBF1 and ARF1 have a minor effect on viral RNA replication and protein expression.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) RD cells were transfected with siRNA against ACBD3, GBF1 and ARF1. At 48 h, cells were infected with EV71 at MOI = 1 of PFU/cell. After 24 h, total RNA was extracted and the viral RNA levels of EV71 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green. (b and c) The knockdown efficacy of si-ARF1 (
   <bold>b</bold>) or si-GBF1 (
   <bold>c</bold>) was detected by RT-PCR assay at 48 h post-transfection in RD cells. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Cell viability was detected by using Cytotoxicity Detection KitPlus (LDH). (
   <bold>e</bold>–
   <bold>g</bold>) RD cells were transfected with siRNA against ACBD3 (
   <bold>e</bold>), GBF1 (
   <bold>f</bold>), or ARF1 (
   <bold>g</bold>). At 48 h, cells were infected with EV71 at MOI of 1 PFU /cell. At 24 h, cells were harvested for Western blot assay.
