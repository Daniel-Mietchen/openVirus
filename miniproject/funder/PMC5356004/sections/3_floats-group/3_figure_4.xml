   <bold>c</bold> and 
   <bold>d</bold>) The plasmid which expresses ACBD3 was transfected into the ACBD3 knockout cells. After 24 h, cells were infected with EV71. At 24 h, the replication of EV71 was detected by WB (
   <bold>c</bold>) or plaque assay (
   <bold>d</bold>). (
   <bold>e</bold>) The plasmid which expresses ACBD3 was transfected into the knockout cells. After 24 h, cells were infected with different EV71 strains respectively. At 24 h, the replication of EV71 was detected by TCID50. Values represent the mean of triplicate samples ± SEM. Error bars represent SEM.
