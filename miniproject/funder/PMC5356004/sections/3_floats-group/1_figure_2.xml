  <title>3A interacts with ACBD3 in mammalian cell.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP (Upper) or GFP-3A (Lower). At 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed and stained with anti-ACBD3 antibody (red). (
   <bold>b</bold>) 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-3A. At 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against GFP. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against ACBD3, GFP and β-actin. (
   <bold>c</bold>) RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 at MOI = 5 of PFU/cell. After 8 h, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against 3A (Green) and ACBD3 (Red). (
   <bold>d</bold>) RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 at MOI = 1 of PFU/cell. After 24 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against ACBD3. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis. (
   <bold>e</bold>) RD cells were treated as described in (
   <bold>d</bold>). At 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against 3A. (
   <bold>f</bold>) RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 including three different strains as indicated. After 24 h, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against ACBD3.
