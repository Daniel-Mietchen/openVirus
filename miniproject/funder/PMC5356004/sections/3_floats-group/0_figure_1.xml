  <title>EV71 3A interacts with ACBD3.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-ACBD3 along with GFP, GFP-2B, GFP-2C, GFP-3A, GFP-3C, GFP-3D or GFP-3B. At 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody against Flag. Samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against Flag, GFP and β-actin. WCL, whole-cell lysates. (b and c) 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP, GFP-2B, GFP-2C, GFP-2BC, GFP-3A, GFP-3AB, GFP-3C or GFP-3D. At 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysated. The cell lysates were incubated with recombinant GST-ACBD3 protein which was conjugated on glutathione sepharose 4B beads at room temperature for 6 h. GST protein was used as a control. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against GFP and GST. Data shown are representative of three separate experiments.
