  <title>ACBD3 interacts with 3A at C-terminal amino acids.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram of different variants of 3A. (
   <bold>b</bold>) 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-3A variants along with Flag-ACBD3. At 24 h after transfection, lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-Flag. Samples were subjected to Western blot analysis. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Amino acids sequence alignment of 3A protein of EV71, CVB3, CVA17 and PVS2. (
   <bold>d</bold>) 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP 3A amino acid substitution mutants along with Flag-ACBD3, the immunoprecipitation were done as described above. (
   <bold>e</bold>) RD cells were transfected with EV71 RNA transcripts. At 72 h post transfection, cells were harvested and resolved with 12% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis for EV71 or β-actin was conducted.
