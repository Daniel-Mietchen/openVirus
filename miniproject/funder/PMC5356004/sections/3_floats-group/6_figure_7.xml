   <bold>c</bold>) RD cells were mock infected (
   <bold>b</bold>) or infected with EV71 (
   <bold>c</bold>) for 12 h. Cell lysates were fractionated on a size-exclusion column using Superdex 200 10/300 GL. Each fraction was analyzed by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. The positions corresponding to the elution of the standard markers of molecular weight are indicated.
