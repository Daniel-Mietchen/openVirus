<p>Here we report that EV71 3A targets ACBD3, which occurs in EV71 infected cells as well. Genetic deletion of ACBD3 inhibits viral RNA replication whereas restoration of ACBD3 repairs the defect. A site-specific mutation that interrupts the 3A-ACBD3 interaction severely impairs viral replication. Further experiments reveal that GBF1 and ARF1 play a minor role on EV71 RNA replication and protein expression. Our results demonstrate that EV71 3A selectively utilizes ACBD3 to facilitate viral replication.</p>
