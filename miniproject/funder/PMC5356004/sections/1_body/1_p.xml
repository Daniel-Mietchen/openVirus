<p>EV71 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The viral genome is approximately 7,500 nucleotides in length, with a single open reading frame that encodes a large precursor protein. After virus infection, the precursor is processed into four structural (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) proteins which are crucial for virus entry and encapsidation

In addition, the precursor is cleaved into seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) which mediate viral RNA transcription and translation, as well as autocatalytic polyprotein processing by 2A and 3C. The 2C, 3A and 3D proteins are required for the viral RNA replication, and are located at the RNA replication complex
