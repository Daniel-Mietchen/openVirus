<p>Enterovirus replication is reported to involve ARF1 and GBF1

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In this model, membrane-bound 3A modulates ARF1/GBF1 to recruit PI4KB, resulting in a replication complex. Intriguingly, knockdown of ARF1 or GBF1 had a minor inhibitory effect on EV71 replication. However, depletion of ARF1 had a marginal effect on VP2 production. Further, in cells infected with EV71 ARF1/GBF1 was not recruited to form replication organelles. While 3A/3AB formed complex with ACBD3, no ARF1/GBF1 was detectable. These results are consistent with the notion that EV71 replication only partially dependent on ARF1 or GBF1. In line with this, GBF1 and ARF1/ARF3 was necessary for EV71 replication at 6 hrs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, suggesting that GBF1 and ARF1/ARF3 may play a role in the early stage of viral replication. It seems that EV71 has evolved an alternative mechanism to hijack ACBD3, which substitutes for ARF1/GBF1. In this regard, it is notable that depletion of ACBD3, GBF1 and ARF1 does not affect the formation of replication complex in coxsakievirus B3 infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. It remains an open question why distinct mechanisms are operative within enteroviruses.
