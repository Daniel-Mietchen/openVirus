<p>In summary, enteroviruses remodel cellular membranes into specialized structures where viral replication complexes are assembled coordinately. This study highlights an essential role of ACBD3 in the replication of EV71. This is probably relevant to the biology different picornaviruses. It is likely that the ACBD3 pathway is not only important in Aichi virus but also in EV71 replication.</p>
