<p>Next, we asked whether ARF1 or GBF1 interacted with viral replication machinery. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that GBF1 spread out as speckles in mock infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a</xref>). At 4, 6, and 8â€‰hours after infection, the localization coefficient between GBF1 and 3A are less than 0.35. Similarly, the localization coefficient between ARF1 and 3A are less than 0.3 at 4, 6, and 8 hrs post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4b</xref>). EV71 infection induced their accumulation at 12 hrs post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S4a and S4b</xref>). To further corroborate this, we carried out immunoprecipitation analysis. RD cells were mock infected or infected with EV71. At different time points post infection, lysates of cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-3A antibody. Although ACBD3, EV71 3A and 3AB were precipitated with 3A neither GBF1 nor ARF1 was associated with 3A in virus infected cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b and c</xref>). Taken in combination, these data suggest that ARF1 and GBF1 have a minor role in the replication EV71.
