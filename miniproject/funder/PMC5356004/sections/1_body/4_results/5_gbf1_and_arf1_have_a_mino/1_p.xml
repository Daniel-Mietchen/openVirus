 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. To investigate whether EV71 replication relies on GBF1or ARF1, we analyzed viral RNA and proteins. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>, depletion of ACBD3 by siRNA severely impeded viral replication, with 75% of reduction in viral RNA synthesis. At 24â€‰h post-infection, depletion of GBF1 exerted partial inhibition viral RNA replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>), although siRNA specific to ARF1 or GBF1 was functionally active (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b and c</xref>). Under these experimental conditions, siRNA treatment was not toxic to the cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>). Depletion of ACBD3 sharply reduced VP2 production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6e</xref>). However, Depletion of ARF1 or GBF1 marginally inhibited VP2 production (
