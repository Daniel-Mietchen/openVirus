<p>To identify host proteins that mediate EV71 genome replication, we screened human cDNA library in the yeast two-hybrid system. With 3AB, 3C and 3D of EV71 as probes, we obtained 96 positive clones. Among those, ACBD3 was identified as a 3A interacting partner. To evaluate the interaction between EV71-3A and ACBD3 in mammalian cells, 293T cells were transfected with plasmid expressing Flag-ACBD3 along with GFP-2B, 2C, 3A, 3C, 3D or 3B. GFP was used as a control. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibody against Flag. The data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> show that GFP-3A was co-immunoprecipitated (Co-IP) with ACBD3, but not with 2B, 2C, 3B, 3C or 3D. To further confirm the interaction between ACBD3 with 3A, purified GST-ACBD3 was incubated with lysates of cells which express EV71 2B, 2C, 2BC, 3A, 3AB, 3C and 3D, respectively. We observed that 3A and 3AB were pulled down by GST-ACBD3, but not by GST alone (
