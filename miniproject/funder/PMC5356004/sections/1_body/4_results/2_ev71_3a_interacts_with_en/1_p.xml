<p>To investigate whether EV71 3A interacts with endogenous ACBD3, we set out a series of experiments. As such, GFP or GFP-3A was expressed in HeLa cells. At 24 h after transfection, we examined the localization of 3A with respect to the endogenous ACBD3. In GFP-expressing cells ACBD3 primarily condensed at the Golgi apparatus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, upper), which is analogous to normal cells where ACBD3 typically co-localizes with a Golgi-resident protein Golga5 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S1A</xref>). However, in GFP-3A-expressing cells ACBD3 dispersed into the cytoplasm and co-localized with 3A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, lower). Consistent with this result, ACBD3 was immunoprecipitated by GFP-3A, but not by GFP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). Meanwhile, the localization of endogenous ACBD3 and 3A in EV71 infected cells was determined by laser confocal microscopy. Although aggregated in the Golgi in mock infected cells, ACBD3 spread out in the cytoplasm upon EV71 infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Notably, ACBD3 co-localized the 3A protein of EV71 in discrete regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that 3A and 3AB was pelleted by anti-ACBD3 antibody in EV71 infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Western blot analysis verified the expression of ACBD3 both in mock and virus infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Furthermore, time course analysis reveals that ACBD3 was pelleted by anti-3A antibody as early as 4 h after EV71 infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2e</xref>). These results suggest that 3A interacts with and redirects ACBD3 to distinct regions in EV71 infected cells.
