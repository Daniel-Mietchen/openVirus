<p>Given that 3A interacted with ACBD3, we sought to define the interaction domains. First, we mapped the 3A interacting domain of ACBD3 to the C-terminal GOLD (Golgi dynamic) region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S3</xref>). Next, we investigated region of 3A protein responsible for the ACBD3 interaction. As EV71 3A is a small protein, of 86 amino acids, we constructed a panel of plasmids expressing 3A mutants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). These include the four N-terminal fragments (1–30, 1–40, 1–50, 1–60aa) and three C-terminal fragments (21–86, 41–86, 61–86aa). 293 T cells were transfected with flag-ACBD3 along with mutants of GFP-3A or GFP. Cell lysates were prepared for Co-IP assays using anti-flag antibody. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>, the full length 3A was co-precipitated with ACBD3. Similarly, the 21–86 mutant was also co-precipitated with ACBD3, indicating that amino acids 1–21 is not critical. However, the 41–86 mutant only weakly bound to ACBD3, which suggests a requirement of this region. The 3A mutants with deletions of amino acids 30–86 were unable to bind ACBD3. These data suggest that at least the region of 3A encompassing amino acids 41–86 is required to bind ACBD3. In additional, we performed secondary structure analysis via Phyre2 computer protein analysis program. It seems EV71 3A may potentially form 3α-helix (amino acids 19–28, 31–39, and 48–60). While H54 falls in the third a-helix, I44 sits in a random coiled region. A relevant structure is not apparently evident. Additional work is needed to elucidate the structure-function relationship.
