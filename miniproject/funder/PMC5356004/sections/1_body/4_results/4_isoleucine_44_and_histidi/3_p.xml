<p>To assess 3A mutations on viral replication, we generated recombinant EV71. RD cells were infected with 3A variants and lysates of cells were processed for Western blot analysis with anti-VP0. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5e</xref>, similar to wild type virus, the 3A-L12I mutant expressed VP0, suggesting normal viral replication (lanes 1 and 2). In sharp contrast, 3A-I44A and 3A-H54Y barely produced any VP0 (lane 3 and 4). Herein, either I44A or H54Y substitution was important to EV71 replication. These results suggested that 3A-ACBD3 interaction is critically important for viral replication.
