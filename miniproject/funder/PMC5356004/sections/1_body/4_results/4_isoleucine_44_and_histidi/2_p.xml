<p>Alignment of amino acid sequences shows that 3A from enteroviruses is homologous but with notable variations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). It has been reported that isoleucine 12 in 3A of CVA17 is critical for binding to GBF1
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>, but plays no role in binding to ACBD3
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. And valine 44 and histidine 57 of 3A from CVB3 are functionally linked to PI4KB in viral replication
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. To define the role of these residues in EV71 replication, we constructed mutants of EV71 3A, with L12I, I44A, or H54Y substitution. To evaluate the 3A mutations on ACBD3 binding, 293â€‰T cells were transfected with ACBD3 along with 3A variants and subjected to immunoprecipitation. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>, like wild type 3A, L12I was able to bind ACBD3 (lanes 2 and 3), suggesting leucine 12 is not required. Although expressed at comparable levels, I44A lost its ability to bind ACBD3 (lane 4) whereas H54Y bound ACBD3 weakly (lane 5). These results argue that isoleucine 44 and histidine 54 dictate the interaction of EV71 3A and ACBD3.
