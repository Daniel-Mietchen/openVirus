<p>To define the role of ACBD3 unambiguously, we generated an 
 <italic>ACBD3</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup>cell line by CRISPR-mediated disruption (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2A and S2B</xref>). As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>, viral RNA replication was readily detected in wild type cells. Nevertheless, it was severely impeded in 
 <italic>ACBD3</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells. This was not due to a defect in viral entry (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Fig. S2C</xref>). Congruently, the efficiency of plaque formation was drastically reduced in the absence of ACBD3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). In addition, viral protein synthesis was barely visible in 
 <italic>ACBD3</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). When ectopically expressed, ACBD3 restored viral protein synthesis and the efficient of plaque formation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c and d</xref>). Similarly, addition of ACBD3 restored viral growth in 
 <italic>ACBD3</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> cells infected with different EV71 strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4e</xref>). These experimental results demonstrate that ACBD3 is indispensable for EV71 replication.
