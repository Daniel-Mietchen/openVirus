<p>Based on the above results, we hypothesized that EV71 3A mediates viral replication through its interaction with ACBD3. To test this, we performed siRNA knockdown assays. RD cells were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against ACBD3 or a control. As expected, ACBD3 expression was significantly reduced in cells transfected with ACBD3 specific siRNA but not in cells with scramble siRNA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Next, we determined the effect of ACBD3 on EV71 replication. Cells were infected with EV71 at 48 h after transfection with siRNA targeting ACBD3. Total RNAs were prepared at 24 h post infection and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, siRNA knockdown of ACBD3 resulted in 70% decrease in the level of EV71 RNA compared to the control, indicating an inhibition of viral replication. In line with this, knockdown of ACBD3 reduced viral yield (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3e</xref> shows that ACBD3 knockdown sharply reduced plaque formation. Moreover, these phenotypes were seen with different EV71 strains (
