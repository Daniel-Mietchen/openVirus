 <sup>7</sup> RD cells were mock-infected or infected with EV71 for 12 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer comprised of 14 mM CHAPS, 150 mMNaCl, and 20 mMTris-HCl (pH7.4). Cell lysates filtered with 0.2 μm membrane filters were loaded onto a Superose 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences). Elution was performed at 4 °C and monitored by absorbance at 280 and 260 nm. Every 0.5 mL of fraction was collected. Each fraction was analyzed by Western blotting assay. Molecular weight was determined using standard proteins (Ferments, Maryland).
