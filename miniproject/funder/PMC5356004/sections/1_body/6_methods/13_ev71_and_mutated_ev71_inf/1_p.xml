<p>The EV71 infectious clone was done as described in refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. The mutated infectious clones were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase (Strategene, La, Jolla, CA) using the wild type EV71 infectious clone as a template. RNA transcripts were synthesized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> from linearized templates using MEGAscript
 <sup>®</sup> T7 Kit (Invitrogen). Then, RNA transcripts were transfected into RD cells. At 72 h post-transfection, viruses were collected and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-EV71 antibody.
