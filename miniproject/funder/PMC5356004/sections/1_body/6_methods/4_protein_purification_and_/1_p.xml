<p>The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were carried out according to Amersham handbook. GST pull down assays were performed as previously described method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Briefly, 2 μg purified GST-ACBD3 variants or GST were incubated with 100 μg lysates of cells which expressing the EV71 2B, 2C, 3A, 3AB, 3C, or 3D at 4 °C for 6 h in binding buffer, respectively. Then 20 μl of 50% slurry glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to the reaction mixture which was adjusted to 200 μl with binding buffer (20 Mm Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH7.4), rotated on a wheel at 4 °C for 2 h. These mixtures were washed four times with washing buffer. The samples were analysis by Western blot assays.
