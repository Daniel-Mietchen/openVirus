<p>The target sequence used is TCGCCACCTGGATCCGGTCG for human ACBD3. First, the sequences were cloned into lenti-CRISPRv2 which was digested by BsmBI. To construct the knockout cell lines, 1.2 μg of gRNA-expressing plasmid, 0.6 μg pVSVg plasmid and 0.9 μg of psPAX2 vector were co-transfected into1.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells. At 48 hrs post-transfection, the supernatant of transfected cells which contain lentivirus were collected for the following experiment.
