<p>RD cells were plated into 24-well culture plate. The next day, lentivirus was added to the cells. After 48 h, cells infected by lentivirus were screened by using 1 μg/ml puromycin. Five days later, single clones were screened by limiting dilution cloning method. The knockout clones were verified by sequencing of the PCR fragments and Western blotting assay. The PCR primers are: 5′-GGCAACTGACGATTCCGGAGGG-3′ and 5′-CGGGACATGACTGCTAAACCAA-3′.</p>
