<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and reverse transcription was carried out using the Superscript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples were subjected to real-time PCR by using SYBR Green. The primers used were as follows: GBF1 (5′-GGGAACGCATTGACTGTTTT-3′ and 5′-CTCGGGCTTCTCAAAGTCAC-3′), ARF1 (5′-GTGACCACCATTCCCACCATAG-3′ and 5′-TCATTGCTGTCCACCACGAAG-3′), GAPDH (5′-CAACTGGTCGTGGACAACCAT-3′ and R 5′-GCACGGACACTCACAATGTTC-3′). Levels of genes mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Results are reported as fold change using the ΔΔCT method.</p>
