<p>RD cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) were seeded in 24-well plate with growth medium (DMED, 10% FBS). The next day, growth medium were removed and 200 μl serial dilution of EV71 stocks were added to well. Then the 24-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. 1 ml per well 1.2% Avicel (R-591, FMC) (one volume 2.4% avicel with the same volume 2 × DMEM) were added to the plate, as previously described
