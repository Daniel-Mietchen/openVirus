<p>Cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of cell lysates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pall, Port Washington, NY). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and then proteins on the membrane were incubated with indicated primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. This was followed by incubation with corresponding IRD Fluor 800-labeled IgG or IRD Fluor 680-labeled IgG secondary antibody (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at a wavelength of 700–800 nm and the molecular sizes of the developed proteins were determined by comparison with pre-stained protein markers (Ferments, Maryland). Western blot band densities were quantitated by the Image J software.</p>
