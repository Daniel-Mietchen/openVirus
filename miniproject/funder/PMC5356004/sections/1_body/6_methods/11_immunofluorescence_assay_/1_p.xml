<p>Immunofluorescent assay was done as described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% formalin followed by washing with PBS buffer, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Then cells were blocked and stained with primary antibodies, followed by stained with an Alexa Fluor 488/594 secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). Fluorescence images were obtained and analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5). For correlation analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient values were calculated using the WCIF Image J software with colocalization threshold plugin.
