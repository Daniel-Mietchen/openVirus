<p>The plasmids pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-2B, pEGFP-2C, pEGFP-3A, pEGFP-3AB, pEGFP-3C, and pEGFP-3D have been described elsewhere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. The plasmid expressing human ACBD3 was purchased from Origene (Rockville MD). The plasmids expressing GST-fused ACBD3 variants are gifts from Zhang Leiliang (Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. The ACBD3 and pEGFP-3A variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using Pfu DNA polymerase (Strategene, La Jolla, CA). The primers for 3A variants were used as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementary Table 1</xref>. All variants were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. LentiCRISPRv2, pVSVg, psPAX2 were obtained from AddGene.
