<p>Transfected cells were lysed with RIPA, containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysates of cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 500 μl RIPA buffer at 4 
 <sup>o</sup>C overnight on a rotator in the presence of protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes captured on the protein A/G agarose were fractionated by 8–15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for analysis.
