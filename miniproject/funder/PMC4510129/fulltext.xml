Over the last few decades, many studies have proven time and again that the diversity of HIV-1 epidemics can often be linked to the route of infection transmission. That said, the diversity and complexity of HIV-1 molecular epidemics in the region have been increasing at an alarming rate, due in part to the high tendency of the viral RNA to recombine. This scenario was exemplified by the discovery of numerous circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), especially in Thailand and Malaysia. In this study, we characterized a novel CRF designated CRF74_01B, which was identified in six epidemiologically unlinked IDUs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The near-full length genomes were composed of CRF01_AE and subtype B', with eight breakpoints dispersed in the <italic>gag-pol</italic> and <italic>nef</italic> regions. Remarkably, this CRF shared four and two recombination hotspots with the previously described CRF33_01B and the less prevalent CRF53_01B, respectively. Genealogy-based Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of CRF74_01B genomic regions showed that it is closely related to both CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B. This observation suggests that CRF74_01B was probably a direct descendent from specific lineages of CRF33_01B, CRF53_01B and subtype B&#x002b9; that could have emerged in the mid-1990s. Additionally, it illustrated the active recombination processes between prevalent HIV-1 subtypes and recombinants in Malaysia. In summary, we report a novel HIV-1 genotype designated CRF74_01B among IDUs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The characterization of the novel CRF74_01B is of considerable significance towards the understanding of the genetic diversity and population dynamics of HIV-1 circulating in the region.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia: High Impact Research H-500001-00-A000012-000001 to KKT.

Recombinant lineages generated through recombination between subtypes isolated from at least three epidemiologically unlinked individuals are known as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), else these recombinants would be known as unique recombinant forms (URFs) [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>As of April 2015, at least 72 CRFs have been identified globally (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</ext-link>). Although HIV-1 subtypes A, B and C remained the most prevalent genotypes worldwide, CRFs can be attributed to at least 16% of HIV-1 infections globally and are anticipated to increase in proportion [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Similar patterns can be observed in Asia, where the complexity and diversity of HIV-1 increases in parallel to the cumulated number of HIV-1 infections, though the rates and extent varies [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In Malaysia, the early phase of the HIV-1 epidemic was driven mostly by intravenous drug users (IDUs) that were associated with subtype B&#x002b9; of Thai origin and CRF01_AE. Since then, numerous HIV-1 CRFs such as CRF33_01B, CRF48_01B, CRF52_01B, CRF53_01B, CRF54_01B, and CRF58_01B have been reported in Malaysia in the past decade [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], all of which have arisen from the predominant subtype B' and CRF01_AE co-circulating in the country. These new CRFs could in fact further recombine with other subtypes or CRFs, generating second-generation recombinant descendants. One example is the CRF48_01B discovered in 2007, a CRF descended from the CRF33_01B lineage [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More recently, a new CRF candidate closely related to CRF33_01B was also detected through molecular screening [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating an increasing trend of second-generation CRFs emerging in the region. Therefore, one could anticipate that HIV-1 infections caused by CRFs would increase not only in proportion, but also in complexity over time [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study, we described a novel CRF candidate discovered among IDUs in Malaysia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was approved by the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) Medical Ethics Committee.

HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma samples through magnetic silica-based method implemented in the automated NucliSENS easyMAG platform (BioMerieux, France). Reverse transcription was carried out with random hexamers using SuperScript III RNase H<sup>-</sup> Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction.

Genomic sequences with similar mosaic structures and recombination breakpoints were categorised as novel CRFs. On top of that, breakpoints for the previously reported CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B were also determined concurrently to ascertain the accuracy of the estimated breakpoints for the novel CRF.

Among these six isolates, three near-full length and three partial genomes were successfully amplified and sequenced (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).

The recombination structures were determined through bootscanning and informative sites analysis. All three near-full length genomes have identical mosaic recombination structures, which are composed of nine sub-regions alternating between CRF01_AE and subtype B&#x002b9;. Sub-region neighbour joining analyses also confirmed the putative parental subtype of each sub-region (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). A total of eight breakpoints were estimated at HXB2 positions 2053&#x02013;2063, 2375&#x02013;2416, 2538&#x02013;2551, 2841&#x02013;2875, 3148&#x02013;3160, 3284&#x02013;3325, 9013&#x02013;9038 and 9388&#x02013;9389. Specifically, five sub-regions of CRF01_AE were identified by informative site analysis at HXB2 positions 643 to 2052, 2417 to 2537, 2876 to 3147, 3326 to 9012 and 9389 to 9606, while four sub-regions of subtype B&#x002b9; were observed in 2064 to 2374, 2552 to 2840, 3161 to 3283 and 9039 to 9388. However, we note that sub-region VI, which was only 123bp in size (HXB2 position: 3161 to 3283), did not provide sufficient phylogenetic signal for definitive distinction of subtype B (Western origin) and subtype B&#x002b9; (Thai origin).In particular, the first four recombination breakpoints were similar to those in CRF33_01B, a CRFs previously identified in Malaysia.

The former hypothesis is highly probable, as CRF33_01B has gradually dispersed and established among the general population since its first report in 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], therefore having a higher chance to co-circulate with other genotypes and subsequently recombine to generate novel CRF. In order to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of CRF74_01B with other structurally related recombinant lineages, the longest shared genetic regions (non-recombinant genetic fragment) with sufficient phylogenetic signal were identified among CRF74_01B, CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B. Regions corresponding to HXB2 positions 790&#x02013;2052 (similar to region I in <bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>) and 3326&#x02013;9012 (region VII in <bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>) were selected for maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructions in BEAST. MCC tree reconstructions under the constant and exponential demographic models produced similar tree topologies, thus only the constant tree model is shown (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>).</p><p>The topologies of the MCC tree showed that CRF74_01B branched from an internal node along with CRF33_01B in region I (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>), which could indicate a common ancestry between these two CRFs; though one particular strain of CRF74_01B, 10MYKL052, is paraphyletic in relation to other CRF74_01B strains. On the other hand, CRF74_01B appears to form a monophyletic cluster with CRF53_01B in the longer sub-genomic region VII (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>). Therefore, it is likely that CRF74_01B is a second-generation progeny descended from specific lineages of CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B. Notably, CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B appear to have emerged from a common ancestor, as both group branches from one common internal node (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>). On the other hand, CRF48_01B that was reported to be descended from CRF33_01B [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], showed no direct relationship to CRF74_01B and is clustered independently within CRF33_01B. Similar observations can be derived from maximum likelihood analyses (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Based on the Bayesian MCMC analysis in this study, the evolutionary rates for region I and region VII were estimated at 2.3 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1.8 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x02013;2.8 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>) and 2.8 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (95% HPD: 2.4 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>&#x02013;3.2 x 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), substitutions per site per year, respectively, which are in concordance with substitution rates estimated elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Following the MCC trees depicted in <bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref></bold>, the estimated time for the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for CRF74_01B placed its emergence at approximately between 1994 and 1996. This outcome supports that notion that CRF74_01B emerged a few years after the emergence of its putative parental strain CRF33_01B (<bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref></bold>), which is proposed to have emerged between 1991 and 1993 [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0133883.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0133883.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Plausible genetic recombination events leading to the generation of HIV-1 CRF74_01B.</title><p>Using information on the recombination structures and phylogenetic inference of CRF74_01B and other genetically related CRFs as possible parental lineages, a chronology of recombination events leading to the emergence of CRF74_01B was proposed.

For one, the genetic data used for the analyses were limited, as few near-full length genomes of CRF53_01B and CRF74_01B are available due to their low prevalence in the country [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Even for an established recombinant such as CRF33_01B, which has an increasingly extensive transmission network in Malaysia [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], only a few near-full length genomes are readily available for comprehensive phylogenetic analyses. Secondly, monophyletic rules [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] suggested that the discrepancies between the two MCC tree topologies could be a result of multiple recombination processes, which could complicate phylogenetic analysis due to limitations in the current theoretical and computational settings [<xref rid="pone.0133883.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, until more isolates are detected and sequenced, the intricate relationship between these CRFs must be interpreted with caution, although phylogenetic evidence suggests the ancestral roles of both CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B (<bold>Figs <xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref></bold>and <bold><xref rid="pone.0133883.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). In short, CRF74_01B is probably a second-generation recombinant lineage generated via yet undefined recombination event(s) that involved CRF33_01B, CRF53_01B and subtype B&#x002b9;.</p><p>The emergence of CRF74_01B further highlights the continuous inter-genotypic recombination processes between the various genotypes and recombinants that are circulating among the various risk groups in Malaysia. It also prompted the necessity of vigilant surveillance on the genetic diversity of HIV-1 epidemics in Malaysia, since it has increased tremendously with the description of the CRF33_01B, CRF48_01B, CRF52_01B, CRF53_01B, CRF54_01B, CRF58_01B and the latest addition of CRF74_01B.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified a novel CRF74_01B among IDUs in Malaysia.
