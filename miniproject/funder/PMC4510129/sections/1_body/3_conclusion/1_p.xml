<p>We identified a novel CRF74_01B among IDUs in Malaysia. Thus far, this is the sixth CRF found in the country. Bayesian MCMC analysis showed that CRF74_01B could be a second-generation progeny lineage from the recombination between CRF33_01B, CRF53_01B and subtype BÊ¹. Hence, continuous molecular screening and epidemic surveillance should be implemented in order to comprehend the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemics, which could be crucial in the design of effective vaccines and intervention measures.</p>
