<p>Patients with history of unsafe injecting drug practices were recruited in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between 2010 and 2011. HIV-1 RNA was extracted from plasma samples through magnetic silica-based method implemented in the automated NucliSENS easyMAG platform (BioMerieux, France). Reverse transcription was carried out with random hexamers using SuperScript III RNase H
 <sup>-</sup> Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to manufacturerâ€™s instruction. Through amplification of the protease-reverse transcriptase (PRRT) genes and neighbour-joining analysis described in another study conducted earlier [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], four of 128 (3.1%) PRRT sequences from epidemiologically-unlinked study subjects forming a distinct cluster were identified. In addition, we identified two other isolates from our routine genotyping, which shares a clade with the four sequences identified previously. In order to study the detailed mosaic structures for this monophyletic cluster, near-full length genome amplification were carried out through nested PCR strategies, using sets of primers described in
