<p>In order to study the phylogenetic relationship between the novel CRF as well as the approximate time of emergence of the novel CRF and other published CRFs in Malaysia, Bayesian coalescent analysis using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method were performed through BEAST version 1.7.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] under the uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock model with the general time-reversible (GTR) nucleotide substitution model with constant and exponential coalescence model. Each MCMC analysis was executed for 50 million states, sampled at every 50,000 states. The model with effective sampling size (ESS) &gt;200 was selected. Posterior probabilities densities were determined in Tracer v1.5 (available in

All sequences studied have been deposited in GenBank, as listed in
