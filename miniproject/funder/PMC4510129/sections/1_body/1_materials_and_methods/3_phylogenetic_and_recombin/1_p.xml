<p>In order to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of the sequences, reference sequences relevant to HIV-1 epidemics in Southeast Asia, such as CRF01_AE, subtype B of Western origin, subtype Bʹ of Thai origin, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC, CRF15_01B, CRF33_01B, CRF34_01B, CRF48_01B, CRF51_01B, CRF53_01B, CRF54_01B and CRF58_01B were downloaded from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database (

References and query sequences (including near-full length and partial genomes) were codon-aligned in accordance to HIV Sequence Compendium 2013 (

 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were carried out. HIV-1 CRF01_AE (90THCM240) and subtype Bʹ (93CNRL42) were used as putative parental genotypes, as well as subtype C (95IN21068) as an outlier group, to determine the recombination structures as well as the location of breakpoints in the near-full length and partial sequences. Genomic sequences with similar mosaic structures and recombination breakpoints were categorised as novel CRFs. On top of that, breakpoints for the previously reported CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B were also determined concurrently to ascertain the accuracy of the estimated breakpoints for the novel CRF. Next, sub-genomic region neighbor-joining trees were constructed using MEGA version 6, on Kimura two-parameter model with a transition-to-transversion ratio of 2.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to reaffirm the parental lineages of each sub-genomic segment. The reliability of the branching orders were analysed by bootstrap replicates of 1000. Maximum likelihood tree analyses were performed using PAUP version 4.0 [
