<p>A total of six isolates from epidemiologically-unlinked individuals formed a monophyletic cluster based on phylogenetic analysis of the PRRT sequences reported previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among these six isolates, three near-full length and three partial genomes were successfully amplified and sequenced (

 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> region (HXB2: 790–4898) (attempts to amplify the near-full length genomes was unsuccessful due to limited specimens quantity and poor specimens quality). The recombination structures were determined through bootscanning and informative sites analysis. All three near-full length genomes have identical mosaic recombination structures, which are composed of nine sub-regions alternating between CRF01_AE and subtype Bʹ. Sub-region neighbour joining analyses also confirmed the putative parental subtype of each sub-region (

 </bold>). A total of eight breakpoints were estimated at HXB2 positions 2053–2063, 2375–2416, 2538–2551, 2841–2875, 3148–3160, 3284–3325, 9013–9038 and 9388–9389. Specifically, five sub-regions of CRF01_AE were identified by informative site analysis at HXB2 positions 643 to 2052, 2417 to 2537, 2876 to 3147, 3326 to 9012 and 9389 to 9606, while four sub-regions of subtype Bʹ were observed in 2064 to 2374, 2552 to 2840, 3161 to 3283 and 9039 to 9388. However, we note that sub-region VI, which was only 123bp in size (HXB2 position: 3161 to 3283), did not provide sufficient phylogenetic signal for definitive distinction of subtype B (Western origin) and subtype Bʹ (Thai origin).In particular, the first four recombination breakpoints were similar to those in CRF33_01B, a CRFs previously identified in Malaysia. Similarly, the first two breakpoints were similar to CRF53_01B [

 </bold>). Recombination and sub-region tree analysis of the three partial genomes (isolates 10MYKJ016, 11MYYC672, 11MYJJ741) also showed identical mosaic structures and shared six recombination breakpoints in the 
 <italic>gag</italic>-
 <italic>pol</italic> region (HXB2: 790–4898) with the near-full length genomes (10MYKJ052, 10MYPR268 and 11MYPR416) (

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>
 </bold>). Recombinant structures of these strains are different from any known CRFs reported to date. Taken together, the novel recombination lineage identified in this report was designated CRF74_01B by the HIV Los Alamos National Laboratory according to the standardized nomenclature proposal [
