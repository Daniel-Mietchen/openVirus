<p>The topologies of the MCC tree showed that CRF74_01B branched from an internal node along with CRF33_01B in region I (

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>
 </bold>), which could indicate a common ancestry between these two CRFs; though one particular strain of CRF74_01B, 10MYKL052, is paraphyletic in relation to other CRF74_01B strains. On the other hand, CRF74_01B appears to form a monophyletic cluster with CRF53_01B in the longer sub-genomic region VII (

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>
 </bold>). Therefore, it is likely that CRF74_01B is a second-generation progeny descended from specific lineages of CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B. Notably, CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B appear to have emerged from a common ancestor, as both group branches from one common internal node (

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>
 </bold>). On the other hand, CRF48_01B that was reported to be descended from CRF33_01B [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], showed no direct relationship to CRF74_01B and is clustered independently within CRF33_01B. Similar observations can be derived from maximum likelihood analyses (

 </bold>). Based on the Bayesian MCMC analysis in this study, the evolutionary rates for region I and region VII were estimated at 2.3 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1.8 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup>–2.8 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and 2.8 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> (95% HPD: 2.4 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup>–3.2 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), substitutions per site per year, respectively, which are in concordance with substitution rates estimated elsewhere [

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>
 </bold>, the estimated time for the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for CRF74_01B placed its emergence at approximately between 1994 and 1996. This outcome supports that notion that CRF74_01B emerged a few years after the emergence of its putative parental strain CRF33_01B (
 <bold>
  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>
 </bold>), which is proposed to have emerged between 1991 and 1993 [
