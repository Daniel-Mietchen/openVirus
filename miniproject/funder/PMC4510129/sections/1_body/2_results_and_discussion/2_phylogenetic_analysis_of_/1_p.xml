<p>As sharing of breakpoints typically suggest a common ancestry between recombinants [

 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it is possible that CRF74_01B could be a descendent of CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B, or vice versa. The former hypothesis is highly probable, as CRF33_01B has gradually dispersed and established among the general population since its first report in 2006 [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], therefore having a higher chance to co-circulate with other genotypes and subsequently recombine to generate novel CRF. In order to investigate the phylogenetic relationship of CRF74_01B with other structurally related recombinant lineages, the longest shared genetic regions (non-recombinant genetic fragment) with sufficient phylogenetic signal were identified among CRF74_01B, CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B. Regions corresponding to HXB2 positions 790–2052 (similar to region I in

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>
 </bold>) were selected for maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructions in BEAST. MCC tree reconstructions under the constant and exponential demographic models produced similar tree topologies, thus only the constant tree model is shown (
