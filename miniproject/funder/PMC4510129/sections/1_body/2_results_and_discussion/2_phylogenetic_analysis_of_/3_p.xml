<p>However, certain limitations that may affect the tMRCA estimation and interpretation in the study should be addressed. For one, the genetic data used for the analyses were limited, as few near-full length genomes of CRF53_01B and CRF74_01B are available due to their low prevalence in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Even for an established recombinant such as CRF33_01B, which has an increasingly extensive transmission network in Malaysia [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], only a few near-full length genomes are readily available for comprehensive phylogenetic analyses. Secondly, monophyletic rules [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] suggested that the discrepancies between the two MCC tree topologies could be a result of multiple recombination processes, which could complicate phylogenetic analysis due to limitations in the current theoretical and computational settings [
 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, until more isolates are detected and sequenced, the intricate relationship between these CRFs must be interpreted with caution, although phylogenetic evidence suggests the ancestral roles of both CRF33_01B and CRF53_01B (

  <xref rid="pone.0133883.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </bold>). In short, CRF74_01B is probably a second-generation recombinant lineage generated via yet undefined recombination event(s) that involved CRF33_01B, CRF53_01B and subtype BÊ¹.
