<p>In Malaysia, the early phase of the HIV-1 epidemic was driven mostly by intravenous drug users (IDUs) that were associated with subtype Bʹ of Thai origin and CRF01_AE. Since then, numerous HIV-1 CRFs such as CRF33_01B, CRF48_01B, CRF52_01B, CRF53_01B, CRF54_01B, and CRF58_01B have been reported in Malaysia in the past decade [

 <xref rid="pone.0133883.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], all of which have arisen from the predominant subtype B' and CRF01_AE co-circulating in the country. These new CRFs could in fact further recombine with other subtypes or CRFs, generating second-generation recombinant descendants. One example is the CRF48_01B discovered in 2007, a CRF descended from the CRF33_01B lineage [
