  <title>Plausible genetic recombination events leading to the generation of HIV-1 CRF74_01B.</title>
  <p>Using information on the recombination structures and phylogenetic inference of CRF74_01B and other genetically related CRFs as possible parental lineages, a chronology of recombination events leading to the emergence of CRF74_01B was proposed. The diagram highlights CRF74_01B as a second-generation recombinant with an estimated tMRCA between 1994 and 1996.</p>
