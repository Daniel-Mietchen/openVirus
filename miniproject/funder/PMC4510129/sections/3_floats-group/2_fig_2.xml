  <title>Recombination structures and sub-genomic maximum clade credibility tree reconstructions.</title>
  <p>Recombination structures of HIV-1 CRF33_01B, CRF53_01B and CRF74_01B were shown. Shared recombination breakpoints between these CRFs were indicated by dashed lines. Maximum clade credibility trees for the 
   <italic>gag</italic> region (region I; HXB2: 790–2052) and 
   <italic>pol-env</italic> region (region VII; HXB2: 3326–9012) of CRF74_01B and other relevant reference sequences were reconstructed. The means of tMRCA of CRF74_01B for region I and region VII were estimate around 1996.2 and 1993.9, respectively, with the 95% credibility intervals stated in parentheses.
