  <title>Recombination and neighbour joining analysis of HIV-1 CRF74_01B.</title>
  <p>The mosaic structure of CRF74_01B was depicted through bootscan using HIV-1 CRF01_AE (90THCM240) and subtype Bʹ (93CNRL42) as putative parental subtypes, and subtype C (95IN21068) as outlier strain. Subtype assignment for sub-genomic regions of CRF74_01B (regions I to IX) were determined and depicted using neighbour joining analysis. Red branches indicate CRF01_AE while blue branches indicate subtype B and Bʹ reference strains. CRF74_01B isolates were indicated (yellow shades).</p>
