<p>We also looked at epidemic synchrony and annual phase coherence at other spatial levels (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007012.s004">S4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007012.s005">S5</xref> Figs, respectively) and found that both synchrony and coherence lengths tend to decrease for smaller spatial resolutions and stabilise at 1,240 km and 1,500 km.
