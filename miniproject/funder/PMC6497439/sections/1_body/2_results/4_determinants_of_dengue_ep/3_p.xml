<p>We explored performance of the statistical models for other spatial levels (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007012.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and found that overall model 7 (gravity model combined with precipitation) was the best in terms of variance explained. The classical gravity model (compared to climate factors) explained the majority of variance in epidemic synchrony across most of spatial scales (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007012.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). However, at smaller scales, precipitation contributed the most for coherent timing of annual epidemics (
