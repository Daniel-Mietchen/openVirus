<p>The same analysis for annual phase coherence (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) revealed that while the gravity model performed even better (14% of variance explained), incorporation of other factors was still beneficial. The best fit (28% of variance explained) was for model 7 that accounted for human mobility and precipitation.
