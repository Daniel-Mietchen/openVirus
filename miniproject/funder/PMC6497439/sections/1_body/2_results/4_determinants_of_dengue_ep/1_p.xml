<p>We built a suite of models investigating potential determinants of dengue epidemic synchrony (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The classical gravity model (model 4) that accounted only for distance and the product of population sizes of regions captured a part of variation in epidemic synchrony (9.6%) which was higher than those of vector suitability (1.5%, model 6), precipitation (no variance explained, model 8: negative R
 <sup>2</sup> indicates that the fit is actually worse than fitting a constant term) and average temperature (3.8%, model 10). The fit was further improved by combining the gravity model with correlations of vector suitability (model 5), precipitation (model 7) and average temperature (model 9), raising the explained variance up to 11%, 14% and 11%, respectively. We found that estimates of human mobility parameters were consistent between different models, regardless of additional variables.
