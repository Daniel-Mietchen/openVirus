 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007012.g002">Fig 2A</xref> shows, for each state, the median and 95% range of annual phase lags from other states, which represent delays of individual state dengue waves from the nationwide annual waves. Average phase lags enabled us to identify the average seasonal pattern of dengue in Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007012.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), which starts in the western states, travels to the highly densely populated southeastern states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and then reaches the northeast of the country. We found that Roraima and Amapá, two states in the north, had inconsistent annual phase lags over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007012.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) suggesting that they had poor synchrony with the rest of the country and did not follow the aforementioned wave pattern. We observed similar spatial patterns when we aggregated data at different spatial resolutions (
