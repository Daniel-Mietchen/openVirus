The next step was to obtain pairwise phase angle differences between states that indicate for each point in time whether a state is ahead or behind another one in terms of recurrent annual waves. Consequently, for each state we obtained the average phase difference from the other 26 states. The mean value of this phase difference over time was used to produce a map of annual phase lags between states. Phase differences were interpreted as time units as for the regular annual signal phase angle changes from -π to +π in 1 year, which makes the phase lag of 1 radian equivalent to approximately 2 months. Hence, the map of annual phase lags represents the average ordering of states in terms of dengue wave arrival times.
