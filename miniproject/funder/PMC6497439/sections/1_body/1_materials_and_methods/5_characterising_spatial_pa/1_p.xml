<p>We used biwavelet package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] in R with Morlet function as a wavelet base for the analysis of longitudinal dengue data. Original case series for each state were log-transformed and scaled to zero mean and unit variance. The outputs of the wavelet transform of each of the time series consisted of: the local wavelet power spectrum, which allows for inspection of time-frequency distribution and detection of predominant signal components for particular time periods; and the corresponding phase angles, which can be used to assess the speed of wave propagation for a particular period.
