<p>We considered correlations between regional time series by computing the Pearson correlation coefficient of raw case series (epidemic synchrony) and annual phase angles (annual phase coherence) for each pair of regions. Then, these measures were summarised by the nonparametric spline covariance function (implemented in ncf R package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]) to assess how they depend on the distance. Normally, they are higher between neighbouring regions that experience synchronised dengue epidemics and, therefore, could serve as useful descriptors of travelling waves. Phase coherence measures the relative timing of seasonal epidemics while epidemic synchrony indicates how their relative amplitudes covary [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In other words, annual phase coherence describes lags between annual signals (i.e. seasonality only), while epidemic synchrony also accounts for other frequency components as well as their amplitudes (other synchronised events with various periodicity).
