<p>We excluded data on region pairs for which we had negative correlations to allow for log-transformation (less than 10% of all pairs for state-level, predominantly between distant regions). We used R
 <sup>2</sup> and Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) for model comparison, and also generated bootstrapped confidence intervals for the parameters by resampling the location pairs with replacement 500 times.
