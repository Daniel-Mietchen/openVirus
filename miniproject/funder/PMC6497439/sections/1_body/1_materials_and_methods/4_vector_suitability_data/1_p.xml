<p>We obtained average monthly estimates of vector suitability for each Brazilian municipality using the modelling outputs from [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mosquito occurrence data were fitted to annual data and covariates (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>. time varying temperature-persistence suitability, relative humidity, precipitation and a static urban vs. rural covariate) and then subsequently re-applied to the same covariates at a monthly level. Maps were produced at a 5 x 5 kilometre resolution, aggregated to the municipality level and the mean value was used for our model. For consistency, we rescaled the monthly suitability values, so that the sum of all monthly maps equalled the annual mean map.
