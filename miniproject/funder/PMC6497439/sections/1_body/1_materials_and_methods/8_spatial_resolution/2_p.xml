<p>In this paper, we present results of the wavelet analysis on the state level, primarily for better visual representation. Analyses of epidemic synchrony and annual phase coherence are presented on the Urban-2 level (n = 161), to allow for sufficient variation in distance between pairs of regions. The results on all the six available levels can be found in the Supplementary Material.</p>
