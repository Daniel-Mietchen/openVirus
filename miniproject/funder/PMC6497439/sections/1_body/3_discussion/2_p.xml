<p>Our findings revealed the presence of seasonal travelling wave that starts in the western states, then travels to the east and reaches the northeast at the end of a typical dengue season. Overall the timing of epidemic peaks between states was largely consistent between seasons. This provides a level of predictability for public health planning: particularly, in terms of preparedness of health care facilities to allocate enough resources for timely treatment of severe dengue cases. The epidemics in the more populous states along the coast appeared to peak relatively late compared to other states, potentially providing an opportunity for control programs to optimise the timing and placement of interventions.</p>
