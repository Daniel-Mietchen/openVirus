<p>We characterised the spatial correlation between dengue cases series of each pair of regions depending on distance and estimated the extent of synchronised epidemics in terms of timing (annual phase coherence) and intensity (epidemic synchrony). Our results are in line with previously published ones that reported the spatial correlation of dengue cases between pairs of municipalities to decay with distance [
