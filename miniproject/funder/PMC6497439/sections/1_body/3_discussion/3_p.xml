<p>The epidemiology of dengue in the two most northern states of the country (Roraima and Amap√°) appeared different from the rest of the country, as they did not follow the overall seasonal travelling wave pattern. This could be explained by the equatorial climate with favourable conditions for dengue transmission throughout the year, while epidemics in other regions are highly restricted by seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation.</p>
