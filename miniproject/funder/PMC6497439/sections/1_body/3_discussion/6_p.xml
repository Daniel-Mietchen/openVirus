<p>Our findings suggest that precipitation was more important than human mobility for the seasonality of dengue at the mesoregion and finer spatial levels. Contrastingly, across scales human mobility better explained season-specific and region-specific features attributed to non-annual components and epidemic size effects. Contribution of human mobility approximated via gravity model for both epidemic synchrony and phase coherence was declining with finer spatial resolution. This might suggest that gravity models are failing to capture fine-scale human movements as they tend to emphasize larger urban centers as points of attraction while the importance of hubs may decline in the course of an epidemic [
