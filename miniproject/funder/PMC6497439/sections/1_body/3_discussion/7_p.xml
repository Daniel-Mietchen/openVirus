<p>This study has several other limitations. Firstly, we described the averaged seasonal pattern but did not consider season-specific features or anomalies (e.g. due to El Niño–Southern Oscillation). Incorporating these elements may further improve model performance. Secondly, in wavelet analysis we ignored information on amplitudes and considered only annual components of dengue case series. This was done considering the timing of seasonal dengue rather than its epidemic size and severity. Thirdly, our models to estimate epidemic synchrony/phase coherence were restricted to only include pairs with positive correlations which may bias our estimates upwards. Lastly, dengue surveillance system in Brazil is not entirely accurate for capturing all dengue cases, there might be regional biases, underestimation and overestimation issues [
