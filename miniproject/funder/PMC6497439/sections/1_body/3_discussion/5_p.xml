<p>Gravity models that used distance and population size as markers of human mobility explained a major part of the correlation in dengue epidemics. However, we found that incorporating information on the correlation in climate markers of vector ecology substantially improved the fit. Future research on relative contributions of vector ecology, human demographics, population mobility and host immunity could further increase our understanding of spatial dynamics of dengue and similar arboviruses.</p>
