<p>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes serious health and economic burden in tropical and sub-tropical regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Population growth, urbanisation, international travel and changes in climate patterns have led to significant geographic expansion and continued rise in dengue cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Large territories, various climate types, as well as heterogeneities in demographics, land use and urban development contribute to complex epidemic dynamics. In 2016, Brazilian public health authorities reported more than a million probable cases and over 600 deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO), while the number of apparent dengue infections was estimated at around 5 million per year [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To design appropriate response strategies, a detailed understanding of the dynamics of dengue spread at the country level is necessary [
