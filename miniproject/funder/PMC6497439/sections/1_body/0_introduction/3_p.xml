<p>The reasons why communities may experience a lag in dengue epidemics compared to their neighbours can be attributed to multiple factors. Synchrony of regional epidemics can be mediated by climate drivers such as temperature and rainfall, as has previously been observed between different countries within Southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The movement of infectious people between communities might also provide wave-like dynamics across settings [
