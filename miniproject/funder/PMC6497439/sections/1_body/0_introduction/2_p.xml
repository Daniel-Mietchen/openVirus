<p>Dengue has previously been shown to exhibit ‘travelling wave’ type dynamics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], i.e. when regional epidemic timing has a distinct spatial structure. However, these studies have largely focused on Southeast Asian settings. It remains unclear, to which extent pan-national waves are also observed in South America, where dengue re-emergence occurred more recently [
