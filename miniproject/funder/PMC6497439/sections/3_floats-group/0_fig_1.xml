  <title>Summary of the spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue in Brazil.</title>
  <p>(A) Average annual dengue risk per 10,000 inhabitants in 2001–2016 for each state. Administrative boundaries were obtained from GADM (

(B) Heat map of log-normalised average number of monthly cases in 2001–2016 for Brazilian states sorted by longitude: west (top) to east (bottom). (C) Log of monthly dengue cases per 10,000 inhabitants in Brazil. (D) Heat map of log-normalised case series for Brazilian states sorted by longitude: west (top) to east (bottom). Colours were scaled for each state independently so that yellow indicates the lowest number of dengue cases and red indicates the maximum.
