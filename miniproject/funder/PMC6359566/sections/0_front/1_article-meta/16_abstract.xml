 <p>Baculoviruses have already been used for insect pest control, but the slow killing speed limits their further promotion and application. Here we provide a strategy for improving baculovirus insecticidal activity using Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) to express double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting cotton bollworm (
  <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>) juvenile hormone (JH)-related genes. Droplet-feeding bioassays show that the 50% lethal concentration (LC
  <sub>50</sub>) values of recombinant baculoviruses expressing the dsRNA of JH acid methyl transferase gene (
  <italic>HaJHAMT</italic>) and the JH acid binding protein gene (
  <italic>HaJHBP</italic>) were 1.24 × 10
  <sup>4</sup> polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB)/mL and 2.26 × 10
  <sup>4</sup> PIB/mL, respectively. Both were much lower than the control value (8.12 × 10
  <sup>4</sup> PIB/mL). Meanwhile, the LT
  <sub>50</sub> of recombinant baculovirus expressing dsRNA of 
  <italic>HaJHBP</italic> was only 54.2% of the control value, which means that larval death was accelerated. Furthermore, the mRNA level of target genes was reduced in recombinant baculovirus-treated cotton bollworm larvae. Transcription of several key genes involved in hormone signaling pathways—for example, ecdysone receptor gene (
  <italic>HaEcR</italic>)—was also altered. This study establishes a new strategy for pest management by interfering with insect hormone-related gene expression via baculoviruses, and the engineered baculoviruses have great potential application in cotton production.
