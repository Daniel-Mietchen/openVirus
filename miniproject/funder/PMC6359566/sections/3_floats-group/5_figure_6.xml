  <p>The qRT-PCR detection of genes involved in hormone pathways in third instar 
   <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> larvae. After 48 h of feeding with vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT, vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP, and vHaBacΔegt, gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. 
   <italic>ACTIN</italic> was used as an internal standard to normalize the level of gene expression. Data of the histogram represents the ratio of gene expression to that in the control (vHaBacΔegt infected larvae). Bars show means and standard errors (three independent replicates).
