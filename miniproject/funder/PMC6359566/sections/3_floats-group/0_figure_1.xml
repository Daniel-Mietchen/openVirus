  <p>Schematic version of a recombinant baculovirus plasmid (bacmid). The hairpin RNA structure was composed of the same two juvenile hormone (JH)-related gene fragments in the antisense orientation separated by the intron from the potato GA20-oxidase gene. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) expression was controlled by the 
   <italic>op166</italic> and 
   <italic>p10</italic> promoters. The 
   <italic>polyhedrin</italic> gene under its native promoter was reinserted in recombinant bacmids. In addition, the 
   <italic>egt</italic> locus was replaced by 
   <italic>eGFP</italic> and 
   <italic>Cm
    <sup>R</sup>
   </italic> genes.
