  <p>Survival analysis of third instar 
   <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae feeding with OBs of baculoviruses. The concentration of OBs was 100 times the LC
   <sub>50</sub> value. The observation continued until all larvae died or pupated. Larvae feeding without baculovirus were used as controls; a total of 96 larvae were tested for each virus. Survival analysis were performed using the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator by SPSS 22.0.
