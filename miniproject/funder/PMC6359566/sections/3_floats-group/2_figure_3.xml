  <p>Transcription verification of dsRNA fragments in infected cells by reverse transcription (RT-PCR). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Detection of dsJHAMT total transcription in transfected insect cells; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Detection of dsJHBP transcription in transfected insect cells. HaBacÎ”egt-transfected insect cells were used as control. Total RNA of infected cells was extracted at 6 days after transfection. RT-PCR was performed and PCR products underwent electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel. Arrows point to target bands.
