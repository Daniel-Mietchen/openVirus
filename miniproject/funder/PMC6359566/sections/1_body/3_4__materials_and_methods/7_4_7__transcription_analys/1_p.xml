<p>The total RNA was extracted from three larvae that were infected with OBs and reared for two days. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by a GoScript
 <sup>TM</sup> reverse transcription system (Promega) and diluted 10 times as a template. To measure transcription of 
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic>, 
 <italic>HaJHBP</italic>, and related genes in OB-feeding 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using a LightCycler 480 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) following a two-step protocol: 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 58 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 20 s. We used 
 <italic>ACTIN</italic> as the reference gene, and calculated transcription relative to 
 <italic>ACTIN</italic> with the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔ
  <italic>C</italic>t
 </sup> method [
