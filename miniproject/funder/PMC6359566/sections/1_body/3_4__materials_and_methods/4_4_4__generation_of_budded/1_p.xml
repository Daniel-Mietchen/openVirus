<p>Bacmid DNAs of HaBacΔegt-dsJHAMT, HaBacΔegtdsJHBP, and HaBacΔegt were purified from 5 mL cultures. A total of 5 μg bacmid DNA was used to transfect 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> HzAM1 cells with the aid of 10 μL of lipofectin, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). When cultured at 27 °C for three days, transfected cells were viewed for fluorescence under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE-300, Tokyo, Japan). After six days’ culture, the cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as the first-generation virus and used to infect HzAM1 cells at a rate of 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). When the yield of budded viruses (BVs) reached the peak (96 h), the supernatant, as the second-generation virus, was collected, and used to obtain the third-generation virus. The resulting BVs were named vHaBacΔegt-dsJHAMT, vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP, and vHaBacΔegt and tested for 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) by endpoint dilution assay. All viruses were kept in the dark at 4 °C for further experiments.
