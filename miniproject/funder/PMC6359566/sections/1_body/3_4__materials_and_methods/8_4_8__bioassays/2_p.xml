 <sub>50</sub> values of recombinant HearNPV were also tested by a droplet feeding method at a high OB concentration (100 × LC
 <sub>50</sub>). Second instar 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were infected as mentioned above. Time 0 was defined as the point where larvae were transferred to the fresh diet. Then we observed and recorded the number of deaths at 07:00, 13:00, 18:00, and 23:00 every day until all the larvae died or pupated. Each HearNPV was tested using 96 larvae. LT
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier estimator and further compared by a log-rank test (Mantel–Cox) in SPSS 22.0 [
