<p>LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of recombinant HearNPVs were determined by the droplet feeding method [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Late second instar 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were placed in 24-well sterile plates and starved overnight at 28 °C. The following morning, larvae that had molted third instar were used for bioassays. The polyhedrosis virus was set to 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> OBs/mL, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> OBs/mL, 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> OBs/mL, 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> OBs/mL, and 3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> OBs/mL suspensions. The starving third instar larvae were fed with the different suspensions of OBs mixed with 4% sucrose and 1 mg/mL blue dye (erioglaucine disodium salt, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The larvae whose midgut changed to blue in 10 min were transferred individually into a 24-well plate containing fresh artificial diet. The mortality rate was observed twice a day until all larvae died or pupated. Each OB suspension concentration was tested using 24 larvae and the experiment was performed twice. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were analyzed by Probit regression analysis and compared by 
 <italic>z</italic>-test in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0, Armonk, NY, USA).
