<p>These two donor plasmids were transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-competent cells harboring a HaBacHz8-Δegt bacmid and helper plasmid expressing transposase, respectively. Correspondingly, the resulting recombinant bacmids produced by transposition were named HaBacΔegt-dsJHAMT and HaBacΔegtdsJHBP. According to the Bac-to-Bac
 <sup>TM</sup> system manual, the colonies were selected in the presence of kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, and X-Gal. White recombinants were picked and then checked by PCR using M13 forward primer and gene-specific primers.
