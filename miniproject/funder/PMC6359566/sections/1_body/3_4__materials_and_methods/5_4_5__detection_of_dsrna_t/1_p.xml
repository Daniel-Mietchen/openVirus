<p>To make sure the dsRNA expression cassette inserted into the HearNPV genome was active, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect dsRNA expression. The total RNA was extracted from infected HzAM1 cells at 6 dpi with Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the user manual. Next, 1.0 Î¼g of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA with a GoScript
 <sup>TM</sup> reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and oligo(dT) anchor primer. Primer pairs JTF and Pin and Pin and JPR (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00419">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were used to detect the transcription of dsJHAMT and dsJHBP, respectively.
