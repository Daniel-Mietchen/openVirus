<p>The baculovirus early promoter 
 <italic>op166</italic> was amplified by PCR from plasmid pFB-op166 using primers OPF and OPR (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00419">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The obtained 184 bp amplicon was cloned into the pMD-18T vector for sequence verification. After digesting with 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I and 
 <italic>Sma</italic>I, 
 <italic>op166</italic> promoter was inserted into the vector pFBD-HaPH downstream of the 
 <italic>p10</italic> promoter to obtain the donor plasmid precursor pFBD-HaPH-op166. Hairpin RNAi constructs dsJHAMT and dsJHBP, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], were excised by 
 <italic>Sse8387</italic>I (blunting) from plasmids stored in our lab, and then cloned into the 
 <italic>Pvu</italic>II enzyme site of pFBD-HaPH-op166 downstream of the 
 <italic>op166</italic> promoter to produce donor plasmids pFBD-HaPH-op166-dsJHAMT and pFBD-HaPH-op166-dsJHBP, respectively.
