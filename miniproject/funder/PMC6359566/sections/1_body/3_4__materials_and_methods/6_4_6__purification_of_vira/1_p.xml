<p>Third instar 
 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> larvae were infected via microinjection with the third-generation BVs (a titer of 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 5 μL for each larva), vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT, vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP, and vHaBacΔegt. After about five days, cadavers of the larva that died from infection were collected and mashed. After adding some distilled water, the mixture was centrifuged at 300× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to collect the supernatant. Then the supernatant was centrifuged again at 3000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The precipitate was resuspended in distilled water and thoroughly mixed, which was the purified OBs. The purified OBs were diluted and counted under a microscope using a hemocytometer. Samples were counted three times and averaged.
