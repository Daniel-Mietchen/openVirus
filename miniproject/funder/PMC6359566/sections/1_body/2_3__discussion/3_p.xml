<p>In this study, we constructed two recombinant bacmids containing a dsJHAMT and dsJHBP expression cassette. To ensure that RNAi occurred in cotton bollworm as soon as possible after infection and persisted throughout the infection, dsRNA expression was driven by two baculovirus promoters, the early 
 <italic>op166</italic> promoter and the late 
 <italic>p10</italic> promoter (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that the insertion of dsRNA did not affect virus infection and OB formation in HzAM1 cells. Further examination of infected cells by RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f003">Figure 3</xref>) confirmed the transcription of dsRNA as expected.
