<p>The combined actions of JH and ecdysteroids are crucial in regulating insect molting and metamorphosis. The presence of JH during larval molting prevents pupation [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, nearly every JH molecule binds to JHBP in hemolymph when transported from corpora allata cells, the JH synthesizing place, to its sites of action [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. JHBP also protects the chemically labile JH from nonspecific enzymatic degradation [
