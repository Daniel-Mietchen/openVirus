<p>Baculoviruses are the most widely used virus insecticide in the world. However, in contrast to plant- or bacteria-mediated RNAi, the application of baculovirus as a dsRNA delivery vehicle for pest control has attracted far less attention [

Previous research indicated that baculovirus-mediated RNAi was not suitable for functionally characterizing genes of the lepidopteran insects, since the infection effects might mask the potentially produced phenotypes associated with RNAi [
