<p>Bioassay results confirmed that our strategy to modify baculovirus was successful. Both recombinant HearNPVs in this study exhibited a large reduction in LC
 <sub>50</sub> value compared to the control (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which shows that dsRNA expressed by baculoviruses played an extra insecticidal role in comparison with the control virus. However, for the LT50 bioassay, the result of vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP was significantly reduced, while there was no significant difference between vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT and the control (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We suspected that this might be due to the lower virus concentrations used for infection than that of the control. The specific virus concentrations (100 times the LC
 <sub>50</sub>) were 2.26 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> OBs/mL for vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP, 1.24 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> OBs/mL for vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT, and 8.12 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> OBs/mL for the control, respectively. Further testing indicated that the transcription of dsRNA target genes 
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic> and 
 <italic>HaJHBP</italic> in 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae was suppressed in cotton bollworm larvae fed with recombinant OBs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This might reduce JH concentration in 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Considering there was cross-talk between JH and ecdysteroid signaling [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and that the transcription of other genes (
 <italic>HaECR</italic> et al.) involved in insect hormone signaling pathway was indeed altered at 48 h post-infection with recombinant HearNPVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f006">Figure 6</xref>), ecdysteroid function might also be affected in larvae. Therefore, we proposed a hypothesis. Recombinant HearNPVs could effectively express dsJHAMT and dsJHBP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f003">Figure 3</xref>), and reduce target genes mRNA levels in infected larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f005">Figure 5</xref>). This may lead to a decrease in JH concentration [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and interfere with the hormonal equilibrium in infected host, which in turn might affect the growth and development of the larvae and ultimately results in larvae death. Obviously, this additional insecticidal effect will increase the insecticidal activity of recombinant HearNPVs. Specific to this study, it was reflected that recombinant HearNPVs had lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> values and a shorter LT
 <sub>50</sub> value than the control vHaBacΔegt (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In agreement with our results, recombinant baculoviruses expressing juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) or a mutant JHE (more stable in hemolymph than wild-type JHE) showed a dramatic reduction in LC
 <sub>50</sub> in comparison to larvae infected with wild-type AcMNPV [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. JHE is a catalytically inactive insect enzyme, and its overexpression decreases the concentration of JH [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Besides, the expression of dsJHBP rather than dsJHAMT could speed up the insecticidal activity of baculovirus in our research (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), possibly because JHBP is located farther downstream of the JH signaling pathway and has a faster impact on the JH titer than JHAMT.
