<p>Cotton bollworm, 
 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>, is one of the worldâ€™s most destructive pests in cotton and many other crops [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) has already been successfully applied to control cotton bollworms in Australia, the United States, China, and India [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, since cotton bollworms do not die immediately after infection with HearNPV, it is difficult to effectively control pests and avoid losses in the outbreak period. In this work, we attempted to construct novel recombinant HearNPVs that can increase the insecticidal activity of HearNPV, and especially reduce the killing time. Our previous report showed that transgenic cotton expressing dsRNA targeting gene encoding proteins that synthesize or transport juvenile hormones was effective against cotton bollworm, especially for Bt-resistant cotton bollworm [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Insect resistance to the cotton-pyramiding Bt toxin and RNAi was substantially delayed compared to using Bt cotton alone. Here, to control cotton bollworm, we constructed two recombinant HearNPVs expressing dsRNA targeting JH acid methyltransferase gene (
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic>) and JH-binding protein gene (
 <italic>HaJHBP</italic>) from 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic>, and tested their insecticidal action. Our results demonstrate that the recombinant HearNPVs obtained in this study had significantly improved insecticidal activity.
