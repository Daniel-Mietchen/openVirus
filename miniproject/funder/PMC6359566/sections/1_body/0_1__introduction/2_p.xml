<p>Insect hormones play an important role in the regulation of insect growth, development, and reproduction. Insect hormone analogues, such as tebufenozide, have resulted in larval death due to the interruption of hormone-mediated cell or organ development [

There is considerable interest in the possibility of using insect hormones or hormone regulatory proteins in conjunction with microbial delivery systems as a means of controlling insect pests. Several hormone-related genes were used in genetically modified baculoviruses to enhance their insecticidal activity, including the genes of a diuretic hormone, eclosion hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone, and juvenile hormone (JH) esterase [

However, just a small part of these recombinant baculoviruses showed significant improvement over parent wild-type baculoviruses in pesticidal activity. Alternatively, the deletion of a nonessential baculovirus gene coding ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (EGT) provided a beneficial effect on killing speed [
