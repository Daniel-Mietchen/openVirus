<p>Insect pests cause large crop losses worldwide through direct damage and the transmission of plant diseases [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, spraying chemical insecticides remains the most common method of pest control [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but problems such as environmental pollution, effects on human health, and the development of resistance in target pests have followed [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Baculoviruses, which are arthropod-specific viruses, have been successfully applied for agriculture and forestry pest management. They are safe for people and wildlife because of their extremely narrow host range [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Baculoviruses can cause epidemics in insect populations and be effective in the environment for a long time [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In Latin America, baculoviruses as commercial pesticides have been successfully applied in integrated pest management programs for decades in soybean and vegetable fields, as well as apple and pear orchards [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Fortunately, the genome sequences of some notable baculoviruses were determined, and many strategies have been developed to improve their killing action and stability through recombinant DNA technology [
