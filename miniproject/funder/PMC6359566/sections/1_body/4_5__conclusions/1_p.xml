<p>In conclusion, the results obtained show that recombinant HearNPV expressing dsJHAMT or dsJHBP successfully suppressed target gene expression in infected cotton bollworm, and these recombinant HearNPVs had higher insecticidal activity than the unmodified baculovirus. Especially for vHaBacÎ”egtdsJHBP, the insecticidal speed increased by 45.8%, while the toxicity more than doubled. These data show the possibility for applying engineered baculoviruses in cotton bollworm control, and this research provides a new strategy for pest management by interfering with insect hormone-related genes via baculovirus-mediated RNAi.</p>
