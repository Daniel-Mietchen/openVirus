<p>To investigate the effect of the dsRNA insertion on virus infection and occlusion body (OB) formation, we transfected insect cells (HzAM1 cells), with HaBacΔegtdsJHAMT, HaBacΔegtdsJHBP, and HaBacΔegt (as a control). Since the 
 <italic>egt</italic> gene locus of HaBacΔegt was replaced by the 
 <italic>eGFP</italic> gene, green fluorescence should be observed in the infected cells. As expected, strong green fluorescence was observed under ultraviolet light in the HzAM1 cells at three days post-transfection (
