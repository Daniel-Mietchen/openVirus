<p>Furthermore, we extracted the total RNA of these infected cells and detected the transcription of dsRNA through reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). A 419-bp band of dsJHAMT-specific product was detectable in cells infected with HaBacΔegtdsJHAMT (

No signal was seen in the control (cells infected with HaBacΔegt). These results confirmed again that the recombinants were constructed correctly and dsRNA was able to transcript as expected after infecting.
