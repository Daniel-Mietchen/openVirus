<p>We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to detect the transcription level of RNAi target genes in 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae that were infected by feeding with OBs for two days. The results showed that the mRNA level of 
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic> was suppressed in larvae infected with vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT, in contrast to the control virus vHaBacΔegt (

 <italic>HaJHBP</italic> in larvae infected with vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP (
