<p>To analyze the biological activity of recombinant HearNPV, we cultivated budded viruses (BVs) in HzAM1 cells and purified sufficient viral occlusion bodies from 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae injected with BVs. Third instar 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae were infected orally with selected doses of OBs and monitored for mortality. The 50% lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT was 1.24 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> OBs/mL, which was just 15.3% of the control virus vHaBacΔegt value of 8.12 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> OBs/mL (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP (2.26 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> OBs/mL) was only 27.8% of the control value (
 <xref rid="ijms-20-00419-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Statistical analysis indicated that the difference in the tLC
 <sub>50</sub> value between vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT and vHaBacΔegt was significant (
 <italic>z</italic> = 4.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), as was the difference between vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP and vHaBacΔegt (
 <italic>z</italic> = 7.27, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
