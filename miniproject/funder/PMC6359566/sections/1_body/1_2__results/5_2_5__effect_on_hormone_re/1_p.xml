<p>To investigate the effect of recombinant HearNPVs on other hormone-related gene larvae, we detected mRNA levels of several key genes in orally infected 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae using qRT-PCR, including the JH receptor gene 
 <italic>HaMet</italic>, ultraspiracle (
 <italic>HaUSP</italic>), a potential candidate for the JH receptor, JH regulated gene RNA-binding protein (
 <italic>HaRBP</italic>), and ecdysone receptor gene 
 <italic>HaEcR</italic>. We found that transcription of 
 <italic>HaRBP</italic> and 
 <italic>HaUSP</italic> increased in vHaBacΔegtdsJHBP-infected larvae compared to the control (vHaBacΔegt-infected larvae), while 
 <italic>HaUSP</italic> expression was reduced in vHaBacΔegtdsJHAMT-infected larvae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, 
 <italic>HaEcR</italic> expression decreased in both recombinant HearNPV-infected larvae.
