<p>According to our previous report, transgenic cotton expressing dsRNA targeting 
 <italic>H. armigera</italic> JH acid methyltransferase gene (
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic>, GenBank accession number KX289532.1) or JH-binding protein gene (
 <italic>HaJHBP</italic>, GenBank accession number KX289533.1) showed resistance to cotton bollworm [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-20-00419" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this work, a 408 bp fragment of 
 <italic>HaJHAMT</italic> and a 483 bp fragment of 
 <italic>HaJHBP</italic> were used to compose hairpin RNAi constructs (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-00419">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref> for sequences). In order to obtain the recombinant baculovirus expressing dsRNA by the Bac-to-Bac system, the donor vectors, in which dsRNA expression was under the control of the 
 <italic>p10</italic> promoter and 
 <italic>op166</italic> promoter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-00419-f001">Figure 1</xref>), were constructed and transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B harboring HaBacHZ8Δegt and a helper plasmid. After site-specific transposition, we selected recombinant baculovirus plasmid (bacmids) based on white-blue screening, and further confirmed them by PCR. Validated bacmids were named HaBacΔegtdsJHAMT and HaBacΔegtdsJHBP.
