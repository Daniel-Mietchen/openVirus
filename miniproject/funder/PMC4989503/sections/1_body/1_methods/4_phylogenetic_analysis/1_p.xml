<p>To analyze the genetic characteristics of EV71 cases, the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> gene from EV71 isolates was examined by conventional RT-PCR. 
 <italic>VP1</italic> partial sequences for the EV71 isolates were compared with those of foreign strains. Multiple sequence alignments with the respective reference strain sequences were carried out using DNAstar Sequence Alignment Editor. MEGA software (version 4.0) was used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method (bootstrap resampling of 1000 replicates). Sequence data from both strands were aligned and edited using MEGA.
