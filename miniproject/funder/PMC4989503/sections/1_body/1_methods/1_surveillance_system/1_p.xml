<p>The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) National EV Surveillance System consists of 180 clinics managed by pediatric physicians (35 primary clinics, 105 secondary hospitals and 40 tertiary hospitals nationwide) and has monitored EV infections since 1993. Participating physicians collected specimens from patients whose illnesses included HFMD, herpangina, meningitis, encephalitis and sepsis, and documented patient age, date of specimen collection, symptoms and suspected diagnosis. Analysis of the specimens, including typing of relevant EV71 and phylogenetic analysis, was carried out at the National Polio Laboratory of KCDC.</p>
