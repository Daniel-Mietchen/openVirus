<p>Patient specimens were used for EV71 detection and molecular typing. Viral RNA was extracted using magnetic beads (GM-AUTOPREP Kit; Greenmate Co., Seoul, South Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the purified viral nucleic acid was processed by using Freedom EVO (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland). A highly conserved 5′ noncoding region was the target of a previously described 196-bp region [

 <italic>VP1</italic> using primers designed in a previously study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the ROK, cell culture and RT-PCR were used for identification of EV strains from 1993 to 2004; after 2005, detection of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> by RT-PCR was used to genotype EV as a routine detection method, and real-time RT-PCR detection of EV71 was used as the standard detection method since 2008, providing more rapid analysis [

 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences of EV71 have been deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers EU729114, EU729123, AY125972, HM443644, HM44366, HM443645-HM443662, KC162863-KC162883 and KT182938-KT182945.
