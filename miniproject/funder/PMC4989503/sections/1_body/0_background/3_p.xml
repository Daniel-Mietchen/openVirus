<p>From studies of EV71 infections, researchers have found that the central nervous system (CNS) is likely the target of the EV71 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Since 2008, outbreaks of EV71 infection associated with neurologic involvement, i.e., HFMD with CNS complications, have been reported in the Republic of Korea (ROK) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, EV71 has emerged as an important target for the upcoming era of poliomyelitis eradication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the ROK, sporadic cases of EV71 infection occurred in 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; however, death or severe effects of EV71 infection were not reported until 2006. Therefore, in this study, we first examined the epidemic and virologic characteristics of the EV71 endemic from 2007 to 2012 in the ROK. We analyzed the etiology of EV71-associated HFMD or herpangina and complications in ROK from 2007 to 2012 and aimed to identify EV71 strains using phylogenetic analysis.
