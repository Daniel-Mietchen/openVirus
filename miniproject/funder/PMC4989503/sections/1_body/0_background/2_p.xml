<p>EV71 was first described in 1974 after isolation from patients in California in 1969 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Strains of B5 subtype have caused outbreaks in Asian countries, including Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, since 1997 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Moreover, in the late 1990s, in the Asia-Pacific region frequent EV71-associated HFMD epidemics have occurred, with high incidences of severe neurologic complications and increased fatality rates [
