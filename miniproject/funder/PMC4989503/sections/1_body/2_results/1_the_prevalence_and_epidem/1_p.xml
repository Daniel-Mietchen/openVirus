<p>From 2007 to 2012, we collected specimens and clinical information from 9987 patients with suspected EV infections in the ROK. The annual outcomes of EV and EV71 from 2007 to 2012 are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A total of 3502 (35 %) patients were confirmed as EV positive by laboratory analyses. EV71 infection was confirmed 585 (16.7 %) of EV-positive patients (Table1). In the ROK, EV71 was detected for the first time in 2000 (12 cases), and no cases were confirmed from 2001 to 2005 (data not shown). In 2006, six cases were confirmed as EV71. Since 2009, EV71 has been confirmed at a frequency similar to those of other EV types (Table
