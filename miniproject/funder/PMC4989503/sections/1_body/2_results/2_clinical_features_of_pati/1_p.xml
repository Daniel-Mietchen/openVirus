<p>The classification for clinical manifestations of EV71-positive patients is described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. HFMD was the major clinical sign (
 <italic>n</italic> = 364, 62.2 %). We found that 198 cases exhibited HFMD only, while 166 (28.4 %) cases exhibited HFMD with CNS complications. The incidence of EV71infection of the CNS accompanied by HFMD was increased beginning in 2009 (no cases in 2008 and 26.0 % of patients in 2009). The other clinical symptoms were aseptic meningitis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 136, 23.2 %), encephalitis or meningoencephalitis without HFMD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 19, 3.2 %), myocarditis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, 0.3 %), and sepsis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 2.2 %). We also received reports of death (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5, 1.1 % among 435 cases during 2009–2011) associated with EV71 infection between 2009 and 2011 (two cases in 2009, two cases in 2010 and one case in 2011). Fatalities occurred due to neurological complications. In 2009, two deaths caused by EV71 infection occurred in female infants approximately 12 months of age who showed signs of encephalitis accompanied by HFMD. Additionally, in 2010, two male infants died of EV71 infection at 10 and 13 months of age. One patient showed signs of meningitis accompanied by HFMD, while other patients suffered from lung hemorrhage with HFMD in 2010. Another case of EV71 infection occurred in a 16-month-old infant with myocarditis and meningitis accompanied by HFMD in 2011.
