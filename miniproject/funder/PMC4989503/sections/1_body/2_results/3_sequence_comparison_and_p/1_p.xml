<p>EV71 genetic groups can be classified into three distinct clusters (A, B and C) with some temporal and regional subclustering [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on this classification, all of the isolates in the current study, with the exception of two strains (HM443644-2009 typed as C1 and HM443663-2009 typed as C5), belonged to subgenotype C4a (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These strains (i.e., C4a) are common in China, Japan and Vietnam [
