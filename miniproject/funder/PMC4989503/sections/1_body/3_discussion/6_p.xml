<p>One limitation of this study was that only a subset of 
 <italic>VP1</italic> sequences were used for phylogenetic studies. Another study found that the results of 
 <italic>VP1</italic>-based phylogenetic trees are not similar to those of complete genome-based analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Published data on EV epidemiology revealed that recombination between EV71 genotypes B or C and other types of coxsakieviruses occurred in Asian-Pacific countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For EV, genetic recombination has been reported to result in the emergence of viruses with altered pathogenic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Unfortunately, in this study, we were unable to examine the occurrence of homologous recombination. Further studies are needed to analyze EV71 dynamic mutations and genetic variation in the EV71 subtype through the analysis of full genome sequences.
