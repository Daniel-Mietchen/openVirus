<p>The clinical manifestations of EV71 infection were consistent with results from previous studies and showed that the majority of cases occurred in children less than 5Â years of age, as has been observed in other countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, infection with EV71 may become serious public health concern, particularly for children. Additionally, EV71 infections generally exhibit an increased incidence in summer and early autumn [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As expected in temperate climates, the present study revealed a seasonal pattern of distribution, with transmission peaking in the summer and decreasing in the period from autumn to spring. Few cases occurred during the winter.
