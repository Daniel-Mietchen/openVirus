<p>Based on phylogenetic analyses, the ROK isolates belonged to a cluster of the subtype C4a and showed high homology with isolates circulating in other countries. EV71 often occurs in a cyclical pattern, emerging every 2–3 years, in various countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, a C4 virus has been the predominant circulating strain in China since 1998, Taiwan since 2002 and Japan since 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, EV71 subtype C4 has become a predominant strain and has been continuously circulating and causing epidemics in neighboring countries and regions. Moreover, the C4a subtype of EV71 was dominantly identified in the ROK since 2009 and has been continuously monitored for more than 4 years. Previous studies have suggested that the EV71 cyclical pattern may arise according to the proportion of herd immunity among the susceptible population after a major outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].
