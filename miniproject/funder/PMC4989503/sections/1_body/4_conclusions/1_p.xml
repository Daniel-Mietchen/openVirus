<p>The present study indicated that EV71 was prevalent among EV-positive patients in the ROK during a recent 6-year period. Because of the impact of EV71 infection on public health, HFMD was designated as a nationally notifiable communicable disease in 2009, allowing for more comprehensive surveillance programs in the ROK. The surveillance reported in this study provides valuable data on the phylogenetic patterns and clinical manifestations associated with EV71 infection. Our findings also provide relevant information for future development of preventive vaccines and treatment plans. In addition, the information on EV71 infection reported in this study may provide important insights into the general outcomes of EV71 infection and associated acute neurologic disease.</p>
