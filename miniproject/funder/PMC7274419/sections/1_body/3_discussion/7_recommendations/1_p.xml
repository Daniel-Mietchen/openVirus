<p>Moving forward, literature suggesting that HIV and depression care should be combined in treatment and that providers should attend to the emotional and psychological needs of women need to be transferred to the perinatal population and expand beyond ART counseling [

Given that HIV-infected women often experience a double burden of physical and mental illness that is influenced by social support, stigmatization, and family dynamics, these interventions have the possibility of being expanded and adapted to women living with HIV. Specifically, the Friendship Bench, individual talking therapy based on problem-solving therapy delivered by a lay health worker, has been found to be effective in Zimbabwe among a general population suffering from depression, the majority of whom were living with HIV [

Importantly, the Friendship Bench and similar interventions draw on pre-existing structures of primary care and ART counseling services and train lay health workers, indicating that they are scalable given the high proportion of women living with HIV that also have PND. Additionally, they focus on counseling and providing social support, which is often a critically missing piece of women’s current experiences.
