<p>Second, the high interconnection of contributors to PND is supported in other qualitative work [

We add to this literature by finding this HIV diagnosis to be particularly burdensome when it is not expected and is diagnosed during routine ANC. Research from South Africa found that if women are living with HIV, women’s PND is worse because women are worried about having children to look after while living with HIV [

Based on our data, it is possible that women living with HIV and experiencing PND may, in particular, lack support from their partner.
