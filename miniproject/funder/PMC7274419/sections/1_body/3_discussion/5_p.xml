<p>Third, women’s stigma related to HIV and PND cut across all of their identities mentioned above [

A study in South Africa found that the relationship between stigma and HIV among HIV-positive women persists after controlling for marital status and pregnancy intention, indicating that it is a distinctly important component of women’s identities contributing to PND [

One study in South Africa found that psychological or emotional illnesses, including depression, hold an additional layer of stigma and increase stress and perceived stigma upon disclosure of status [
 <xref rid="pone.0227935.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Yet, this work was not specific to PND [
 <xref rid="pone.0227935.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While we found depression-related stigma to be present, we argue that there is unique stigma related to PND, as women were worried about being perceived as a bad mother due to their depression. Additionally, while the literature documents well how stigma affects depression, it is less well understood how ambivalence or a lack of support can be a contributing factor. Multiple women did not mention overt stigma, but indicated that ambivalence and a lack of support also contributed to their PND.
