<p>In our population, women with PND experienced a unique double burden of HIV and PND, which was commonly expressed as having pain in their hearts and as worry. Women’s HIV diagnosis, especially when it was unexpected and received during routine ANC, was a key contributor to their developing PND. Women’s unexpected diagnosis intersected with their pregnancy and marital relationships to contribute to their PND. These relationships were then influenced, positively or negatively, by women’s social interactions and relationships.</p>
