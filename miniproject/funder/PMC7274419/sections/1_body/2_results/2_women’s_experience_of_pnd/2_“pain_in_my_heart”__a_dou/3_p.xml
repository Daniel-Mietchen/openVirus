<p>Women also expressed that they could handle their PND more easily if it did not co-occur with HIV. As a woman’s HIV diagnosis was a key contributor to her developing PND, without this diagnosis, many women believed they would not have developed it or would have experienced a milder form. One woman stated that receiving an HIV diagnosis made her PND worse: “you get very depressed because you think of the problems you already have at home and then you have even more problems now. The depression increases” (postnatal, living with HIV over 2 years). Without an HIV diagnosis, PND was also perceived to have an endpoint whereas PND stemming from HIV was expected to be lifelong because the primary cause (i.e., their HIV status) was also lifelong.</p>
