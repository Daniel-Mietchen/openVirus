<p>Ruth was a pregnant participant who had received an HIV diagnosis during a past pregnancy over two years ago. When Ruth and others described how their PND presented itself in their lives, they often described their culmination of symptoms causing “pain in my heart.” When talking about her depression during her interview, Ruth said that her heart was troubled; her depression would not stop in her heart and was persisting because it had come from the combination of her HIV diagnosis, pregnancy, and marital issues. Other women used phrases referring to the heart. Women used this phrase of having pain in their hearts to describe how depression felt to them and how this feeling persisted in their heart throughout time, disrupting their lives and not allowing them to tend to other tasks. When a prenatal woman that had been diagnosed in her current pregnancy was asked if she knew about depression, she described her own experience as the following: “from the time I started my HIV treatment, I feel a lot of pain in my heart. It’s not like I am worried about anything, but I just feel so much pain in my heart, as if I have been shocked by something” (prenatal, living with HIV &lt;6 months). This pain persisted because she did not feel that she could confide in anyone about her HIV status and because her husband had abandoned her once she disclosed her diagnosis. A woman diagnosed with HIV within the last two years said that she kept feeling an overwhelming pain in her heart that kept her from working and that this pain stemmed from her overthinking and worry. This worry was about raising her children alone, as her husband had abandoned her after she became HIV-positive. Importantly, women explained that understanding how others felt in their heart and helping other women strengthen their heart were potential mechanisms for addressing PND.</p>
