<p>Here we present the experiences of women living with both HIV and PND in Malawi. We highlight the narrative of one respondent, ‘Ruth,’ alongside others’ stories to demonstrate how PND often manifests and how a woman’s HIV diagnosis is a key contributor to her development of PND. Ruth’s story represents a typical case, which helps provide insight into women’s PND experiences.</p>
