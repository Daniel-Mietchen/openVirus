<p>In addition to their marital issues, many women felt stigmatized and unsupported by others. One woman stated that “people who can encourage us to live a life with little depression are rare” (prenatal, living with HIV over 2 years). Both HIV and PND were emotionally charged topics in women’s communities and women often received mixed reactions from community members. Mixed or negative reactions largely stemmed from others not accepting women’s HIV diagnosis, meaning that they did not accept the women as their full selves with an HIV diagnosis. One woman directly linked HIV stigma to her development of depression: “I sometimes ask myself if [my community knows] about my HIV status and if that is the reason they treat me in the way they do. I then get depressed because I think too much” (postnatal, living with HIV over 2 years). Women feeling stigmatized by others often led to their overthinking, which was both a cause and symptom of PND.</p>
