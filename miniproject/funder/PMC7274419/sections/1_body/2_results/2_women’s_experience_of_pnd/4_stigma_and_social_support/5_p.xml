<p>Throughout women’s discussions of social support, they described social support as being composed of three components: interaction, encouragement, and offloading or sharing worries. Interaction was seen as a distraction for women to stop worrying about their HIV and PND. Encouragement was discussed as both needed by women and provided by them to others so that “[they] get strengthened in [their] heart” (prenatal, living with HIV over 2 years). Encouragement thus helped their depression and their worries. Offloading was identified as a critical component for preventing suicide. Some had not found anyone that they could share their worries with: “I have never met anyone whom I could share my worries with… sometimes I get depressed but can’t tell anyone” (postnatal, living with HIV over 2 years). Thus, women needed a combination of all three components of social support, as they all served different functions in alleviating PND.</p>
