<p>- Thank you for your comment. 24 women were recruited, requiring one site to have 4 women while the remaining sites recruited 5. This has been added to the manuscript (page 4, lines 94-95). Our goal in qualitative interviews was to reach saturation, where new data are redundant with data already collected.7 Given the rule of thumb of 5-10 in-depth interviews per stratum (pre- and post-natal), we expected that we would achieve saturation within our proposed sample size. This has also been added to the manuscript (page 4, lines 128-129). We hope that this change clarifies the second part of your statement, as we are not sure what the statisticial tests are that you are referencing.</p>
