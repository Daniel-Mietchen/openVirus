<p>- Thank you for your comment. As you said, and as stated in the manuscript, we know that perinatal depression affects many women in low and middle-income countries and we know that adults living with HIV are at an increased risk for depression. However, very little is known about perinatal depression among women living with HIV. Indeed, what we do know is quantitative and/or is not specific to only women living with HIV (added to page 3 line 77).1,2 Thus, there is a need to develop a richer, qualitative understanding of PND specifically among HIV-positive women. Additionally, mental illness and its stigma is conceptualized differently in different settings, further indicating the need to deeply explore its intersection with HIV in various settings.3 </p>
