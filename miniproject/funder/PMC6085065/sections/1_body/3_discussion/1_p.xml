<p>This work presents a large number of newly-acquired coding-complete CHIKV sequences collected from patients in the United States and Nicaragua during the 2014–2015 Caribbean and Latin American epidemic. The new data significantly increase the number of publicly-available CHIKV sequences, especially of the Asian genotype, and consequently allowed a comprehensive study of the evolution and genetic diversity of the CHIKV Asian genotype in the Americas. We reconstructed the epidemic history of the Asian genotype and estimated the mean evolutionary rate as 4.33E-4 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD: 3.54E-4–5.15E-4 substitutions/site/year). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed considerable genetic diversity and phylogeographic clustering within the CO clade and described different epidemiological dynamics of CHIKV in the Americas. Specifically, the Nicaragua epidemic was characterized by several introductions and rapid local spread of the virus, while the Florida epidemic was characterized by multiple introductions but limited autochthonous transmission. Arbovirus transmission by Aedes sp. mosquitoes in Florida has been well documented [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We also identified the significant amino acid substitutions within the entire Asian genotype as well as within the CO clade. Additionally, our deep sequencing minor variants analysis investigated intra-host diversity of CHIKV strains in the CO clade, especially regarding the nonsynonymous codons identified previously by phylogenetic reconstructions. Finally, we found significant phylogenetic clustering according to the presence of dehydration and myalgia (separately) in the Nicaraguan sequences.
