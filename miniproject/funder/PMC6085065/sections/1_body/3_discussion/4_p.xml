<p>The large sampling of sequences from Nicaragua and Florida in this study allowed us to investigate the epidemiological dynamics of the CHIKV Asian genotype in these two regions during the 2014–2015 epidemic. Different strains of the viruses were introduced to the Americas, including Nicaragua, and were the cause of most of the outbreaks in different regions. However, although there were multiple introductions of the virus in Florida, there was limited autochthonous transmission of CHIKV during the 2014–2015 Caribbean/Americas epidemic. Florida has a large population of residents that travel to countries with ongoing transmission and a high number of visitors that were prior residents of these countries. A few possible reasons for the lack of sustained transmission in Florida could exist. First, the climate of Florida and the mosquito vector population may not be optimal to create the same environment as in other countries in the Caribbean to sustain transmission for a long period of time. Second, the U.S. and Florida have better arbovirus surveillance systems, prevention methods (for example, home window screens, air conditioning, regular garbage collection services, use of repellent, promotion of dumping standing water around the home, and promotion of covering mosquito breeding sites such as boats, etc.), and mosquito control (through the use of larvicide and adulticide). These factors likely contribute to the lack of ongoing CHIKV transmission in Florida so far.</p>
