<p>In addition, deep sequencing analysis, which was previously performed by Stapleford 
 <italic>et al</italic>. on a collection of CHIKV strains, identified a large number of minor variants that met the established criteria of having a significant p-value and being present in at least 20 percent of reads for a given position [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, when we compared the positions on our list to those reported in the previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], we found five positions that matched previous results. Specifically, codons 134 in nsp1, 613 in nsp2, and 116, 345, and 441 in nsp4 overlapped between our study and the prior publication. This finding provides independent verification of quasispecies circulating during the Caribbean outbreak that contained these minor variants, and may indicate convergent evolution among these viruses as they follow a similar, yet independent, evolutionary “path”. Additional laboratory work is needed to determine whether the circulating quasispecies that include minor variants modulate viral replication, host-pathogen interactions, or overall fitness and whether genetic influences, such as covariation, play a role in their dominance.
