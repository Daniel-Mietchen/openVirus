<p>Next, we investigated the significant amino acid substitutions in the Asian genotype phylogenies and discovered two CO-clade-specific amino acid substitutions, V3167A (E2 V368A) and L3242M (6K L20M), and other amino acid changes within CO clade. A recent comparison of the nonsynonymous amino acid changes that differentiate American and Asian genotype strains also identified these two sites [

The amino acid differences that we identified as being significantly different between Asian pre-CO and Asian CO sequences are of interest and could merit additional experimentation to determine whether they are accompanied by a change in phenotype. While we expect that a subset of these positions are consistent among intra-clade strains due to the evolutionary relatedness of these strains, we also expect a small number of these positions to confer some evolutionary advantage, which would explain their persistence in the virus population. Although high specificity of clade-specific residues was not observed at all significantly different positions, such comparisons may identify regions of viral proteins where amino acid changes are tolerated and may play a role in viral replication, fitness, host interaction, or the immune response.
