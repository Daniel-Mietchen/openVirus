<p>Additional CHIKV sequence data are critical to understand the genetic diversity of the virus and to successfully monitor the epidemic potential of CHIKV in the Americas. Similarly, metadata describing the virus isolation, patient characteristics, and clinical information are also useful in efforts to identify how viral evolution may contribute to changes in transmission, virulence, and/or disease severity. An example that illustrates this point comes from previous CHIKV studies of the 2005â€“2006 outbreak in La Reunion, which identified a single mutation in the E1 glycoprotein (A226V of the ECSA genotype) [
