<p>The location of the two clade-specific variations on the E1-E2 three-dimensional protein structure also provides additional knowledge. The region surrounding threonine 155 is not likely exposed to the host immune system since it is buried in the tertiary and quaternary protein structure and is not present in or near any reported B cell epitopes from the Immune Epitope Database (
