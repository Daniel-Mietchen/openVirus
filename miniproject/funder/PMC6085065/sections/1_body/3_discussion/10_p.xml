<p>In summary, our study reported a large number of CHIKV complete genome sequences collected from multiple regions in the Americas and revealed the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of the CHIKV Asian genotype (particularly the CO clade) during the recent CHIKV Caribbean/Latin American epidemic. These results provide additional insight into the evolution of CHIKV during a geographically-diverse epidemic and may have important implications for the control and prevention of other mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas, such as Zika, dengue, and West Nile viruses.</p>
