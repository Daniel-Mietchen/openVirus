<p>Based on the tree topology, we hypothesized that samples from particular geographic areas within Nicaragua could be enriched in virus strains assigned to different phylogenetic subclades. To test this hypothesis, we applied a hypergeometric statistical test. While the majority of the sequenced isolates were collected in Managua, statistically significant results were observed for CO1.1 strains in Masaya (3/3 virus samples in this subclade and location; p-value 0.041), and subclade CO1.4 in 2 separate locations including Managua (5/8 virus samples in this subclade; p-value = 0.047) and Nueva Segovia (2/8 virus samples in this subclade; p-value = 0.014).</p>
