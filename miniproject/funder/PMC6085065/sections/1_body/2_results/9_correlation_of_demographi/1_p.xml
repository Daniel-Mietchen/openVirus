<p>Clinical symptoms, disease severity, and related metadata fields were collected as part of the Nicaraguan study. Specifically, host demographic information was available for all 108 Nicaraguan samples, and clinical information was available for 95 of these samples. We performed two phylogeny-trait association statistics (AI and PS) to identify whether Nicaraguan CHIKV strains might exhibit some phylogenetic clustering by host demographics and/or disease severity (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We found no significant association of age distribution and sex ratio with viral genetic variation (i.e., phylogenetic topology) in Nicaraguan strains. Hence, phylogenetic clustering by age and sex was not greater than that expected by chance alone. However, the analysis revealed significant phylogenetic clustering of Nicaraguan strains by the presence of dehydration and myalgia separately, based on both clustering statistics, AI and PS (p-value â‰¤ 0.004) (
