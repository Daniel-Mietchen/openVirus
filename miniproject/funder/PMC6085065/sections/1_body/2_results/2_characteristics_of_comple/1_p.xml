<p>In order to maximize the reliability of downstream phylogenetic analyses, our first step was to identify and remove any sequences that displayed evidence of recombination. RDP results suggested that one of 456 coding sequences, CHIKV_STMWG02, displayed evidence of potential recombination and was consequently excluded from further phylogenetic analysis. The CHIKV genome was highly conserved across all samples, with an average nucleotide similarity of 96.20% and an average amino acid similarity of 98.24%. Nonstructural genes (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, and NSP4) showed similar levels of heterogeneity as structural genes (Capsid, E3, E2, 6K, and E1), with the average nucleotide similarity ranging from 95.66% (NSP3) to 96.74% (NSP2), and the average amino acid similarity ranging from 95.51% (6K) to 99.18% (NSP2). NSP2 was the most conserved gene across the genome as a whole. We then wanted to gain a better understanding of the role that selection pressure played in the sequence diversity within this collection. As such, we investigated the aligned sequences for individual amino acid sites under diversifying selection (positive selection) by three methods (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and Methods</xref>), using a significance level of p&lt;0.05. Nonstructural protein NSP1 site 148 was identified as being under diversifying selection by all three methods, whereas no codons in the structural polyprotein were detected to be under diversifying selection by more than one method.
