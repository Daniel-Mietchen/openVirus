<p>We subsequently visualized the amino acid differences identified by Meta-CATS that were located in the structural E1 and E2 proteins onto an existing three-dimensional protein structure (3J2W) to better understand the contribution of the significant amino acid variation that was observed. This structure includes substantial regions of the E1 and E2 proteins that have been co-crystallized in a conformation that has been modeled into a complete virion structure. We focused specifically on the residues that differed in the E1 and E2 regions, since in general they have a higher likelihood of affecting the host B-cell immune response and entry into target cells. While residues 368 and 371 in the E2 protein were found to significantly differ between the CO and previously existing Asian strains, these residues were not resolved in the available crystal structure [
