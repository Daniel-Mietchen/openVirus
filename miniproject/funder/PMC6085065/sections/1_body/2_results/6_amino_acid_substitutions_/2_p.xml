<p>Significant amino acid substitutions suggested by the Meta-CATS analysis for BMCMC phylogeny were consistent with those suggested by the maximum likelihood phylogeny (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We identified 2 positions that showed strict residue separation between the CO clades, based on the consensus sequence. Aligned position 1381 in the nonstructural polyprotein, corresponding to amino acid position 48 in the NSP3 mature peptide, consists solely of serine residues in the CO1 and CO2.2 clades; however, this serine is replaced by a cysteine residue in all 13 strains belonging to clade CO2.1. Similarly, at aligned position 3438 in the structural polyprotein, located at position 155 of the E1 mature protein, only threonine residues are observed in clades CO1 and CO2.1, whereas CO2.2 strains code exclusively for an isoleucine. In addition, significant variation was detected at nonstructural polyprotein positions 1157, 1720, 1827, and 2452 of CO1.4 strains when compared to CO1.1, CO1.6, and CO1.7. Specifically, 3 of 9 residues differ in the CO1.4 strains when compared to the other 3 clades. Interestingly, these 3 strains (NIC.7101, NIC.1497, and NIC.1835) were all isolated from Nicaragua in 2015 and belong to a sub-clade of CO1.4 (
