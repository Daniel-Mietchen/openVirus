<p>Amino acid substitutions that have become fixed into the evolutionary history of the CHIKV Asian genotype were mapped to the branches of maximum likelihood phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The CO clade is characterized by amino acid substitutions V3167A and L3242M (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g004">Fig 4</xref>, internal branch 5), relative to the recent Asian strains (after the year 2000), which have all the amino acid changes on internal branches 1 to 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Additional amino acid substitutions for small monophyletic groups within the CO clade were also mapped to the maximum likelihood tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Given that the topology of the BMCMC phylogeny showed subclades and monophyletic groups within the CO clade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we performed statistical comparisons of the amino acid residues that significantly differed between these subclades and monophyletic groups using Meta-CATS. Specifically, we compared sequences belonging to CO1 vs. CO2, CO2.1 vs. CO2.2, and CO1.1 vs. CO1.4 vs. CO1.6 vs. CO1.7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Clades CO1.2, CO1.3, and CO1.5 were excluded from these statistical comparisons because of insufficient numbers of sequences. We then compared the results from the maximum likelihood phylogeny to those from the BMCMC phylogeny.
