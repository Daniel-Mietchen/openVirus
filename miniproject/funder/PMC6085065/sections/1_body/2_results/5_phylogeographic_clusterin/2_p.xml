<p>Almost all Nicaraguan strains fall into the CO1 subclade, with the exception of a monophyletic group of five sequences in the CO3 subclade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left lower panel), and Nicaraguan strains in the CO1 clade clustered with strains from other countries in Central America (e.g., El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, highlighted with red concentric circles in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>, right panel). The rest of the CO1 strains are from countries in the Caribbean Greater Antilles (Puerto Rico, Haiti, and Jamaica), Caribbean Lesser Antilles (Trinidad and Tobago), and North America (Florida and Mexico), indicating the viral movements between the Caribbean and North America. Although Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic within the Caribbean Greater Antilles were the most common sources of the origin of infection for sequences belonging to the CO2 subclade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left upper panel), limited strains were isolated from Caribbean Lesser Antilles (US Virgin Islands), Central America (Honduras and Panama), South America (Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil), and North America (Florida). The rest of the non-CO1/CO2 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left lower panel) have more diverse origins than the CO1 and CO2 sequences with representative sequences from North America (Mexico), South America (Guyana, Brazil, Colombia), Caribbean Greater Antilles (Puerto Rico, Jamaica), Caribbean Lesser Antilles (Trinidad and Tobago, US Virgin Islands, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Lucia, Martinique, British Virgin Islands), and Central America (Nicaragua). Overall, our phylogeographic analysis across multiple collections suggests numerous international transmission events.
