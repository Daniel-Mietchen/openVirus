<p>We next wanted to determine how the topology of the phylogenetic tree consisting of sequences collected during the Caribbean/Americas epidemic (CO clade) was influenced by the geographical location of the patient. The availability of recent travel history for each patient in the majority of the newly-generated sequences from the United States enabled us to trace the origin of the infection. To determine the phylogeographic structure of the CHIKV CO clade, we performed phylogeny-trait association (BaTS) tests on the phylogenies of the CO clade alone. This analysis revealed significant phylogenetic clustering by geographical location (p-values for AI and PS &lt; 0.001), suggesting stronger spatial clustering of the virus by either sampling country or country of recent travel than expected by chance alone. To enable a more in-depth view of how geographical location of isolation correlated with tree topology, the CO clade from the Bayesian MCC tree of Asian genotype sequences was annotated with the country of origin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The branches of the tree were colored based on the regions where the samples were isolated, while the ovals represent the probable origins of infections. In general, strains isolated from the same place tended to cluster together (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>) show the local transmission of CHIKV in Florida.
