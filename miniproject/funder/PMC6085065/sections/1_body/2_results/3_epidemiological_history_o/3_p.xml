<p>Our analysis suggests that the Asian genotype has circulated in mainland southeast Asia since the 1950s and then migrated to the surrounding islands around 1980 (state probabilities over 0.9, marked by asterisks in

These viruses continued to spread across the Pacific (state probabilities over 0.5 but less than 0.9) and Caribbean islands (state probabilities over 0.9, marked by asterisks) from 2008–2009 prior to causing the epidemic in the Western hemisphere in 2014–2015. Since 2013, CHIKV continued to spread from the Caribbean islands to Florida in North America; Brazil, Colombia, and Guyana in South America; as well as Nicaragua and other Central American nations (
