<p>To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between our collection of CHIKV sequences and those that had previously been generated, we constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all available sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This global CHIKV phylogeny revealed the presence of the three major genotypes of CHIKV West African, ECSA, and Asian genotypes that have spread around the globe, consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The recent Indian Ocean outbreak (IO) and Caribbean outbreak (CO) form monophyletic clades that are descendants of the ECSA and Asian genotypes, respectively. Our newly-sequenced strains collected from patients in Nicaragua, Florida (with recent travel history to the Caribbean), and New York after 2014 (also with recent travel history to the Caribbean) fell into the CO clade. Four historical strains collected from New York during 2006â€“2008 (with recent travel history to India, La Reunion, and Sri Lanka) fell into the IO clade, while one strain collected from a patient in New York in 1995 (with travel history to Central Africa Republic) belongs to the ECSA genotype but not the IO clade (
