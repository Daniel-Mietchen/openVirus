<p>With an average sequencing depth of at least 250X across all three CHIKV collections, we re-examined the read information to identify minor variants that were present as intra-host quasispecies within each clinical sample. Deep sequencing analysis of the nonstructural polyprotein region identified 250 minor variants that met our filtering criteria in strains belonging to at least one of the three collections and 56 minor variants that were observed across strains belonging to 2 or more collections. In the structural polyprotein, there were 156 minor variants present in strains belonging to at least one collection, with 30 of these variants detected across at least 2 collections (
