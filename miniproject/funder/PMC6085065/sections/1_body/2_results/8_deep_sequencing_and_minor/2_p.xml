<p>We identified 20 codons in the nonstructural polyprotein that contained statistically significant minor variation across all three virus collections including: 25, 26, 29, 30, 158, 163, 164, 235, 320, 376, 377, 1059, 1060, 1234, 1358, 1853, 1976, 2173, 2204, and 2293. Codon numbering was used to facilitate cross-referencing between minor variants that affect amino acid sequence and other analyses. To determine whether any of the detected minor variants were present within nonsynonymous codons identified by Meta-CATS as significantly differing between subclades, we cross-referenced the 2 sets of results. Codon 1381 in the nonstructural polyprotein had detectable minor variation only within the New York collection. Interestingly, the consensus sequence in this codon codes for serine in members of the CO1 subclade but codes for either serine or cysteine in the CO2 subclade, with minor variants coding for either amino acid being detected. Similarly, 12 codons in the structural polyprotein were found to have minor variants across all three collections at positions: 20, 22, 24, 510, 511, 769, 805, 810, 889, 944, 948, and 1135. These findings suggest that dominant variants have emerged within the viral genome while genetic diversity is still being maintained at the population level as quasispecies that contain multiple minor variants.</p>
