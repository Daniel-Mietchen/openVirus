<p>With the rapid explosion of strains that contributed to the Caribbean/Americas epidemic, we did not observe significant subclades within the CO clade in the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. However, we observed considerable genetic diversity in the BMCMC phylogenetic tree, which enabled the separation of two large subclades (CO1 and CO2, BPP&gt;0.9, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>), a few small subclades (CO3-CO6, BPP&gt;0.9, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and some monophyletic groups within the CO1 and CO2 subclades (CO1.1-CO1.12 and CO2.1-CO2.3, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Sequences from Nicaragua and Florida showed different epidemiological dynamics. Nicaraguan sequences tended to cluster together in the upper portion of the CO clade but did not form a single subclade. The exception was a small group of Nicaraguan sequences (marked by the red pound sign in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g002">Fig 2</xref>) that were phylogenetically distinct from the other Nicaraguan sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This suggests several introductions and rapid local spread of the viruses in Nicaragua during the 2014â€“2015 epidemic. In contrast, the CHIKV epidemic in Florida was characterized by multiple introductions of the viruses from travelers (imported cases) but very limited autochthonous transmission. Sequences from Florida are located in the lower portion of the CO clade and did not form a single subclade either. With the travel information that was available, the Florida sequences were found to be phylogenetically proximal to the sequences from the regions in Caribbean to which the cases reported travel (see the following section, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006670.g003">Fig 3</xref>).
