<p>Host demographic information was available for all Nicaraguan samples, and clinical information was available for 95 of 108 of the Nicaraguan samples. To determine whether there was phylogenetic clustering by age or sex of the patient, virus sequences were grouped into 4 classes according to host age (&lt;5 years, 5–10 years, 11–18 years, and &gt;18 years old) or into 2 classes by sex respectively. Similarly, each patient was classified as either positive or negative for each clinical symptom individually. The clinical symptoms analyzed included history of: dehydration, headache, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, rash, abdominal pain, and retro-orbital pain. The strength of association between the phenotypic features described above and the CHIKV phylogeny was determined using two phylogeny-trait association statistics, the parsimony score (PS) and the association index (AI) tests, both of which were implemented in the Bayesian tip association significance testing (BaTS) program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A significance cutoff level of p&lt;0.05 was used in both statistics. A null distribution of these statistics was determined using the posterior distribution of Nicaragua-only phylogenetic trees obtained from the BEAST package described above.
