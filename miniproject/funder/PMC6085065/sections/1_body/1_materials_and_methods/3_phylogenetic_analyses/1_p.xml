<p>We combined the newly-determined 185 complete CHIKV genome sequences together with 271 CHIKV genome sequences available in GenBank (

We excluded vaccine strains, synthetic recombinant strains, and other non-wildtype sequences. Because of the large number of insertion/deletion regions in the UTRs, these regions were excluded from the phylogenetic analyses (456_CDS). Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program in MEGA 6.0 with manual adjustment [

 <sup>−4</sup> in at least two methods were reported as evidence of recombination, and the one predicted recombinant strain (KJ679578) was removed from further phylogenetic analyses. Nucleotide and amino acid similarities across complete CDS and in each gene were also calculated. The individual amino acid sites under diversifying selection were detected by three different codon-based maximum likelihood methods: single most likely ancestral reconstruction (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL), and IFEL (similar to FEL, but selection is only tested for along internal branches of the phylogeny) using the Datamonkey webserver (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A significance cutoff of p&lt;0.05 was used for all methods.
