<p>Due to the long branches of three genotypes (historical West African, ECSA, and Asian) suggested by our previous ML phylogeny and the very limited number of sequences in the West African genotype (n = 11), the phylogenetic trees of the ECSA and Asian genotypes were separately reconstructed using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) method available in the BEAST V1.8.2 package (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Two sequences from the ECSA genotype, STMWG01/2011 and Angola/m2022/1962, were excluded from the BEAST analysis because of potential laboratory contamination or mutations that occurred during passaging [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Maximum likelihood phylogenies for the ECSA dataset and Asian dataset were also constructed using the methods described above and rooted by the oldest sequence in the dataset. To incorporate temporal information, each sequence in both datasets was assigned a date of origin that corresponded to the time of collection. To better estimate the spatial diffusion of the viruses, sequences were grouped by the different regions where they were collected. For 442 (out of 456) sequences with detailed travel history information, we assigned the regions based on the country of origin (

In the discrete phylogeographic analyses, the GTR+Î“+I substitution model selected by Modeltest in MEGA 6.0 was used under a relaxed molecular clock (uncorrelated lognormal, UCLN). The demographic model, Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) Bayesian skyride coalescent tree prior was employed in the BEAST runs. In each BEAST run, to ensure convergence of effective sampling size parameters (ESS) over 200, a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for 500 million generations, and a 10% burn-in was removed. The results were assessed using the Tracer program v1.6.0 (

The posterior distribution of BMCMC trees was summarized as the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree and generated using TreeAnnotator v1.8.2 (available in BEAST v1.8.2 package), with the first 10% of trees removed as burn-in. MCC trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.3 (
