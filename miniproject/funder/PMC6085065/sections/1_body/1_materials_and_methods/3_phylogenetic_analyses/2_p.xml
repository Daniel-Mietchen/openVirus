<p>A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of complete coding sequences of CHIKV was inferred in MEGA 6.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A general time reversal (GTR) nucleotide substitution model with a gamma distribution of among-site rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+Î“+I) was selected as the best-fit model by Modeltest in MEGA 6.0 and used in the tree inference. The robustness of the ML tree was assessed by bootstrap analyses of 1000 pseudo-replicates, and the phylogenetic tree was midpoint rooted.
