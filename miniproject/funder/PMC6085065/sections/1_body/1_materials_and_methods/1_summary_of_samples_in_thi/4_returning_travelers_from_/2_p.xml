<p>Each collection used distinct protocols to isolate viral genetic material for sequencing. NYSDOH: Vero cell cultures were inoculated with CHIKV-positive sera, then total RNA was extracted from supernatants using MagMax Total Viral Isolation kit and shipped to the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). BPHL: Sera from positive CHIKV cases either underwent RNA extraction directly from the original serum or from cell culture inoculation prior to shipment. Nicaragua: Total RNA from CHIKV-positive sera or first-passage isolates in C6/36 cells was extracted using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and shipped to JCVI.</p>
