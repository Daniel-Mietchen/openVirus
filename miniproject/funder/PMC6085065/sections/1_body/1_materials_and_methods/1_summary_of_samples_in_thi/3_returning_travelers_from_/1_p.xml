<p>In 2014, Florida experienced a large increase in cases of chikungunya in travelers returning primarily from the Caribbean. The Florida Bureau of Public Health Laboratories (BPHL) confirmed 122 of these imported cases and all 12 locally transmitted cases from May 2014 to December 2014. Archived samples from a subset of these cases were used in this study. Here, a total of 67 complete genomes were sequenced and included in the current analysis, from travelers returning from the Caribbean and several cases of autochthonous transmission in Florida.</p>
