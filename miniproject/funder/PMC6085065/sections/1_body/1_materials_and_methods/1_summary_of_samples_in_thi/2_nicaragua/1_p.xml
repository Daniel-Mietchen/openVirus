<p>To study the introduction and clinical spectrum of CHIKV in Nicaraguan children, two studies of chikungunya were established as extensions of an existing NIH-funded hospital-based study of dengue and an ongoing community-based cohort study of dengue and influenza, which are conducted in close collaboration with the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health. Samples for sequencing were collected during the first and second waves of the epidemic in 2014–15 and 2015–16, respectively. In addition, samples collected from a chikungunya household transmission study that enrolled children and adults were included. Finally, samples from the Ministry of Health National Surveillance System were also included in the collection [
