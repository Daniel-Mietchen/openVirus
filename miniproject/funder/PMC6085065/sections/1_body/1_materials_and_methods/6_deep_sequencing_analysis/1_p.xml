<p>Deep sequencing analysis was performed on all sequences to identify the minor variants in the sequence population. This involved generating a consensus sequence from all sequence reads for each sample using the CLC mapping assembly program 
 <italic>(clc_ref_assemble_long)</italic> and then mapping all high-quality trimmed reads sequenced from the sample against its own consensus sequence. The annotated consensus was used to provide biological context and to determine whether the minor variation resulted in a synonymous or a nonsynonymous change, and whether any nonsynonymous changes were categorized as either conservative or non-conservative. To find statistically-significant variations in the population, all forward and reverse reads covering each position were checked and a statistical model using a binomial distribution was generated to ensure that coverage at each base position was above a specific threshold (3%) with a 95% confidence interval, followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple-hypothesis testing. Positions where insufficient coverage existed to provide 95% confidence of a minor allele resulted in the position not being reported in the output. The significant variations existing in the sequencing reads were then included in an automated report against the consensus sequence of the same strain to obtain the percentage of minor alleles in the population.
