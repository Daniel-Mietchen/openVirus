<p>After sequencing, barcoded reads from each sample were deconvoluted and trimmed to eliminate low-quality regions, SISPA hexamer primers and barcode sequences. Trimmed reads were subjected to 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly with the 
 <italic>clc_novo_assemble</italic> program in the CLC Bio software suite. The resulting contigs were queried against a custom full-length CHIKV reference database to determine the closest reference. Sequences were then mapped to the selected reference for each sample using the 
 <italic>clc_ref_assemble_long</italic> program in the CLC Bio suite. A final mapping of all next-generation sequences to the updated reference sequences was performed with CLC Bioâ€™s 
 <italic>clc_ref_assemble_long</italic> program. When sufficient read data were available, reference sequences were extended to capture as much of the untranslated regions (UTRs) as possible. Assemblies were manually validated and curated prior to annotation with VIGOR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. VIGOR was used to predict genes and detect any potential sequencing errors. The annotation was subjected to manual inspection and quality control before submission to GenBank. All sequences generated as part of this study were submitted to GenBank as part of Bioproject PRJNA294670.
