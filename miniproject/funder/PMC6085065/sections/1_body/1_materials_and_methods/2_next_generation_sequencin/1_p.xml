<p>Viral RNA, which was shipped to the JCVI from each of the participating institutions, was subjected to sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006670.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In cases where sequence-independent amplification failed, a sequence-specific overlapping primer amplification strategy was used to generate the entire genome of CHIKV. The primer sequences used to amplify the required regions in each sample are reported in the respective GenBank sequence records. Barcoded libraries were pooled and adaptors were ligated following the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq (2x300 bp Paired End (PE)) instrument.
