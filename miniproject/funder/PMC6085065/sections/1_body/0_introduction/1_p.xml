<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and is an arthropod-borne virus spread by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. CHIKV has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that is 11.8 kb in length and encodes both a nonstructural and a structural polyprotein that are separated by a subgenomic promoter. Although CHIKV causes an acute febrile illness with clinical manifestations similar to other co-circulating mosquito-borne viral diseases, such as dengue, CHIKV infection may be followed by months or years of sequelae including rheumatic disease and debilitating joint pain [
