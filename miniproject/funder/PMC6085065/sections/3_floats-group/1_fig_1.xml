  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of complete coding nucleotide sequences of CHIKV.</title>
  <p>Well-supported nodes by bootstrap values over 70% are marked in the tree. Three genotypes (West African, ECSA, and Asian) and clades (Indian Ocean and Caribbean outbreaks) are described in the trees. New sequences sampled from the Americas are colored in red. The phylogenetic tree is midpoint-rooted, and the scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Arrows indicate known recent travel of the human hosts to Africa or Asia in the ECSA genotype.</p>
