  <title>Maximum likelihood tree of CHIKV Asian genotype.</title>
  <p>The major nodes with bootstrap values above 70% are indicated. The CO clade, supported by bootstrap value 96.6%, is colored in red. Amino acid substitutions that contribute to clade diversity are mapped to the branches of the tree. CO-clade-specific amino acid substitutions are marked in red. Monophyletic groups within CO clade and associated amino acid changes are marked in blue. The scale bar represents genetic distance.</p>
