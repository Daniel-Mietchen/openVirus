<p>One important aspect of our results is that we evaluated the epidemiological significance of the observed variation in transmission kinetics among DENV isolates. We used mathematical modeling to incorporate variation in the dynamics of DENV transmission by mosquitoes into a relevant epidemiological framework. We implemented an agent-based model that included stochasticity for different parameters, such as the daily survival rate of mosquitoes and the probability of human-mosquito contact. Importantly, our model considered intra-host infection dynamics, both in humans and mosquitoes. Consistent with results from deterministic Ross-MacDonald models of vector-borne pathogen transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], our simulations indicated that EIP duration was the most influential factor underlying DENV transmission dynamics. In particular, EIP duration had a stronger influence than the maximum proportion of infectious mosquitoes on both the probability and the size of dengue outbreaks. We emphasize that these differences in transmission dynamics depend on the validity of our modeling assumptions. For instance, there could be other differences between DENV strains, such as human viral dynamics, that could counteract or modulate the effects observed in our model.
