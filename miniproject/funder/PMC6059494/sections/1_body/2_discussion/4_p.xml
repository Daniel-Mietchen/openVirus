<p>Despite the evidence for genetic variation among virus variants, we did not detect any association between viral nucleotide polymorphisms and the parameters describing the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection. There was no consistent association between kinetics and DENV genotypes. For example, a 2012 isolate from Thailand belonging to genotype I displayed the longest lag time and a slow-disseminating profile. This isolate was phylogenetically closest to a 2012 isolate from Laos within genotype I, which displayed a fast-disseminating profile. Small nucleotide differences in the genome sequence can disproportionately affect DENV replication by modifying the secondary structure of the viral RNA molecule [

However, the most likely explanation for the lack of genotype-phenotype association is that our study was underpowered for a genetic association analysis due to the small number of isolates examined.
