<p>In conclusion, this study illustrated the power of combining empirical data obtained from experiments 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> with epidemiological modeling to unravel the determinants of vector-borne pathogen transmission dynamics. DENV transmission dynamics are characterized by heterogeneities resulting from individual, temporal and spatial variabilities that are often difficult to identify [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. We have shown that variability in mosquito infection dynamics exists among arbovirus strains and is epidemiologically meaningful. Such quantitative dissection of transmission dynamics contributes to improve our understanding of heterogeneities in arbovirus epidemiology.
