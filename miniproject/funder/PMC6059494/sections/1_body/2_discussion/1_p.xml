<p>Building on earlier studies that showed EIP variation between DENV genotypes [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we have demonstrated that viral genetic variation in the kinetics of mosquito infection may contribute to heterogeneity in DENV transmission dynamics. Such temporal variation in the transmission process has generally been ignored in models of mosquito-borne pathogen epidemiology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with the exception of temperature-dependent models [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We experimentally compared field-derived DENV isolates representing the worldwide genetic diversity of recently circulating strains. We found significant variation in the dynamics of systemic infection of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> among the DENV isolates, which was poorly predicted by midgut infection patterns. Using large-scale simulations with a stochastic agent-based model, we illustrated how the empirical variation in systemic infection dynamics may translate into sizeable differences in epidemiological outcome (risk and magnitude of dengue outbreak in the human population).
