<p>To quantitatively compare the kinetics of systemic infection among DENV isolates, we fitted a global likelihood model based on the 3-parameter logistic function to the empirical data for all combinations of permutations of isolates (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Materials and Methods</xref>). Based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, we identified four groups of isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). The first group had slow systemic infection dynamics and included three DENV isolates (Gabon2012, NCal2013, Thai2012) with a relatively low saturation level, small slope factor and long lag time. The second group had fast systemic infection dynamics and included three DENV isolates (Thai2010b, Thai2013, Thai2010a) with a higher saturation level, larger slope factor and shorter lag time. The last two groups consisted of one DENV isolate each (Laos2012 and Haiti2012) that had unique combinations of parameters (

A hierarchical clustering analysis performed on the affinity matrix derived from AIC scores of all combinations of isolates revealed that isolate Laos2012 branched with the fast-disseminating infection group whereas isolate Haiti2012 branched with the slow-disseminating infection group (
