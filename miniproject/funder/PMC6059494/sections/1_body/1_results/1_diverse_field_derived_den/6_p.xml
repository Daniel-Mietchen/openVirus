<p>The hierarchical clustering results for midgut infection prevalence did not match the results obtained for systemic infection prevalence, indicating that midgut infection patterns are poor predictors of differences in the kinetics of systemic infection. Likewise, there was no association between the viral phylogeny and the kinetics of systemic infection (

As expected with such a small number of isolates, there was no statistically significant association between individual DNA polymorphisms or amino-acid differences with any of the three parameters describing the kinetics of systemic infection.
