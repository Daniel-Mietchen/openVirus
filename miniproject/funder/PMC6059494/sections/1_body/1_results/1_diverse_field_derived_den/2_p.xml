<p>We first tested infection status (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007187.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) and subsequently focused on systemic infection dynamics of midgut-infected mosquitoes. Systemic DENV infection was determined at each time point based on virus presence in head tissues. Systemic infection prevalence among midgut-infected mosquitoes ranged from 4.5% to 100% across isolates and time points and was significantly influenced by the time point (
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.0×10
 <sup>−16</sup>) but not by uncontrolled variation in blood meal titers (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) or the interaction between time point and blood meal titer (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.61).
