<p>To quantify the kinetics of systemic DENV infection, we assumed that the cumulative change in the proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic DENV infection over time post exposure followed a sigmoid function. A logistic model (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Materials and Methods</xref>) was fitted to the empirical data to estimate three parameters (
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>) describing the kinetics of each isolate (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). 
 <italic>K</italic> is the saturation level and represents the maximum proportion of infected mosquitoes with a systemic infection. 
 <italic>B</italic> is the slope factor and represents the maximum slope of the cumulative function scaled by 
 <italic>K</italic>. 
 <italic>M</italic> is the lag time and represents the time at which the absolute increase in cumulative proportion of systemic infection is maximal, which is also when the systemic infection prevalence equals 
 <italic>K</italic>/2.
