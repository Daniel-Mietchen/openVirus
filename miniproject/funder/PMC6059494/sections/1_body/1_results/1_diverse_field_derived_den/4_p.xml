<p>Among isolates, the saturation level 
 <italic>K</italic> ranged from 79% to 100% (mean ± SD: 93 ± 7%). The slope factor 
 <italic>B</italic> was transformed into Δt, the time required to rise from 10% to 90% of the saturation level, which ranged from 1.85 to 7.73 days (mean ± SD: 4.37 ± 2.03 days). The lag time 
 <italic>M</italic> ranged from 4.84 to 7.36 days (mean ± SD: 5.68 ± 0.82 days). There was no statistically significant correlation between the three parameters (

 <italic>M</italic>) values as a proxy. We obtained the daily rate of new systemic infections by calculating the first derivative of the cumulative systemic infection function (
