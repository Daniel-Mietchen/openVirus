<p>Based on the empirical values of their parameter combinations, the risk and magnitude of dengue epidemics varied among the eight DENV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). The probability that at least 1 secondary human infection occurred ranged from to 49% to 68%, and the probability of a large-scale dengue outbreak (â‰¥100 secondary human infections) ranged from 38% to 50% among isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). During large-scale outbreaks, the mean proportion of the human population that became infected ranged from 69% to 90% among isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In particular, the Haiti2012 isolate, which had the longest lag time (
 <italic>M</italic>) value, consistently led to a smaller outbreak size than all other isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007187.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Overall, the probability and size of dengue outbreaks tended to be more similar among isolates from the same AIC-based group of infection kinetics described above. Differences between DENV isolates did not change significantly when EIP was modeled by a continuous 3-parameter function in individual mosquitoes or by a threshold function with variable EIP among mosquitoes (
