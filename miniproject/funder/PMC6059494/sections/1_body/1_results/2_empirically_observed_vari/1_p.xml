<p>To assess the epidemiological significance of the differences observed in the kinetics of DENV systemic infection in mosquitoes, we implemented a stochastic agent-based model that accounted for variation in the three parameters (
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>) of the logistic model described above, and their effect on the probability and size of dengue outbreaks. This method allows individual humans and mosquitoes, each one being characterized by a unique set of infection parameters, to interact within a simulated environment, and was designed to model the unfolding of real-world arboviral epidemics (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">Materials and Methods</xref>). The 3-parameter function that was used to model the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection was incorporated as a time-dependent probability function to determine transmission status when a contact occurred between a human and a mosquito. Starting with one infected human in a population of 10,000 individuals, the model was run 100 independent times over 400 days using different combinations of the three parameters in the same range as the empirical values. The total number of infected humans was recorded for each combination of realistic parameter values. All combinations of parameter values resulted in a certain proportion of outbreaks without any secondary human infection (

Outbreaks with ≥1 secondary human infections were mainly partitioned into small-scale outbreaks (&lt;100 secondary infections) and large-scale outbreaks (≥100 secondary infections) leading to a strongly bimodal distribution of outbreak size (
