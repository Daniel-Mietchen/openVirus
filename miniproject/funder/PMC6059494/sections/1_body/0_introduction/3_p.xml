<p>Here, we investigated whether arbovirus genetic variation may alter transmission kinetics in epidemiologically significant ways. Specifically, we experimentally measured variation in transmission kinetics among several wild-type isolates of dengue virus (DENV) type 1 representing the worldwide genetic diversity of recently circulating strains. DENV are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus that cause more human infections than any other arbovirus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They exist as four genetically divergent types that loosely cluster antigenically [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Each DENV type is divided into major phylogenetic clades, often termed genotypes, which in turn contain a wide diversity of strains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All four serotypes of DENV are mainly transmitted by the mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> worldwide [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
