<p>To more accurately assess the epidemiological significance of DENV genetic variation in transmission kinetics, we used two complementary approaches. First, we experimentally monitored the cumulative proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic infection over time for eight genetically diverse, low-passage DENV type 1 isolates. We then used these 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> empirical data to derive a 3-parameter model of the kinetics of systemic infection, a proxy for transmission potential, and compare transmission dynamics among DENV isolates. Second, we implemented a stochastic agent-based model accounting for intra-mosquito and intra-human viral dynamics to compute time-dependent individual transmission probabilities and simulate arbovirus outbreaks 
 <italic>in silico</italic>. Using this model, we showed that the empirically observed differences in DENV transmission kinetics have the potential to significantly influence the probability and size of human dengue outbreaks.
