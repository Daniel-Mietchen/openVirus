<p>The influence of EIP on DENV epidemiology was recently examined in the context of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated blocking of virus transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Earlier studies suggested that viral genetic variation in EIP could also influence DENV epidemiology in nature. For example, differences of EIP among DENV type 2 strains have been proposed as a mechanism of genotype replacement and dengue emergence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. By comparing three DENV type 2 strains of the American genotype with three DENV type 2 strain of the Southeast Asian genotype, Anderson and Rico-Hesse estimated a 2- to 65-fold increase in vectorial capacity for the invasive Southeast Asian genotype relative to the resident American genotype [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This increase resulted from a 7-day difference in EIP between genotypes (7 days for the Southeast Asian vs. 14 days for the American genotype) across a range of daily survival rates. However, EIP was estimated as a single ‘threshold’ value defined as the time at which 50% of salivary glands became infected, which likely misrepresents EIP for an entire population [
