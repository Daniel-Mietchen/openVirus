<p>A mosquito’s intrinsic ability to transmit a virus, referred to as vector competence, is a stepwise procedure that begins when the mosquito takes an infectious blood meal on a viremic host. Following initial infection and replication in the midgut, the virus disseminates systemically from the midgut to secondary tissues including salivary glands, where it can be released into saliva during a subsequent blood meal. The probability of detecting DENV in

Although it is generally measured by end-point laboratory assays, vector competence is a dynamic process that combines with vector survival and EIP to determine the proportion of infectious vectors over time [
