<p>In the last few decades, arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) have become major contributors of global mortality and disability, calling for an improved understanding of their transmission dynamics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Transmission of arboviruses is governed by a complex set of biotic and abiotic factors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the majority of which relate to the vector biology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Individual, temporal and spatial variability in these factors results in considerable heterogeneities in arbovirus transmission dynamics, but the relative contribution of each factor is still poorly understood [
