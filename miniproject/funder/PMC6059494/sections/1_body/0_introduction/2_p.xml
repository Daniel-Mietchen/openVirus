<p>In classic models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission, one of the most influential parameters is the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), defined as the time interval between pathogen acquisition and pathogen transmission by the vector [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In these models, EIP interacts with the probability of mosquito survival as an exponential term, so that even a small deviation in EIP will substantially change the number of mosquitoes surviving long enough to become infectious. Despite the recognized importance of EIP as a powerful determinant of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission, variation in the duration of EIP has rarely been accounted for in models of mosquito-borne pathogen epidemiology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Current approaches to assess the epidemiological significance of variation in arbovirus transmission kinetics rely on temperature-dependent models developed from limited empirical data [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These models generally assume that the only factor affecting transmission kinetics is ambient temperature.
