<p>A stochastic agent-based model was developed in a closed human population to assess the influence of variation in the dynamics of systemic mosquito infection on dengue outbreaks. An agent-based model was chosen to achieve a more intuitive integration of the complex interplay of relatively simple rules within and between agents than would be possible with a mechanistic model. Starting with one infected human, this model encapsulates arbovirus transmission between susceptible mosquitoes and humans within a simulated environment. The model considers the influence of intra-host infection dynamics, both in humans and mosquitoes, on virus transmission probability during human-mosquito contacts. The model was run for several combinations of the three parameters (
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>) that were used above to describe the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection. The main epidemiological outcome was the total number of secondary human infections. The entities of the model were individual humans and mosquitoes. The variable states of humans were uninfected/infected. The variable states of mosquitoes were alive/dead and uninfected/infected. The time step of the model was one day. The values assigned to the model variables are shown in
