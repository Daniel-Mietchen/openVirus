<p>Human and mosquito population sizes were set as constant for each simulation. The model was populated with 10,000 humans and 30,000 mosquitoes. No birth, death or migration was allowed for humans. At each time point, daily mosquito deaths were compensated by the birth of uninfected mosquitoes. The model assumed homogeneous mixing of humans and mosquitoes, allowing any mosquito to bite any human with equal probability. At each time point in the simulation, a subset of the mosquito population was randomly chosen based on the daily feeding rate (
