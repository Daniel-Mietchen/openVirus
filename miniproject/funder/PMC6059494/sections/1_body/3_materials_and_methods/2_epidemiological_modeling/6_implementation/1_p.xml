<p>The model was implemented in R version 3.4.0 using the packages foreach [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], doParallel [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], plyr [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], reshape2 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A total of 1,140 different parameter combinations for 
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic> were run. Two sets of simulations were run. The first set aimed to explore the parameter space of 
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic>. An arbitrary range of mean values was generated for each parameter by increasing from a realistic minimum value to a realistic maximum value in a stepwise fashion (the increment size is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007187.s006">S1 Table</xref>). A total of 1,140 different parameter combinations for 
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic> were run, and each combination was run for 100 independent replicate simulations, yielding a total number of 114,000 simulations. The second set of simulations aimed to explore epidemiological outcomes for the eight empirically characterized DENV isolates. In these simulations, mean values of 
 <italic>K</italic>, 
 <italic>B</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic> were set to their respective experimentally determined estimates, whereas standard deviation was the same as in the first set of simulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007187.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Epidemics caused by each DENV isolate were examined in 100 independent replicate simulations. Each simulation was initiated with one infected human at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0, then each simulation was run for 400 days. The code of simulations is available at
