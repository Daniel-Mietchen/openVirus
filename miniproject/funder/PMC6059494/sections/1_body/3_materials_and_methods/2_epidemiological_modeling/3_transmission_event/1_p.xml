<p>The model only considered arbovirus transmission (
 <italic>i</italic>) from an infected human to uninfected vectors and (
 <italic>ii</italic>) from an infected vector to susceptible humans. The model ignored vertical transmission from an infected female to its offspring because it is rare both in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and in mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and can be considered as epidemiologically insignificant. The model assumed that humans acquired protective immunity from a previous infection, whereas infection clearance was not allowed in mosquitoes. No superinfection events were allowed in mosquitoes and humans that would change infection dynamics.
