<p>For each replicate of a given parameter combination, the total number of humans infected during the outbreak was recorded. Two outputs derived from the simulation data were examined: (
 <italic>i</italic>) the proportion of failures to initiate an outbreak and (
 <italic>ii</italic>) the mean number of secondary human infections across replicates. Failure to initiate an outbreak was defined as the lack of secondary infections over the length of the simulation following initial introduction of a single infected human. Failures to initiate an outbreak were filtered out before calculating the mean number of human infections. For each analysis, a stratified random splitting was performed on the data with the createDataPartition function from the caret R package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] to obtain 
 <italic>training</italic> and 
 <italic>test</italic> subsets of the data with a balanced number of sample for each parameters combinations. The 
 <italic>training</italic> set was composed of 70% of the data. We performed random forest regression with optimized parameter settings provided by the train function of the caret R package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. A total of 500 trees were used for both analyses with two and four variables or interaction between variables randomly tried at each split. The model included the proportion of failures to initiate an outbreak as the response variable and the three parameters describing systemic infection dynamics and their interaction as explanatory variables. The relative importance of parameters was determined according to their 
 <italic>IncNodePurity</italic> value, which measures the quality of a split for each variable, averaged over all trees.
