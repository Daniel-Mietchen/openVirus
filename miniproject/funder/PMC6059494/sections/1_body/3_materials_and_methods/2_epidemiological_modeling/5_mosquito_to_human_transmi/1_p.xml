<p>Dynamics of mosquito-to-human transmission probability was modeled using the 3-parameter equation (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1007187.e001">Eq 1</xref>) described above. For each individual mosquito, values for the three parameters were drawn from a probability distribution (

 <italic>M</italic> was drawn from a normal probability distribution, 
 <italic>B</italic> was drawn from a truncated normal distribution (to avoid values &lt;0) and 
 <italic>K</italic> was drawn from a beta distribution. Alternative modeling strategies are described in
