<p>The full-length genomes of two of the DENV isolates (Thai2010a and Thai2010b) were already sequenced from a previous study [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and are available in GenBank under accession numbers HG316481 and HG316482, respectively. The full-length genome sequences of the six other DENV isolates of the study were obtained by high-throughput sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), DNAse treated (Turbo DNAse, Life Technologies) and purified with magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Purified RNA was then reverse transcribed using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit and random hexamers (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Second DNA strand was synthetized in a single reaction with

 <italic>coli</italic> DNA ligase (NEB), 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> DNA polymerase I (NEB), 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> RNAse H (NEB) in second strand synthesis buffer (NEB). Resulting dsDNA was purified with magnetic beads (Agencourt AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter) and its concentration was measured by fluorometric quantification (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA, Invitrogen). Sequencing libraries were prepared using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina), multiplexed and sequenced in single-end on an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform using a mid-output 150-cycle v2 kit (Illumina).
