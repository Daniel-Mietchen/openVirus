<p>After demultiplexing, trimmomatic v0.33 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was used to discard reads shorter than 32 nucleotides, filter out Illumina adaptor sequences, remove leading and trailing low quality bases and trim reads when the average quality per base dropped below 15 on a 4-base-wide sliding window. Full DENV genomes were reconstructed by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembly using Ray v2.0.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The largest contig was extended in 3’ and 5’ using the full genome sequence of the closest BLAST hit. This chimeric construct was used as the reference to re-map all the reads using Bowtie 2 v2.1.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and correct the 3’ and 5’ ends. The alignment file was converted, sorted and indexed using Samtools v0.1.19 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Coverage and sequencing depth was assessed for each sample using bedtools v2.17.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Single nucleotide variants and their frequency were called using LoFreq* v2.1.1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and used to correct the chimeric construct. Only nucleotides with &gt;10X coverage were conserved for generating the consensus sequence. The full-length genomes of the six newly sequenced DENV isolates were deposited in GenBank under accessions numbers MG877552 (Laos2012), MG877553 (Haiti2012), MG877554 (Thai2012), MG877555 (Ncal2013), MG877556 (Thai2013), and MG877557 (Gabon2012).
