<p>The presence of a midgut and/or systemic DENV infection was determined on day 4, 6, 8, 12 and 18 post virus exposure. An infected body indicates a midgut infection, and an infected head indicates a systemic (disseminated) infection. Batches of mosquitoes were freeze-killed at each time point and their heads and bodies were separated and stored at -80Â°C until processing. Virus detection was performed for all mosquito bodies and for the heads of all mosquitoes with a DENV-positive body. The majority of samples were tested using a qualitative version of the FFA [

These undetermined samples were re-tested by two-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of DENV RNA as previously described [
