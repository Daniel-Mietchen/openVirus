<p>Experiments were carried out with wild-type 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes derived from a field population originally sampled in the Muang District of Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand and took place within 10 generations of colonization. Mosquitoes were maintained and orally exposed to DENV as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, five- to seven-day-old females deprived of sucrose solution for 24 hours were allowed to feed for 15 min from a membrane feeding system (Hemotek) that contained an artificial infectious blood meal maintained at 37°C. The infectious blood meal consisted of two volumes of washed rabbit erythrocytes and one volume of pre-diluted viral stock, supplemented with 10 mM adenosine triphosphate as a phagostimulant. The viral stock was pre-diluted in order to standardize the infectious dose among the DENV isolates. The infectious dose was chosen to result in an expected infection rate of 50–100%. The same infectious blood meal was used to expose three sequential batches of mosquitoes during a total of 45 min. An aliquot of the artificial blood meal was collected immediately prior and after blood feeding and stored at -80°C for later titration by FFA. The mean (± SD) log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed viral titer dropped from 5.73 ± 0.13 to 5.46 ± 0.26 FFU/ml during the 45-min feeding period. This difference was statistically significant (t test: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0093) so the average of the two measurements for each isolate was used in all subsequent analyses. After virus exposure, fully engorged females were transferred to 1-pint cardboard containers and maintained under controlled conditions as described above with a maximum of 30 females per container.
