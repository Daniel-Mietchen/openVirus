<p>Eight DENV type 1 isolates derived from human sera were selected from the collection of the French National Reference Center for Arboviruses based on their geographical origin and year of isolation in order to represent the worldwide viral genetic diversity of recently circulating strains (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Informed consent of the patients was not necessary because virus isolated in laboratory cell culture is no longer considered a human sample. Prior to their use in mosquito experimental infections, DENV isolates were amplified 2–6 times in C6/36 (
