<p>A background set of 51 full-length DENV genome sequences was obtained from GenBank to represent the different genotypes of DENV type 1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Genome sequences were aligned using ClustalW v.2.0.12 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and analyzed with RAxML v.8.2.10 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] to generate the best-scoring maximum-likelihood (ML) tree of 10 runs with 100 thorough bootstrap replicates. The GTR + I + G nucleotide substitution model was chosen based on the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value using the JModelTest 2 software [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The same procedure was applied to the eight DENV isolates. Phylogenetic trees were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.3 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the ggtree R package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Phylogenetic comparative analysis of continuous traits was performed with the phyloSignal function of the phylosignal R package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] using the Abouheif's Cmean, Moran's I, Blomberg's K and Pagel's Lambda methods [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
