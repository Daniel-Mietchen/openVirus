<p>Comparison of systemic infection kinetics among DENV isolates was based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The global likelihood model was fitted to all 4,140 partitions of isolates. Isolates from one group were constrained to share the same parameter values. AIC values were calculated for all possible partitions of isolates with the same empirical data of systemic infection. The best isolate grouping was considered as the one with the lowest AIC score. An affinity matrix among isolates was derived from AIC values obtained from all grouping comparisons. Two isolates share a higher affinity if they are commonly grouped together in models with low AIC values. A hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the affinity scores to reveal the extent of similarities of systemic infection kinetics among isolates.</p>
