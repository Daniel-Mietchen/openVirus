<p>The time-dependent effect of infectious dose (blood meal titer) on mosquito midgut infection and systemic infection was analyzed by logistic regression. Differences in mosquito infection over time were analyzed using hierarchical clustering with the Ward method based on the scaled proportion of infected mosquitoes at each time point post exposure. Pvclust [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] was used to calculate Approximately Unbiased (AU) 
 <italic>p</italic> values for hierarchical clustering through multiscale bootstrap resampling using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Genome-wide associations were tested by analysis of variance of the kinetics parameter values as a function of viral sequence polymorphisms (at the nucleotide and amino-acid levels). The null hypothesis was the lack of difference in parameter values between polymorphic variants at each locus. It was rejected when 
 <italic>p</italic> values were &lt;0.05 after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Geneious v.7.0.6 (
