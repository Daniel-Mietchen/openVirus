 <p>Transmission of arboviruses by mosquitoes is a time-dependent process because dissemination of the virus from the insectâ€™s digestive tract, where the infection is initially established, to the salivary glands, where it can be transmitted to the next host, typically takes several days. The duration of this time interval is an important determinant of the proportion of infected mosquitoes that live long enough to become infectious. Due to the lack of available data, epidemiological models rarely account for the dynamic nature of this process and its natural variation among arbovirus strains. In this study, we experimentally monitored the dynamics of mosquito infection by eight strains of dengue virus and found significant differences between them. In addition, we used the empirical data obtained in a simulation model to show that the differences observed among the strains are expected to result in human dengue outbreaks of different probability and size. Together, our results indicate that natural variation in mosquito infection dynamics between arbovirus strains may contribute to the unexplained heterogeneity of dengue virus transmission patterns.</p>
