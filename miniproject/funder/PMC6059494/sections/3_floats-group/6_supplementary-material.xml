  <title>Observed prevalence of mosquito midgut infection following oral exposure to DENV isolates.</title>
  <p>(A) Bar charts represent the proportion of mosquitoes with a DENV-infected midgut at several time points following oral exposure. Dashes represent the 95% confidence intervals of the proportions. Time-averaged proportions are shown on the right side of each chart. Midgut infection prevalence was significantly influenced by the time point (
   <italic>p</italic> = 6.6×10
   <sup>−9</sup>), and increased with uncontrolled variation in blood meal titers although not significantly so (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.12). (B) The heat map represents midgut infection prevalence (using scaled values to standardize variation across time points) over time post DENV exposure for each isolate. Hierarchical clustering dendrograms are displayed on the left side of the heat map with Approximately Unbiased (AU) values (in %) computed by multiscale bootstrap resampling. A green rectangle highlights isolates groupings with AU values larger than 95%.
