  <title>Phylogenetic relationships between DENV isolates of the study.</title>
  <p>Full-length genome sequences were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships among the isolates of the study in a background of representative sequences of DENV type 1. Genotypes are represented with distinct colors and the eight DENV isolates of the study are shown in black. Inferences were calculated with a maximum-likelihood method implemented in RAxML v.8.2.10[
   <xref rid="ppat.1007187.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The scale bar represents 0.007 substitutions per site.
