  <title>Pairwise correlations between the three parameters of systemic mosquito infection dynamics.</title>
  <p>For each isolate, the cumulative change in the proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic DENV infection over time post exposure was used to fit a 3-parameter logistic model. 
   <italic>K</italic> is the saturation level and represents the maximum proportion of mosquitoes with a systemic infection. 
   <italic>B</italic> is the slope factor and represents the maximum slope of the cumulative function scaled by 
   <italic>K</italic>. 
   <italic>M</italic> is the lag time and represents the time at which the absolute increase in cumulative proportion is maximal. Blue lines represent linear regressions and the gray areas are their confidence intervals. Spearmanâ€™s rank correlation coefficients and 
   <italic>p</italic> values are indicated below each graph.
