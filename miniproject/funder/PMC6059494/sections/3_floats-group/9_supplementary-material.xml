  <title>Analyses of simulations outputs.</title>
  <p>(A) Density chart of the mean number of infected humans across simulation replicates for several combinations of 
   <italic>K</italic> and 
   <italic>M</italic> (with parameter 
   <italic>B</italic> drawn from a uniform distribution). 
   <italic>K</italic> and 
   <italic>M</italic> were the two most influential parameters identified by random forest analysis performed on two independent simulation outputs: (B) the proportion of failures to initiate an outbreak and (C) the mean number of human infections across replicates. Overall, random forest analysis explained 88.9% and 96.6% of the variability in the proportion of failure to initiate an outbreak and in the mean number of human infections in successful outbreaks, respectively. In panels (B) and (C), upper charts show the correlation between observed and predicted values on the 
   <italic>test</italic> data subset. Bottom charts show the relative importance of infection kinetics parameters, with higher 
   <italic>IncNode Purity</italic> values meaning greater importance.
