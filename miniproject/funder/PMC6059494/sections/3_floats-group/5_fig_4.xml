  <title>Simulated effect of variation in mosquito infection dynamics on the risk and magnitude of dengue outbreaks.</title>
  <p>A stochastic agent-based model was run 100 times for each combination of mean values of the three parameters (
   <italic>K</italic>, 
   <italic>B</italic>, 
   <italic>M</italic>) describing the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection. Other parameters, such as relative mosquito density, biting rate and human viral dynamics were held constant. Panel (A) shows the proportion of simulations that resulted in ≥100, &lt;100 and no secondary human infections using the 
   <italic>K</italic>, 
   <italic>B</italic> and 
   <italic>M</italic> values empirically measured for the eight DENV isolates. Panel (B) shows the total number of humans that became infected during large-scale dengue outbreaks (≥100 secondary human infections) using the empirical 
   <italic>K</italic>, 
   <italic>B</italic> and 
   <italic>M</italic> values of the eight DENV isolates. In both panels, isolates are color-coded according to their AIC-based group of systemic mosquito infection kinetics.
