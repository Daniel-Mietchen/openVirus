  <title>Comparison of systemic mosquito infection kinetics among DENV isolates.</title>
  <p>A logistic 3-parameter model was fitted to all permutations of isolates, with isolates from the same group being forced to share the same parameters. Panel (A) represents the isolate grouping that maximizes the probability function for systemic infection dynamics. This isolate grouping had the lowest AIC value among all tested permutations (

For each isolate group, data points represent the empirical measurements color-coded by isolate and the black line is the logistic fit of the group. An affinity matrix among isolates was derived from AIC values obtained from all model comparisons (

The distance between isolates corresponds to the number of times two isolates shared the same groupings with respect to their AIC. The red dotted line shows the cut-off value leading to the best AIC-based isolate grouping.
