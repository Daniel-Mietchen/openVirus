  <title>Variation in the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection between DENV isolates.</title>
  <p>(A) The cumulative prevalence of systemic infection over time post virus exposure is shown for each DENV isolate. Data points represent the observed prevalence at each time point with their size being proportional to the sample size (number of mosquitoes tested). Dashes represent the 95% confidence interval of the prevalence. Lines correspond to the fitted values obtained with a 3-parameter logistic model. (B) The daily rate of new systemic infections (instantaneous velocity) over time post virus exposure is shown for each DENV isolate. It was calculated as the first derivative of the cumulative systemic infection function and is equivalent to the frequency distribution of lag time values among individual mosquitoes. In both graphs, the lower right panel shows the merged fitted values for all isolates.</p>
