  <title>Raw empirical data from this study.</title>
  <p>Each line represents an individual mosquito and the columns are the experimental conditions and phenotypes. From left to right, the columns indicate the DENV isolate, number of days post infectious blood meal, body infection status, head infection status, infection round (out of three sequential 15-min rounds of exposure), experiment (out of two separate experiments), blood meal titer (in log
   <sub>10</sub> FFU/ml), number of prior passages in C6/36 cells, country of origin, date of isolation, and DENV-1 genotype. The last column identifies the small number of samples that were tested by PCR instead of FFA.
