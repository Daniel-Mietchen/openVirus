  <title>Simulated effect of mosquito infection kinetics on dengue outbreaks.</title>
  <p>The interactive bubble plot represents the probability and size of dengue outbreaks across simulation replicates as a function of the three parameters (
   <italic>K</italic>, 
   <italic>B</italic>, 
   <italic>M</italic>) describing the kinetics of systemic mosquito infection. The size of the bubble is proportional to the percentage of successful outbreaks (&gt;1 infected human). The color of the bubble represents the log
   <sub>10</sub>-transformed mean number of infected humans during successful outbreaks. Hover text indicates the percentage of successful outbreaks, the mean number of infected humans during successful outbreaks, and the parameter values when the pointing device is moved over a bubble. This chart was made with Plotly for R v. 4.7.1 [
