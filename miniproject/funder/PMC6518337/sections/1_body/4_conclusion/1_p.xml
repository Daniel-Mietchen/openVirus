<p>A novel mismatch-tolerant LAMP was developed by simply adding a minuscule amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase in addition to the standard amount of Bst DNA polymerase to the standard LAMP reaction mixture. This method could be applied to update all LAMP-based diagnostic assays. Importantly, the novel LAMP method tolerates well mismatches between primers and templates, and has higher amplification efficiency for viral variants than the conventional LAMP method. Therefore, the mismatch-tolerant LAMP method represents a simple, sensitive and promising approach for molecular diagnosis of genetically diverse viruses, and it is especially suited for application in resource-limited settings.</p>
