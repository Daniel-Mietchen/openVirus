<p>We have previously reported that by removing the mismatched bases in the 3′-end of a primer using high-fidelity DNA polymerase that has a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, the performance of PCR for detection of genetically diverse viruses can be significantly improved (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, to improve the performance of LAMP in detection of genetically diverse viruses, we used similar principle and developed a mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP method. The most distinctive feature of the novel method in comparison to the conventional method is that a minuscule amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase was added into the standard LAMP system. In fact, only 0.15 U of high-fidelity DNA polymerase per 25 μl LAMP reaction mix is sufficient to accomplish optimal performance. As expected, the addition of high-fidelity DNA polymerase largely improved LAMP amplification efficiency for variable templates that form mismatches with the primers, thus demonstrating an excellent tolerance for various mismatches between primers and templates. Furthermore, compared to the conventional LAMP method, the mismatch-tolerant method not only significantly improved the detection sensitivity, but also markedly shortened the reaction time regardless of the presence or absence of mismatches between the primers and templates. The underlying mechanisms for an improved amplification for wild-type template have not been determined. Nevertheless, our findings indicated that the novel mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP method is faster and more efficient than the conventional methods.
