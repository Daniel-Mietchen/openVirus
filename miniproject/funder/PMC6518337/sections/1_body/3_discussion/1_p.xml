<p>Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are major burden to global public health systems (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Mehand et al., 2018</xref>). Many of them are vector-borne infectious diseases that affect a large population in the tropical and subtropical regions (e.g., Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia), and cause higher morbidity and mortality in low-income countries than developed countries (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Weaver et al., 2018</xref>). Development of point-of-care tests (POCT) for these viruses plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of vector-borne infectious diseases in resource-poor countries/regions (

In this study, we developed a mismatch-tolerant LAMP method and demonstrated its practical use by improving the sensitivity and specificity of a previous established RT-LAMP assay for the detection of all four DENV serotypes.
