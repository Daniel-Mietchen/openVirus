<p>High susceptibility of LAMP to mismatches limits its power in diagnostic application for viral infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">de Paz et al., 2014</xref>), and makes it especially difficult to apply on highly variable viral genome, for which the design of universal primers for a single assay that covers all genotypes, subtypes or rare variants of the same virus is challenging. Moreover, many viruses exist as quasispecies in which various variants can form mismatches with LAMP primers that designed with even the most conserved genomic region. In the last decade, a strategy by combining multiple degenerate primers together was developed for broad-spectrum detection of various genotypes or subtypes of genetically diverse viruses such as DENV, HIV-1, influenza A viruses, and enteroviruses (
