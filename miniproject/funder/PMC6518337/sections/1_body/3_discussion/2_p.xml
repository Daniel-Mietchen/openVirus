<p>Our novel assay has notable features that are superior to the conventional LAMP method, which was developed in about two decades ago (

The conventional LAMP assay has been widely used in various fields because of its noted advantages including relatively independent of expensive instruments, stable reaction system, and flexibility in real-time monitoring of reactions using fluorescent dyes (e.g., SYTO 9 and SYBR green I) or visual determination using colorimetric dyes (e.g., HNB, Calcein or pH-sensitive dyes) (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Tanner et al., 2015</xref>). LAMP requires three pairs of primers: long FIP and BIP primers that bind to a relatively short genomic region (usually less than 300 bp); the 3′-ends of the F3/B3, FIP/BIP and FLP/BLP that provide 3′-hydroxyl groups and start DNA extension; the 5′-ends of the primers FIP and BIP (i.e., 3′-end of F1 and B1) that are responsible for the self-priming of the dumb-bell form DNA generated in the first stage of LAMP reaction (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Notomi et al., 2000</xref>). However, the presence of mismatches at these ends markedly reduced the amplification efficiency of LAMP, as we have observed in this study and other have reported previously. In particular, the mismatches occurring at both ends of FIP/BIP and the 3′-ends of FLP/BLP had larger inhibition effect on LAMP amplification than those occurring at 3′-ends of F3/B3. One plausible reason for this phenomenon is that F3/B3 are only responsible for the initiation of LAMP cycling by strand replacement of newly synthesized DNA along the target, but do not participate in the self-priming of the dumb-bell form DNA (
