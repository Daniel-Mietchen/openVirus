<p>In resource-limited settings, diagnosis of dengue relies mainly on the clinical manifestation, which is easily confused with similar symptoms caused by other infectious agents, such as malaria, chikungunya, and influenza (

The novel RT-LAMP method has a high sensitivity of detection for multiple viral genotype/subtypes with a short amplification time, and can be developed into a visual measurement qualitative assay by adding HNB, cresol red, or other pH-sensitive dyes (e.g., phenol red and neutral red). The above features offer great application potential for our assay in POCT at local clinics and even in the fields. In particular, recent progresses in the nucleic acid extraction-free protocols and lyophilized formulation of LAMP reagents will further facilitate its application in the diagnosis of various viral infectious diseases in different settings in resource-poor countries (
