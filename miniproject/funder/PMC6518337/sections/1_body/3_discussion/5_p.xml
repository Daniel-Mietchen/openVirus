<p>Having completed the proof-of-concept studies, we went on to test the robustness of the novel assay on clinical samples by choosing a genetically diverse virus, DENV, which causes an infection of great impact to public health in tropical and subtropical area (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Early and rapid detection of DENV infection is important for patient management and epidemiological monitoring, especially in resource-limited settings (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Shu and Huang, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Teles et al., 2005</xref>). Current assays for dengue diagnosis have their limitations. NS1 antigen detection assay is highly sensitive and specific for acute DENV infection, but the pre-existing anti-NS1 IgG antibody induced by a previous infection will interfere with the detection of subsequent DENV infection especially in high-prevalence regions where many DENV serotypes co-circulate (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>). In principle, NAA tests are more sensitive and specific for early and accurate detection of DENV infection than the NS1 antigen assay. Therefore, we used the novel method to improve a previously established RT-LAMP assay for pan-serotype detection of DENV (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Teoh et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the previous assay, the novel assay showed a significant improvement for detection of all four DENV serotypes. DENV infected patients often had mean viremia of 10
 <sup>7.6-8.5</sup> PFU per ml of plasma at the acute phase (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>). LOD tests revealed that the novel assay is sufficiently sensitive for detecting these viremia levels. Moreover, the evaluation of 153 clinical samples showed that the novel assay had higher detection rate than the NS1 antigen assay and RT-PCR method for all four DENV serotypes.
