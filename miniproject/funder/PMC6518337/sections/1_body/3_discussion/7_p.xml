<p>Despite having many significant findings, this study also has several limitations. First, because there lacks a gold standard to determine the true positive and true negative samples for DENV infection, we were unable to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the novel DENV RT-LAMP assay. Second, the sample size used in the clinical evaluation was relatively small, especially DENV-2 samples and DENV-negative samples. Further validation of our assay with a large sample size is needed. Third, in this study, we only applied the novel RT-LAMP method to DENV detection. Its application to the detection of other genetically diverse viruses may help to further evaluate the robustness of our new assay.</p>
