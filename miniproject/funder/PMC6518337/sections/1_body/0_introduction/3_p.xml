<p>We recently developed a mismatch-tolerant RT-qPCR method with proof-reading capacity by introducing a small amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase to a standard amount of Taq DNA polymerase (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The high-fidelity DNA polymerase removed the mismatched bases at 3â€²end of the primer and thus significantly improved the amplification efficiency for template containing mutations. Here, we utilized a similar principle to develop a mismatch-tolerant LAMP method for high-sensitive and broad-spectrum detection of genetically diverse viruses, and used dengue virus (DENV) in the proof-of-principle experiments.
