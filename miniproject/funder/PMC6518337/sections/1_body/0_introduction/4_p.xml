<p>DENV was chosen in part because it is a global public health problem with an estimated 390 million infections occurring each year (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). DENV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Henchal and Putnak, 1990</xref>). Dengue epidemics occur mainly in urban and semi-urban areas in the tropical and subtropical regions, including a large number of resource-poor countries (

However, the majority of individuals with DENV infection are subclinical, with no manifested symptoms, yet capable of spreading the virus (

Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of DENV infection, using a relatively simple method that can be deployed to different terrains, is critical not only to clinical management, but also for the prevention and control of dengue epidemic (
