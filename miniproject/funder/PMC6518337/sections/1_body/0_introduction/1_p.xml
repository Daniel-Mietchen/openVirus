<p>Because of their high sensitivity and specificity, nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests have been explored as molecular diagnosis tools for infectious diseases, especially for acute infections (

Thermal cycling amplification is the basis of various PCR-based techniques, such as the quantitative PCR (qPCR) method that has been widely applied to biomedical research, as well as agricultural, ecological, food and environmental sciences (

However, PCR-based methods, especially qPCR, require relatively sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, to be performed in special diagnostic laboratories or facilities. These requirements limit their applications in resource-limited settings (
