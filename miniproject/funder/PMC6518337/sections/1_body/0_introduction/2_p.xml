<p>Distinct from PCR-based methods, isothermal amplification is performed under a constant temperature, and rarely relies on sophisticated equipment (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, isothermal amplification techniques represent a promising direction for the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) method for use in the fields or resource-limited settings (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">de Paz et al., 2014</xref>). Some isothermal amplification methods have already been developed, such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification (RCA), and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Among them, LAMP is the most commonly used technique with more than 3,000 PubMed searchable publications by January, 2019 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Notomi et al., 2000</xref>). LAMP generally uses six primers to initiate the self-primed DNA synthesis and amplification cycling (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Nagamine et al., 2002</xref>). Although the most conserved genomic region is generally used for primer design, the LAMP primers, especially the two inner LAMP primers FIP and BIP that are typically over 40 nt long, form mismatches easily with templates of highly variable viruses that exist as a quasispecies (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Sanjuan et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Domingo and Perales, 2018</xref>). The mismatches between primers and templates can significantly reduce the amplification efficiency of LAMP (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Notomi et al., 2000</xref>), decrease the sensitivity of detection, and even generate false negative results. These drawbacks are a major barrier to translate the LAMP technique into a commercial viable application (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2018</xref>), and the reason why few LAMP-based commercial diagnostic kits had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of US or World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.
