<p>Part of the difficulty in dengue diagnosis is that DENV comprises four antigenically distinct serotypes of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, and different serotypes only exhibit 65â€“70% sequence homology at the nucleotide level (

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Teles et al., 2005</xref>), there still lacks a high-efficiency pan-serotype DENV detection assay for point-of-care use in resource-limited settings. Using the novel mismatch-tolerant LAMP technique, we improved the sensitivity of detection of a previous developed pan-serotype RT-LAMP assay for DENV, and demonstrated that such a test may have practical applications.
