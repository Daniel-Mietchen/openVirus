<p>High-fidelity DNA polymerase has a proofreading function and can be used to remove mismatched nucleotides. To improve the amplification efficiency of LAMP on highly variable templates, we developed a mismatch-tolerant LAMP method by combining Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase and a small amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase in the reaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). The amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase was previously demonstrated to be optimal at 0.15 U in a 25 Î¼l reaction system, at which the mismatched bases were removed from the primers, and the completion with other DNA polymerase such as Taq DNA polymerase for DNA synthesis did not occur (

Therefore, a standard mismatch-tolerant LAMP reaction system that includes all reagents in the conventional LAMP reaction with an additional 0.15 U high-fidelity DNA polymerase were established. Using the novel system, we developed an novel RT-LAMP assay for pan-serotype detection of DENV using the primer sets previously described (
