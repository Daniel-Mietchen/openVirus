<p>The principle of LAMP shows that the 3′-ends of the F2/B2, F3/B3, and LF/LB, as well as the 3′-ends of F1/B1 (corresponding to the 5′-ends of the F1c/B1c) provide 3′-hydroxyl groups for DNA extension (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Notomi et al., 2000</xref>). Because of lacking a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity, Bst2.0 DNA polymerase has a reduced capacity to extend primers when mismatches occur at the 3′-ends of these primers, and thus resulted in a low amplification efficiency of LAMP (
