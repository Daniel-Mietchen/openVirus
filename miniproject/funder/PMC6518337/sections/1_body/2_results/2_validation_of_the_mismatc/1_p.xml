<p>To assess the influence of various mismatches between primers and templates on LAMP amplification, and validate the effectiveness of the novel mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP, we constructed a series of mutant RNA of DENV-4 that can form three kinds of mismatches with the 3′-ends of F3, FIP, and BLP, as well as the 5′-end of FIP (i.e., 3′-end of F1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). We firstly used the conventional RT-LAMP assay to detect 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies of the mutant RNAs, and a control wild type template. Relative to the wild type template (Tt: 21.7 min), the mutants generated slower RT-LAMP amplification with Tt values of 22.8–44.3 min (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For the same primer, three kinds of mismatches formed with the mutant RNAs resulted in a relatively large variance in Tt values (0.5–6.5 min) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, we found that the mismatches occurring in different primers had marked difference in their inhibition effect on LAMP amplification. The mutants forming mismatches with the 3′-end of the F3 primer had Tt values of 22.8–25.2 min (about 1–3.5 min higher than the wild type), whereas the mutants forming mismatches with the 3′-end of the BLP or FIP (corresponding to the 3′-end of F2) primers had Tt values of 35.2–44.3 min, which are 13.5–22.6 min higher than the wild type (
