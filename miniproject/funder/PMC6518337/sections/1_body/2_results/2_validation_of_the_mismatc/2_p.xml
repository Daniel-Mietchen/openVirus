<p>Then, we used the mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP assay to test the same mutants and the wild type template. The novel method had Tt value of 16.1 min for the wild type template, about 5.6 min lower than that in the conventional method (

The mutants forming mismatches at the 3-ends of both the BLP and FIP, as well as at the 5′-end of the FIP (corresponding to the 3′-end of F1) had about 13.7–22.6 min lower Tt values by the novel method than the conventional assay, and the mutants having mismatches with the F3 primer showed about 5.9–8.5 min lower Tt values than the conventional ones (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, the novel method seemed to have a similar amplification efficiency for the wild type and the mutants, except for slightly slower (about 4.3–6.5 min) for the mutants forming mismatches with the 3′-ends of the FIP and BLP than for the wild type (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
