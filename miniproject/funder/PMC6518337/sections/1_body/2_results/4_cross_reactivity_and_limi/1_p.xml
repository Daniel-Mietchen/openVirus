<p>Cross-reactivity test showed that there was no amplification of other ten human viruses (including closely related flaviviruses, Zika virus, and yellow fever virus) by the novel DENV RT-LAMP assay within 50 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that the new assay is specific for DENV. Sensitivity tests showed that the novel pan-serotype DENV RT-LAMP can detect as low as 162, 886, 78, and 104 RNA copies of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, which are equivalent to 3.36, 84, 0.17, and 1.34 PFU, respectively. In comparison, the conventional RT-LAMP assay only yielded one or two positive amplifications among the three replicates at the same concentrations of DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4, except for DENV-2, for which 886 virus RNA copies were detected by all replicates (
