<p>The novel RT-LAMP, the NS1 antigen detection, the specific RT-PCR and the conventional RT-LAMP assays detected 145 (94.8%), 141 (92.2%), 120 (78.4%), and 133 (86.9%) DENV positive samples, respectively (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The concordance rates of the novel RT-LAMP assay were 90.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 84.8–94.7%; kappa value: 0.253] and 78.4% (95% CI: 70.9–84.5%; kappa value: 0.121) with the NS1 antigen detection and the specific RT-PCR assays, respectively (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The positivity results were more consistent between the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP assays, with a concordance rate of 92.2% (95% CI: 86.4–95.7%; kappa value: 0.537).
