<p>To assess the capacity of the novel RT-LAMP assay for detection of all four DENV serotypes, 120 samples that were previously genotyped were used, and 116 of them (96.7%) were also tested as positive by the novel RT-LAMP assay (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among them, all DENV-2 (5/5, 100%) and DENV-3 (46/46, 100%), most DENV-1 (55/58, 94.8%), and DENV-4 (10/11, 90.9%) samples were detected as being positive (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The novel RT-LAMP assay showed better performance for DENV-1 (94.8% vs. 87.9%) and DENV-3 (100% vs. 87.0%) than the conventional assay, and identical performance for DENV-2 and DENV-4 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In addition, we randomly selected 12 samples with a negative RT-PCR test but positive by the novel RT-LAMP assay for further amplification using a RT-nested PCR assay. One additional sample was detected as being positive and further genotyped as DENV-4 by Sanger sequencing and Blast analysis. Among seven samples with a Tt difference of more than 15 min between the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP assays, three DENV-1 and four DENV-3 strains were identified, and only the three DENV-1 strains carried A- &gt; C or C- &gt; T substitution in the F2 region (
