<p>To prepare for use in the resource-poor settings, the novel RT-LAMP assay was further developed into a visual determination assay by adding HNB or cresol red. Because both HNB and Cresol Red assays gave a clear color indication for all samples at 50 min (

As a comparison, the conventional assay only detected 1620, 886, 780, and 1040 copies of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, respectively, for the same duration of amplification.
