<p>The LAMP primers for pan-serotype detection of DENV were previously designed in the 3′ UTR region of the DENV genome, the most conserved genomic region shared among the four serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further evaluate the primers, we retrieved all available 3′ UTR sequences of four DENV serotypes, and performed sequence alignments. A total of 1220 DENV-1, 626 DENV-2, 659 DENV-3, and 130 DENV-4 sequences were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Except for the F3 region, the vast majority of sequences are conserved for all four serotypes, and only a few variants in each serotype can form mismatches with the LAMP primers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, DENV-2 and DENV-4 appeared to be distinct from DENV-1 and DENV-3 in the F3 and F2 regions (especially the regions corresponding to the 5′ parts of the primers) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). When all four DENV strains were detected using the conventional RT-LAMP assay, a lower amplification efficiency was observed for DENV-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Sequencing and sequence analysis showed that there were four substitutions in the FIP and BIP regions of DENV-2 compared to other serotypes (

To examine whether the mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP can improve the amplification efficiency for all four DENV serotypes, we used the novel method to detect the same DENV strains and compared it with the conventional RT-LAMP assay. All four serotypes had lower Tt values (14.8–23.2 min) by the novel RT-LAMP assay than that by the conventional ones (21.3–31.5 min) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). The differences in Tt values between the two assays were 4.5–11.7 min. To avoid non-specific amplification, the reaction time of the new method was set at 50 min for the subsequent experiments.
