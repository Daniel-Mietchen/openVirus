<p>To develop a visual detection method, 120 μM hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) was added to the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP reaction mix. Another visual RT-LAMP assay was performed with the WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, United States), which uses cresol red as a visual indicator. The reactions were performed at 63°C, and the color change was observed at the 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-min time points.</p>
