<p>Ten-fold serial dilution of the RNA from four DENV stocks were used as the standards to determine the sensitivity of the novel DENV RT-LAMP assay. The initial titers of the DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 stocks were 4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>, 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, and 1.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU) per ml. To determine the RNA copy numbers of the virus stocks, RT-qPCR assay was performed with previously described primers (
