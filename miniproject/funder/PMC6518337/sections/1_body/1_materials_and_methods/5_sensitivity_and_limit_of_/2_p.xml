<p>LOD of the novel DENV RT-LAMP assay was determined using 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA from each virus stock. Each dilution was tested in a set of 10 replicates. To more accurately estimate the LOD, we performed additional experiments using a fivefold dilution of each DENV serotype with a starting RNA copy number of 3 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup>. Probit regression analysis was performed to determine the LOD using the SPSS 17.0 software. The LOD was defined as a 95% probability of obtaining a positive result (
