<p>The samples having a negative result by RT-PCR assay but positive by the novel RT-LAMP assay, or having a time threshold (Tt) difference of more than 15 min between the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP assays were subjected to further RT-nested PCR amplifications. The amplicons were processed for Sanger sequencing and further sequence analyses. The RT-nested PCR assay was performed using StarScript II Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (GenStar, Beijing, China) with F3 and B3 as outer primers, and F2 and B2 as inner primers (
