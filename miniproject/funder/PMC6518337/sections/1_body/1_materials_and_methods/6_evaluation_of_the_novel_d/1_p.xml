<p>To evaluate the performance of the novel RT-LAMP assay for pan-serotype detection of DENV, 153 plasma samples that were previously collected from dengue-suspected patients (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). DENV infection was determined by both NS1 antigen detection and specific RT-PCR assays. The NS1 antigen assay was performed using One-Step Dengue NS1 RapiDip
 <sup>TM</sup> InstaTest kit (Cortez Diagnostics, United States); the RT-PCR assay was performed using PrimeScript
 <sup>TM</sup> One Step RT-PCR Kit Ver.2 (Takara, Japan). Of the 153 samples, 120 positive samples by RT-PCR assay were further subjected to Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and 58 DENV-1, 5 DENV-2, 46 DENV-3, and 11 DENV-4 were identified. During September, 2018, the RNA stocks were tested again using both the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP assays. A comparison in performance of the four methods was performed, and the concordance rate was calculated by Clinical Calculator with the following formula: (number of consistent results by both methods/total number) Ã— 100%
