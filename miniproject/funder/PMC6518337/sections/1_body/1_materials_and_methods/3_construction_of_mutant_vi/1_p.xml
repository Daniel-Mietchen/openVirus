<p>To perform the proof-of-concept experiment of the mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP, a series of mutants that form mismatches with the F3, FIP and BLP primers were constructed using a fast mutagenesis system (TransGen, Beijing, China) based on the 3′-UTR region of the DENV-4 genome. In brief, the 3′-UTR fragment of DENV-4 was obtained using StarScript II Probe One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (GenStar, Beijing, China) with primers F3/134 and B3/4, and then sub-cloned into pMD18-T plasmid vector (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). A T7 promoter was fused to the 5′-end of the primer F3/134. Various mutants were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis with mutagenic primers (

Copy number of each mutant RNA was calculated using the following formula: RNA copies/μl = [RNA concentration (g/μl)/(nt transcript length × 340)] × 6.022 × 10
