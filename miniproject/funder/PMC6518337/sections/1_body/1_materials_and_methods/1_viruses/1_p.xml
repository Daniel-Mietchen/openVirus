<p>Four DENV strains DENV-1 (16007), DENV-2 (16681), DENV-3 (16562), and DENV-4 (1036) were used to establish the novel DENV RT-LAMP assay. Two other flaviviruses, Zika virus (SZWIV-01) and attenuated yellow fever virus 17D (derived from Asibi strain), and eight respiratory viruses were used to evaluate the cross-reactivity of the assay. The respiratory viruses include adenovirus (VR-930), enterovirus (VR-1076), influenza A and B viruses (VR-333 and VR-789), parainfluenza viruses 3 (VR-93), HCoV-229E (VR-740), HCoV-OC43 (VR-1558), and human rhinovirus (VR-489). Four DENV strains were gifts from Dr. Claire Huang (U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at Fort Collins, Colorado). The Asian ZIKV strain SZ-WIV01, isolated from human serum of an imported case of ZIKV infection in China in 2016, was obtained from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The yellow fever virus 17D was obtained from Dr. Cheng-feng Qin (Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing). The respiratory viruses were previously purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and stored at Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
