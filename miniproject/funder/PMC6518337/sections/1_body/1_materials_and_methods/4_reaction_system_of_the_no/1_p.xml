 <sup>®</sup> RT and Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (all from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, United States) were used to establish the novel mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP system. The main difference between the novel and the conventional RT-LAMP assays is the inclusion of an additional amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase in the reaction system. The amount of the Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase was optimized at 0.15 U per 25 μl reaction mix. A 25 μl reaction mix of the novel RT-LAMP assay includes 1× isothermal amplification buffer, 6 mM MgSO4, 1.4 mM dNTPs, 8 units of Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, 7.5 units of WarmStart
 <sup>®</sup> RT, 0.15 unit of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, 20 pmol each of primers FIP/123, FIP/4, BIP/123, and BIP/4, 2.5 pmol each of primers F3/134, F3/2, B3/123, and B3/4, and 20 pmol of loop primer BLP/1234. Three microliter of RNA was used for the RT-LAMP assays. The primer information was previously described and provided as

The RT-LAMP reaction was performed at 63°C for 60 min with 0.4 μM SYTO 9 (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, United States) as fluorescent dye for real-time monitoring by the Light Cycler 96 real-time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
