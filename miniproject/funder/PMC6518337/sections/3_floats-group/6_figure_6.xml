 <caption>
  <p>Sensitivity comparison between the novel mismatch-tolerant and the conventional RT-LAMP assays for four DENV serotypes. The sensitivity of the novel mismatch-tolerant RT-LAMP assay for each DENV serotype is highlighted in red and underline. Positive amplification was defined only when all three replicates are successfully amplified. NTC: no template control.</p>
