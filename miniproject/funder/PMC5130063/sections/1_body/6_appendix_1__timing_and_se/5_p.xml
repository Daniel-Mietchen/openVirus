<p>This same model was used for 4 countries—Japan (lag 2), Hong Kong (lag 3), Taiwan (lag 3) and Singapore (lag 2)—and for 3 meteorological parameters—temperature, absolute humidity and relative humidity. As this model carries autocorrelated terms, we used generalized least squares for model fitting. Coefficients from the fitted models are presented in Tables A1–A3.</p>
