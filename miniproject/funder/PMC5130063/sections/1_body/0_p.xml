<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has become an endemic childhood disease in East and Southeast Asia. Its main etiologic agents are human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus 16 (CV-A16). Although usually mild—with symptoms limited to &gt;38°C fever, malaise, rashes on the volar regions of the hands and feet, herpangina and difficulty eating and drinking—more rarely, infection can lead to complications of the nervous or cardiopulmonary systems. Such cases can result in long-term sequelae such as cognitive and motor disorders

 </sup> or death, usually from pulmonary edema or brainstem encephalitis.

 </sup>) means the death toll can be substantial (384 deaths in China in 2014

 </sup>). The EV-A71 virus seems to be responsible for more severe outcomes, while CV-A16 and other Coxsackieviruses, such as CV-A2, CV-A6 and CV-A10, usually present milder symptoms that resolve within a few weeks.
