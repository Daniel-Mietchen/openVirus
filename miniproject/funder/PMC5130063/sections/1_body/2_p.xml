<p>The objective of this paper is to provide a robust systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD that informs public health policy making about HFMD epidemics. The review covers 3 major areas: (1) history and seasonality of HFMD, and the efforts in predictive modeling; (2) risk factors for infection, to guide control and (3) global epidemiologic parameters, such as the incubation period and basic reproduction number, which may determine the effectiveness of control policies.</p>
