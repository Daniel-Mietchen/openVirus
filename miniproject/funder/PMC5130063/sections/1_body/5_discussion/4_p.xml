<p>The next step to analyzing the dynamics of HFMD seasonality is likely to involve social and environmental factors, another under-researched area for this pediatric disease. For instance, the literature is unclear on the relative importance of school versus community transmission, with evidence to support both, yet knowledge of where HFMD most often is transmitted is important as school closure policies are employed to control outbreaks in some countries. Further, the environment of schools in Asia may vary widely, and attributes such as hygiene practices should be characterized and quantified to allow more definitive results and conclusions in future studies.</p>
