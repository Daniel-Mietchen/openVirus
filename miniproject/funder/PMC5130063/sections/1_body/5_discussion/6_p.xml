<p>Studies on risk factors were rare, and we identified only 3 papers that describe risk factors for hygiene and contact patterns, making a meta-analysis of risk factors unfeasible. These typically were only powered to provide unadjusted effect sizes, and so provide evidence of correlation, not causation. One interesting finding was the apparent protective effect of a caregiver “always washing” their hands. This suggests that adult to child transmission might be important, even if adults are mostly asymptomatic with EV-A71 and CV-A16, but may reflect confounding with general hygiene. Future work may elicit hygiene factors at the preschool level and relate these to attack rates.</p>
