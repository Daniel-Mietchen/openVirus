<p>Despite the substantial number of papers on HFMD, this systematic review shows that many fundamental questions about EV-A71 and CV-A16 persist. Both viruses occur year round in tropical Asia, but are epidemic in the summer in Northeast Asia. A role for temperature or humidity therefore seems plausible,

 </sup> although given the relative lack of seasonality in equatorial Asia, it is not clear whether prediction of outbreaks is possible there. In Japan, summer temperatures peak after HFMD incidence does, suggesting correlation but not temporality, and that it may not be possible to provide early warning of impending epidemics. This also differs from other human enteric viruses including poliovirus 1 (also an enterovirus), hepatitis A and adenovirus that have been shown to survive longer on colder surfaces.
