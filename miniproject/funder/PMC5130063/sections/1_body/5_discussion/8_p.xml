<p>To reconcile the differences between the disparate estimates, the age distributions of the samples need to be considered. As shown in this review, symptomatic HFMD incidence rate differ greatly even between ages 0 and 6, and thus, studies conducted predominantly on preschoolers may derive higher estimates of R
 <sub>0</sub> compared with studies in older children. Accordingly, future studies on HFMD should use narrower age bands and also state the distribution clearly to allow adjustments or standardization.
