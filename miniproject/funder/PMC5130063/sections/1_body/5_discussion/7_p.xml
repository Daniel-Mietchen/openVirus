 </sup> To determine the cost-effectiveness of incorporating the vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules, or of other interventions such as school closure or isolation, would require epidemiologic models that account for the protective effects of herd immunity. However, this review indicates that vital parameters for such models remain unknown. The asymptomatic rate and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are both poorly known, while estimates of the incubation period, although commonly cited as 3–5 days, appear to be based solely on expert opinion. Most importantly, estimates of the basic reproduction number range widely from 1.1 to 5.5. This uncertainty prohibits utilitarian estimation of the necessary vaccine coverage to prevent epidemics of EV-A71.
