<p>The research questions in this systematic review were generally answered only by a limited number of papers, with substantial differences in their study design, and thus, most data were not synthesized through meta-analysis. More research to assess risk factors and measure key epidemiologic parameters is needed. We were also unable to trace the earliest cases of HFMD in Asia as our scope only covers published material on outbreaks, which leads us back to 1967 in Japan. Finally, we limited the scope of this study to exclude virologic characteristics or molecular epidemiology, which have been well reviewed elsewhere,
