<p>Even without being able to determine the relative importance of school versus community transmission, the effectiveness of school closure to prevent large-scale HFMD outbreaks is questionable, as the interruption to social networks cannot be enforced while children are out of school. Additionally, although we know little about the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases of HFMD, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic is substantial, and so even quite modest school closure attack rate thresholds, such as Singaporeâ€™s 25%,
