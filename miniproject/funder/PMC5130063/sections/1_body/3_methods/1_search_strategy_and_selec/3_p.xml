<p>Two independent readers examined each of the 407 abstracts to determine if specific research questions were answered. The 8 specific research questions were as follows: (1) What time of the year do HFMD outbreaks occur, and with what seasonal factors are outbreaks associated? (2) How long have EV-A71 and CV-A16 been circulating in Asia? (3) What age groups are at higher risk of infection? (4) What risk factors are associated with infection and severe outcomes? (5) Where do infections predominantly occur (home or school)? (6) What is the incubation period? (7) What proportion of infections are symptomatic? and (8) What is the basic reproduction number for HFMD by virus? An article was retained as long as both readers indicated that it answered at least 1 specific research question and was discarded if both readers agreed that no questions were answered. A third independent reader arbitrated when there was a disparity between the original readers.</p>
