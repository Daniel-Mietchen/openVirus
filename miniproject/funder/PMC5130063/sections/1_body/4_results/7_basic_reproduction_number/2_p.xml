<p>A second paper
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>
 </sup> used a method from Choi and Pak
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>
 </sup> to estimate the basic reproduction number to be 5.5 (interquartile range, 4.2–6.5) for EV-A71 and 2.5 (interquartile range, 2.0–3.7) for CV-A16. These estimates are likely inaccurate because the method assumes (i) a known generation time distribution, labeled incubation period in the paper; (ii) a completely immunonaïve population, though applied to groups of individuals for whom past exposure was highly plausible and (iii) an early exponential growth period, despite being applied to complete outbreak data.
