<p>Only 3 papers have sought to estimate the reproduction number for HFMD or the viruses that cause it. One paper

 </sup> estimates what they call the “local effective reproduction number” in China—meaning using the average number of secondary cases from a randomly selected index to estimate the cases that would be caused in a fully susceptible population (note, this is substantially different from the effective reproduction number
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>
 </sup> in a partially susceptible population)—using a sophisticated Poisson regression model that incorporated infection from the environment, the prefecture and neighboring prefectures. This model did not, however, account for the accumulation of herd immunity and required arbitrary assignment of the infectious period, so the estimated local effective reproduction number of 1.1–1.2 during peak periods may be biased.
