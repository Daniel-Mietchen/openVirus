 </sup> attempted to estimate the reproduction number using a SEIQRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Quarantined, Recovered) simulation model and obtained an estimate of 1.1 for the years 2009 to 2012 in China. However, the model used 10% of China population as the initial susceptible population, but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on this vital parameter.
