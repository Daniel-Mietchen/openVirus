<p>Although several studies report that the asymptomatic rate of EV-A71 infection is high, few studies report data (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Two studies, from Taiwan and Shanghai, tested sera for evidence of EV-A71 infection and asked patients or their families to recall past HFMD infection, deriving estimates of 29%

 </sup> and 10%

  <xref rid="R106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>
 </sup> of symptomatic infection, respectively. Some HFMD cases may have been caused by other enteroviruses, biasing these estimates upwards, while some may have been diagnosed as another viral illness or forgotten, biasing them downwards.
