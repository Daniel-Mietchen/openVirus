<p>The discrepancy between these 2 pairs of papers is substantial, undoubtedly because of differences in methodology. An overall estimate, combining the 4 studies, is 36% (33%â€“39%), but given the large discrepancy between studies, this estimate does not appear reliable. The latter pair of studies is prospective, thereby circumventing recall bias, and thus appear to provide a more accurate description of the epidemiology of enterovirus infection.</p>
