<p>The symptomatic HFMD incidence rate varies widely even within the narrow 0- to 6-year age-band. The greatest proportion of cases occur at ages 1 [18.8% (17.4%–20.2%)] and 2 [17.9% (16.6%–19.2%)]. By the age of formal schooling, from 6 years in most Asian countries, the proportion is substantially lower [8.7% (7.9%–9.5%)]. Overall, 82.6% (82.2%–82.9%) of all cases occur before age 6. The lower rate during the first year of life could be because of lack of contact with other children or to presence of maternal antibodies.
