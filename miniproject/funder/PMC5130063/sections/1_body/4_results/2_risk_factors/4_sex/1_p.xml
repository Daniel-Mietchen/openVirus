 </sup> study shows no statistically significant differences [OR: 0.94 (0.76–1.16)]. Taken together, these suggest that infection rates are comparable, but that boys are more likely to develop symptoms, more involved in propagation of outbreaks or more likely to be brought for medical care than girls.
