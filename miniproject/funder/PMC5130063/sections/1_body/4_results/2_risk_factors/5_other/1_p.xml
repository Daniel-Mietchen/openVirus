<p>A case–control study in Xi’an, China,

  <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>
 </sup> found that breastfeeding may lower the risk of developing severe HFMD [adjusted OR: 0.57 (0.33–0.98)], even though breastfeeding does not apparently lower the chance of being infected by EV-A71 [OR: 1.1 (0.93–1.3)].

 <sup>

 </sup> showed that sunshine could be protective against HFMD. This is agreed by a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
 </sup> which showed that UV radiation in classrooms is associated with lower HFMD attack rate (
 <italic>P</italic> value of 0.027), and recommended installing UV lamps to sterilize unoccupied classrooms. These findings are, however, inconsistent with the seasonal nature of HFMD, where outbreaks in temperate countries tend to occur in summer, when sunlight and UV exposure are strongest.
