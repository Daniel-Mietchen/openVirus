 <sup>
  <xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>
 </sup> as summarized in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. These reported outbreaks are unlikely to reflect the true first outbreaks of HFMD, as serologic studies provide evidence that by the time surveillance systems were established, EV-A71 and CV-A16 were already endemic in many of these countries. Early serologic tests conducted in Japan in 1970 show evidence of EV-A71 and CV-A16 circulation.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>
 </sup> Serum taken in the late 1990s in Singapore, before the start of surveillance in 2000, shows that around 50% children and 44% cord blood, indicating maternal infection, had already seroconverted to EV-A71.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>
 </sup> Blood samples from Taiwan (1989–1997) show 3%–11% EV-A71 incidence per year, and up to 68% of children
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>
 </sup> had serologic evidence of EV-A71 infection before the large HFMD outbreak of 1997. Similarly, although China has reported millions of HFMD cases since the beginning of the HFMD surveillance program in 2008, evidence from Anhui
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>
 </sup> shows high seroprevalence of up to 74.6% in older children before the 2008 outbreaks. Retrospective seroepidemiologic tests from blood serum collected in 2005
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>
 </sup> also show that China had positive rates of 32.0% to EV-A71 and 43.4% to CV-A16, indicating that outbreaks happened earlier but were simply not reported in the literature.
