<p>To assess how general the relationship between climate and transmissibility of HFMD was, we took incidence data from Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), that is, spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical latitudes, and fitted time series models to them. After controlling for contagion via autoregression terms, the effect of meteorologic factors was weak: a small positive increase in transmissibility with rising absolute humidity/temperature during the current week in Tokyo and Singapore. There was no evidence for temperature and humidity in having the same effect in Hong Kong or Taiwan, although rising relative humidity seems to decrease transmissibility in Singapore.
