<p>Several papers describe the incubation period (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) though it is striking that the majority do not provide a source to justify the claimed period. These unsupported claims vary substantially from paper to paper, from the incubation period “is” 3–6 days
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>
 </sup> or 3–7 days,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>
 </sup> “is usually 3–4 days, but can be ... 10 days or more,”
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
 </sup> or “is usually 3–5 days (range, 2–12 days),”
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>
 </sup> is “typically” 3–7 days
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>
 </sup> or 3–5 days,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
 </sup> ranges from 5 to 7 days
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
  <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>
 </sup> or 3 to 7 days
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>
 </sup> and the “usual period” is 3–5 days “with longest period of 7 days.”
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>
 </sup> Only a few provide evidence to justify the claim: one reports
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>
 </sup> that the incubation period is usually 3–7 days, citing a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) factsheet on aseptic meningitis. Another cites
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>
 </sup> an early study from Singapore,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>
 </sup> which presented the median and range for the serial interval (3 days [1–7]), not the incubation period. Another early study
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>
 </sup> states that the incubation period is “said to be” 3–5 days, but notes that this is inconsistent with the serial interval observed in the study. It appears that there is no empirical support whatsoever for any distribution of incubation periods.
