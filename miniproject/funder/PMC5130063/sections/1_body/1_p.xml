<p>There are nearly 25 years of literature from Asia that describes the epidemiology of HFMD, drawing on pediatric cohorts, national surveillance systems, outbreak investigations and clinical data, and from disparate countries that span stages of economic development and with climates that range from tropical to temperate. This diversity complicates attempts to identify general features of HFMD epidemiology and conceals gaps in the body of knowledge of this important pediatric disease.</p>
