  <p>Excerpts from studies on risk factors. Ruan et al case-control study in Qiaosi,
   <sup>
    <xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>
   </sup> China, was conducted by taking 273 diagnosed HFMD/herpangina as cases (6 years of age or younger) and 273 stratified random sample as controls. Park et al case-control study uses hospital cases of enteroviral aseptic meningitis (
   <italic>n</italic> = 205) and HFMD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 116), and nonenteroviral disease controls (
   <italic>n</italic> = 170). Their case-crossover design uses only cases. 1–7 days before admission was set as the hazard period, and 22–28 days prior to admission was set as the nonhazard period. Both studies gather data via questionnaires. White points indicate nonadjusted ORs, black points indicate adjusted OR. For the effect of sex (bottom right), confidence intervals are omitted from complete case notifications, and colored gray and white alternately for visual distinction.
