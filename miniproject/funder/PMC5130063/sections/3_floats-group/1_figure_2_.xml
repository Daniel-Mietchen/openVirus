  <p>Temporal incidence of HFMD or enterovirus and climatic factors for 4 Asian cities spanning temperate, subtropical and tropical latitudes. Top: incidence, temperature, absolute and relative humidity. Top panels indicate incidence (data in gray, mean and 95% interval in black) for the time period Jan 2001 to Mar 2012 (Tokyo), Jan 2001 to Dec 2009 (Hong Kong, Peoples Republic of China), Jan 2001 to Dec 2011 (Taiwan, Republic of China) and Jan 2001 to Jan 2012 (Singapore). Middle and bottom panels show mean daily temperature, absolute and relative humidity at Tokyo Narita, Hong Kong International, Taipei Taoyuan International and Singapore Changi airports, downloaded from the Weather Underground. Bottom: Coefficients of meteorological variables at 0â€“2 week time lags in autoregressive models of Z-scored HFMD case counts to facilitate comparison between locations. Each city is analyzed separately using a model in which HFMD incidence in week t is (auto)regressed on incidence in weeks t-1 up to t-3 (using the Akaike information criterion to select the order of the autoregression component) and, independently, on each meteorological variable. Weather parameters are not regressed together in a single model because of collinearity. The effect of weather on HFMD incidence can be seen by coefficient mean (points) and 95% confidence intervals (lines), colored red if statistically significant at the 5% level.</p>
