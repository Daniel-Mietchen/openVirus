  <p>Temporal patterns of HFMD outbreaks in Asia, by latitude. Left: Plot Digitizer is used to convert charts into numbers. White boxes are the months where HFMD cases fall below the year’s median. The remaining cells are then shaded into 4 darker shades by octiles. The regions of China were based on Wang et al’s classification

   </sup>(C standing for central). The regions are arranged by latitude. South China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have subtropical climates. Areas further north are temperate, while the Southeast Asian regions are tropical. Right: The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation to its mean, and the proportion of cases in top 3 months is the proportion of cases of the 3 months with highest incidence to the annual incidence. Points represent 1 year per region. The lines are obtained from ordinary least squares regression with latitude as the independent variable and show how clearly defined epidemics become the further north from the equator.
