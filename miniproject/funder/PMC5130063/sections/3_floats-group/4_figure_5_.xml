 <caption>
  <p>HFMD cases by age and estimates of incubation period. Left: Each line indicates a unique data set (total 79 lines). Distributions within age ranges were assumed to be constant. The black dots are average proportion for that age (with 95% CI). Right: Reported incubation periods for HFMD, by year of publication and provision of evidence to support claimed period. Lines indicate that the incubation period “is X days.” Gray bars indicate that the incubation period is “usually” or “typically” X days. Gray bars with lines shows an extended interval “can be up to X days.” The point indicates a median. 
   <italic>Notes</italic>: (1) provides information within the paper, which is inconsistent in this estimate; (2) uses generation interval distribution as a proxy for incubation period; (3) cites a US CDC factsheet on aseptic meningitis, which in turn provides no supporting evidence and (4) cites Goh et al.
