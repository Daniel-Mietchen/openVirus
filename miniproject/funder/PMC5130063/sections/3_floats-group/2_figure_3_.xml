 <caption>
  <p>Historical establishment of HFMD in Asia. Dots represent a reported outbreak in that year, with the main causal agent written below. Boxes with right arrow indicate endemicity of HFMD, evidenced by repeated reporting of HFMD. Boxes with left arrow indicate seroepidemiologic evidence that the pathogen is already in existence, even if no significant outbreaks were documented previously. Triangles indicate the point where data on HFMD started to be collected systematically, for example, through government surveillance. The length of the left arrows are arbitrary as there is no way to know how long has HFMD been circulating before the tests.</p>
