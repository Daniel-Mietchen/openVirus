<p>Healthcare clinicians need to have conversations surrounding vaccine hesitancy even with parents of children who appear to be broadly up-to-date on their vaccines and thus appear to generally support the concept of vaccination. These parents are unlikely to give any indication of their skepticism of influenza vaccines yet this study finds that they may opt to not have their child vaccinated against influenza. Pediatricians and other healthcare clinicians who see children should consider adding questions to their history and physical protocols pertaining to parental history of refusing or delaying vaccination, as well as pertaining to vaccine hesitancy both broadly and specifically to influenza regardless of the childâ€™s general vaccine history.</p>
