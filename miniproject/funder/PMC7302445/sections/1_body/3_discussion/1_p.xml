<p>A concerning main finding of this study is that nearly half of very young US children have “hidden vulnerability to influenza.” These children are UTD on a large series of vaccine recommendations (a 19-shot, 7-vaccine series)–and would otherwise seem like neither a population vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases nor suggest their parents would have tendencies to refuse vaccination–but yet are not UTD on influenza vaccinations. A recent study of complete influenza vaccine uptake among very young NIS children found nearly identical uptake [

We were able to examine this finding including comparisons to both uptake of other vaccines and adjusting for parental attitudes toward vaccination and vaccine-preventable diseases.
