<p>This study provides important findings and data regarding “hidden vulnerability to influenza”–a phenomenon whereby nearly half (44%) of very young US children are up-to-date on a large series of routinely-recommended vaccines yet are not UTD against influenza by their second birthday–despite high morbidity of influenza in this age group. Independent of an expansive set of confounders, the most important factor predicting vaccine vulnerability is history of vaccine refusal, though there was also an independent, unique association of hidden vulnerability to influenza with having never delayed vaccination.</p>
