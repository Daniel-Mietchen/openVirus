<p>This study has the goal of replicating prior studies examining determinations of influenza vaccine uptake of very young children while directly addressing the three aforementioned sets of limitations. To do so, this study uses a nationally-representative sample of very young children in the US that includes provider-verified vaccination status and constructs across all domains noted in the literature, including federally-restricted variables about parental attitudes of vaccination and accounting for intersectionality. It examines determinants of a newly-identified vulnerable population: those with “hidden vulnerability to influenza”–i.e., children UTD on a wide variety of vaccine recommendations (the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series) except influenza.</p>
