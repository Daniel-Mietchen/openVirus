 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides weighted bivariate correlations (i.e., not adjusted for any other variables) between the three UTD outcomes and each covariate. There were several determinants associated with vulnerability across all of the UTD outcomes (see the shaded gray cells), but two findings were unique to “series but not influenza”–children in households speaking Spanish or another language (9 percentage points more likely than English households to have hidden vulnerability to influenza, p = 0.023), and never delaying vaccination (8 percentage points more likely than ever delaying to have hidden vulnerability to influenza, p = 0.003).
