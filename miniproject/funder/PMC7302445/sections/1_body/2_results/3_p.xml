 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows weighted results from LPM regression of the “series but not influenza” outcome onto all determinants (i.e., adjusted for all variables), including interaction terms. Comparing all columns, several patterns emerge (see the shaded gray cells). Ever refusing vaccination was associated with 9.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.2–15.7) 
 <italic>higher</italic> probability of “series but not influenza” (hidden vulnerability to influenza) despite that ever delaying (not necessarily refusing) was associated with 7.5 percentage points (95% CI 2.6–12.5) 
 <italic>lower</italic> probability of “series but not influenza.” The direction of the delay finding was unexpected from what was observed in the other two outcomes (
