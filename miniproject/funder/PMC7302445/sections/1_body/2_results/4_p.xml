<p>Some interaction term coefficients in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> related to combinations of mother’s education and child’s race/ethnicity were significant and the direction of the “series but not influenza” coefficients were also different than what would be expected from the other two outcomes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234466.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These warrant exploration of patterns among the interaction term variables and suggest that intersectionality matters for hidden vulnerability to influenza. Accordingly, to interpret interaction term coefficients, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows weighted, predicted probabilities of each UTD outcome among all possible combinations of interaction terms. There were no significant interaction term coefficients involving mother’s marital status in the “series but not influenza” outcome from 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and no significant differences in predicted probabilities of intersectional subgroups in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. There were also no significant differences within predicted probabilities of each lone intersectional construct (see
