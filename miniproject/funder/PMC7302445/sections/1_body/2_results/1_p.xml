 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> contains weighted descriptive statistics of the complete case sample. By their second birthday, 33% of children were UTD on influenza vaccinations, and 71% were UTD on the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series. The cross-section of these variables (this studyâ€™s outcomes) reveals that 27% were UTD on both, 23% were UTD on neither, and 44% were UTD on the series but not influenza vaccines (again, the latter variable being the main interest of this study).
