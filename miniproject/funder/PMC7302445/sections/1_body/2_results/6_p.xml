<p>Finally, the triple-interaction term coefficients were examined to further explore the above intersectionality finding. In 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Hispanic children with married, college-educated mothers were significantly more likely to be in the “series but not influenza” group (0.603: 0.489–0.717) than non-Hispanic White children with college-educated mothers regardless of whether the mother was married (0.366: 0.319–0.413) or not (0.295: 0.166–0.424). Visualizing this in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g003">Fig 3</xref>, which stratifies 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g002">Fig 2</xref> by mother’s marital status, a clear trend emerges: the patterns seen among married mothers (top panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g003">Fig 3</xref>) closely mimic the unstratified relationship depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Looking at the pattern among mothers never married, widowed, divorced, separated, or deceased (bottom panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g003">Fig 3</xref>), however, reveals a divergence in Hispanic women: attainment of a college degree is associated with hidden vulnerability to influenza among Hispanic children only with married Hispanic mothers. Hispanic mothers not in the married group appear to have the same education interaction as non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Other/multiple race children. The direction of the interaction term coefficient compared to its interaction term coefficient in the “both” or “neither” columns of 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> suggests this is unique to “series but not influenza” vulnerability.
