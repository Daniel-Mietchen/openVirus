<p>However, examination of the predicted probabilities of “series but not influenza” among child’s race/ethnicity*mother’s education subgroups elucidates why there were significant interactions terms observed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. First, Hispanic children with college-educated mothers have higher probability (0.565: 95% CI 0.447–0.683) of “series but not influenza” than non-Hispanic White children with college-educated mothers (0.344: 0.291–0.396) despite that the former had one of the lowest predicted probabilities of the “both” outcome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234466.s002">S2 Table</xref>); this indicates that a unique identifier of hidden vulnerability for influenza is in Hispanic children with college-educated mothers. Second, examining the graphical representation of this relationship (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234466.g002">Fig 2</xref>) shows that mother’s education is associated with reduced “series but not influenza” probability among non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Other children but increased probability for non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic children.
