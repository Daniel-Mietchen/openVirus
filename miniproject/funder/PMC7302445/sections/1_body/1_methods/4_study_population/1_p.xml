<p>Respondents were eligible for the study if they: (1) had provider-verified data (NIS-defined eligibility for the outcome variables; also addresses recall bias gap in other literature); (2) were not ineligible for the influenza UTD variable by age at survey date (NIS-defined eligibility for the outcome variables); and (3) received the Parental Concerns module (8,065 total eligible children). Complete case analysis was performed; 89.8% of the eligible sample were complete cases across all variables (N = 7,246). Complete case status was neither associated with the main outcome (“series but not influenza” UTD status), nor 15 of 20 covariates. Because complete case status was only slightly associated with 5 of the 20 covariates, missingness was not completely at random (a key assumption for ruling out multiple imputation for dealing with missingness). Moreover, the large size of the complete case sample, relatively low complete case missingness, and lack of association between complete case status and outcome of interest all suggest complete case analysis to be less biased than other methods of dealing with missingness such as multiple imputation, [
