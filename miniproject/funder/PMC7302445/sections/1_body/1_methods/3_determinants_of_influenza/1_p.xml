<p>Vaccination is the use of a health service, so selection of determinants can be grounded in Andersen’s model of health services use, [
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which divides determinants into three factors: (1) 
 <italic>predisposing</italic> (e.g., child’s race/ethnicity, parental vaccine attitudes and beliefs); (2) 
 <italic>enabling</italic> (e.g., family income, health insurance); and (3) 
 <italic>need</italic> (e.g., functional state, need for medical care). The model also accounts intermediate-level health behaviors influencing health services use (e.g., personal health practices). Andersen’s model has been used across multiple healthcare system sectors in the context of a variety of diseases. [
