<p>Third, given interaction term coefficients are not directly interpretable, [
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] model-predicted marginal probabilities of UTD status among all interaction term subgroups were calculated and graphed. Analyzing double and triple interaction terms can be complicated to interpret from just the numbers, so we graphed the predicted probability to visually compare changes in the outcome of interest among all interaction term subgroups in a side-by-side manner.
