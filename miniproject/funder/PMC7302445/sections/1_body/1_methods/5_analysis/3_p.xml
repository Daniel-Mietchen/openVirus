<p>Second, each outcome was then regressed onto all determinants, including interaction terms for all combinations of child’s race/ethnicity, mother’s education, and mother’s marital status to incorporate intersectionality. Logistic regression is often used to examine bivariate outcomes, though we use Linear Probability Model (LPM) regression–Ordinary Least Squares regression of a binary outcome–because logistic regression does not produce straightforward interpretation of interaction terms.
