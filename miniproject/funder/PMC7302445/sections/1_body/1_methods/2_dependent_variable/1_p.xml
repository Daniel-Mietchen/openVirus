<p>Two binary NIS variables were used to construct the three dependent variables used in this study. The first is complete influenza vaccination–that is, whether the child received the full number of seasonal influenza vaccines given the number of influenza seasons they have experienced by their second birthday and when the survey was administered (children not 6–23 months of age during the span of September 1 to December 31 are “not eligible;” see Section 7.8.1 and Table 7 of the survey user’s guide [
 <xref rid="pone.0234466.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). The second variable captures whether the child is UTD on the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series. The three binary dependent variables used in this study are combinations of these two NIS variables–being UTD on: (1) “both” requirements; (2) “series but not influenza” requirements; and (3) “neither” requirement. These terms are used throughout the paper. The focus of this study is on the “series but not influenza” outcome in order to address the gap of identifying determinants that uniquely predict children UTD on a wide variety of vaccine recommendations except influenza in order to predict “hidden” vulnerability to influenza.
