 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>The data are owned by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Others can obtain access to these data at a Federal Statistical Research Data Center in the same manner that the authors did. To do so, they must submit a proposal to the NCHS for the restricted data, have the proposal approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and then successfully follow guidance for receiving Special Sworn Status (SSS) from the United States Census Bureau. Then they will receive access to the data at a Federal Statistical Research Data Center. Interested researchers can email the NCHS Research Data Center at 
  <email>rdca@cdc.gov</email> to ask question about the data or the process for obtaining the data. More information on the application process for obtaining the data can also be found at
