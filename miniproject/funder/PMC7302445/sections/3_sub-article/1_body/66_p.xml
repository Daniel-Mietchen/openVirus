<p>Reviewer #1: This manuscript presents an analysis of nationally representative survey data on influenza vaccine uptake in young children. The authors investigate cross-sectional associations with a number of predictors of vaccination, including social and demographic variables and past vaccine utilization. Importantly, the analysis also seeks to identify intersectionality, which is a novel and important approach that represents a significant contribution to the literature on vaccine hesitancy. Overall, the analysis is rigorous, the conclusions are supported by the data, and the manuscript is well-written and clear. I agree with the authors' conclusion that it is concerning that there may influenza vaccine specific hesitancy, even among parents who are regularly choosing vaccination for their children to prevent other diseases. I have some questions and comments, which I believe would strengthen the manuscript. These comments are separated by manuscript section below.</p>
