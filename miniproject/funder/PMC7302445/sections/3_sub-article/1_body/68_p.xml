<p>It is important that the authors are clear about their assertions about risk of influenza and benefits of influenza vaccine. Specifically, children &lt; 5 years old are typically considered to be at lower risk of influenza infection than school aged children (most likely due to to contact patterns), unless they attend child care outside of the home. The references cited here are reporting risk of complications due to influenza infection (e.g. pneumonia) which children &lt;5 ARE considered to be at especially high risk for developing. I suggest a minor change to the language to indicate that these children are at higher risk of complications, rather than saying they are simply at high risk of influenza. Similarly, influenza vaccination is the most effective preventive measure for prevention of infection,</p>
