<p>There is much mention of parental attitudes to vaccination however no mention of potential impact of provider attitudes to influenza vaccination. I am unaware what research has been conducted in this area in the US, but there is certainly evidence from other countries that ‘hesitancy’ amongst providers regarding influenza vaccination is higher than for other vaccines, particularly related to the comparatively low effectiveness of influenza vaccine, which may impact on recommendation/ strength of recommendation. This is important given the extensive evidence that strong provider recommendation is a key determinant of vaccine uptake. While parent perception of strength of physician’s vaccine recommendation was included as a variable in this study, with no significant associations detected, I assume that this was framed in the survey in general terms rather than specific to particular vaccines such as influenza. Suggest add brief discussion of this issue to the limitations section.</p>
