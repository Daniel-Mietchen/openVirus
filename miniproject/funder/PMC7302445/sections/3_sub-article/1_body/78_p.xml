<p>Reviewer #2: This is a generally well written manuscript describing what appears to be a very well designed and conducted study (although I am unable to comment definitively on the appropriateness/rigour of the statistical analyses as this is not my particular area of expertise) exploring an important area where previously published research is limited, and with findings that should be of broad interest. A few suggestions to enhance the paper are provided.</p>
