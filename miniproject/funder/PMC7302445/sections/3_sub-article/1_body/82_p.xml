<p>It is not clear how ‘complete influenza vaccination’ has been assessed. This is described as “whether the child received the full number of influenza vaccines given the number of influenza seasons they have experienced by their second birthday”. However as noted above this depends on both age and number of doses previously received. In this age group, if assessing ‘complete influenza vaccination’ for the most recent influenza season this would require two doses to have been received unless two doses had been received in the previous season, in which case would only require one dose. Suggest reword to make clearer how assessed.</p>
