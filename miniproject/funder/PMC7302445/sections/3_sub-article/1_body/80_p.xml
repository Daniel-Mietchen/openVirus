<p>The sentence “Further, “complete uptake” – receiving the appropriate number of influenza vaccinations for the child’s age – is much lower, peaking at 45% in children 6-23 months old” is confusing. Children aged &lt;9 years require 2 doses in their first season of vaccination so the number of doses of influenza vaccination recommended in any particular season depends on both the age and number of doses previously received. The paper cited looked at children aged 6-23 months from 2002 to 2012 and found that complete vaccination in this age group peaked at 45% in 2011/12, which is a quite different conclusion from that noted above. Complete vaccination for children aged 2-&lt;5 years, who will often only need one dose, will be higher. Suggest reword this sentence.</p>
