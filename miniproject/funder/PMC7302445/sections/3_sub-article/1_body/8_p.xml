<p>According to the journal criteria  an analytical, cross-sectional study, like this one must has been conducted rigorously. However, the methods used are not clearly presented.  The work contains some methodological mistakes which  diminish its quality. I suggest to reconsider the methods used (see the list of reviewers’ comments below).</p>
