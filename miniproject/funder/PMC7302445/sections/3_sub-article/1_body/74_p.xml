<p>The tables are difficult to read and interpret due to the large number of variables and interactions tested. I would recommend that the authors present interesting findings and relevant supporting information in the main tables and move everything else to supplemental tables. Another possibility is to present only the "series but not flu" outcome in the main tables and move other outcomes to a supplementary table.</p>
