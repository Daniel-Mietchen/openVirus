<p>The primary outcome of interest is potentially problematic due to the annual nature of influenza vaccines. Unless I am misunderstanding this outcome, a 2 year old child who received two doses of influenza vaccine in the year of the survey (2011) but was unvaccinated in the previous year (2010) would be considered to have "hidden vulnerability" to influenza. This is true, even though, by ACIP recommendations that child would be considered fully vaccinated against influenza for the 2011 season. In addition, that child may actually have higher antibody titres to vaccine strains and be expected to have higher vaccine effectiveness (due to negative interference) for the 2011 season. At a minimum, I recommend a sensitivity analysis where children are classified as "fully vaccinated", "partially vaccinated" or "unvaccinated" against influenza using ACIP guidelines to determine this categorization.</p>
