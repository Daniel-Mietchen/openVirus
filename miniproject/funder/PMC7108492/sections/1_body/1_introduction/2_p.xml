<p>These challenges notwithstanding, the west African Ebola epidemic led to a paradigm shift in EID preparedness (

Experimental vaccines and therapeutics were deployed during this outbreak, thanks to over a decade of R&amp;D into biodefense-related Ebola countermeasures and because the vesicular stomatitis virus–Ebola virus vaccine manufactured by Merck demonstrated effectiveness in field trials (

However, none of these products was ready to deploy in time to change the course of the outbreak, due to the insufficiency of clinical data on safety and efficacy plus absence of product stockpiles. Although the trials assessing the vesicular stomatitis virus–Ebola virus vaccine did not commence until late in the epidemic, their success suggested a pathway for better preparedness against future epidemics: namely, advancement of biomedical countermeasures through human trials in anticipation of emergencies and making the most promising of these quickly available for efficacy testing and use if and when emergencies were to occur.
