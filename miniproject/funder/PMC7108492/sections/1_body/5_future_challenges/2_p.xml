<p>In view of this risk of failure, the full cost of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical to clinical efficacy trials and readiness for emergency use can vary, on average, from $300 million to $500 million (

CEPI has so far committed more than $458 million to EID vaccine-development projects, and whereas the full costs of vaccine development are expected to be shared with funding and development partners, concrete clinical outcomes are likely going to take several years to materialize. If vaccines were to be developed for all of the EIDs prioritized by WHO, an average $2.8â€“3.7 billion would be needed to support vaccine development through phase 2 trials, depending on cost structures of vaccine development programs and R&amp;D pipeline attrition (

Improved coordination among industry, global health, and civil-society institutions, and guidance from regulators will also be needed to determine the public health needs for key diseases and to iron out technical and regulatory pathways for feasible vaccine development.
