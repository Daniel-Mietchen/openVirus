<p>CEPI’s R&amp;D portfolio includes several vaccines based on attenuated viruses, viral vectors, DNA, RNA, and protein-based approaches. Some of these technologies are established and already being tested in the clinic, such as a measles-vector–based vaccine against chikungunya developed by Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) (

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>); a DNA-based vaccine against Lassa virus (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and MERS-CoV, being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals (Plymouth Meeting, PA) (

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Other approaches, such as RNA vaccines, are in earlier phases of development but show great promise for application against multiple pathogens and rapid production. In addition, CEPI has set aside funds to support the development of Ebola vaccines. This research funding will be complementary to current efforts in this field, and investments will be coordinated with other funders, where necessary, to avoid duplication of work.
