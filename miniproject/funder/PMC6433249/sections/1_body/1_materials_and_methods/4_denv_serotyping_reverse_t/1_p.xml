<p>The four DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents (POCKIT Dengue Virus Serotype 1 Reagent Set, POCKIT Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Reagent Set, POCKIT Dengue Virus Serotype 3 Reagent Set, POCKIT Dengue Virus Serotype 4 Reagent Set; GeneReach) were performed as described in their user manuals. Briefly, lyophilized RT-iiPCR reagent was rehydrated with 50 μl of Premix buffer (GeneReach), and 5 μl of sample was added to the mixture. Subsequently, 50 μl of the final mixture were transferred to an R-tube (GeneReach), which was spun briefly in a cubee mini centrifuge (GeneReach), The R-tubes were placed into the reaction chamber of a POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer or a hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus Nucleic Acid Analyzer, and a run was initiated. The default program, including an RT step at 50°C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95°C for about 30 min, was completed in less than 1 h. Results based on signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios according to the default S/N thresholds used by the built-in algorithm [
