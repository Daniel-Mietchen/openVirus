<p>Nucleic acid extraction was performed by using the taco Preloaded DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (GeneReach) on a taco mini Automatic Nucleic Acid Extraction System (taco mini; GeneReach) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, sample (200 μl) were added into the first well of the extraction plate and the automatic extraction steps were performed. All nucleic acids were subjected subsequently to the respective serotyping RT-iiPCR and the reference qRT-PCR systems in parallel. For mosquito samples, before taco mini extraction, each mosquito was homogenized in 250 μl PBS with a disposable grinder and centrifuged briefly. Subsequently, 200 μl of the upper aqueous sample were transferred into the first well of the preloaded extraction plate before starting the extraction program.</p>
