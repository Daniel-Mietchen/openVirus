<p>The 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (UGAL) mosquito strain was used in this study and infected with DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 or DENV-4 by micro-injection (nanoinjector) into the thoracic cavity. Adult female mosquitoes, aged 7–8 days, were cold anesthetized and inoculated using a microcapillary needle that had been pulled to a point with needle puller. The 4 serotype of dengue virus stocks were standardized to 2x10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml, and 0.2 μl was injected into each mosquito (approximately 400 PFU/mosquito). Infected mosquitoes were maintained in cages at 28 ± 1°C and 70% ± 5% relative humidity with 12h/12h light-dark cycle and fed with 10% sucrose solution. Three infected mosquitoes were collected every other day for the 7-day incubation period to determine the virus titers. The remaining mosquitoes were frozen and stored at −80°C until further use.
