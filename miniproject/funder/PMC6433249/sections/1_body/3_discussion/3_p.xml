<p>In DENV diagnosis, DENV serotyping is also important since DENV-2 and DENV-3 are more often associated with severe diseases than the other serotypes [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/POCKIT system validated previously for the detection of all four DENV serotypes in human plasma and serum [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] is useful in aiding the identification of acute DENV infection, especially for remote regions with high burdens of DENV infection. However, this system could not differentiate between different DENV serotypes. In this study, we showed that the four new RT-PCR reagents for DENV serotyping can work on the same field-deployable PCR system to serve as tools to allow timely near-patient serotyping of DENV in human and mosquitos to facilitate efficient disease management and public health surveillance.
