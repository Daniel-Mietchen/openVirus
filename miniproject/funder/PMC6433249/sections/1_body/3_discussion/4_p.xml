<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, similar to that of the reference qRT-PCR for all four serotypes, the sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR system was at biological titers of around 10
 <sup>0</sup> PFU/ml. This was consistent to the performance of other molecular detection methods for DENV [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As reported previously, RNA copy numbers were likely significantly higher than PUFs, due to defective virus particles or viral RNA freed from infected cells in the sample matrix [
