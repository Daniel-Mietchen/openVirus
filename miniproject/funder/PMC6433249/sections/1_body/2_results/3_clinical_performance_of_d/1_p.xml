<p>To evaluate the clinical performance of each DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagent, 40 serum samples (about 20 DENV serotype-positive and 20 DENV-negative) were tested for each respective reagent. For this purpose, 20 DENV-1, 20 DENV-2, 20 DENV-3, and 20 DENV-negative samples previously identified by a real-time PCR [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] were used. Due to the lack of DENV-4 positive clinical samples in the region, DENV-4 samples were prepared by spiking 20 DENV-negative human serum specimens with different concentrations of the DENV-4 DN9000475A stock (1.9 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/ml). The samples were subjected directly to nucleic acid extraction by the taco mini method. Nucleic acid extracts were tested by the respective DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents and the reference multiplex qRT-PCR in parallel. Completely matched results were found for DENV-1 detection (20 positive and 20 negative) between the DENV-1 RT-iiPCR and the reference qRT-PCR, as well as for DENV-4 detection (20 positive and 20 negative) between the DENV-4 RT-iiPCR and the qRT-PCR (

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, compared to the reference qRT-PCR, the DENV-1 RT-iiPCR and DENV-4 RT-iiPCR had 100% overall agreement (CI95%, 97.3–100%), the DENV-2 RT-iiPCR had 97% overall agreement (CI95%, 89.8–97.5%) and the DENV-3 RT-iiPCR had 97% overall agreement (CI95%, 89.8–97.5%), indicating that the four DENV serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents on the POCKIT system had clinical performance comparable to those of the reference qRT-PCR to detect their target DENV serotypes in serum samples.
