<p>Recently, the portable, simple and compact POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer (POCKIT, GeneReach, Taichung, Taiwan) which can automatically detect and interpret PCR results within one hour became available in mobile PCR laboratory formats [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A lightweight hand-held model, POCKIT Micro Plus Nucleic Acid Analyzer (POCKIT Micro Plus), that works with a built-in rechargeable battery is also available. In this system, insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) is achieved consistently in a capillary tube (R-tube, GeneReach) in a simple, specially designed insulated heater and relies on fluorescent probe hydrolysis for signal detection [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Various iiPCR/RT-iiPCR-based reagents, available commercially in a lyophilized format to facilitate long-term storage and easy shipping, have been validated to have analytical and clinical performance comparable to reference methods (real time PCR, nested PCR, virus isolation) for different important microbial pathogen hosts [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The POCKIT device has been bundled with easy field-deployable methods for nucleic acid extraction, with potential to serve as a flexible mobile PON tool for rapid DENV detection in human and mosquito.
