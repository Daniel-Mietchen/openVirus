<p>Timely on-site detection and serotyping of DENV in human and mosquito can potentially alert front-line health professionals invasion of a new or long time absent serotype, allowing timely implementation of intervention strategies focuses in those areas to help mitigate disease outbreaks in human [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Current methods to aid diagnosis of DENV infection include virus isolation (e.g. antigen detection immunofluorescence assay), nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs; e.g. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR], real-time RT-PCR [qRT-PCR]), and serological assays (e.g. NS1 antigen detection, plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT), and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although a number of NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are commercially available to detect NS1 antigen during the first few days of fever, they do not provide serotype information [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PRNT, antigen detection immunofluorescence assay are able to determine DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but they are both time-consuming, expensive, laborious, and feasible only in well-equipped laboratories. With relatively high specificity and sensitivity, NATs were recommended for the detection of DENV RNA by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several multiplex qRT-PCR methods capable of serotyping have been reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0214328.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, performance of qRT-PCR tests requires skilled technicians and relatively expensive equipment that are not available to remote areas or developing countries; transportation of specimens is another major obstacle. In order to bring early serotyping of DENV to points of need (PON), a rapid, easy, mobile, NAT method of high sensitivity and specificity is needed.
