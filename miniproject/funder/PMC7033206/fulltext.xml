However, the small-scale geography of migration networks and movement of HIV-positive individuals between communities is poorly understood. Here, we use population-based data from ~22,000 persons of known HIV status to characterize migratory patterns and their relationship to HIV among 38 communities in Rakai, Uganda with HIV prevalence ranging from 9 to 43%. We find that migrants moving into hotspots had significantly higher HIV prevalence than migrants moving elsewhere, but out-migration from hotspots was geographically dispersed, contributing minimally to HIV burden in destination locations. Our results challenge the assumption that high prevalence hotspots are drivers of transmission in regional epidemics, instead suggesting that migrants with high HIV prevalence, particularly women, selectively migrate to these areas.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">HIV prevalence varies throughout Africa, but the contribution of migration remains unclear.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a leading cause of adult mortality globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, is a prime example of the connection between population mobility and infectious disease. Early in the HIV pandemic, migration was found to be a major factor driving dissemination of the virus, and it continues to play a critical role in modern HIV epidemiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

Barriers to reducing HIV incidence include lower ART coverage among youth, men, and mobile and migratory populations, as observed in recent community randomized trials showing limited impact of immediate ART for HIV prevention on population HIV incidence in Southern and Eastern Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Despite the continued public health threat of HIV, global development spending on the disease has decreased by 20%, necessitating more efficient use of declining resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This has prompted calls for targeted HIV prevention, including geographic targeting of resources and interventions to high prevalence places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Fine-scale mapping of the African epidemic has revealed substantial and widespread variation in HIV prevalence throughout the African continent with one-third of the HIV-infected population concentrated in &#x0003c;1% of its area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Modeling studies of national and sub-national HIV epidemics on the African continent have found that targeting of high prevalence areas (i.e., hotspots) is an efficient use of public health resources, although these studies were conducted in settings where high prevalence areas corresponded to areas with the largest numbers of people living with HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. It is unknown whether targeting of high prevalence areas with a low density of HIV-positive people relative to the surrounding region would have similar impact. For example, fishing communities situated along Lake Victoria have among the highest HIV prevalence levels in Eastern Africa, but these communities have small population sizes and a lower burden of cases relative to the surrounding inland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Early modeling work focusing on highly infectious &#x0201c;core groups&#x0201d; suggests that targeting small numbers of infected persons with elevated sexual contact rates, such as Lake Victoria fishing communities, could abate the broader epidemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, though the extent to which geographic hotspots or other high prevalence populations function as sources of transmission to another population depends on the degree of connectivity between them as well as the epidemic dynamics within them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">HIV can be seeded from hotspots into other communities through two mechanisms: cross-community sexual partnerships or migration of HIV-positive individuals between communities. In previous work conducted in rural Rakai District, Uganda and surrounding areas, we showed that sexual partnerships with people outside a community of residence were especially risky for women and were likely responsible for ~25% of incident HIV infections among non-migrants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which migration from hotspots contributes to viral introduction in the Rakai region has not been previously reported. Here, we assess patterns of migration at the individual and community&#x000a0;levels and their association with HIV using longitudinal population-based data from persons aged 15&#x02013;49 years of known HIV status residing in 38 communities in Rakai between 2011 and 2015. Our surveys included four Lake Victoria fishing communities with extremely high HIV prevalence (~40%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Specifically, we assess the geographic scale and structure of migration networks linking these communities as well as the contribution of migrant-introduced infection to newly detected HIV cases. We also assess HIV prevalence among migrants moving into and out of fishing community hotspots and lower prevalence populations.</p><p id="Par7">Our results highlight four key findings. First, cross community migration is pervasive in rural Uganda, concentrated among young people, and common in both hotspot and non-hotspot communities. We also find that those who migrate are both more likely to have HIV and less likely be on HIV treatment than those who do not. Third, we find that migrants account for the majority of newly detected HIV cases in our study area. Lastly, our results show that those who move to hotspots come from a more geographically diverse pool of locations and have a higher HIV prevalence than migrants who move elsewhere. Overall, our results suggest that migration is common and associated with untreated HIV infection and that HIV hotspots preferentially attract high-prevalence, geographically diverse populations. These data imply that a deeper understanding of the link between migration and HIV is important for HIV control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cross-community migration is pervasive in rural Uganda</title><p id="Par8">Rakai District is a predominantly rural district in south-central Uganda (area ~2200&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup>, population ~518,000) bordered by Masaka District to the north, Tanzania to the south, and Lake Victoria to the east. The Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) is an open population-based household census and cohort of adults aged 15&#x02013;49 years conducted in 40 communities in Rakai District and surrounding areas since 1994<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">To understand the patterns of migrations in Rakai and their role in the spread of HIV, we analyzed data from 38 communities included in two sequential RCCS survey rounds. The first survey, denoted as R15, was conducted between 8 August 2011 and 30 May 2013. The second survey, denoted as R16, was conducted between 21 August 2014 and 30 January 2015. Communities included 27 rural agrarian villages, seven semi-urban trading centers and four Lake Victoria fishing communities.

At the community-level, HIV prevalence among in-migrants was significantly correlated with the HIV prevalence in the long-term residents of destination communities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). HIV prevalence in most cases was higher among migrants moving into and out of fishing communities regardless of their place of origin or destination (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), with larger differentials between migrants and residents observed in women than in men. For example, 45% (95% CI: 34&#x02013;59%) of female in-migrants from Masaka who in-migrated to fishing communities were HIV-positive compared to 13% (95% CI: 8.0&#x02013;19%) of women who in-migrated from Masaka to agrarian and trading communities (Poisson regression <italic>p</italic>-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

This analysis was restricted to in-migrants who moved from one of the nine inland or two fishing sub-districts only. The HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to an inland sub-district from one of the two fishing sub-districts was somewhat higher compared to the HIV prevalence of in-migrants who originated from one of the nine inland sub-districts (16.1% vs. 21.5%), and this difference was driven exclusively by female in-migrants. In comparison, the HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to a fishing sub-district was substantially higher than the HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to an inland sub-district. HIV prevalence among in-migrants moving to fishing communities did not statistically significantly differ if they originated from an inland or fishing sub-district (35.0% vs. 30.6%).</p><p id="Par27">Since the high prevalence of HIV observed among in-migrant populations in fishing communities could be because individuals rapidly acquire HIV after moving there rather than coming into destination communities already HIV positive, we assessed HIV prevalence by length of stay in fishing communities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). If individuals predominately acquire HIV after rather than before arrival, HIV prevalence should increase with duration of stay.

Using detailed data from a population-based cohort, we found that nearly one-third of the Rakai Community Cohort Study&#x02019;s population migrated over a 2-year period. Women were more likely to migrate than men and migrant women were more likely to be HIV-positive than long-term residents. HIV-positive migrants regardless of sex were less likely to use ART than HIV-positive long-term residents and preferentially moved to high-prevalence fishing community hotspots. However, migrants from these same hotspots did not account for a substantial proportion of HIV infections among inland agrarian and trading communities.</p><p id="Par29">Lake Victoria fishing communities have been classified as hotspots because of their extremely high HIV prevalence relative to the general population of Eastern Africa, and in 2013, the Ugandan Ministry of Health recognized fisherfolk as a key population eligible for immediate antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. One assumption driving this policy was that fishing communities serve as a source of HIV infection to much larger populations with lower HIV prevalence. However, our analysis of community-based migration networks suggests that HIV transmission dynamics is more complex than the assumption underpinning this geo-targeted initiative, showing that fishing communities predominately received high HIV prevalence in-migrant populations with limited out-bound connectivity to any given inland community.&#x000a0;These results are supported by recent phylogenetic analyses from these same study&#x000a0;communities and elsewhere in Uganda&#x000a0;showing that HIV&#x000a0;flows&#x000a0;more frequently from inland to Lake Victoria fishing communities than vice versa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">One hypothesis consistent with our data is that there is a dispersed sub-population of individuals (particularly women) with high HIV prevalence among migrating individuals. This high prevalence population is concentrated in hotspots, such as fishing communities, where they engage in high-risk sexual behaviors and amplify the local HIV epidemic. In Rakai, residents of Lake Victoria fishing communities are predominately male, more likely to be unmarried, and, irrespective of sex, have substantially higher levels of HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and unprotected sex compared to residents of inland communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Other research from Rakai and elsewhere in the Lake Victoria basin suggests that female sex work is common in fishing communities and that the mobility of women engaged in sex work is high and transient, so it is possible that this apparent female assortative mixing may be driven by sex work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, a prior qualitative study examining the HIV risk environment within the largest Lake Victoria fishing community in the Rakai study area found that financially vulnerable women working in restaurants and bars had been recruited there by their employers to have sex with fishermen with easily disposable cash incomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Another earlier qualitative study found that unmarried women in Lake Victoria fishing communities had sex almost exclusively with paying partners who were residents within the community<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Historically, the role of mobile women in HIV dispersal has received little attention despite higher female than male HIV prevalence and the increasing feminization of migration in Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Additional empirical and model-based transmission studies accounting for these migratory dynamics, population-size, and their possible relationship to sex work could be useful in determining the multifaceted role for high prevalence fishing communities in the broader East African HIV epidemic as well as other hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p id="Par31">Overall, migration was a pervasive phenomenon in our study communities with one-third of individuals classified as migrants. Migration was most common among youth in their teens and early twenties, a period during which Africans and women in particular are at high risk for HIV infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The relatively high mobility in fishing and trading communities is in part due to a seasonal fishing industry and their market economies. A prior study from Rakai showed that migration among youth has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, and that young persons who migrate are significantly more likely to engage in HIV-related risk behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. More recent research from Rakai&#x02019;s agrarian and trading populations showed that the first two&#x000a0;years following migration is associated with a two-fold higher risk for incident HIV acquisition compared to long-term residents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>; however, it is unknown whether migrants in hotspots face similar risks. In this study, women moving into hotspots had very high HIV prevalence regardless of the time spent in the fishing communities suggesting that many of these women acquired HIV before they migrated. In contrast, HIV prevalence increased more than two-fold two&#x000a0;years after arrival among in-migrant men, implying that these men are at high risk for HIV acquisition after coming into fishing communities. These data suggest a potentially critical role for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and medical male circumcision among this male sub-population.</p><p id="Par32">There are few population-based studies of internal migration and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and, consequently, little is&#x000a0;known about the overall contribution of migration to HIV burden at the sub-national level. In the RCCS, recent in-migrants accounted for 57% of all newly detected HIV infections, primarily among female migrants. These data imply that there is a constant introduction of HIV into African communities from external sources. This notion of frequent viral introductions is supported by molecular epidemiological studies showing multiple circulating strains and higher levels of HIV diversity in main road trading communities within this population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">We also find lower levels of antiretroviral use among in-migrants irrespective of sex. The relatively low levels of ART use among mobile persons likely results in poorer clinical outcomes and AIDS-related mortality as demonstrated in other settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. It is unclear whether migrants are a marginalized group with lower levels of ART initiation, or whether migration interrupts treatment use, or both. Though gaps in treatment coverage were greater among in-migrants than out-migrants when compared to residents, both mobile populations had significantly lower levels of ART use after adjustment for age and community type of residence, a finding supportive of the former explanation. There were also substantial changes in HIV treatment guidelines over the study period and scale-up of services may have been sub-optimal among in-migrants from places where the new guidelines were not applicable or were implemented at a slower-pace. The need to deliver HIV care to mobile HIV-positive individuals remains a major public health challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Programs that expeditiously identify new in-migrants and link them to care may prove especially useful in these settings.</p><p id="Par34">There are several limitations to this study. Migration dynamics were assessed from census data and do not account for short-term mobility. Notably, the majority of censused individuals who did not participate in the survey were away for work or school. However, a Kenyan study using mobile phone data showed that census data approximate overall patterns of mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Participation in the RCCS was also lower among young people, men, and those who out-migrated, but sensitivity analyses adjusting for potential selection bias using inverse probability weights did not significantly change estimates of HIV prevalence or ART use, and participation rates among in-migrants did not substantially differ from those of long-term residents. It is conceivable that participation among out-migrants was lower, because non-participants had already out-migrated prior to the surveys. We also defined migrants as anyone who moved into a study community, irrespective of how far they had moved. Boundaries of study communities were defined by the RCCS, which may be inaccurate, and even very small movements in residence were classified as migration events. Indeed many of the migration events we observed were hyperlocal, particularly in and around trading communities. We also used self-reported data to assess ART use, which may be subject to reporting bias. However, in a validation study we found a high specificity (99%) and moderate sensitivity (76%) of self-reported ART use compared to detection of antiretroviral drugs in plasma, regardless of migrant status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Lastly, while our results may not be generalizable to hotspots outside of the Lake Victoria basin, they should motivate investigation into the epidemic and population dynamics that give rise to hotspots elsewhere and caution assumptions about them in the absence of data.</p><p id="Par35">In conclusion, we find that migration in rural Uganda is common, particularly among younger persons and women, and that migrants have a higher HIV burden and lower levels of ART use. We also show that high prevalence Lake Victoria fishing communities attract HIV-positive migrant populations. However, migrants from fishing communities do not account for a substantial proportion of HIV infections&#x000a0;among adjacent inland communities, casting doubt on the assumption that hotspots necessarily serve as important infectious sources to neighboring general populations. Taken together, our results imply that achieving an AIDS free generation will require special efforts to reach mobile populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data and ethics approval</title><p id="Par36">We used data from the RCCS, an open population-based census and cohort.

RCCS migration data were then extrapolated to these population density maps to obtain the total number of in-migrants in each sub-district as well as in-migrants originating from a given location. A network graph of migrant flows was constructed with a directed edge drawn from sub-district A to sub-district B, if population A accounted for &#x02265;1% of in-migrants per year in population B. Edges and nodes were shaded to reflect to the HIV-prevalence among in-migrating and resident populations, respectively. Masaka District, Kampala, and Tanzania were also included in the network graph since these were identified as key sources of migrant populations; however, only edges directed from these locations were permitted since internal migration data from these populations were not available. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between HIV-prevalence among in-migrating and long-term resident populations at a community-level.
