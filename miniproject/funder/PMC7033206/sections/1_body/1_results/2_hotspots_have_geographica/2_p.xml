<p id="Par15">Median distance from place of origin was significantly greater among persons moving into fishing communities (median = 48 km, IQR: 33–84 km) than those moving into either trading (18 km, IQR: 6–44 km, Wilcoxon-rank sum 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001) or agrarian communities (18 km, IQR: 7–42 km, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Similar trends were observed among out-migrants from fishing communities who moved a median of 44 km (IQR: 24–76) compared to a median of 25 km (IQR: 3–156) and 27 km (IQR: 8–144) among out-migrants from trading and agrarian communities, respectively. Migrants of fishing communities also came from and went to a more geographically diverse set of locations than migrants from other RCCS communities (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Out-migrating men and women, younger persons, and HIV-negative individuals traveled further on average than other demographic subgroups or HIV-positive persons (Supplementary Fig.
