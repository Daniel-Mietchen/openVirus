<p id="Par14">We geocoded place of destination for 74% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4,122/5,585) of out-migrants and place of origin for 84% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4,637/5,498) of in-migrants censused, irrespective of survey participation (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Slightly more than half of these in-migrants (56%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,596/4,637) arrived from communities within Rakai District. A substantial proportion of in-migrants also came from the Masaka District (19%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 875), which borders Rakai to the north and Kampala (6%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 309), the capital city of Uganda. Of 233 international in-migrants (5% of all in-migrants), 92% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 209) arrived from the Kagera District in Tanzania, which is directly south of Rakai. Individuals who out-migrated also tended to move to other Rakai communities (41%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,792/4,122), Kampala (27%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,111), Masaka (18%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 731), and Kagera (3%,
