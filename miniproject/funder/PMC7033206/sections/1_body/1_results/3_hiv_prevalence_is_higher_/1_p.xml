<p id="Par16">HIV testing was performed for all consenting RCCS participants during both survey rounds. Among women, age-adjusted HIV prevalence was 30% higher among in-migrants compared to long-term residents across all study communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Analyses stratified by community-type showed that this disparity was driven by female in-migrants in agrarian communities whose age-adjusted HIV prevalence was 1.64 times higher compared to long-term residents (95% CI: 1.39–1.92). Prevalence of HIV among female in-migrants was somewhat, but not statistically significantly, higher than long-term residents in trading communities (Prevalence Risk Ratio [PRR] = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.95–1.65) and roughly equivalent in fishing communities (PRR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.93–1.26). HIV prevalence was also significantly higher among female out-migrants compared to long-term residents (PRR = 1.27; 95CI: 1.26–1.58), with the greatest relative difference observed among women in agrarian communities (PRR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.26–1.58).
