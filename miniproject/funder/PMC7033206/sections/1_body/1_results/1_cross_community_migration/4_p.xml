 </sup>. The overall rates of out-migration and in-migration estimated from these census data were 10.9 and 10.1 per 100 person years (py), respectively. However, migration rates varied markedly across communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Out-migration rates ranged from 5.4 to 24 per 100 py and in-migration rates from 4.2 to 23 per 100 py, with significantly higher levels of in-migration in trading centers (median = 16 per 100 py: IQR: 11–18) and Lake Victoria fishing communities (13 per 100 py, IQR: 12–15) compared to agrarian communities (7.2 per 100 py; IQR: 6.4–8.6; Wilcoxon-rank sum
