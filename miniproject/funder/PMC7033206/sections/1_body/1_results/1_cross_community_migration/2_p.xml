<p id="Par9">To understand the patterns of migrations in Rakai and their role in the spread of HIV, we analyzed data from 38 communities included in two sequential RCCS survey rounds. The first survey, denoted as R15, was conducted between 8 August 2011 and 30 May 2013. The second survey, denoted as R16, was conducted between 21 August 2014 and 30 January 2015. Communities included 27 rural agrarian villages, seven semi-urban trading centers and four Lake Victoria fishing communities. HIV prevalence ranged from 9% to 26% in agrarian communities, 11% to 21% in trading communities, and 38% to 43% in fishing communities.</p>
