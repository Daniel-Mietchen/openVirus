<p id="Par12">Among censused eligible persons who participated in at least one of the two surveys (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22,901), 29% migrated either into or out of the study communities. Migration was most common among adolescents and young adults aged 15–24 years, with in-migration peaking among men and women in their early 20s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). Similar trends in likelihood of migration by age was observed among out-migrants (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Overall, in- and out-migration was more common among women. Among R15 survey participants, 25% of women out-migrated compared to 22% of men (Poisson regression 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), and of R16 participants, 24% of women were in-migrants compared to 19% of men (Poisson regression 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). In- and out-migrants were less likely to be married and to work in agriculture compared to residents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Women most frequently migrated for marriage, for work, or to live with family and friends, while men mainly moved for work or to start a new household.
