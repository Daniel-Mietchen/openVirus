<p id="Par27">Since the high prevalence of HIV observed among in-migrant populations in fishing communities could be because individuals rapidly acquire HIV after moving there rather than coming into destination communities already HIV positive, we assessed HIV prevalence by length of stay in fishing communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). If individuals predominately acquire HIV after rather than before arrival, HIV prevalence should increase with duration of stay. Instead, we found no statistically significant differences in female HIV prevalence by duration of stay. However, HIV prevalence among male in-migrants increased with duration of stay from 18% to 39% over 2 years (Poisson regression 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.006), suggesting a substantial proportion of these male migrants likely acquired infection within the fishing communities.
