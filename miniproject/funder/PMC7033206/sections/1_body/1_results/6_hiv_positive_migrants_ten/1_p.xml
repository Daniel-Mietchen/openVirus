<p id="Par24">We assessed the geography of migratory movements using RCCS data aggregated to the sub-district-level and scaled to reflect local population densities (see Methods). There were nine inland sub-districts (abbreviated ISD1-9) including agrarian and trading communities and two fishing sub-districts including the fishing communities and four neighboring agrarian communities (abbreviated FSD1-2). The migration network showed strong links between sub-districts containing Rakai’s high prevalence fishing communities with Tanzania and Masaka District (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). There were multiple weaker links with Rakai District’s inland populations; however, these connections were predominately directed into rather than out of the two fishing sub-districts. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> shows that there were substantially more in-migrants moving from the inland sub-distracts to fishing sub-districts than vice versa, and that the majority of HIV cases among in-migrants were from inland sub-districts. Considering migrant populations from all places of origin and total HIV case burden in the sub-district, we estimated that out-migrants from hotspots contributed to no more than 1.3% (median = 0.4%: IQR: 0–1.1%) of all HIV cases in the nine inland sub-districts.
