<p id="Par25">The reconstructed migration network in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> showed that migrant populations with higher HIV prevalence moved into hotspot fishing communities. At the community-level, HIV prevalence among in-migrants was significantly correlated with the HIV prevalence in the long-term residents of destination communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). HIV prevalence in most cases was higher among migrants moving into and out of fishing communities regardless of their place of origin or destination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), with larger differentials between migrants and residents observed in women than in men. For example, 45% (95% CI: 34–59%) of female in-migrants from Masaka who in-migrated to fishing communities were HIV-positive compared to 13% (95% CI: 8.0–19%) of women who in-migrated from Masaka to agrarian and trading communities (Poisson regression
