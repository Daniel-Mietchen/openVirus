 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> summarizes HIV prevalence data among long-term residents and in-migrants by place of origin across the nine inland and two fishing sub-districts depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. This analysis was restricted to in-migrants who moved from one of the nine inland or two fishing sub-districts only. The HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to an inland sub-district from one of the two fishing sub-districts was somewhat higher compared to the HIV prevalence of in-migrants who originated from one of the nine inland sub-districts (16.1% vs. 21.5%), and this difference was driven exclusively by female in-migrants. In comparison, the HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to a fishing sub-district was substantially higher than the HIV prevalence among in-migrants who moved to an inland sub-district. HIV prevalence among in-migrants moving to fishing communities did not statistically significantly differ if they originated from an inland or fishing sub-district (35.0% vs. 30.6%).
