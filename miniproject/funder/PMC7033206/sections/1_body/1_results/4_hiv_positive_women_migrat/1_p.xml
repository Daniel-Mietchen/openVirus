<p id="Par20">We also assessed the relative risk of out-migration by HIV serostatus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Overall, HIV-positive women were 1.33 times (95% CI: 1.19.49) more likely to migrate compared to HIV-negative women after adjustment for age and community-type, with the greatest differences in out-migration by serostatus observed among agrarian women. In contrast, HIV-positive men were no more likely to migrate than HIV-negative men (Table
