<p id="Par35">In conclusion, we find that migration in rural Uganda is common, particularly among younger persons and women, and that migrants have a higher HIV burden and lower levels of ART use. We also show that high prevalence Lake Victoria fishing communities attract HIV-positive migrant populations. However, migrants from fishing communities do not account for a substantial proportion of HIV infectionsÂ among adjacent inland communities, casting doubt on the assumption that hotspots necessarily serve as important infectious sources to neighboring general populations. Taken together, our results imply that achieving an AIDS free generation will require special efforts to reach mobile populations.</p>
