<p id="Par30">One hypothesis consistent with our data is that there is a dispersed sub-population of individuals (particularly women) with high HIV prevalence among migrating individuals. This high prevalence population is concentrated in hotspots, such as fishing communities, where they engage in high-risk sexual behaviors and amplify the local HIV epidemic. In Rakai, residents of Lake Victoria fishing communities are predominately male, more likely to be unmarried, and, irrespective of sex, have substantially higher levels of HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and unprotected sex compared to residents of inland communities

 </sup>. Other research from Rakai and elsewhere in the Lake Victoria basin suggests that female sex work is common in fishing communities and that the mobility of women engaged in sex work is high and transient, so it is possible that this apparent female assortative mixing may be driven by sex work

 </sup>. Indeed, a prior qualitative study examining the HIV risk environment within the largest Lake Victoria fishing community in the Rakai study area found that financially vulnerable women working in restaurants and bars had been recruited there by their employers to have sex with fishermen with easily disposable cash incomes

 </sup>. Another earlier qualitative study found that unmarried women in Lake Victoria fishing communities had sex almost exclusively with paying partners who were residents within the community

Additional empirical and model-based transmission studies accounting for these migratory dynamics, population-size, and their possible relationship to sex work could be useful in determining the multifaceted role for high prevalence fishing communities in the broader East African HIV epidemic as well as other hotspots in sub-Saharan Africa.
