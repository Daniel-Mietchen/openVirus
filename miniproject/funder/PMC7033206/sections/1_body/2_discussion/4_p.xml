<p id="Par31">Overall, migration was a pervasive phenomenon in our study communities with one-third of individuals classified as migrants. Migration was most common among youth in their teens and early twenties, a period during which Africans and women in particular are at high risk for HIV infection

 </sup>. The relatively high mobility in fishing and trading communities is in part due to a seasonal fishing industry and their market economies. A prior study from Rakai showed that migration among youth has been steadily increasing since the 1990s, and that young persons who migrate are significantly more likely to engage in HIV-related risk behaviors

 </sup>; however, it is unknown whether migrants in hotspots face similar risks. In this study, women moving into hotspots had very high HIV prevalence regardless of the time spent in the fishing communities suggesting that many of these women acquired HIV before they migrated. In contrast, HIV prevalence increased more than two-fold two years after arrival among in-migrant men, implying that these men are at high risk for HIV acquisition after coming into fishing communities. These data suggest a potentially critical role for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and medical male circumcision among this male sub-population.
