<p id="Par34">There are several limitations to this study. Migration dynamics were assessed from census data and do not account for short-term mobility. Notably, the majority of censused individuals who did not participate in the survey were away for work or school. However, a Kenyan study using mobile phone data showed that census data approximate overall patterns of mobility

 </sup>. Participation in the RCCS was also lower among young people, men, and those who out-migrated, but sensitivity analyses adjusting for potential selection bias using inverse probability weights did not significantly change estimates of HIV prevalence or ART use, and participation rates among in-migrants did not substantially differ from those of long-term residents. It is conceivable that participation among out-migrants was lower, because non-participants had already out-migrated prior to the surveys. We also defined migrants as anyone who moved into a study community, irrespective of how far they had moved. Boundaries of study communities were defined by the RCCS, which may be inaccurate, and even very small movements in residence were classified as migration events. Indeed many of the migration events we observed were hyperlocal, particularly in and around trading communities. We also used self-reported data to assess ART use, which may be subject to reporting bias. However, in a validation study we found a high specificity (99%) and moderate sensitivity (76%) of self-reported ART use compared to detection of antiretroviral drugs in plasma, regardless of migrant status

 </sup>. Lastly, while our results may not be generalizable to hotspots outside of the Lake Victoria basin, they should motivate investigation into the epidemic and population dynamics that give rise to hotspots elsewhere and caution assumptions about them in the absence of data.
