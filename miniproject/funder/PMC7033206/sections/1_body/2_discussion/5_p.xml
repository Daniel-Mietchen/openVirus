<p id="Par32">There are few population-based studies of internal migration and HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa and, consequently, little isÂ known about the overall contribution of migration to HIV burden at the sub-national level. In the RCCS, recent in-migrants accounted for 57% of all newly detected HIV infections, primarily among female migrants. These data imply that there is a constant introduction of HIV into African communities from external sources. This notion of frequent viral introductions is supported by molecular epidemiological studies showing multiple circulating strains and higher levels of HIV diversity in main road trading communities within this population
