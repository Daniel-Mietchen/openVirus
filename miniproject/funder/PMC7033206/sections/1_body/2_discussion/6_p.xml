<p id="Par33">We also find lower levels of antiretroviral use among in-migrants irrespective of sex. The relatively low levels of ART use among mobile persons likely results in poorer clinical outcomes and AIDS-related mortality as demonstrated in other settings

 </sup>. It is unclear whether migrants are a marginalized group with lower levels of ART initiation, or whether migration interrupts treatment use, or both. Though gaps in treatment coverage were greater among in-migrants than out-migrants when compared to residents, both mobile populations had significantly lower levels of ART use after adjustment for age and community type of residence, a finding supportive of the former explanation. There were also substantial changes in HIV treatment guidelines over the study period and scale-up of services may have been sub-optimal among in-migrants from places where the new guidelines were not applicable or were implemented at a slower-pace. The need to deliver HIV care to mobile HIV-positive individuals remains a major public health challenge
