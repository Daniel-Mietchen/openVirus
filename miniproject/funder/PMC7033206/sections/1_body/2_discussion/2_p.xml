<p id="Par29">Lake Victoria fishing communities have been classified as hotspots because of their extremely high HIV prevalence relative to the general population of Eastern Africa, and in 2013, the Ugandan Ministry of Health recognized fisherfolk as a key population eligible for immediate antiretroviral therapy regardless of CD4 count

 </sup>. One assumption driving this policy was that fishing communities serve as a source of HIV infection to much larger populations with lower HIV prevalence. However, our analysis of community-based migration networks suggests that HIV transmission dynamics is more complex than the assumption underpinning this geo-targeted initiative, showing that fishing communities predominately received high HIV prevalence in-migrant populations with limited out-bound connectivity to any given inland community. These results are supported by recent phylogenetic analyses from these same study communities and elsewhere in Uganda showing that HIV flows more frequently from inland to Lake Victoria fishing communities than vice versa
