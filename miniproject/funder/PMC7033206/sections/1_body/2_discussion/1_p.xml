 </sup>. Using detailed data from a population-based cohort, we found that nearly one-third of the Rakai Community Cohort Studyâ€™s population migrated over a 2-year period. Women were more likely to migrate than men and migrant women were more likely to be HIV-positive than long-term residents. HIV-positive migrants regardless of sex were less likely to use ART than HIV-positive long-term residents and preferentially moved to high-prevalence fishing community hotspots. However, migrants from these same hotspots did not account for a substantial proportion of HIV infections among inland agrarian and trading communities.
