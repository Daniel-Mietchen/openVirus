<p id="Par40">Demographic characteristics were compared between long-term residents and out- and in-migrants using data from the survey at which they were first observed (R15 or R16). Because HIV prevalence significantly varied between agrarian, trading, and fishing communities, migration dynamics were analyzed separately for these community-types. Out-migration and in-migration rates were defined as the number of migrations per 100 person years among all persons aged 15â€“49. Cumulative distribution functions, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were used to summarize distances travelled between source/destination locations for migrant populations, and significant differences in travel distance between community types were assessed by Wilcoxon-rank sums tests. Generalized additive binomial models were used to assess the proportions of male and female censused populations who were migrants as a continuous function of age.</p>
