<p id="Par42">RCCS data were aggregated into sub-districts in order to reconstruct local HIV migration networks for the region. There was a total of eleven sub-districts, including nine inland sub-districts and two fishing sub-districts along the Lake Victoria coast. The total population aged 15–49 years was estimated for each sub-district using World Pop data (population density), RCCS census data on age distributions, and household GPS data using Bayesian hierarchical mapping methods as previously described. RCCS migration data were then extrapolated to these population density maps to obtain the total number of in-migrants in each sub-district as well as in-migrants originating from a given location. A network graph of migrant flows was constructed with a directed edge drawn from sub-district A to sub-district B, if population A accounted for ≥1% of in-migrants per year in population B. Edges and nodes were shaded to reflect to the HIV-prevalence among in-migrating and resident populations, respectively. Masaka District, Kampala, and Tanzania were also included in the network graph since these were identified as key sources of migrant populations; however, only edges directed from these locations were permitted since internal migration data from these populations were not available. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between HIV-prevalence among in-migrating and long-term resident populations at a community-level. All statistical analyses were performed in the R statistical software (V3.6.1), including network reconstruction, which was done using the igraph package. Maps were created using the raster package and GADM administrative boundaries.</p>
