<p id="Par37">The RCCS conducts a household census with no age truncation prior to the cohort survey. Census data include household GPS location and information on each household member including name, age, gender, marital status, and familial and marital relationships. Individuals who have migrated into or out of a household since the prior census are identified. The RCCS survey, conducted after the census, includes all consenting residents aged 15â€“49. Interviewers by same sex interviewers use structured questionnaires in the local language (Luganda) to collect sociodemographic, behavioral, and health information. Data are directly entered into mobile PCs and edited in the field.</p>
