<p id="Par38">Migrants were identified at census and defined as persons who moved to or from another community regardless of distance travelled or whether or not the source/destination community was under RCCS surveillance. Specifically, individuals surveyed in R15 who out-migrated to another community prior to R16 were classified as out-migrants. Conversely, individuals who in-migrated into a household from another community between surveys were classified as in-migrants at R16. Persons who did not change communities between the two surveys were classified as long-term residents. To be included in the RCCS survey, in-migrants were required to have stayed in the community for at least 1 month or &lt;1 month but with intention to stay in the study community for six months or longer. In contrast, individuals who resided in the community for less than one month with no intention to stay long-term were classified as visitors. Additional information was obtained on the reason for migration (marriage/divorce, work, living with relatives/friends, other), the movement type (migrated from within or outside a RCCS community), and the community of origin or destination (recorded as a free response). In-migrants provide this information themselves, whereas data on out-migrants was obtained from the head of household or a proxy (i.e., another designated household member) at census. Community of origin and destination for all migrants was identified on a map and geocoded using Google Earth by a team of two Ugandan co-investigators (J.B. and D.N.) with local expertise.</p>
