<p id="Par36">We used data from the RCCS, an open population-based census and cohort. Individuals, including migrants, can enter or exit the study population between surveys. The RCCS surveys individuals aged 15–49 in 40 communities in and near the predominately rural Rakai District of south central Uganda. RCCS communities are classified as agrarian (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27), trading (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7), and Lake Victoria fishing communities (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4). HIV-prevalence is significantly higher in fishing communities (~42%) than in either trading (~14%) or agrarian communities (12%). The study was reviewed and approved by the Ugandan Virus Research Institute’s Scientific and Ethics Committee (HS540), the Uganda Council on Science and Technology (GC/127/15/11/137), and Western Institutional Review Board, Olympia WA (20031318). Study participants provided written informed consent at each visit. Antiretroviral therapy and voluntary medical male circumcision were provided by the RHSP and the Ministry of Health through support from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).
