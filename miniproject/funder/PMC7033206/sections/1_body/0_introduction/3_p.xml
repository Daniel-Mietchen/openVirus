<p id="Par5">Fine-scale mapping of the African epidemic has revealed substantial and widespread variation in HIV prevalence throughout the African continent with one-third of the HIV-infected population concentrated in &lt;1% of its area

 </sup>. Modeling studies of national and sub-national HIV epidemics on the African continent have found that targeting of high prevalence areas (i.e., hotspots) is an efficient use of public health resources, although these studies were conducted in settings where high prevalence areas corresponded to areas with the largest numbers of people living with HIV

 </sup>. It is unknown whether targeting of high prevalence areas with a low density of HIV-positive people relative to the surrounding region would have similar impact. For example, fishing communities situated along Lake Victoria have among the highest HIV prevalence levels in Eastern Africa, but these communities have small population sizes and a lower burden of cases relative to the surrounding inland

 </sup>. Early modeling work focusing on highly infectious “core groups” suggests that targeting small numbers of infected persons with elevated sexual contact rates, such as Lake Victoria fishing communities, could abate the broader epidemic
