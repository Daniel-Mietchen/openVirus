<p id="Par7">Our results highlight four key findings. First, cross community migration is pervasive in rural Uganda, concentrated among young people, and common in both hotspot and non-hotspot communities. We also find that those who migrate are both more likely to have HIV and less likely be on HIV treatment than those who do not. Third, we find that migrants account for the majority of newly detected HIV cases in our study area. Lastly, our results show that those who move to hotspots come from a more geographically diverse pool of locations and have a higher HIV prevalence than migrants who move elsewhere. Overall, our results suggest that migration is common and associated with untreated HIV infection and that HIV hotspots preferentially attract high-prevalence, geographically diverse populations. These data imply that a deeper understanding of the link between migration and HIV is important for HIV control efforts in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
