<p id="Par6">HIV can be seeded from hotspots into other communities through two mechanisms: cross-community sexual partnerships or migration of HIV-positive individuals between communities. In previous work conducted in rural Rakai District, Uganda and surrounding areas, we showed that sexual partnerships with people outside a community of residence were especially risky for women and were likely responsible for ~25% of incident HIV infections among non-migrants

 </sup>. However, the extent to which migration from hotspots contributes to viral introduction in the Rakai region has not been previously reported. Here, we assess patterns of migration at the individual and community levels and their association with HIV using longitudinal population-based data from persons aged 15–49 years of known HIV status residing in 38 communities in Rakai between 2011 and 2015. Our surveys included four Lake Victoria fishing communities with extremely high HIV prevalence (~40%)

Specifically, we assess the geographic scale and structure of migration networks linking these communities as well as the contribution of migrant-introduced infection to newly detected HIV cases. We also assess HIV prevalence among migrants moving into and out of fishing community hotspots and lower prevalence populations.
