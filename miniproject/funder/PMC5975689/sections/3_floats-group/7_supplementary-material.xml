  <caption>
   <p>RT-LAMP primers design for PEDV nucleotide detection. Nucleotide sequence alignments of M gene of seven PEDV strains. Representative M gene sequences in each strain are aligned with clustalW. Sequence data of designing primers for RT-LAMP in this study (KT323979.1), the sequence used for RT-PCR (JX435310.1 and JN089738.1), the sequence of G1b S INDEL strain (KY619833.1), the sequence of G2b/Non S INDEL/North America strain (KY619838.1), the sequence of G2a/Non S INDEL/Asian strain (KJ960178.1), the sequence of NK96P4C6 G1a classical strain (KY619828). Primer recognition sites are indicated with primer names. (DOCX 28Â kb)</p>
