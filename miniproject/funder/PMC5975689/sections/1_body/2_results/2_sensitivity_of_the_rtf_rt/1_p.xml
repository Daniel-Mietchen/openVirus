<p id="Par30">To evaluate the sensitivity of the RtF-RT-LAMP assay, the detection limit was compared to the conventional one-step RT-PCR by amplifying ten-fold serial dilutions from the cell culture of two PEDV strains (NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−)). The detection limit of the one-step RT-PCR of the NK94P6 strain and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−) strain were 2.8 × 10

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In addition, we used other two field strains that were PEDV S INDEL and Non-S INDEL strains to confirm the sensitivity of RtF-RT-LAMP (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This was much higher than that of the one-step RT-PCR. The sensitivity of the RtF-RT-LAMP assay was 100 times higher than that of one-step RT-PCR. Moreover, the real-time DNA fluorescence intensity from the reactions at all concentrations evaluated was high when the reactions were performed within 40 min. Therefore, the optimal reaction condition of the current RtF-RT-LAMP assay for PEDV was optimized for 40 min.
