<p id="Par32">To estimate sample sizes for pooled faecal samples using the RtF-RT-LAMP assay, four positive samples were chosen from 50 positive samples based on amplification time in RT-LAMP and intensity of the electrophoresis band of RT-PCR products at different levels from the weakest positive to the strongest positive (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Sample 331 had the weakest electrophoresis band in RT-PCR. It was positive at the 25:45 min mark for amplification time, for which RT-LAMP can be positive until a pooling size of 15 samples. However, three other positive samples can be positive until a pooling size of 45 pooling or 50 samples (Table
