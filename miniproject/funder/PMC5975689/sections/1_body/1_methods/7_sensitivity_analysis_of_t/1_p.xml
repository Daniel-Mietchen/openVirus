<p id="Par25">To evaluate the sensitivity of the RtF-RT-LAMP, PEDV-infected Vero cell cultures of two strains (NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−)) with defined median tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was tenfold serial diluted with the supernatant of negative faecal samples. RNA was then extracted from 250 μl media of each dilution and used as a template for RtF-RT-LAMP and one-step RT-PCR as mentioned above.
