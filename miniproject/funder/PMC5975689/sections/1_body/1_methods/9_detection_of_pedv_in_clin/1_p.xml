<p id="Par27">A total of 99 faecal pig samples were collected from pig farms in Japan including 50 PED positive samples (from Kagoshima, Miyazaki, Aomori, Aichi prefectures) that were collected from December 2013 to August 2017 and 49 negative samples from a PED negative farm (Sumiyoshi farm, Miyazaki prefecture). These positive samples are classical, emerging Non-S INDEL, S INDEL, and S1 NTD-del PEDV variants and some positive samples are mixed infection of emerging non-S INDEL and S1 NTD-del PEDV variants. Faecal samples were prepared as a 10% (
