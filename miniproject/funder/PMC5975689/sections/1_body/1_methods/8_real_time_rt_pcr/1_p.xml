<p id="Par26">The quantitative One-Step PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara Bio, Japan) was used for the real-time RT-PCR to quantitate two PEDV field strains (PEDV S INDEL and Non-S INDEL field strains). A 198 bp DNA fragment of the N gene was amplified with the primer sets of forward primer (qN306-F) 5’-CGCAAAGACTGAACCCACTAAC-3′ and reverse primer (56R) 5’-TTGCCTCTGTTGTTACTTGGAGAT-3′. A TaqMan probe (ProbeN466–469) with the sequence of 5’-GCAGGAGTCGTGGTAATGGCAACA-3′ was labeled with the 5′-reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and the 3′-quencher BHQ3. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out in a 20 μl reaction containing 2 μl of RNA template, 10 μl of 2X One Step RT-PCR Buffer III, 0.4 μl of TaKaRa Ex Taq HS, 0.4 μl of both forward and reverse primer, 0.8 μl of Probe, 0.4 μl of ROX Reference Dye and 5.6 μl of RNase free water. The reactions were performed using a StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Amplified Biosystems, USA) under the following conditions: initial reverse transcription at 42 °C for 5 min, followed by initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s, and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 30 s. The results of amplification were analyzed by StepOne Software v2.3 (Amplified Biosystems). Tenfold serial dilutions of the transcripts were prepared at concentrations of 8.97 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 8.97 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies of PEDV per 1 μl volume that were used for obtaining the standard curves.
