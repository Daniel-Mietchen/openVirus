<p id="Par23">The RtF-RT-LAMP reaction was conducted in a final reaction volume of 25 μl consisting of 2 μl RNA template, FIP and BIP primers (1.6 μM each), Loop F and Loop B primers (0.8 μM each), F3 and B3 primers (0.2 μM each), Isothermal Mastermixes (OptiGene, UK), 0.15 u of AMV reverse transcriptase (15 u/μl; Invitrogen, USA). Amplification reactions were performed at 63 °C for 40 min (with fluorescence detection followed by melt curve analysis from 90 to 70 °C at 0.05 °C/s), and then heated at a start temperature of 98 °C and end temperature of 80 °C for 10 min with a ramp rate of 0.05 °C/sec to terminate the reactions using Genie® III (OptiGene, UK). The fluorescence of the reaction was measured in real time, verifying the start of the amplification.</p>
