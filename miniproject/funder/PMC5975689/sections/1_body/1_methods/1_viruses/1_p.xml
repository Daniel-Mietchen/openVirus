<p id="Par18">PEDV NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−) strains which belong to classical clade (G1) were propagated in Vero-KY5 (Vero) cells. Trypsin was not used to culture PEDV in Vero cells. The NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 strains were kindly provided by the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan, and the Fukuoka Chuo Livestock Hygiene Service Center, Fukuoka, Japan, respectively. The Vero cells were also provided by the National Institute of Animal Health, Japan. Briefly, Vero cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% (

 <sub>2</sub>. Viruses were propagated in Vero cells cultured in EMEM with 2% FBS and 0.3% TPB at 37 °C. The titter of the PEDV NK94P6 and Fukuoka-1 Tr(−) strains were 2.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID

 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml, respectively.
