<p id="Par28">The RtF-RT-LAMP assay was used to determine efficiency in pooled stool samples for future application in large-scaled epidemiological surveys. We determined the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay in pooled faecal samples to calculate the possible sample sizes that can be applied to the pooled technique. Each PEDV positive sample was pooled with PEDV negative samples in different pooling ratios including 1:4, 1:9, 1:14, 1:19, 1:24, 1:29, 1:34, 1:39, 1:44, and 1:49. A 50-μl aliquot from individual positive or negative samples was transferred to a new tube and carefully votexed. Then, 250 μl in each pooling ratio was used for RNA extraction (ReliaPrep™ RNA Cell Miniprep System, Promega, USA). RNA was used as a template for RtF-RT-LAMP.</p>
