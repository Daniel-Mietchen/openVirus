<p>Thank you for this for this important observation, and we have added a description of the gray literature sources used, as well as more detail on the eligibility criteria in the methods. In the Phase I results, we also have added a breakdown on the types of reports in grey literature to better describe their relationship with governmental and nongovernmental organizations (Lines 275-279). We broke down the types of grey literature reports identified, which include those with PSE activities as a component of HIV surveillance studies commissioned in collaboration with governmental organizations, PSE-specific studies, and NGO-led reports.</p>
