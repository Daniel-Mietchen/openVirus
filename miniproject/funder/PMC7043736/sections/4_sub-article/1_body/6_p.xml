<p>Thank you for the recommendation and suggestion on adding commentary on reasons for findings. We agree that underestimations are a frequent observation that can lead to lack of utility and have noted this in the discussion (Line 461-462). While the motivations of PSE activity funders influencing utilization is an important consideration, evidence in documents conveying the reasoning of PSE funders/implementers was not examined in enough detail to be able to include this as a demonstrable factor influencing research utilization in the discussion section. </p>
