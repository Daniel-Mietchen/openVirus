<p>Thanks for this important consideration and opportunity to convey how PSE references specifically relate to the ways program planning has been described. In most documents where we reported that PSE was used to change a policy or program, PSE rarely changed policy, but did change programs as described in the actions taken for planning of programs. About a third of documents that referenced PSE data, made no mention of using them to take actions in planning or any language commenting on the results of the estimates (Lines 377-380). But where action has been taken and attributed to the existence of PSE data, the document language specifies a different direction in planning regardless of the results of the estimates. We consider this to be a change in program planning rather than just informing it, and have observed this to be independent of whether or not the results of the estimates were as expected.</p>
