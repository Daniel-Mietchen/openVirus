<p>Overall, most published PSE studies of key populations identified have limited documented utilization in HIV policy and planning documents. This review has highlighted the need to improve effective uptake of size estimation data to guide the HIV response, as well as the need for the development of more size estimates of key populations in both generalized and concentrated epidemic settings on the African continent. Moreover, the near complete absence of size estimates for transgender persons is especially concerning in the context of the high burden of HIV among transgender women [

Considering the importance of PSE in guiding data-driven HIV responses, the data presented here display an opportunity to build capacity to ensure that available data appropriately guides responses, and that optimal decisions are made about data needs moving forward. Overall, those focused on data-driven responses can establish relationships with country governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, conduct collaborative country-driven data collection, and build their capacity to understand and interpret size estimates and their quality, which can encourage endorsement of estimates and their subsequent utilization in planning. In light of the disproportionate burden of HIV documented among key populations coupled with limited coverage of existing HIV services, the development and utilization of accurate size estimates is ever more crucial to tailor effective and efficient responses to the HIV pandemic.
