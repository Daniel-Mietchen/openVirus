<p>PSE studies for key populations are becoming increasingly common, and these studies have involved significant investment of finances and human resources to undertake. However, the results presented here suggest only a small proportion of such studies are being used to inform programming by country governments and their funding and implementation partners, including PEPFAR and the Global Fund. Additionally, we observed that about a third of PSE studies that were cited in program and policy documents were not utilized by PEPFAR or the Global Fund through any method assessed in this review, such as to identify a problem, develop a plan of action, or inform planning of key populations programming. This speaks to the need to improve the effective accessibility and uptake of size estimation data, which requires not only increased reporting of estimates in planning documents by program implementers, funders and policy makers, but the utilization of estimates to guide the HIV response at the national and regional levels.</p>
