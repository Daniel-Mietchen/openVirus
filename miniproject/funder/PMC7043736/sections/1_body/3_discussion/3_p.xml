<p>In a review of available size estimates for key populations, Sabin and colleagues noted that while many estimates are developed and submitted by national HIV/AIDS programs to UNAIDS, few estimates published in peer-reviewed literature were endorsed by national authoritative stakeholders, and thus were not used in national planning [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The low utilization of estimates in this review, particularly of estimates found in the peer-reviewed literature, reinforces this finding. Close engagement of government stakeholders throughout the process of study design, implementation, and data use may support increased uptake and utilization of estimates in local and national programming. Researchers can also build the capacity of stakeholders to interpret and use study findings in guiding service development and targets; these forms of stakeholder engagement were found to be limited when evaluating size estimation studies. While over half of PSE studies reported some stakeholder involvement in implementation, few studies reported stakeholder engagement in study design. A study-specific advisory panel was established in some studies, as well as stakeholders convened to interpret findings and develop consensus on estimates in others, but there was limited documentation of established strategies to improve research utilization by working with stakeholders on ways to use the studies’ findings in stakeholders’ own work or develop their capacity for research utilization. The primary strategies of stakeholder engagement seen in this review allow for context-specific interpretation of data after study implementation, and increase accessibility of findings. However, without stakeholder engagement in study design, study teams may be unaware of contextual factors that can influence the quality of study implementation and results, and may limit confidence and endorsement in resulting estimates by stakeholders who make program and policy decisions [

 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The cases reported above present examples of engagement researchers can undertake to involve stakeholder in studies, but ultimately indicate that comprehensive stakeholder engagement was limited to a few studies.
