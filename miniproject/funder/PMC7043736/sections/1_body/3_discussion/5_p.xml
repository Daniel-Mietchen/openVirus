<p>This review is limited by the reporting of information in studies and planning documents. Thus, if indicators of stakeholder engagement were not explicitly reported in a study document, it was not possible to know whether or not these conversations took place. Likewise, if PSE sources were not clearly cited in documents being assessed for research utilization, we concluded that those size estimates were not considered in the policy and programmatic decision-making processes documented. We acknowledge that publication requirements and report length limits can lead to underreporting of existing stakeholder engagement by studies. Organizations also collect programmatic data that may often go unpublished along with dissemination and advocacy tools, which could not be identified in this review. Furthermore, some data are not publicly available during the development of decision-making documents. In many cases, size estimation is conducted as one component of larger studies on HIV prevalence, risk behaviors, and the care continuum, and recommendations specific to size estimation results may not be reported. As the focus of the second phase of the review was on PEPFAR and Global Fund investments, which emphasized documentation in online archives, this review may have missed unpublished planning documents by other country-level agencies demonstrating PSE research utilization. The Global.HIV systematic review may not have captured all available size estimation sources, as it was limited to sources found online through peer-reviewed literature databases and gray literature. In some PSE studies, underestimations that limit the utility of PSE in informing programming may also play a role in the lack of reference to PSE studies in planning documents. This review did not assess PSE quality, but other reviews have documented that of African countries with existing PSE, about half are considered to have nationally adequate estimates [
