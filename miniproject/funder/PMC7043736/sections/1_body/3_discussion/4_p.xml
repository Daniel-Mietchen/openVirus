<p>In a systematic review of stakeholder engagement methods reported in effectiveness and outcomes research, Concannon et al noted that stakeholder engagement is most common in early stages of research and least common in the process of dissemination and application of findings [

While studies often involved stakeholders in implementation, literature on stakeholder engagement notes that a key component is stakeholder provision of guidance on research dissemination and use of data for future program design and implementation [

 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Immediate outcomes include informing research questions, methods, interpretation and dissemination; intermediate outcomes include the value and uptake of research; and long-term outcomes involve decision-making and health policy. While frameworks of stakeholder engagement focus on engagement of community stakeholders, in the context of key population PSE, the engagement of stakeholders needed to make policy and program decisions, such as Ministries of Health, National HIV/AIDS programs, as well as local implementing NGOs, play a central role in enacting intermediate and long term outcomes of PSE research. Existing conceptual models of engagement suggest that engaging stakeholders who make program and policy decisions when conducting PSE studies may be tied to utilization of research in program planning. Various resources have been developed to guide researchers and implementers on incorporating stakeholder engagement in research and its utilization [
