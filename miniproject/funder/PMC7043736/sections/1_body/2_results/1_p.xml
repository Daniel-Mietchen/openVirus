<p>The Phase 1 review produced 118 PSE from 39 studies for key populations in 22 countries in Africa. Overall, 70 PSE were available for FSW, 27 for MSM, 21 for PWUD, and none for transgender persons. All estimates of PWUD identified were exclusively of people who inject drugs (PWID). National, regional, or local PSE were identified for Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Egypt, eSwatini, Ethiopia, Ghana, the Gambia, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, and Togo. In total, 30% (36/118) were national estimates, 52.5% (62/118) were district or city level estimates, and 14.4% (17/118) were provincial estimates. Three regional estimates were available, 2 of which were for Eastern Africa. Overall, 64% (25/39) of studies reporting PSE data were present in the peer-reviewed literature only, and 36% (14/39) were identified in gray literature, five of which had also published results in peer-reviewed articles. Of grey literature reports, 11 included PSE activities as a component of HIV surveillance studies commissioned in collaboration with governmental organizations, two were PSE-specific studies led by governmental organizations, and one was an NGO-led report with mention of PSE data. The outcomes of each stakeholder engagement and research utilization indicator assessed per study are shown in Tables
