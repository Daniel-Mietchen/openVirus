<p>In total, 41% (48/118) of PSE were referenced to identify a problem. The most common of such problems were gaps in response and/or service coverage, and to highlight the lack of comprehensive data on the target population. FSW were the most frequently mentioned population (38%), with PWID being the least mentioned (27%). Of the PSE used to identify a problem, 29% (14/48) were used to develop a plan of action or develop a recommendation to address the problem for 9 countries, including Angola, Cameroon, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa. Five of the countries referenced one key population in the plans of actions and recommendations, with Niger [

 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] referencing PSE for FSW; Senegal referencing PSE for PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]; Ghana referencing a national PSE estimate for FSW [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; and Angola referencing PSE for MSM [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Three of the countries referenced PSE for two key populations including: South Africa referencing FSW and PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; Morocco referencing PSE for MSM and PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]; and Kenya referencing PSE for FSW and PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. One country, Egypt, referenced PSE for 3 key populations: FSW, MSM, and PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In all references used to develop a plan of action, resources proposed were directed towards rather than away from key populations.
