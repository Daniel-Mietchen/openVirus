This has included data focused on both defining the content and strategy of HIV programs, as well as the scale of these programs in response to evidence-based need. The UNAIDS 2016–2021 Strategy has made one of their ten targets to reach 90% of key populations globally with tailored HIV combination prevention and treatment programs[

Population size estimates (PSE) for key populations provide denominators in coverage assessments and can facilitate prioritization of public health programs, resource allocation, intervention planning, and evaluation. Moreover, the population denominators provided by PSE can be used in partnership with HIV care continuum and service data to evaluate current coverage of care, treatment retention, and viral suppression, which can identify coverage gaps in order to directly inform the development of evidence-based service targets [
