<p>Among both concentrated and generalized epidemics around the world, key populations including female sex workers (FSW), cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), people who use drugs (PWUD), and transgender women bear a disproportionate burden of HIV when compared to other reproductive-aged adults [

 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This may be due, in part, to limited coverage of key populations in national surveys, and limited disclosure in surveys of proximal HIV risks, such as sexual practices, that can suggest key population status. Thus, data are often missing for individuals most at risk of HIV acquisition and transmission across settings, potentially limiting data-driven resource allocation and program planning [

 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The UNAIDS Gap Report noted this gap in service coverage on a global scale, partly attributed to stigmas in health care settings combined with a lack of key population-specific HIV programs [
