<p>Following the parent review, Phase 1 of our review was conducted, identifying PSE through a review of abstracted sources in the Global.HIV database. The Phase 1 PSE review was limited to data found in peer-reviewed or gray literature publications from January 1, 2009 through December 29, 2017 to ensure sufficient time for the data to be available and utilized for policy and program documents released between 2017 and 2019. Through the following steps, the REDCap Data Export tool was used to identify all recordsthat were catalogued as containing PSE data for FSW, MSM, PWUD, or transgender populations from any of the 54 African countries. The export tool presented results of the following selected indicator fields of each record, with a filter limiting records to those with data in eligible countries: population of interest, size estimates (absolute count), PSE method, location(s) of PSE, country of data collection, and year of publication. The data source of each record presenting eligible PSE data in these export results then underwent full text review to further extract the operational definition used for each estimated population, the funder or implementer of the PSE study, and the year of estimation. The quality of the PSE identified was not assessed for this study.</p>
