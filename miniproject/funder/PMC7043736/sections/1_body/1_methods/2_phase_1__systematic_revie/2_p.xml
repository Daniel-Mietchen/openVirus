<p>The parent review included studies that met the following eligibility criteria: studies of any design that include data that captures the burden and risk of HIV, prevalence, incidence, prevention indicators, treatment cascade, population size estimates, experienced violence and engagement with healthcare systems data among FSW, MSM, PWUD, transgender persons, and incarcerated populations, even if these groups are not the primary focus of the study; Studies released or presented between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2019 were included, and data from all countries and settings were included; Study data must be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented as an abstract at a scientific conference, or available on the web from governmental or non-governmental sources. Data identified through this review were used to build the Global.HIV data repository, a database hosted by the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) application[
 <xref rid="pone.0228634.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. After undergoing title/abstract screening and full text review, data from eligible studies were abstracted independently by a team of reviewers, two independent reviewers per article, using standardized data abstraction record forms in REDCap. Each REDCap record contains extracted data of interest and study details from one data source. In each record form, data on each indicator were entered into text fields specific to that indicator, for example, “Size estimate 1 (count)”. This record structure enables indicator-specific filtering and selection of results during repository-wide data exports. Differences in data abstraction were resolved using REDCap’s data comparison tool by a third, independent reviewer.
