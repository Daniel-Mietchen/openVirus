  <p>The resulting plots of fit goodness tests from the LSTM model for HFMD notified cases series. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Standardized residuals. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Autocorrelation function (ACF) plot of errors across varying lag times. The ACF plot of forecasted errors reveals no individually evident autocorrelation at varying lags except for the two points occurring at lags 11 and 13. For these two lagged points out of the estimated 95% confidence limit, they are also reasonable as this phenomenon can easily happen by chance alone. (

   <italic>P</italic>-values are larger than 0.05. These diagnostics manifest that the network is well suited to the dataset.
