  <p>The resulting plots of fit goodness tests from the best-fitting NAR model for HFMD notified cases series. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Standardized residuals. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Autocorrelation function (ACF) plot of errors across varying lag times. All of the autocorrelations fail to be beyond the estimated 95% uncertainty bounds around zero across varying lag times apart from the one from ACF plot at zero lag that should occur. This manifests that the network appears to have captured the dependence hidden behind the HFMD notified cases series. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Input-to-error correlation plot for varying lags. The input-error cross-correlation function illustrates how the residuals are interrelated with the series of x(t). All of the correlations fall within the confidence bounds around zero, which hints the developed model is a perfect specification. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Q-statistic 
   <italic>P</italic>-values. Analyses form the plots demonstrate the constructed model is adequate in excavating the information of this time series.
