<p id="Par22">Our prediction project using the LSTM model for regression was conducted with Keras. First, the actual HFMD notifications were rescaled between 0 and 1 using a normalized preprocessing approach. Second, in-sample data were separated into two blocks, 75% of them would be used for the training model, whereas the remaining 25% of the data would be utilized to validate the generalization and to simulate performance. Similarly, in the robustness-test data, the same data classification described above was applied to the first test dataset, while 70% and 30% data points were taken as training and validation subsets, respectively, out of the second test dataset. Third, the back propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm

 </sup> was adopted for LSTM training with various time steps, and hidden layer neurons used to select the preferred model relied on the minimum root mean square error loss and satisfactory ACF plot
