<p id="Par20">In this work, the graphical user interface (GUI) in MATLAB (Version R2014a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was employed to automatically create an advanced script prior to modeling an NAR. First, the actual HFMD observations were processed between 0 and 1 using a normalized approach

 </sup> to facilitate further analysis. Second, the 
 <italic>dividerand</italic> function was used to randomly divide the in-sample data into training, validation and testing subsets, following ratios of 70%, 15% and 15%, respectively. In the robustness-test data, the abovementioned ratio in the training, validation and testing subsets was also used in the first test dataset, while another commonly used ratio of 80%, 10% and 10% corresponding to the training, validation and testing subsets, respectively, was employed in the second test dataset. Third, the number of hidden neurons and delays 
 <italic>d</italic> were adjusted by repeated attempts with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in an open feedback loop. The response plot of outputs and targets, correlograms and input-error cross-correlation plots, coupled with the mean square error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (R), were offered to choose the best-fitting model. Finally, the training open-loop form was transformed to a closed loop to achieve a goal of multistep-ahead forecasting (Supplementary Fig.Â
