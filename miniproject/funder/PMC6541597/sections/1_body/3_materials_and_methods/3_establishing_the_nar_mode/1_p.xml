 </sup>. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can adequately enable arbitrarily intricate non-stationary series to attain any desired accuracy owing to their powerful flexible nonlinear mapping capacity, and they have been considered as a function approximator applied in the domains of environmental forecasting, electrical energy and medicine

 </sup>. The NAR model is a leading shallow, dynamic recurrent neural network (RNN) that is based on the linear autoregressive model with the ability to time-varying the state of interconnected neurons

 </sup>, can be adopted to explore the nonlinear relationship between the response variable and its predictors owing to its network architecture with a hidden layer accompanied by a sigmoid transfer function that allows it to have no restrictions on the parameters that comply with the requirement of stationarity

 </sup>. Furthermore, with the aid of tapped delay lines, the NAR technique also has a short-term memory function for the previous inputs and outputs, which makes its response at any given time rely not only on the present inputs but on the history of the inputs series as well

 </sup>. For a time series with obvious seasonality, when providing suitable observations from the same season as inputs, this network can capture the time series components of periodicity, seasonality and secular trend adequately well with respect to the appropriate inputs that require a multitude of experiments to discover the optimum. Accordingly, this method can provide reliable forecasts for current HFMD incidence case series including linear and nonlinear information. The specified equation of the NAR method can be written as:
