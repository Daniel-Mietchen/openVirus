<p id="Par16">In China, HFMD is clinically diagnosed by physicians, and the laboratory confirmed the diagnosis dependent on the detection of specific nucleic acids, the isolation of enterovirus related to pathogenic factors and the detection of a fourfold change in neutralizing antibodies. In addition, verified cases must be registered within 24â€‰hours, and duplicate cases must be deleted by professionals at the end of the same month. Ethical approval or consent is not required for our present study owing to the public availability of HFMD surveillance data in China.</p>
