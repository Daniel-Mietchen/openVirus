A total of 121 observations covering 11 years were collated and summarized. Subsequently, the whole dataset was split into two blocks to build the models, among which the first 109 data points (from June 2008 to June 2017) were regarded as in-sample modeling horizons, while the remaining 12 data points (from July 2017 to June 2018) were considered as out-of-sample predictive horizons. Since the sample length and time periods adopted to construct the models might have an impact on the forecasting power, two additional data categories were provided to test the robustness of the models developed, among which the first 103 (from June 2008 to December 2016) and 115 data points (from June 2008 to December 2017) were considered as in-sample modeling horizons, while the other 18 (from January 2017 to June 2018) and 6 data points (from January 2018 to June 2018) were used as out-of-sample predictive horizons.
