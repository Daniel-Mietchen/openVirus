<p id="Par3">In mainland China, after the first reported case of HFMD in Shanghai in 1981
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, several outbreaks have been reported and have caused the deaths of numerous children
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, HFMD affects more than two million children annually in mainland China
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, and the number of cases and deaths caused by HFMD sporadics, epidemics and outbreaks invariably tops the list of monitored class C diseases every year since HFMD was designated as a notifiable disease in 2008

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Since 2016, although an available vaccine that only plays a role in the infection caused by the EV71 virus has been introduced to prevent HFMD
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>, the potentially worsening trend in the reported cases of HFMD has not been reversed. Importantly, it is estimated that there is an increasing risk of ongoing HFMD recurrence in China in recent years
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup> and HFMD still continues to exert a significant influence on the general susceptible population. Early detection and advanced warning for the timing, extent and duration of HFMD epidemics will be particularly valuable in formulating effective prevention and intervention strategies to minimize the damage caused by the infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, a reliable forecasting technique to track the temporal patterns of HFMD is needed.
