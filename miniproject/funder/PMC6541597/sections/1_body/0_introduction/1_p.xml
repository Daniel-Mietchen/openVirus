 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Most show mild symptoms mainly characterized by fever and rash on the hands, feet and mouth. A small minority have more severe complications, such as myocarditis, pulmonary edema and aseptic meningoencephalitis, some of which are fatal
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. The infections are predominantly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and human enterovirus 71 (EV71), although other viruses can be involved
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. The viruses are thought to be predominantly transmitted from child to child by direct and indirect contact, including droplets, droplet nuclei, dust, water and food

 </sup>. HFMD was first reported in New Zealand in 1957, and since then, millions of cases and many outbreaks have been reported worldwide

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
 </sup>, where epidemics and numerous large-scale outbreaks of HFMD have occurred, resulting in enormous burdens of disease and global public health concerns
