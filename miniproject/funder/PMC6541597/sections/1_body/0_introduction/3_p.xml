<p id="Par4">The existing early warning models for forecasting the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases mainly consist of linear and nonlinear models, along with their hybrids

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>; the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR) approach is among the nonlinear models with arbitrarily expected accuracy that can effectively extract the meaningful dynamic information of a data sequence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Both the ARIMA and NAR models are well suited to study the future trends of the morbidity or mortality time series of diseases with stationary short-term dependencies based on the aggregated long trajectories
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. However, long-term trajectory modeling, which is most often encountered in epidemiological prediction, is frequently characterized by non-stationary long-term lags over time. Additionally, when employing an NAR model to connect the preceding information located into the time-varying series to the present assignment, with the growing gap between the past inputs and estimated outputs, the NAR technique will encounter a vanishing or exploding gradient problem during training, which makes it difficult to develop the long-term dependence structure in a time series

 </sup>. The long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, a type of deep learning network that has been extensively studied and applied to quite a few frontier fields, such as voice recognition
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup> and speech synthesis systems
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, comprises a cluster of recurrently connected subnets that allow the LSTM method to store and access information over long periods of time, hence mitigating the vanishing or exploding gradient problem

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. However, there is a current lack of research focusing specifically on the applicability of LSTM model in the forecasting of infectious diseases with time series analysis. Therefore, motivated by the merits of the LSTM model, the burden of HFMD and the persistently high incidence in mainland China, we aim to forecast the notified incident cases of HFMD with a LSTM model. Meanwhile, the simulating and predictive abilities of the LSTM model were compared with two especially useful estimation models, including the ARIMA and NAR methods, to seek the best-fitting time series modeling technique for HFMD, which will be of great help in initiating guidance planning and effective intervention measures for HFMD-prevention in mainland China.
