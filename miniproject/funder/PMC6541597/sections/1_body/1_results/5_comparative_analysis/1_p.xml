<p id="Par9">Multiple statistical measures were applied to compare the in-sample simulation and out-of-sample predictive accuracies among the three methods. Compared to the SARIMA and NAR models, the minimum values of measures concerning the facets of training and testing were observed in the LSTM technique, aside from the MAE in the simulated stage of the NAR model, and were fitted to the robustness-test dataset from June 2008 to December 2017 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For these three constructed models, overall, the curves simulated and predicted by the LSTM model were closer in proximity to the actual values as well (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), which further implies that the epidemic trajectories of HFMD can be captured reasonably well by the LSTM technique. Hence, the LSTM technique was re-modeled to recursively achieve multistep-ahead predictions from July 2018 to December 2020 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>); it appears that a slightly potential rising risk in the incident cases of HFMD will be observed in the forecasting period. In the meantime, the uncertainty bands for the resultant forecasts were estimated utilizing simulation of 100 future possible paths by performing bootstrapping with the number of samples of 1000
