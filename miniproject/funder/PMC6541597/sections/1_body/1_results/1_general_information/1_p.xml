<p id="Par5">The time series of notified cases of HFMD included 121 observations from June 2008 to June 2018, and a total of 19,218,824 cases were reported. The monthly average of case notifications was 158,834, which led to an annualized average morbidity rate of 133,894 cases per 100,000 population with a standard error of 10,825 cases during the whole period. Between June 2008 and June 2017, 17,072,500 cases occurred, and the number of morbidity cases increased from 102,223 to 308,789, with an overall increase of 202.074% throughout the past decade. The highest incidence peak of 528,777 cases was observed in May 2014, which was a marginal increase of 417.278% compared to June2008. When the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) decomposition approach was performed to smooth the short-term monthly effect of the observed incidence case series from June 2008 to June 2018, it was found that there were clear seasonal peaks, specifically in May and June of every year, a trough in January and February and an evident 12-month cyclical process. In addition, notwithstanding a slight decline that existed between January 2014 and June 2018, there were still a substantially large number of reported cases each year (Fig.
