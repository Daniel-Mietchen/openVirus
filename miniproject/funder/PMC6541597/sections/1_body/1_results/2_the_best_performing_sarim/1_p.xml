<p id="Par6">Before modeling, the original in-sample observations were examined using the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test (ADF = −2.3318, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.1642), which is indicative of an obviously non-stationary morbidity case series. Therefore, according to the results from the HP filter and ADF test, the first-order seasonal and non-seasonal differences were used to stabilize the variance and mean to suit the modeling requirement of a stationary sequence (ADF = −4.4129, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0006). Analysis of the spikes in the ACF and PACF plots at varying lags with the transformed incidence case series for HFMD resulted in the selection of several candidate models by trial and error to further detect the best-performing specification (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Finally, taking the error correlations between the ACF and PACF plots comprehensively and taking the AIC, AICc and SBC into consideration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>), the preferred model of SARIMA(1,1,2)(1,1,0)
 <sub>12</sub> was generated with minimized AIC, AICc and SBC values of 2339.41, 2340.08 and 2352.23, respectively. When the error correlations at lags fell into the estimated 95% confidence bounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>), the Ljung-Box 
 <italic>Q</italic> test showed that the residuals from the SARIMA model obtained desirable white noise (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and the LM test suggested that no ARCH effect was found at various lags in the residual series (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Furthermore, the test results of the estimated parameters were also all significant (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Nevertheless, the only complication was that the Q-Q plot of the residuals showed a clear departure from normality at the tails (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). The specified equation of the SARIMA model was expressed as (1-B)(1-B
 <sup>12</sup>)X
 <sub>t</sub> = (1 + 0.524B + 0.394B
 <sup>2</sup>)ɛ
 <sub>t</sub>/(1 − 0.434B)(1 + 0.6B
 <sup>12</sup>). In the same way, the reported case series of HFMD from June 2008 to December 2016 and December 2017 was utilized to account for the robustness of the model. The best-fitting SARIMA method constructed using the first 103 in-sample observations was identified as a SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)
 <sub>12</sub> form, and Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref> and Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> provide the results of the diagnostic tests for this optimal SARIMA approach; the best-simulating SARIMA approach obtained with the first 115 observed points was still identified as a SARIMA(1,0,1)(1,1,1)
 <sub>12</sub> form, and the identified parameters and diagnostic tests for the preferred approach are given in Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>–

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>. Then, these optimal methods chosen were utilized to calculate out-of-sample predictions.
