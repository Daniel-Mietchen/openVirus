<p id="Par8">Generally, the LSTM network with 1 hidden layer surrounded by 1 to 7 hidden units can satisfy the need for time series modeling. Consequently, to attain the optimal modeling parameters for the HFMD series, the range of time steps was set to 1 to 20, and the LSTM model was conducted repeatedly utilizing the activation sigmoid function with time steps ranging from 1 to 20 together with a batch size of 1 using the Adam optimizer technique to stabilize the argument updates to help minimize the loss function of the RMSE. All candidate models were iterated through 300 epochs. Ultimately, we identified that the best-simulating model with 1 hidden layer containing 5 hidden neurons and 11 time steps relied on a minimum training score of RMSE = 0.0031 and a testing score of RMSE = 0.0038 and with maximum R values of the training and validation subsets and of the overall data (0.972, 0.982 and 0.974, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S25</xref>). In addition, as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, no overfitting occurred during the training process because of the similar downward trend between the testing and validation datasets before 300-step iterations. The ACF plot of the produced errors revealed no individually evident autocorrelation at varying lags except for the one at lag zero (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>), as shown in the normal Q-Q plot (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S26</xref>), indicating that the forecasted residuals of the LSTM model were normally distributed to a great extent. The Ljung-Box 
 <italic>Q</italic> test showed that errors did not depart from the assumptions of stochastic white noise (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and the LM test demonstrated that the volatility that existed in the actual observations was essentially eliminated in the residuals of the selected LSTM model as well (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Therefore, the model chosen is adequate in capturing the dynamic dependences of this time series. Likewise, the in-sample observations used to test the robustness of the model were applied to determine the optimal LSTM network as noted earlier: the network with 1 hidden layer including 6 hidden neurons and 12 time steps was constructed based on the data series from June 2008 to December 2016 was the best-performing; the results of the diagnostic tests for this network are summarized in Supplementary Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>. The network with 1 hidden layer containing 5 hidden neurons and 11 time steps built on the basis of the data series from June 2008 to December 2017 should be regarded as the best-performing. Supplementary Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref> offer systematic diagnostic tests for this preferred network. After the optimal LSTM approaches are selected, they can be employed to predict the epidemic trends of HFMD in the upcoming years.
