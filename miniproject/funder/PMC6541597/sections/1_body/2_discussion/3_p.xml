<p id="Par12">To understand the epidemic situation in advance of the coming years, the constructed LSTM model with the best-fitting and best-predicting performance was adopted to calculate forecasts for the next two years. The results indicated that although the estimated observations would not show a large amplitude of oscillations relative to the in-sample data obtained, HFMD morbidity cases remained high, among which the highest-risk seasonality seemed to occur in June and July. Similar to prior findings

 </sup>, two apparent seasonal peaks will be observed separately in subsequent Junes and Octobers, in all probability. Thus, due attention and instant action should be paid to these months and a response should be prompted, such as health promotion education; prevention at and control of key locations, particularly in nurseries and schools; vaccination and financial support. In addition, the prevention and control strategies for the rest of the low-risk months should fail to be ignored. In summary, the expected number of cases of HFMD remain present and still comparatively large, demonstrating that China is still afflicted with a chronic threat of HFMD.
