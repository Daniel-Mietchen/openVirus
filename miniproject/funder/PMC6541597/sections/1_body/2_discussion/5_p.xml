<p id="Par14">In conclusion, notwithstanding its flaws, our study does indicate that the LSTM model established can provide more accurate predictions, be it in the in-sample dataset or the out-of-sample dataset. For the HFMD notified case time series compared with the individual SARIMA and NAR models, the LSTM model may be a beneficial tool for the early detection and advanced warning of HFMD activities in mainland China and can allow the official government to allocate health resources effectively and appropriately formulate the preventive and control planning for HFMD. Additionally, the number of forecasted incident cases are still relatively large and indeed present in the imminent future, this issue warrants to be resolved urgently and strategically within the effective measures taken.</p>
