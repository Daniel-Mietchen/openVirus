<p id="Par13">Some limitations should be acknowledged in this work. First, no theoretical guidance can be adopted to identify the optimum number of hidden units, feedback delays and other key parameters during the establishment of ANN models. In practice, they are frequently selected by trial and error, and the specific forecasting process is poorly understood. Second, estimating the 95% uncertainty bounds for the predictions remains an additional problem. Third, the aggregated HFMD incidence case data utilized were obtained from nationwide passive infectious disease surveillance. We thus fail to rule out artifactual monitoring biases (e.g., substantial underreporting, misdiagnosis and delay). Fourth, the statistical predictions do not take known drivers into account and lack any epidemiological data other than case numbers and months, owing to their unavailability. Therefore, whether further studies that take these variables into account will have the potential to boost the fit and predictive ability remains to be authenticated. Fifth, albeit the LSTM technique built can be considered to be an instrumental tool for the medium-long-term estimation of future trends in HFMD incidence case data, in applications, this network is expected to be updated in due course with the incident cases to ensure its superiority in predictive performance. Sixth, detailed data on HFMD notifications are missing (e.g., age and sex), which precludes further analysis in the present work. Lastly, the LSTM model was developed based only on nationwide monitoring data over the period from 2008 to2018. These results therefore need to be interpreted with caution, and the analytic results can represent only entire epidemics of HFMD on the Chinese mainland. Remodeling for the region-specific notified HFMD cases time series may act as guidance for the formulation of targeted public health strategies, and whether the model is appropriate to calculate predictions for other kinds of communicable diseases requires further study.</p>
