  <p>Virus shedding measured in different sample types. For analysis, the disease process is divided into preclinical, clinical, and early recovery phases. A linear mixed-regression model, where each calf identification was introduced as a random effect, was used to compare shedding levels during each phase of the disease process. When the clinical phase was used as a reference for comparison, the level of nasal shedding was significantly lower (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) during both the preclinical and recovery phases. The level of shedding in saliva was lower (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the preclinical phase, while the level of shedding in serum was lower (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the recovery phase. No significant differences in shedding were found for probang samples (
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.06, recovery phase).
