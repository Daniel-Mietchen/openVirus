  <p>Se of filter-based air samplers with different sampling rates for preclinical detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus serotype A aerosols. Data used for these estimates were reported previously (
   <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Se and 95% confidence intervals were modeled by using a logistic regression model (
   <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), which, for this data set, fit better than a mixed model. Only data for the preclinical phase were collated and analyzed.
