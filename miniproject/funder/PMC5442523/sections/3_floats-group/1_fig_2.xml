  <p>Virus shedding as measured by the cyclone air sampler. The disease process is divided into preclinical, clinical, and early recovery phases. A linear mixed-regression model, where each calf identification was introduced as a random effect, was used to compare shedding levels during each phase of the disease process. No significant differences in virus shedding were observed between the different phases. Although other air sampling devices were used, only the cyclone results were analyzed, as this sampler proved to be the most sensitive and provided more data for analysis.</p>
