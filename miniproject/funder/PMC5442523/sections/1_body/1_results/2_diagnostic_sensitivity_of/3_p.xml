<p>Ambient room air was collected with the cyclone samplers, and all samples taken during the preclinical, clinical, and recovery phases were positive (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The lower 95% confidence limits (95% LCLs) for the Se at the preclinical, clinical, and early recovery phases were 0.51, 0.75, and 0.64, respectively. We also estimated the Se for room air sampling using data from a previous study (
