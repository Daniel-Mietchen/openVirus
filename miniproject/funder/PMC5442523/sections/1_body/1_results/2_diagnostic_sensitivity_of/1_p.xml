<p>The numbers of diagnostic and air samples taken during the course of the experiments and subsequently used for this analysis are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The estimated Se values for each of the diagnostic samples evaluated were not significantly different during the preclinical, clinical, and early recovery phases. Of particular interest for this study, however, was the preclinical-phase results. All sample types taken during this phase, with the exception of serum, had a Se greater than 0.85 (85%). The probang samples gave the highest Se values, while serum samples gave the lowest values (
