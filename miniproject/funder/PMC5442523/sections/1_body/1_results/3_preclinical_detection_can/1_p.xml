<p>To assess the impact of preclinical detection on transmission between farms, we consider the between-herd reproduction ratio, 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>. This quantity is defined as the expected number of secondarily infected farms arising from one infectious farm during its infectious period. An epidemic can sustain itself only if 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> is &gt;1, and consequently, preclinical detection will be effective at controlling spread if it is able to reduce the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> to &lt;1.
