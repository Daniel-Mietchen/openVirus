 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> summarizes the expected reduction in 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> as a result of active surveillance using each of the sampling matrices during epidemics. As observed during the 2001 UK epidemic, clinical inspection (based mainly on farmer reports) does not reduce the infectious output (
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> = 1.54) of infected farms to a level sufficient to control spread. The implementation of preclinical surveillance using any of the evaluated sample matrices reduced the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> to &lt;1 for sampling at a frequency of 10 animals per farm once a week. When using air samplers, daily sampling would be required to reduce the 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> to &lt;1. Similar results (i.e., 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic> of &lt;1) were observed during the sensitivity analysis, when a shorter incubation period and a longer infectious period were used. However, the sample size had to be doubled in this case (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). For all surveillance methods, increasing either the number of samples taken (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) or the frequency of sampling (Fig. S2) results in a larger reduction in 
 <italic>R
  <sub>h</sub>
 </italic>.
