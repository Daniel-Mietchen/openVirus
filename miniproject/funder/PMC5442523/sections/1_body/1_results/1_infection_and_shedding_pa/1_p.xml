<p>In the transmission experiments, all inoculated and contact-infected calves started shedding virus (as detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR [qPCR]) at 1 day postinoculation (dpi) or at 1 day postchallenge. With regard to inoculated calves, vesicles other than those at the inoculation sites in the tongue were observed at between 1 and 1.5 dpi, the assumed start of the clinical phase of infection. In the contact-infected calves, the clinical phase started (i.e., vesicles were observed) at between 4 and 5 dpi. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of shedding measured in each of the different samples evaluated. With the exception of probang samples, the highest level of shedding was found to occur during the clinical phase. For nasal samples in particular, the level of shedding was significantly higher (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) during this phase than during the preclinical or early recovery phase. Results for exhaled aerosols are shown only for the cyclone (glass) sampler because it was the most sensitive sampler (see below) and therefore provided more observations for analysis. No significant differences among the different phases (
