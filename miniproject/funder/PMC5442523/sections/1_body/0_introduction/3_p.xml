<p>The objective of this study was to assess the potential for preclinical (early) detection of infected herds as a control tool to reduce the risk of transmission between herds during epidemics. We used data from transmission experiments to estimate the sensitivity (Se) of different sample matrices for the detection of FMDV-infected cattle throughout the incubation period. Sample matrices included individual samples, such as blood, esophageal-pharyngeal fluid, and saliva and nasal swabs, and group-level samples, such as exhaled air. These Se estimates were incorporated into a mathematical model to evaluate the efficacy of different surveillance methods (sample matrix, number of samples, and frequency of sampling) for the early detection of an infected herd and the subsequent reduction of the infectious output. This paper concludes by discussing the potential for specific preclinical samples to be used as surveillance tools to aid in reactive control measures during an epidemic and comments on their performance as tools for early detection. Although we focus on FMD, this approach could also be applicable to other diseases such as African swine fever and classical swine fever, where virus genomes can be detected before infected pigs become infectious (
