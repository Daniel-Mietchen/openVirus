<p>For FMD-free countries, the focus on maintaining their FMD-free status centers on avoiding the introduction of the virus. However, once an outbreak has been declared, the emphasis changes to one of disease control through the culling of animals on farms known to be infected, tracing dangerous contacts, and implementing animal movement restrictions. The success of reactive control measures such as those mentioned above depends critically on the time between a farm becoming infected and the virus being detected and removed (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Currently, the detection of FMDV-infected farms relies on the identification and reporting of animals showing clinical signs. Although previous studies of FMDV in cattle have shown that most transmission occurs after the onset of clinical signs (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), any delays in detection can potentially compromise the effectiveness of control measures. FMDV can be detected in secretions and excretions, such as blood, nasal fluid, saliva, esophageal-pharyngeal fluid, or exhaled air, from infected animals before they show clinical disease (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">â€“</xref>
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This raises the possibility of detecting preclinical shedding of the virus, which could in turn enable earlier intervention in the transmission cycle, leading to a decreased likelihood of onward spread.
