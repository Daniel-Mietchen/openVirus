<p>Our results are based on experiments undertaken in controlled laboratory environments and may consequently differ in some respects from the real-world conditions of an outbreak. Although the models used in this paper are analytically robust (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the diagnostic and transmission parameters that are used to inform the model have been quantified experimentally. Bearing this in mind, a more conservative approach was adopted, using the lower confidence limits of the Se estimates for the evaluations. Nevertheless, field validation of the parameters might be necessary to improve our confidence in the model output. In addition, much of the fundamental work for this paper was undertaken using a FMDV serotype O strain, and transmission and disease characteristics may be different for other serotypes or strains (
