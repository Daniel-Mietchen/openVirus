<p>This study attempted to evaluate the potential for preclinical diagnosis during reactive surveillance to bring about a reduction in the risk of between-farm transmission of FMD. Results obtained from analyses of the virus levels in diagnostic samples indicate that, with the exception of probang samples, the majority of virus shedding occurred during the clinical stage of infection. Airborne virus shedding, as measured by the cyclone air sampler, suggested that this is also true for exhaled aerosol emissions. More importantly for this paper, however, is virus shedding during the preclinical stage of infection. First, the results show that early-phase virus shedding (i.e., during the preclinical phase) can be detected by using a range of diagnostic and aerosol samples, with a high degree of sensitivity. Second, these samples can be used as part of emergency surveillance activities for the early detection of infected herds, thereby minimizing the risk of further transmission between herds.</p>
