<p>The spread of FMD can be so rapid that by the time a sick animal has been identified and infection has been confirmed, several other animals or farms may already have been exposed to the virus. Therefore, the rapid identification of secondarily infected farms is essential if we are to limit the onward spread of disease. Current control measures involve the culling of animals on farms where the virus is detected (based mainly on clinical reporting), restrictions on transport on and off infected premises, and screening and tracing of dangerous contacts. If this response is not effective, additional preemptive culling or vaccination programs are employed to curb the epidemic. These policies do not, however, consider preclinical identification, and the results highlighted in this paper and the experience of the outbreak in the UK in 2007 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) suggest that the fast identification and removal of infected animals on farms where animals do not yet show clinical signs can result in a reduction of the risk of onward transmission and possibly the need for preemptive culling. It should be noted, however, that the effectiveness of the preclinical approach highlighted in this paper remains reliant upon the frequency of surveillance visits as well as the number of animals sampled.
