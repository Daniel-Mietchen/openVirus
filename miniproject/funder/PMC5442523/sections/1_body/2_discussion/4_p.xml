<p>There are, however, some fundamental challenges associated with sampling in the field as opposed to sampling in a controlled experiment. For animals at pasture in the open air, the virus aerosol can be rapidly dispersed (or mixed), and sampling to capture enough virus to be detected in situations where a few animals have become infected will present a considerable challenge. Air sampling within an enclosed area such as a milking parlor is more practical and, due to slower dilution and removal of the virus aerosols, is likely to greatly increase the chances of detecting the virus. Detection sensitivity will be improved by sampling large volumes of ambient air using samplers, such as the cyclone sampler, which were previously shown to detect airborne viruses under field conditions (
