<p>Any of the diagnostic samples evaluated could be used for the early detection of infected herds. Ideally, surveillance methods need to be quick, easy to employ, and as noninvasive as possible. These considerations rule out active clinical inspections and collection of probang and serum samples. They may also rule out the use of nasal sampling, as it can be very intrusive. In contrast, saliva and aerosol samplings are relatively noninvasive, and for aerosol samples, sampling instruments may be deployed in communal areas such as milking parlors. As well as using swabs, it might be possible to develop passive collection systems based on baits or licks attractive to cattle, as reported previously for pigs and wild boar (

Both methods may be utilized by farmers and farm staff, which will boost surveillance resources and reduce the need for surveillance personnel to enter the farms to manipulate animals, thereby improving biosecurity. In addition, if either of these methods were to be employed in conjunction with a pen-side test used to detect virus genomes (
