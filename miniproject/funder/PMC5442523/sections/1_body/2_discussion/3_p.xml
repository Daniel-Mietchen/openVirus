<p>The use of blood samples for reactive surveillance and detection of infected herds before animals show clinical signs was demonstrated during the 2007 UK FMD epidemic (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Our results are in agreement with those empirical findings; furthermore, we have quantified the Se of using blood samples as well as other diagnostic samples as preclinical biomarkers. These Se estimates are necessary to define the sample size and frequency of visits during reactive surveillance. Air sampling in closed environments was also evaluated for preclinical detection. For this variable, the Se appears to depend on the volumes of air sampled, with devices with higher sampling rates, such as the cyclone sampler or the sampler evaluated previously by Pacheco et al. with a sampling rate of 144 liters/min (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), showing the highest Se.
