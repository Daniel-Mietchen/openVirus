<p>In particular, shedding levels in nasal swabs were significantly higher during the clinical phase than during the preclinical and early recovery phases. Similarly, virus levels recovered in aerosols were also higher (although not significantly so) during the clinical phase. These differences in shedding levels in both nasal and aerosol samples might be associated with the previously reported higher probability of transmission during the clinical phase than during either the preclinical or the early recovery phase (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These observations suggest that nasal shedding could be used as a potential correlate of infectiousness in cattle. For example, the virus load in nasal samples could be readily used as a measure of infectiousness when evaluating vaccine efficacy during challenge experiments.
