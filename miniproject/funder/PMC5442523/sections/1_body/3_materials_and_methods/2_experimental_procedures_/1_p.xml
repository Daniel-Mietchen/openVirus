<p>For the first set of experiments, eight healthy conventional Holstein Friesian calves housed in the high-containment units at The Pirbright Institute were used. Four calves, housed in pairs, were inoculated by intradermolingual injection with 0.2 ml of a virus suspension containing 10
 <sup>5</sup> 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of FMDV serotype O strain UKG/34/2001. At 2 dpi, inoculated calves exhibited clinical signs, and each calf was paired with two naive contact calves for a period of 24 h (contact transmission). At the end of each direct contact transmission experiment (3 dpi), the inoculated calves were euthanized, and the contact calves were moved from the room and housed individually in clean rooms for observation. Contact calves were monitored until the vesicles in their mouths started healing, at around days 6 to 8 post-contact challenge (dpc). All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethical committee at The Pirbright Institute.
