<p>For the second set of experiments, eight healthy conventional Holstein Friesian calves housed at the high-containment units at WBVR were used. Calves were housed in pairs, in independent rooms. First, four calves (two per room) were needle inoculated according to the same procedures (including the use of the same virus) performed at The Pirbright Institute. At 1 dpi, two naive contact calves were placed into each room in direct contact with two inoculated calves for a period of 48 h. At the end of the contact challenge at 3 dpi, the inoculated calves were euthanized, and the contact calves were moved to clean rooms (two per room), where they were observed for the development of clinical signs up to 8 dpc. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethical committee at WBVR.</p>
