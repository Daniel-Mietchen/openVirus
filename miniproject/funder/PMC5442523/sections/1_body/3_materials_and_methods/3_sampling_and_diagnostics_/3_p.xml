<p>Air sampling at WBVR was performed by using the AirPort-MD8 device for the close-proximity samples and a commercially available cyclone sampler (Coriolis) with a sampling flow rate of 300 liters/min for the ambient room samples. The cyclone sampler was placed close to the rooms' air exhaust, âˆ¼1.7 m from the floor. Sampling was performed for 10 min, with the room ventilation turned on.</p>
