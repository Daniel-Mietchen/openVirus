<p>During the experiments performed at The Pirbright Institute, air samples were taken twice daily after inoculation. Air samples were collected during a 10-min period with the room ventilation turned off and using five different sampling devices. The devices had different sampling flow rates and were as follows: the AirPort-MD8 (50 liters/min), BioBadge (10 liters/min), BioSampler (12 liters/min), May Multi-Stage Liquid Impinger (55 liters/min), and glass cyclone (570 liters/min) samplers. In addition to this, two sampling approaches were evaluated: (i) close-proximity samples taken from individual calves (sampler placed ∼10 cm from the nostril, within the path of exhaled air), and (ii) ambient room samples, with the cyclone sampler being located at the center of room, ∼1.2 m from the floor. The evaluated aerosol samplers were previously used for the detection of FMDV aerosols, and technical descriptions of these samplers were reported previously (
