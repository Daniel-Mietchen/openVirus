<p>All calves were tested for the presence of FMDV genomes or antibodies against the virus before the day of inoculation. Following inoculation or contact challenge, inoculated and contact calves were monitored twice per day for clinical signs. Nasal and saliva swabs, probang (esophageal-pharyngeal fluid) samples, and serum (blood) samples (here referred to as “diagnostic samples”) were taken daily from day 1 postinoculation to the time when these calves were euthanized. For the experiments performed at The Pirbright Institute, samples were taken twice daily.</p>
