<p>Both clinical and air samples were tested for the presence of virus genomes by using qPCR. For virus load quantification, 10-fold dilutions of the virus supernatant with a known titer (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), determined by virus titration in bovine thyroid cells, were prepared as standard curves. qPCR results were expressed as the equivalent TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per milliliter (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) for diagnostic samples or the equivalent TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per cubic meter of air for air samples.
