<p>Data reported previously by Pacheco et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) on the use of air sampling in experimental rooms to assess the diagnostic potential of air sampling for the detection of FMDV were also used for analysis in this study. Those authors described the use of air samplers for the preclinical detection of FMDV in experimental rooms housing calves infected with FMDV serotype A. One calf was housed per room, and samplers with different sampling rates (4.6, 15, and 144 liters/min) were used to sample air from these rooms daily. Data were obtained from a total of 12 independent trials (rooms), providing a total of 36 room samples.
