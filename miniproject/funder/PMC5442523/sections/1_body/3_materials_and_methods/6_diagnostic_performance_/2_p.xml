<p>Statistical analysis was undertaken by using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), where each calf was included as a random effect (to account for repeated observations of the same animals). To compare shedding levels during each of the three phases of the infection process, a GLMM with a Gaussian distribution was formulated, where the relative titer in the sample as measured by qPCR was the response variable and the phase of infection was the predictor variable. For the quantification the diagnostic Se of qPCR, each sample result was classified as positive/negative, and a GLMM with a binomial error distribution was fitted (
