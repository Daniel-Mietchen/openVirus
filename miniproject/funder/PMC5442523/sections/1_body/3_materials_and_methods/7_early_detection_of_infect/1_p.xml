<p>To evaluate the impact of using preclinical diagnosis for the early detection of infected herds during an epidemic, we combined the estimates of the diagnostic Se of the different sample type-PCR combinations in an early detection model developed previously (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In brief, this model takes into account the infection and disease dynamics within an infected herd, where the daily prevalence of susceptible cattle, latently infected cattle, cattle in the incubation period, and infectious and recovered cattle is modeled by using a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, which also included a compartment for infected animals in the incubation period (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This model also takes into account surveillance characteristics such as the diagnostic Se of the tests, the number of animals sampled at random (sample size) from the assessed herd, and the sampling frequency (sampling interval). All these characteristics, together with the prevalence at the time of sampling, define the Se of surveillance. The higher the Se, the lower the probability of an infected farm escaping detection within a sampling interval. Emergency surveillance starts when one (the first) infected farm is detected and control measures start. In this model, it is assumed that the spread of infection (or introduction) to at-risk farms (neighbors or dangerous contacts) takes place at any random (unknown) moment in time between the last time (a random day) when the farm was tested and the next one. A maximum of 7 days was used as a sampling interval (
