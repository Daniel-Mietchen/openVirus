<p id="Par29">The need and ability to conduct clinical research during infectious disease outbreaks to inform current and future responses is gaining acceptance as a core pillar of outbreak response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the unpredictable nature of outbreaks makes outbreak research challenging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Since time is of the essence, researchers, policy makers, and funders need to rapidly identify key gaps in evidence at the earliest stages of an outbreak, so that they can prioritize research to address those gaps and ensure that any research that is undertaken has maximal value [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Traditional approaches to evidence assimilation, such as systematic reviews, require time and resources that are unlikely to be available during an outbreak, with traditional systematic reviews generally taking at least 12 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Rapid reviews are a variation of a systematic review that balances time constraints with considerations in bias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], designed to inform healthcare policies and guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even rapid reviews and scoping reviews might require 1 to 6 months or longer to complete [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no gold standard approach for rapid or scoping reviews, with methods varying greatly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This highlights a need for a robust methodology to rapidly and systematically identify key gaps in knowledge and evidence to inform research prioritization early in outbreaks. To address this, we developed and piloted a transparent and replicable protocol for carrying out a rapid research needs appraisal (RRNA), within 5 days in response to (re-) emerging outbreaks globally. The aim is not to identify and fully appraise all the available evidence, since this is not feasible within 5 days. Rather, the aim is to identify important gaps in evidence and knowledge in a robust, systematic, and replicable manner to rapidly inform clinical research prioritization.
