<p id="Par30">The RRNA was piloted in 2017 using a fictitious Lassa fever (LF) outbreak scenario. LF is an acute, viral illness first recognized in Nigeria in 1969 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The causative pathogen, Lassa virus (LASV), is a zoonotic, single-stranded RNA arenavirus that is endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, with seasonal peaks in incidence. A limited number of cases have also been reported from Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’ Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the beginning of 2018, Nigeria experienced a large outbreak of LF, with 1999 suspected cases reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Of 437 confirmed cases, 109 died, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 25% in confirmed cases [
