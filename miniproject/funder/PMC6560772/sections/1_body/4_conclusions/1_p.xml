<p id="Par66">This pilot study shows that the RRNA methodology can be used to systematically and transparently identify important research gaps, in days and weeks rather than months or years. The findings highlight that using a RRNA together with input from a disease-specific expert panel can ensure that a wider range of clinical research priorities is identified than if using either method on its own. The pilot illustrates the benefit of global research networks, but also a need to strengthen networks in epidemic “hot spot” regions, which could ensure people with appropriate language skills and contextual expertise are trained and engaged in future RRNAs. The RRNA is not intended to replace systematic reviews, or to generate data for a meta-analysis, but as a tool to inform rapid research prioritization when there are no systematic reviews or robust RCTs available, such as for many of the WHO priority pathogens [

As well as expanding to other diseases areas, it is also important that the gaps that a RRNA identifies for a particular disease are re-visited periodically and in the context of the outbreak. For instance, for Lassa fever, this might include the need for additional research on circulating strains, rate of infectivity, risk groups, risk of transmission from body fluids, re-infection, and health outcomes. These results show that the RRNA can fill in gaps not identified by the expert panel, and the expert panel can help refine the research priorities further. The RRNA methodology can be used in response to any (re-) emerging outbreak globally, when there is no recent systematic review available and applied for the scenario of a “disease X” [
