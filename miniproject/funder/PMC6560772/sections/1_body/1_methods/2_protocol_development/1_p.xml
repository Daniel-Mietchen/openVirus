<p id="Par32">A working group of experts with experience in systematic and rapid review methodologies, information management, and clinical infectious disease research was convened. The protocol was developed over 4â€‰months through three face-to-face meetings with members of the working group and e-mail iterations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The methodology was designed to be used for (re-) emerging infectious diseases where existing evidence and knowledge is expected to be limited and for the purposes of this exercise was focused on clinical aspects, rather than epidemiological, animal, or ecological studies. Therefore, the protocol was designed to be inclusive with a focus on identifying all relevant articles presenting the outcomes of clinical research, including conference abstracts and ongoing clinical trials. The protocol was piloted in a two-stage process. Prior to piloting, experienced systematic reviewers based across three different time zones (Canada, the UK, the Philippines) were engaged and trained in the methodology and the use of the DistillerSR online systematic review software. The systematic reviewers programmed the generic RRNA screening and data extraction forms into DistillerSR prior to piloting. A Dropbox folder was set up for sharing of documents. An online instant messenger group was also set up to allow queries to be posted and answered rapidly by all members of the team.
