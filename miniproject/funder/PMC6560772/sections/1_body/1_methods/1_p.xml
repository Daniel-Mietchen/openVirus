<p id="Par31">The RRNA protocol was developed as a collaboration between Cochrane Response, the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Evidence Aid, and the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team staff at the University of Oxford. The methodology was derived from existing rapid review methodologies and optimized through the use of global teams of systematic reviewers across different time zones, pre-defined screening and data extraction templates and the use of an online systematic review software (DistillerSR, Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). The protocol was focused on identifying existing evidence gaps across pre-defined clinical domains (Additional file
