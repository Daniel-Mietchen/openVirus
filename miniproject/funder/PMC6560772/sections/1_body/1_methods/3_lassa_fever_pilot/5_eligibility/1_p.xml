<p id="Par38">One systematic reviewer screened titles and abstracts for inclusion using DistillerSR, with a second reviewer screening all papers deemed ineligible by the first reviewer. Any disagreements were passed to the next level of screening. Full-text articles were screened independently by two reviewers and consensus on disagreements reached by involving a third reviewer. Articles not found through the automated or manual search were excluded due to non-accessibility given the time constraints. These were listed with full bibliography in the final report. All articles presenting human, clinical LF quantitative research were included. Qualitative studies, non-human animal and cell studies, were excluded. Studies only presenting data on community transmission from zoonotic sources were excluded, since the objective was on clinical research. There were no language limitations at the screening stages.</p>
