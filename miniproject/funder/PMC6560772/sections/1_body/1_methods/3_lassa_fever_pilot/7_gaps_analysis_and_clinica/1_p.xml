<p id="Par41">The final data extraction table was reviewed by one member of the CT, who organized and summarized the level of evidence and outcomes identified for each clinical domain and incorporated the findings into a final report post-day 5 of the RRNA process. The final report was submitted to the CT. The members of the CT subsequently identified gaps in evidence by reviewing the extracted data for each clinical domain, by study design, study objectives, populations covered, interventions/exposure, and outcomes presented and through a round of iterations and consensus discussions over 2â€‰days defined key clinical research priorities, informed by the gaps in evidence identified.</p>
