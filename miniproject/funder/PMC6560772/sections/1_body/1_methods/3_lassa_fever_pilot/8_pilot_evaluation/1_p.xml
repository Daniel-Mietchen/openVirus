<p id="Par42">The full RRNA pilot was evaluated in a two-step process. Firstly, a brief survey was sent to everyone involved in the pilot, asking about facilitators and barriers experienced. The survey responses were collated by the CT and discussed during a telephone conference a week after completion of the pilot. Secondly, an expert panel of three LF experts was asked to independently identify seminal articles and LF clinical research priorities. The panel members independently identified clinical research priorities and seminal articles from their previous experience of Lassa fever research. These were submitted to the team at Oxford University via e-mail, de-duplicated and consolidated into one list. The list of seminal articles was compared with the articles included in the RRNA, and articles excluded due to non-accessibility. The clinical research priorities were compared with those identified by the CT from the RRNA data.</p>
