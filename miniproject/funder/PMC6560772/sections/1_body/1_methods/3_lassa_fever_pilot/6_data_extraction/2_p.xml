<p id="Par40">The protocol specified that one systematic reviewer performed the data extraction from the included papers. A second researcher would then do a random check of 10% of all qualitative data and 100% of the quantitative data extracted. For prioritization purposes, articles would be extracted in order of study design and publication date, with study designs providing a higher level of evidence and most recently published articles prioritized. Data would not be extracted from studies whose design provided a lower level of evidence, such as case series and case reports, when data were available from studies providing a higher level of evidence for the clinical domains addressed in the article. The final data extraction table was submitted to the CT as an Excel file by mid-day on day 5, together with the list of bibliographies of the articles not extracted, with reasons provided and a PRISMA flow chart.</p>
