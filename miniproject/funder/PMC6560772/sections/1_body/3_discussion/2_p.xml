<p id="Par61">Key strengths of the process were the use of experienced systematic reviewers, trained in the RRNA methodology in advance and based across different global time zones for resource optimization. Use of an online systematic review software allowed various steps in the review process to be carried out in parallel, minimizing handovers and knowledge transfer loss. The RRNA protocol was developed specifically for emerging outbreaks where previous clinical research is likely limited. Therefore, the protocol was designed to be over-inclusive at the screening stage, with the aim to reduce the risk of any relevant studies being missed. However, for the LF pilot, the number of articles retrieved and deemed eligible was higher than expected from previous experiences for a re-emerging outbreak, which meant that the full-text screening and data extraction took longer than anticipated. This was alleviated by the prioritization of the data extraction step, whereby lower levels of evidence were not extracted if a higher level of evidence were identified for the clinical domains covered. Furthermore, articles in languages other than English were included but not data extracted. For the future, we recommend that resources should be allocated in relation to the number of articles identified at the search stage. Moreover, depending on the nature of the outbreak and region of endemicity of the pathogen, reviewers with appropriate language skills can be identified at the outset.</p>
