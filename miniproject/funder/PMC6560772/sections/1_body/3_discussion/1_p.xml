<p id="Par60">The development and piloting of the RRNA process demonstrates that a global partnership, through effective use of time zones, can deliver a robust summary of much of the published clinical research evidence on Lassa fever within 5â€‰days in response to an outbreak. The results show that the RRNA methodology can be a valuable tool for rapidly identifying gaps in evidence and informing clinical research priorities in response to (re-) emerging outbreaks globally, ideally combined with an expert panel for further refinement of the research priorities.</p>
