<p id="Par65">The pilot evaluation shows that it is feasible to carry out a robust RRNA within 5 days in response to an outbreak, to inform clinical research priorities. Another 3 to 5 days are recommended for summarizing and reviewing the extracted data, in order to identify gaps in evidence and to formulate clinical research priorities. The resource limitations encountered can be minimized by identifying reviewers, depending on the number of articles identified at the search stage. Depending on the nature of the outbreak, e.g., endemicity, reviewers with specific language skills should be engaged. Identifying experts for the panel took longer than anticipated and although the clinical researchers who formed the expert panel for this pilot had years of experience in LF research, in collaboration with research groups in endemic areas, engaging experts from endemic areas would be desirable. For sustainability, it is important to identify a pool of clinical researchers and systematic reviewers globally, with a focus on infectious disease “hot spot” regions, that are trained in the process and on “stand-by” ready to be activated. Moreover, it is important to engage a pool of global emerging infectious disease experts in advance. The fact that the time commitment is limited minimizes the time spent away from other work commitments and can act as an important facilitator. Timely and effective data sharing during a public health emergency and potential copyright issues around sharing of non-open access articles are other challenges that need to be addressed in advance.</p>
