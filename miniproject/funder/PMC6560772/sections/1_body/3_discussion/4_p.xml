<p id="Par63">Despite the high number of articles identified, the RRNA was able to identify key clinical research articles, which enabled the CT to identify a broad range of gaps in evidence and clinical research priorities across all domains, including eight unique research questions not identified by the expert panel. Prospective clinical observational studies of patients with Lassa fever could answer many of the key evidence gaps, such as risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms for severe disease, infectivity of body tissues, long-term sequelae, and immunological responses. A need for diagnostic studies was also identified by both the RRNA method and the experts and could be nested within clinical observational studies. In addition, clinical trials are needed to evaluate the use of supportive care strategies, ribavirin, and other potential therapeutics. Given the fairly predictable timing and location of LF cases, all these research questions should be tractable given sufficient resources and effort.</p>
