<p id="Par64">Although there was an overlap of research questions identified by the RRNA team and the panel members, both methods identified unique research questions. The questions identified by the RRNA team tended to be broader, whereas the expert panel identified more focused questions. This shows that using both methods can lead to a more robust and comprehensive set of research priorities that covers all domains, while ensuring specificity, than relying on either process alone. All seminal papers that fit the inclusion criteria were identified by the RRNA methodology. The number of seminal papers highlighted by the panel that did not fit the inclusion criteria emphasizes the need to ensure that all stakeholders are fully trained in the process in advance, ideally through a briefing meeting to ensure full understanding of the process.</p>
