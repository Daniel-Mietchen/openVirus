<p id="Par58">A comparison of the clinical research priorities identified by the steering group from the RRNA data with the priorities independently identified by the LF expert panel shows that though there is overlap, each method identified unique priorities. Despite the number of articles identified by the RRNA, the types of studies that were reported meant that there was limited robust evidence in the clinical domains investigated with inadequacies in the quality of the reporting (such as a lack of case definitions and methods used for diagnostics). This meant that the steering group, through a review of the extracted data, identified several clinical research priorities where important uncertainties and evidence gaps remain. These are presented in the table, together with the clinical research priorities identified by the independent LF expert panel (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Of the 19 clinical research priorities informed by the RRNA data, 11 of those were also listed as priorities by the expert panel, together with an additional ten research priorities. This shows that the RRNA methodology was able to identify most of the priorities identified by the Lassa fever expert panel, together with an additional eight unique priorities not identified by the expert panel. The priorities identified by the expert panel tended to be more specific, whereas the priorities identified from the RRNA covered a wider focus.
