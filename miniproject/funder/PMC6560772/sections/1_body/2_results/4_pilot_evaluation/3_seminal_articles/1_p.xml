<p id="Par59">There were 21 seminal articles identified by the LF expert panel. These were all identified by the RRNA search strategy, although 13 did not meet the inclusion criteria for the RRNA and were excluded at the screening stage, mainly due to being animal or cell culture studies. The remaining eight articles [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>] were all included in the RRNA. Three of these articles [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] were case series or case reports and not extracted, instead included with full bibliography. This shows that the RRNA successfully identified and included all seminal articles identified by the LF expert panel which met the RRNA inclusion eligibility criteria.
