<p id="Par47">The data extracted were comprehensive, as would be required for a systematic review. However, for the purpose of the RRNA, in order to enable identification of gaps in evidence and knowledge in a short timeframe, the data were streamlined by a member of the CT to highlight the key PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) parameters required for this purpose, in addition to bibliography, study design, and setting. Data queries were resolved via e-mail after completion of the pilot. Due to the high number of articles identified and the amount and complexity of data extracted, tidying and organizing of the data to facilitate identification of gaps in evidence took longer than expected. The final report was submitted to the steering group, together with a PRISMA flowchart and the supplements 3â€‰days post-pilot completion. Gaps in evidence were identified, individually by members of the CT, through a review of the extracted data for each clinical domain. A narrative summary of the level of evidence and gaps in evidence identified from the data by clinical domains is provided below.</p>
