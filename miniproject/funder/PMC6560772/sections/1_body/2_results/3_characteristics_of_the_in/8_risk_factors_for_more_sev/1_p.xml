<p id="Par56">There were four studies identified and data extracted for this domain (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The studies were set in Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] and Guinea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. One study was set in both countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. The data represented more than 2000 participants and over 500 confirmed or probable LF cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A number of studies reported that elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels were associated with increased mortality rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>], one study also reported a correlation between low levels of blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine aminotransferase and survival [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. Two studies reported an association between low levels of a number of cytokines and survival rates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>].
