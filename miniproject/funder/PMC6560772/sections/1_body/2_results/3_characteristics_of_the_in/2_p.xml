<p id="Par49">The articles were prioritized so that data were extracted first from studies whose design provided the highest level of evidence. Ongoing studies and conference abstracts were also prioritized, since they can present important preliminary findings. Case series and case reports were not extracted when higher level of evidence was available for all the clinical domains addressed in the article. Of the 110 articles, 52 met the data extraction criteria and 46 were extracted within the 5 days [
