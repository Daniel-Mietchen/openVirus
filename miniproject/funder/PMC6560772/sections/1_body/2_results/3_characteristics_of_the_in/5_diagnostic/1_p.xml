<p id="Par53">Fourteen studies were available for this domain; eight qualified for data extraction, and seven were extracted within the time frame (Table

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>], and one in Nigeria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>], providing data from more than 800 confirmed cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Most identified studies were observational, with one case-control study. The studies used different diagnostic tests, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the most commonly used. Neither a gold standard diagnostic test nor clinical or laboratory case definitions were reported. Moreover, systematic diagnostic and sampling strategies were not reported. The studies indicated that no single diagnostic test could detect all cases or strains of LF [
