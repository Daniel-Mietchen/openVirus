<p id="Par54">Twenty-one studies were identified for this domain; six articles qualified for data extraction of those five were extracted within the time frame (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Two studies were set in Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>], two in Guinea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>], one in Mali [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and one in Liberia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. One study was set in more than one country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. Though there were a limited number of studies identified, they provided data from more than 4500 participants, including 1400 LF-positive people (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). One study reported seroprevalence data from a rural region of Guinea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and a cohort study reported that LF IgM antibodies may persist for months to years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. The data shows that there are large gaps in evidence regarding the immune response to LF infection caused by different strains, in different at-risk populations and over time.
