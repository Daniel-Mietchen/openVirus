 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] (set in the USA and Germany), providing data for more than 1500 participants and almost 800 LF cases (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The highest level of evidence in this domain was a non-randomized controlled study set in Sierra Leone (1986, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 312), which studied the effect of ribavirin and convalescent plasma therapy. It was a relatively small study, which showed no reduction in case fatality rates using LF convalescent plasma, but indicated that ribavirin was effective, especially if administered within the first 6 days of illness [
