<p id="Par52">Twenty-three articles were identified for this domain; 13 qualified for data extraction and data were extracted for 12 of these, reporting data from 1980 participants, including nearly 300 confirmed cases of LF (Tables

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Several of the studies reported risk of nosocomial transmission to other patients and healthcare workers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>], with attack rates ranging from 11 to 55% in different settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. Four studies reported the use of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>], administered to a different level of contacts. A total of 64 Lassa fever contacts were treated with the drug. Though it was evident that there is a risk of transmission from body fluids in hospital settings, there were no robust studies identified studying risk of transmission from different types of body fluids or organs, moreover, a lack of standardization of definitions of a “contact.”
