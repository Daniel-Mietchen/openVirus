<p id="Par51">Symptoms of LF on presentation and during hospital admission in healthcare settings in West Africa were described in 15 studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The data shows that LF has been studied in adult and pediatric populations in lower income healthcare settings in West Africa. Most of the studies were observational studies, and many lacked data on case definition, diagnostic criteria used to support the findings, or risk factors, such as comorbidities or immunosuppression through age, illness, or medication. Another gap identified was the quantification of the risk of complications, more severe disease, and sequelae in different at-risk populations. Eleven studies presented data on CFR with standard care: six were set in Nigeria [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], three in Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], and two in Liberia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The CFR ranged from 5.6 to 75%, but with limited information to explain the wide variations observed in different settings or description of the standard care provided.
