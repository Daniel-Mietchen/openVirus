<p id="Par44">Screening of title and abstracts began before the end of day 1, started by the review team in Canada, followed by the Philippines, then the UK, optimizing use of global time zone, and was completed by day two, with 39% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 428/1104) of records passing this step and requiring further assessment. In parallel to the screening of title and abstracts, the information specialist retrieved full-text papers using Endnote’s automatic retrieval function. This was complemented by a manual search of papers not retrieved automatically. The full-text papers were submitted to the review teams and uploaded to DistillerSR in sections. Using the software allowed review processes to be carried out in parallel, while reducing the need for handovers. As soon as papers were deemed potentially eligible, another reviewer could start the full-text screening followed by data extraction, while others continued screening of title and abstracts (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In tandem, electronic copies of journal articles could be uploaded in the system, and progress tracked in real time. Issues were dealt with via the online instant messenger group and during a brief daily mid-day Skype meeting between the review teams. Two members of the CT were on standby to assist throughout the 5 days.
