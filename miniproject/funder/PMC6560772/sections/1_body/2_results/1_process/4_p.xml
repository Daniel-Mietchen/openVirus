<p id="Par46">The search was completed earlier than planned, which meant that the screening of title and abstracts and full-text papers commenced earlier than scheduled. However, the retrieval and screening of full-text papers and resolution of conflicts took longer than anticipated. This was partly due to the higher than expected number of articles identified for a (re-) emerging infectious disease and because Endnote’s automatic paper retrieval only retrieved 51% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 565/1104) of the articles as PDFs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 436) or URL links (
 <italic>n</italic> = 129). The remaining full-text papers, which passed through the first title and abstract screening step (
 <italic>n</italic> = 249), were searched for manually by members of the CT through the University of Oxford online library access. Papers not found after the manual search (
 <italic>n</italic> = 145) were excluded due to inaccessibility, instead listed with full bibliography in the final report (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Most of these articles were not accessible due to being published in non-English languages and journals. There were no systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified amongst the non-accessible articles. The data extraction table was submitted to the CT as a Microsoft Excel file by mid-day on day 5. This was supplemented by a PRISMA flow chart and bibliographies of the studies which were excluded due to not being accessible within the time frame (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) or included but not being data extracted (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The unexpected retrieval and resolution of full-text article delays meant that the proportional check of the extracted data by a second reviewer was not completed within the 5 days. Instead, a member of the CT checked 30% of the extracted data post-day 5.
