However, high proportions of these men have never undertaken HIV testing. We assessed barriers to and facilitators of HIV testing among men who purchase sex in Indonesia, including the acceptability of HIV self-testing. A qualitative study was conducted during December 2016-January 2017 at fourteen sex-work venues and one voluntary HIV counselling and testing (VCT) clinic in Bali. Interviews were conducted with men who purchase sex exploring the men&#x02019;s views on HIV testing. Data were examined using thematic analysis. Twenty-nine men participated in the study. The themes that emerged regarding the barriers to HIV testing included fear of potential shame, embarrassment, and confidentiality breach in accessing HIV testing; fear of social exclusion if the test result was positive; self-treatment and prevention; the distance to a clinic; time constraints; and fear of an invasive testing method. Factors that were seen as facilitating a test were the convenience of time and place; the provision of speedy results; and privacy. Participants expressed interest in HIV self-testing and preferred it to clinic-based testing due to the privacy and confidentiality of the results. The findings support the introduction of an HIV self-testing strategy among this group to improve access to HIV testing.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Dr Luh Putu Lila Wulandari received an Australia Awards Scholarships administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

With a total population of men in Asia at more than 2.3 billion [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], estimates have ranged from 0.5% to 15% of the adult male population as having purchased sex [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] from female sex workers, among whom HIV prevalence was estimated at 5.2% in Asia in 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In addition to possible HIV exposure due to condom-less sex with female sex workers, other factors that might place men who purchase sex at an increased risk of HIV include having multiple sexual partners [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], sexual contact with men [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a high rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that could increase HIV transmission [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and injecting drug use [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although some studies have reported a low HIV prevalence (0&#x02013;0.5%) among men who purchase sex [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], other studies have reported a high HIV prevalence, ranging from 5.7% to 26.5% [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Systematic reviews of HIV prevalence among men who purchase sex in China and West and Central Africa found overall prevalence of 0.68% [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and 7.3% [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] respectively.</p><p>In a number of countries, men who purchase sex have been found to have substantially higher HIV prevalence than men in the general population [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Where condom use in sex work settings is at low or moderate levels, and HIV prevalence among sex working women is high, it is reasonable to assume that men who purchase sex are at higher risk and should therefore access HIV testing. For Indonesia, there have been very limited data available on HIV in this population, apart from surveys of occupational groups such as truck drivers and others [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who may be considered to be more likely to purchase sex, due to mobility. The data of HIV prevalence among those occupational groups revealed the varying rates of HIV prevalence across provinces, i.e. between 0&#x02013;0.8% [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The impetus for providing more opportunities for HIV testing among men who purchase sex is based on the potential risk of HIV acquisition and transmission in this population. Given the engagement of men who purchase sex with other key populations and the fact that this is a difficult-to-reach group that has not often been the focus of national and global prevention efforts, the need for HIV testing among this group is paramount.</p><p>HIV testing serves as an important gateway for preventing HIV transmission as well as for care and treatment. Acknowledging the importance of HIV testing, over the past few years the Indonesian government has intensified efforts to scale up access to testing facilities so as to reach higher risk populations, including men who purchase sex. Despite these efforts to scale-up testing access, testing coverage among men who purchase sex remains low. We conducted a survey of men who purchase sex in Bali in 2015 and found that only 8.1% of men who purchase sex had undertaken HIV testing [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], contrasting with other countries such as the US, Russia, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Nepal, and China where HIV testing rates of between 16% and 74% have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Globally, the UNAIDS coverage goal is for 90% of people living with HIV to be aware of their positive HIV status through an HIV test [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Recognising the difficulty of achieving this with clinic-based testing alone, the World Health Organization (WHO) released new guidelines in 2016 highlighting the importance of using self-testing to expand access to and coverage of HIV testing [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Several systematic reviews have reported high acceptability of this strategy among populations at risk [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. There have also been many qualitative studies investigating the acceptability of HIV self-tests in the general population and other key populations but, to the best of our knowledge, none among men who purchase sex. Conducting qualitative research among men who purchase sex is important since they are at higher risk of HIV compared with the population overall, and may have particular views about testing modalities due to their behaviours being stigmatised and hidden. In the context of a broader research program focused on HIV testing among men who purchase sex through referral to nearby VCT clinics, we used in-depth interviews to explore barriers to, and facilitators of HIV testing among men who purchase sex in Bali, Indonesia, as well as the perceived acceptability of HIV self-testing.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Setting</title><p>Indonesia is categorised as having a concentrated HIV epidemic; it is also one of the fastest growing HIV epidemics in Asia [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], with the current total number of people living with HIV infection estimated to be between 530,000&#x02013;730,000 [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. According to an Integrated Bio-Behavioural Surveillance (IBSS) conducted in 2013, the prevalence of HIV infection was highest in people who inject drugs (39.2%), transgender (7.4%), female sex workers (7.5%), men who have sex with men (12.8%), and prisoners (1.2%), with prevalence varying considerably across Indonesia [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>As of 2017, about 242,699 HIV cases had been reported to the Indonesian Health Ministry since 1987, 66% of them among men [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Bali is one of the provinces in Indonesia that contributed the highest number of these cases, with heterosexual transmission being the second main mode, particularly in the context of transactional sex, which involves the exchange of sex for money, goods or favours [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. As in many Asian countries, a distinction is made in Indonesia between so-called &#x0201c;direct&#x0201d;, or brothel-based female sex workers, whose main income is from selling sex, and &#x0201c;indirect&#x0201d; female sex workers, or non brothel-based female sex workers who work in massage parlours, bars, caf&#x000e9;s and karaoke bars for their main income, but also offer sex services. It was estimated in 2017 that 5.2 million men in Indonesia bought sex from direct female sex workers [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The COREQ qualitative reporting guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] were used to guide the development of this report, with the information presented in accordance with the COREQ checklist. COREQ is a formal guideline aimed to improve the transparency of reporting of the data collection and analysis method used in qualitative studies. It contains a checklist of research team reflexivity, study design, and analysis and findings [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Study design</title><p>Qualitative research was employed due to its interpretative approach to gaining an understanding of how people make sense of their lives [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Qualitative studies are the only means by which people&#x02019;s attitudes to a new health technology can be properly understood, because they allow respondents to report their perceptions in detail at an individual level. They complement data from quantitative surveys, which have the benefit of being applicable at a population level, but can only provide binary information on predetermined items. This approach is suited to the current initial, exploratory study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, as well as the perceived acceptability of HIV self-testing, which are most likely to relate to people&#x02019;s perceptions about HIV risk and how it might be mitigated. A number of earlier studies have used qualitative methods to understand perceptions on HIV testing and specifically HIV self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Ethics information</title><p>Ethics approvals were obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of Udayana University/Sanglah Hospital, Indonesia and the Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs) of the University of New South Wales, Australia.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Timeline and participant selection</title><p>Data collection was undertaken between December 2016 and January 2017 in Denpasar, Bali.

In order to include men with a range of views and experiences related to HIV prevention services, men who had sex with both brothel-based and non brothel-based female sex workers (such as those in massage parlours, caf&#x000e9;s and bungalows) were recruited. In addition, to ensure we captured the views of men from different ethnic groups, we aimed to recruit men from diverse Indonesian ethnicities, which in Bali means primarily Balinese or Javanese men. We intended to recruit 20&#x02013;30 participants, with the final sample size based on the achievement of data saturation, when no new meaningful information would likely be obtained from interviewing more participants [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Procedure</title><p>Clients of brothel/non-brothel female sex workers were recruited with the assistance of fieldworkers from the Yayasan Kerti Praja (YKP), a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that provides HIV interventions for female sex workers in brothel and non-brothel areas. These outreach workers have been active at sex work venues for many years, and have been involved in various research activities such as local surveys or national surveillance. The fieldworkers approached men who presented at the brothels/massage parlours/bungalows/cafes during HIV interventions for female sex workers conducted by the NGO. These interventions included condom promotion and distribution to female sex workers, and referral for STI screening. The outreach workers did not know the potential participants, except for four participants who were clients at the time but were formerly employed at the brothels. In addition, men who presented at the YKP VCT clinic and were willing to participate in the study were recruited with assistance from the VCT clinic counsellor. These men were included in the study in order to understand the perspectives of those already undertaking HIV testing.</p><p>Semi-structured interviews [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] were conducted by LPLW (first author). Participants were interviewed in Indonesian. Interviews lasted about 30 minutes, were audio recorded, and conducted in private areas, guided by the participants&#x02019; preferences. Notes were also taken during the interviews. Before the interview, LPLW introduced herself as a PhD student who was studying health behaviours among men, and sought informed consent from those who were willing to be involved in the study.</p><p>An interview theme list [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was used to guide the interview process.

Subjects covered in the interview were: knowledge and perception of HIV and AIDS; sexual health experience; experiences with HIV testing services; preferences in the provision of HIV testing including self-testing; and stigma surrounding HIV. To improve the quality and validity of the findings, member checking was conducted at the time of the interview, that is, participants were asked to elaborate or clarify whether the researchers had captured correctly what the participants had said in the interviews [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Analysis</title><p>The recordings of the interviews were transcribed verbatim and were not translated into English as both researchers who undertook the analysis were fluent in Bahasa Indonesia.

Although participants acknowledged that HIV testing is important for knowing one&#x02019;s HIV status, they were concerned about the social implications in accessing HIV testing at the clinic and receiving a positive result, and preferred a more confidential method of testing. Similar findings have emerged from studies among men who purchase sex in Guatemala [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], where confidentiality concerns hindered participants from having an HIV test, and in Tanzania, where confidentiality was a key factor in determining the choice of HIV testing strategy [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>Confidentiality protection was an attractive feature of self-testing that most participants perceived in the study, saying that if they could choose, they would prefer self-testing to a test at a clinic; they would prefer to do the test themselves and perform the test at a time and place convenient to them to assure privacy and confidentiality. This is consistent with studies on the perceived benefits of self-testing in other populations, for example in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], in the US [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], in Britain [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p><p>HIV self-testing also has the potential to overcome logistical barriers raised by men, such as distance from the clinic and time constraints. In other countries, a range of delivery methods for self-testing have been utilised, including online ordering,[<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] purchasing from pharmacies [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], provision by women (both female sex workers and pregnant women) to male partners [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], household delivery [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and vending machines [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These studies indicate that the efficiency of provision and saving of time are key motivators to using self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Fear of an invasive testing method also emerged as a reason for the men&#x02019;s reluctance to get an HIV test. This issue can be resolved by HIV self-testing, especially modalities that make use of oral fluids [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. A demonstration project using self-testing using oral fluids revealed a 6&#x02013;7 times higher likelihood of testing uptake compared to conventional blood-based HIV testing at the clinic [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>].</p><p>Our study reveals that the perceptions about HIV risk strongly influence men&#x02019;s decisions about having an HIV test. Some believed they did not need to undertake HIV testing because they were at low risk of HIV. Other participants perceived HIV as a life-threatening disease and preferred not to seek the test and remain ignorant of their HIV status. Again, this finding is consistent with other studies, for example, from Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], both countries with a longer experience of HIV prevalence than Indonesia. To overcome these misconceptions, there needs to be a greater emphasis on education and community awareness. It is also imperative that the community understands the efficacy of modern HIV treatments in preventing disease progression and prolonging life, and that access to treatment can only be achieved if people know their HIV status&#x02013;the sooner the better.</p><p>Other issues raised by men relate to knowledge about their risk of HIV and health implications of the virus. To overcome these issues, emphasis on education and community awareness might also be worth considering. Stigma also has a strong influence on men&#x02019;s decisions to undertake HIV testing. Strategies to alleviate stigma and thereby reduce barriers to HIV testing include improving HIV-related knowledge, ensuring the provision of support to people living with HIV, and structural interventions such as laws to protect the rights of people living with HIV, or replacement of a counterproductive law [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In addition, a more robust public information campaign about the availability of free ARVs through the government health services, presenting HIV as a manageable chronic illness, would be beneficial.</p><p>Another interesting finding of the current study is that men preferred self-medication for STIs over going to a clinic. Men said they bought treatment themselves when they had STI symptoms, and believed it would protect them from both HIV and other STIs. Self-treatment among men who purchase sex, particularly by the use of antibiotics, has long been acknowledged in this setting [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and has also been observed in Cambodia. More than half of men who purchase sex who participated in a Cambodian study reported that they went to pharmacies for treatment for their last STI, compared with only 10% and 18% who went to private or public clinics, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Self-treatment is not ideal from a medical perspective, since most STIs do not have symptoms and over-treatment could facilitate antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The preference for self-medication highlights the stigma around STIs, raising additional barriers to accessing clinics [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>Some caution should be taken when interpreting the results of the current study. Although participants reported a preference for self-testing over clinic-based testing, we did not ask them specifically about their willingness to seek treatment at a clinic if they were positive in a self-test. Some studies internationally have reported suboptimal rates of linkage to care following self-testing [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], and in interviews, participants mentioned confidentiality concerns at the clinic, and fear of gossip within the community if they were seen going to the clinic. Another potential issue is that men were asked about HIV self-testing hypothetically, not having actual experience of it, so they may not have had a realistic view of its benefits or disadvantages. Also, the higher testing coverage (31%), compared with previous surveys (7&#x02013;8.5%) among this population in Bali, may have arisen because some participants were recruited from a private VCT clinic. The refusal rate was high, which is not unexpected given the social stigma relating to buying sex. While the high refusal rate may have affected generalizability, the goal of a qualitative study is to provide a broad picture of views and perceptions, unlike quantitative studies which focus on generalization and prediction [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>].</p><p>Interpretation and input from the investigator is also an important part of a qualitative study. It is acknowledged that the researcher&#x02019;s background will, to some extent, influence the data collection and analysis process [<xref rid="pone.0214987.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The primary investigator, who conducted the interviews with participants, is a female Indonesian medical doctor trained in qualitative research who has been involved in various public health HIV interventions and research involving pregnant women and female sex workers in Bali, but had not previously been involved in providing care to men who purchase sex at the study sites. The first co-investigator is a female native English-speaking public health practitioner, with a PhD degree and anthropology background, who speaks fluent Indonesian and has been involved in various public health HIV interventions in Bali. The backgrounds of these researchers may have influenced how the data was collected and analysed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study has revealed important perceptions related to structural and individual barriers to HIV self-testing in Bali. Men indicated that if they could choose, they would prefer a test that is confidential, so that only they would know the result. Men also expressed their interest in HIV self-testing, indicating the need for further research on the acceptability and feasibility of HIV self-testing among men who purchase sex. Future HIV programs should also continue to explicitly address misconceptions about HIV risk and disease progression, and to more vigorously emphasise the availability of treatment for HIV as a chronic condition.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the men who participated in this study, and the outreach workers of the Yayasan Kerti Praja who took part in recruiting participants.
