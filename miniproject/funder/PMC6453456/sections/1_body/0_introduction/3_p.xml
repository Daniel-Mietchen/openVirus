<p>In a number of countries, men who purchase sex have been found to have substantially higher HIV prevalence than men in the general population [

 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Where condom use in sex work settings is at low or moderate levels, and HIV prevalence among sex working women is high, it is reasonable to assume that men who purchase sex are at higher risk and should therefore access HIV testing. For Indonesia, there have been very limited data available on HIV in this population, apart from surveys of occupational groups such as truck drivers and others [
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], who may be considered to be more likely to purchase sex, due to mobility. The data of HIV prevalence among those occupational groups revealed the varying rates of HIV prevalence across provinces, i.e. between 0–0.8% [
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The impetus for providing more opportunities for HIV testing among men who purchase sex is based on the potential risk of HIV acquisition and transmission in this population. Given the engagement of men who purchase sex with other key populations and the fact that this is a difficult-to-reach group that has not often been the focus of national and global prevention efforts, the need for HIV testing among this group is paramount.
