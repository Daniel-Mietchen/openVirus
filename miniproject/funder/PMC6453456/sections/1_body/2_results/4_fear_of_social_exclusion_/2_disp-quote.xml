  <italic>Never [talking about HIV with a friend]. I'm afraid that if I open up about my own disgrace</italic>, 
  <italic>my friends will exclude me. I have been told that [if there are] people like that [who have HIV], [other people] will stay away from us. I know that… I am scared of that. They won’t hang out with me. That’s what I am scared of</italic>.

  <italic>That’s people in Indonesia. Even if two people are just walking together, people will say that they’re dating</italic>, 
  <italic>they will say they’re naughty, that is what people will think. In my place in Malang, [if] there is one person with HIV, people will stay away from them. Although as far as I know, [HIV] cannot be transmitted if we hang out together, don’t exchange saliva, not having sex, no blood from wounds. But, if you live in the village, still everybody will avoid you</italic>. 
  <italic>If you get sick [with AIDS], everybody will avoid you. So it’s better to keep quiet. (cs21, Non Balinese, non brothel-based sex worker‘s client)</italic>

  <italic>[Feeling ashamed towards] everybody… if we are positive… people will stay away from us</italic>.

  <italic>I am afraid of the results. It’s about the future, I’d rather not know the results. If it’s negative</italic>, 
  <italic>that’s better, right, no problem. The thing is, if it’s positive, what if my family knows about it. We will feel ashamed. What is more, what if the whole village knows about it? They will isolate us. Family will feel ashamed too. That’s why it’s better to not know about it. Everyone will die anyway, we just don’t know when</italic>.
