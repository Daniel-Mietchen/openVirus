  <italic>My last test was about a year ago. But directly. I want to do a blood test</italic>, 
  <italic>but I want the results to be instantly visible. If I have to wait for a long time for the results to come, I prefer not to have it. I will be worried. (bs15, Balinese, brothel-based sex worker‘s client)</italic>

  <italic>People sometimes just don’t want to go [to the clinic]… getting treatment in there</italic>, 
  <italic>well they just don’t wanna do that… Except that we do the test here [when we visit the brothels]… If we are asked to go to the clinic … it really depends on time availability. (lu3, Balinese, brothel-based sex worker‘s client)</italic>
