  <italic>If there is one</italic>, 
  <italic>I would prefer the one like a test pack [oral self-testing]. It’s more simple, and only we will know the result. If we go to a clinic, and people know it, I would be ashamed; people will be gossiping about me. (cs28, Non Balinese, non brothel-based sex worker‘s client)</italic>

  <italic>If that is the case [self-testing]</italic>,

We just need to keep quiet … Just keep quiet and find the information on the treatment needed. Anyway, is there any treatment to cure the disease?
