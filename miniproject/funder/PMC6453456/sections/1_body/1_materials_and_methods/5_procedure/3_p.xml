<p>An interview theme list [
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was used to guide the interview process. The questions covered in the interview theme list were developed from the findings of previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and existing literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0214987.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Subjects covered in the interview were: knowledge and perception of HIV and AIDS; sexual health experience; experiences with HIV testing services; preferences in the provision of HIV testing including self-testing; and stigma surrounding HIV. To improve the quality and validity of the findings, member checking was conducted at the time of the interview, that is, participants were asked to elaborate or clarify whether the researchers had captured correctly what the participants had said in the interviews [
