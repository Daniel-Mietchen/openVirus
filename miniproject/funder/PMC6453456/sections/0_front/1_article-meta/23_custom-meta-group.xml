  <meta-value>The transcript excerpts included within the paper are sufficient to replicate this study's findings. Because prostitution in Indonesia is considered against morality and purchasing sex or sex outside marriage is considered as immoral, full transcripts will only be available upon request. In many parts of the interview, respondents mentioned their name, the name of the brothels and the locations of the brothels. Thus, the full transcripts contain potentially identifying or sensitive information. Requests for the full transcripts may be sent to: Luh Putu Lila Wulandari,
