<p>Pneumonia is a common clinical presentation after a respiratory infection. Since 2016, pneumonia has been the third most common cause of death in Taiwan. The majority of pneumonia cases can be classified as either community-acquired, hospital-acquired, or acquired after traveling to foreign countries. Bacterial pneumonia is usually a complication of influenza virus infection [

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America have classified pneumonia into three types, namely community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired (or nosocomial) pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, according to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors for infection in patients with pneumonia [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The etiology of pneumonia includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Generally, pathogens that potentially cause pneumonia subsist of “typical” bacteria and “atypical” organisms, including 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses. However, 11–20% of pneumonia cases are polymicrobial, and the etiology usually consists of a combination of typical and atypical pathogens [

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> has been reported as the major pathogen in secondary infection after individuals were infected by influenza viruses, and it increases the mortality risk of patients [

 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] show that prior influenza vaccination is associated with a less severe clinical course and improved long-term survival in patients with CAP, especially during the influenza epidemic season. However, Shinjoh et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] reported that children who were immunized for two consecutive seasons experienced decreased vaccine effectiveness and were more likely to acquire influenza and that this might be associated with immunity against influenza infection in the previous season. Therefore, the aims of this study are also to clarify this.
