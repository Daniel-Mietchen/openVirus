<p>Among the pathogens, influenza is one of the primary causes of pneumonia and influential respiratory diseases [

Because of the antigenic drift of viruses, epidemics of influenza are reported every year in Taiwan. To effectively prevent the disease, large influenza vaccination programs have been held by the health authority of the Taiwanese government, and the trivalent influenza vaccine containing influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses is employed annually. To increase the influenza vaccination coverage, free-of-charge vaccination programs have been held since 1988 for several groups, including young children under 6 months old, students from primary school to senior high school, and adults with high influenza risk (i.e., people aged over 50 years and patients of any age with a chronic illness like diabetes, chronic hepatitis, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, etc.) [

Therefore, inoculation with the influenza vaccine is critical for both preventing influenza infection and lowering the risk of post-influenza pneumonia development in the elderly [

Influenza vaccination has been reported to be associated not only with prevention of influenza epidemics but also reduced risk of several diseases, such as acute kidney injury, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in elderly people [
