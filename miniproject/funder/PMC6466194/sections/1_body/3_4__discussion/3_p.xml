<p>One of the most serious complications of influenza infection is bacterial pneumonia, which increases morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Evidence shows that older patients, or those with severe illness with pneumonia, had higher 30-day mortality rates [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In general, influenza viruses cause only the desquamation of the epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, but this disrupts the outermost part of the mucosal defense and promotes secondary bacterial pneumonia. The most common pathogens associated with secondary infection are

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> [

 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in elderly individuals, the government has provided free vaccination of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for people aged &gt; 75 since 2008 [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We also considered that one of the factors for lowering pneumonia risk in our enrolled patients might be 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccination. However, only 257 (1.7%) patients in our study population had received 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> vaccine. Therefore, the observation that influenza vaccination could reduce the risk of pneumonia in elderly individuals may not be overestimated.
