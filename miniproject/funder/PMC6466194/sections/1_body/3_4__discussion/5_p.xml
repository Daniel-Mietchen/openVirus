<p>Our study has several limitations. First, in Taiwan, influenza vaccines are purchased from different pharmaceutical companies. The manufacturing process of influenza vaccines varies between pharmaceutical companies. For instance, the inactivated influenza vaccine (i.e., Optaflu©) produced by Novartis contains whole virus, whereas the vaccine produced by Sanofi Pasteur (i.e., Fluzone©) contains split virus. We did not examine whether the protective effect of both these influenza vaccines is the same. In addition, the protective effect may be different for different age groups. Second, we were unable to obtain potentially relevant personal behavioral information, such as alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and body mass index. These confounding factors may have affected the outcome. Third, Taiwan’s National Health Insurance system involves the Taiwanese population. Our data accurately reflects the situation in Taiwan; however, our results may not be applicable to other regions. Fourth, the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) consists of claim data. The database used does not contain information about clinical parameters, such as pneumonia infection severity. Therefore, we could not further distinguish the severities of respiratory diseases. Fifth, the laboratory data and microbial culture data that may affect the occurrence of pneumonia infection are not included in the database. Moreover, information about from sputum cultures or viral swabs and the causative agents of pneumonia was not available. Thus, the cause of pneumonia identified could not be divided into viral or bacterial.</p>
