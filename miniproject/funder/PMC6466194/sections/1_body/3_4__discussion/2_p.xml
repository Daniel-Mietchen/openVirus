<p>Several studies have shown that influenza vaccination not only prevents influenza infection but also reduces the risk of several diseases in certain groups of patients. According to a retrospective cohort study, the administration of the influenza vaccination in elderly patients with diabetes reduced risks of hospitalization, lung failure, and 12-month mortality [

Although the actual mechanism is unclear, influenza vaccination is proposed to be associated with the reduction of the inflammation cascade [

A high-dose influenza vaccine (60 μg of hemagglutinin from each of the three viral strains against 15 μg of hemagglutinin from each of the four viral strains) might be more effective in reducing poor clinical outcomes in patients who have a heart failure or myocardial infarction history [
