<p>The prevalent strains of influenza viruses in Taiwan are A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses. For the prevention of an influenza outbreak, the health authority of the Taiwanese government recommends trivalent influenza vaccine use. However, because of genetic divergence, influenza B viruses are divided into two lineages: Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Simultaneous cocirculation of these lineages has been observed, and a mismatch of the vaccine lineage and circulating strains has been reported [

 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-01078" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This might decrease the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. However, there was no mismatch of the vaccine strains and the circulating strains in our study during the observation period (2010â€“2013).
