<p>In total, 90,491 patients diagnosed with chronic pulmonary disease were initially recruited from 2010 to 2012. Next, 8010 of the 90,491 patients were selected according to a new diagnosis of pneumonia after chronic pulmonary disease diagnosis. Another 56,233 patients who were never diagnosed with pneumonia were also selected. After this, we performed a 1:1 age and sex match, and 7565 patients were enrolled in each of the two groups: pneumonia and non-pneumonia (
