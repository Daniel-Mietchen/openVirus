<p>Finally, we performed a subgroup analysis by age and sex for the vaccination and non-vaccination groups. After we subdivided the patients by age into three subgroups (&lt;40, 40–65, and ≥65), we observed that only those patients aged ≥ 65 had an obvious reduced risk of developing pneumonia (aOR = 0.78, CI = 0.71–0.86). Male patients also showed a lower risk of pneumonia than the female patients. However, vaccination did not reduce the risk of pneumonia in patients aged 40–65 years (
