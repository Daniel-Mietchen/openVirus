<p>We also analyzed the interval between the onset of pneumonia and receiving the influenza vaccination, as well as the number of vaccinations. We compared these results with patients who had never received an influenza vaccination. Patients that received the vaccine one year prior to the study showed a 13% reduction in the risk of developing pneumonia (aOR = 0.87, CI = 0.78–0.98). Patients vaccinated for two consecutive years prior to the study showed a 25% decreased risk of developing pneumonia (aOR = 0.75, CI = 0.67–0.85). Furthermore, patients vaccinated for three consecutive years compared with those who had never received influenza vaccination showed a 44% decreased risk of developing pneumonia (aOR = 0.56, CI = 0.45–0.69) (
