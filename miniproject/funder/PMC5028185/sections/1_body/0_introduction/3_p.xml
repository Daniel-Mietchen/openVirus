ZIKV has been isolated from non-human primate serum, mosquitoes and a range of human samples, including serum, urine, semen, saliva and breastmilk, albeit with limited success. Most reported isolates have been derived following intracerebral suckling mouse brain (SMB) inoculations or infection of African green monkey Vero and Vero E6 or
