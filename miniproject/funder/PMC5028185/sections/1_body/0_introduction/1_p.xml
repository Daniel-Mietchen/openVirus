 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. These Pacific outbreaks signified the first major epidemics of ZIKV disease, and collectively resulted in over 35,000 clinical cases
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Ongoing ZIKV transmission and spread has facilitated outbreaks in a number of Pacific island countries, including Tonga in 2016. Emergence of ZIKV in the Pacific led to its introduction into Brazil in 2015 and has increased the risk of local transmission in several countries, including Australia, via repeated importation from viremic travelers
