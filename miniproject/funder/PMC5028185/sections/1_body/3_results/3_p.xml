<p>Complete E gene sequences were determined for the TS17-2016 isolate and other strains imported recently into Australia via viremic travelers (GenBank accession numbers KX216632, KX216633, KX216634, KX216636, KX216637, KX216638, KX216639, KX380262 and KX380263). Phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Fig. 1</xref>) of the TS17-2016 ZIKV isolate (GenBank accession number KX216635) demonstrated the virus belonged to the Asian lineage together with contemporary Pacific and American strains and shared 99.9% nucleotide identity with sequences from Tonga 2016, Brazil 2015 and French Polynesia 2013 (GenBank accession numbers KX216634, KX280026 and KJ776791, respectively).
