<p>The SMB-recovered ZIKV isolate TS17-2016 was passaged in C6/36 cells 4 times yielding 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) viral titers of 6.80, 9.15, 9.80 and 8.00 log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL for passages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The mean±SD titer of the positive mosquito pools was 3.47±0.67 log
 <sub>10</sub> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL. The SMB viral titers were below the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay threshold of detection.
