<p>Of all isolation attempts, only the serum-derived SMB was positive, with a C
 <sub>t</sub> value of 29. To further amplify viable virus, the serum-derived SMB was then inoculated in duplicate onto C6/36 cells and intrathoracically into pools of ≤10 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Cell and supernatant fractions from cultures and mosquitoes were individually screened by RT-PCR. Mean±SD C
 <sub>t</sub> values for the culture samples were 16.13±0.74 and 18.76±0.62 for the cells and supernatant, respectively, and a mean±SD C
 <sub>t</sub> of 18.22±1.27 was obtained from 25 pools of positive 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.
