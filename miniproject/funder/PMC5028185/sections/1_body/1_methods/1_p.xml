<p>In February, 2016, a female patient in her 30â€™s returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Australia with a fever and maculopapular rash (ProMED-Mail, 
 <italic>Zika Virus</italic> (28), Archive Number: 20160524.4240474, http://beta.promedmail.org/post/4240474). An acute phase serum and a subsequent urine sample were collected 4 days apart. Both samples demonstrated ZIKV RNA by TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> with cycle threshold (C
 <sub>t</sub>) values of 29 (serum) and 34 (urine). The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for serology using a pan-flavivirus IgM microsphere immunoassay and a pan-flavivirus IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. For virus isolation, each sample was inoculated separately onto C6/36 (ATCC, CRL-1660) and Vero (ATCC, CCL-81) cell monolayers and intracerebrally into 1-2 day old Swiss outbred suckling mice. Cells were incubated for 10 days at 28
 <sup>o</sup>C (C6/36) or 37
 <sup>o</sup>C (Vero) and cultures passaged 3 times. Cultures were monitored for virus growth using an immunofluorescence assay
