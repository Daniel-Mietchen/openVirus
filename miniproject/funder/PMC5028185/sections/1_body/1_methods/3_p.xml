<p>Complete ZIKV E gene sequence (1512bp) alignments were performed using Clustal W and Mega 7.0 software
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and a maximum likelihood tree was inferred from the TS17-2016 sequence, additional sequences from ZIKV RT-PCR positive viremic travelers who had returned to Australia and available sequences on GenBank.
