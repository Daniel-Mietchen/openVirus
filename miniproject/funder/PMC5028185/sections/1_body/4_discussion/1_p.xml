<p>This is the first known isolation and characterization of ZIKV from a clinical patient from Tonga and the first of this virus in Australia. Although local ZIKV transmission has not yet been detected in Australia, endemic populations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are present in northern Queensland, a popular tourist destination for overseas travelers, underscoring the potential risk of ZIKV introduction and transmission currently threatening this region. Recent vector competence experiments demonstrated that of 7 common Australian mosquito species tested, only
 <italic> Ae. aegypti</italic> could transmit ZIKV (Hall-Mendelin, S. 
 <italic>et. al</italic>., 2016, Vector competence of Austalian mosquitoes for Zika virus, in press)
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, the distribution of this species is restricted to northern Queensland and it is primarily this region that is receptive to local transmission of ZIKV.
