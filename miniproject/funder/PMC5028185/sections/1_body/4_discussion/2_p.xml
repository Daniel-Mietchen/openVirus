<p>In this study, the success of SMB inoculation and failure to recover live virus directly from patient samples using conventional cell culture techniques highlights potential difficulties in ZIKV isolation. Previous intracerebral inoculations of mice with ZIKV have resulted in symptomatic disease 6-10 days post inoculation

 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. In our study, mice remained asymptomatic for 11 days which could reflect a potentially low infectious viral dose in the serum. Interestingly, both the SMB and original serum had identical C
 <sub>t</sub> values of 29, however, only the SMB demonstrated sufficient infectious viral load to infect C6/36 cells and mosquitoes. Further studies are required to ascertain adaptive genetic and phenotypic characteristics of ZIKV in respective mammalian and arthropod hosts. Importantly, given that relatively few ZIKV isolates that have been recovered to date and the inherent constraints in importing ZIKV strains into many countries for diagnostic assay development and research, the successful isolation of TS17-2016 will be essential for continued investigations of ZIKV transmission and pathogenicity.
