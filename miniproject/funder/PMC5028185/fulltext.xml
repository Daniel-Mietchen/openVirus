<italic>Zika virus</italic> (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus (arbovirus). Discovered in Uganda, Africa, in 1947<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, ZIKV remained in relative obscurity for years until it caused explosive outbreaks on Yap, Federated States of Micronesia, in 2007 and in French Polynesia in 2013<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. These Pacific outbreaks signified the first major epidemics of ZIKV disease, and collectively resulted in over 35,000 clinical cases<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Ongoing ZIKV transmission and spread has facilitated outbreaks in a number of Pacific island countries, including Tonga in 2016. Emergence of ZIKV in the Pacific led to its introduction into Brazil in 2015 and has increased the risk of local transmission in several countries, including Australia, via repeated importation from viremic travelers<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>ZIKV is a member of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and urban transmission is predominantly driven by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Locally acquired ZIKV infections in Australia have not been reported, however, endemic populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> constantly warrants rigorous disease surveillance and mosquito control strategies<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Indeed, since 2012, 68 cases of imported ZIKV infection have been reported in Australia up until August 2016 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-zika-notifications.htm). Concern also exists because recent evidence has implicated ZIKV infection in severe neurological disorders such as microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>Evolving from its origins in Africa, major East and West African and Asian ZIKV phylogenetic lineages have been defined. To date, all reported Pacific and American ZIKV isolates belong to the Asian lineage<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. ZIKV has been isolated from non-human primate serum, mosquitoes and a range of human samples, including serum, urine, semen, saliva and breastmilk, albeit with limited success. Most reported isolates have been derived following intracerebral suckling mouse brain (SMB) inoculations or infection of African green monkey Vero and Vero E6 or <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> C6/36 cell monolayers<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In this report, we describe the first Australian isolation of ZIKV from a clinical patient, a traveler from Tonga.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In February, 2016, a female patient in her 30&#x02019;s returned from Tonga to Brisbane, Australia with a fever and maculopapular rash (ProMED-Mail, <italic>Zika Virus</italic> (28), Archive Number: 20160524.4240474, http://beta.promedmail.org/post/4240474). An acute phase serum and a subsequent urine sample were collected 4 days apart. Both samples demonstrated ZIKV RNA by TaqMan reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> with cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) values of 29 (serum) and 34 (urine). The RT-PCR ZIKV positive serum sample was negative for serology using a pan-flavivirus IgM microsphere immunoassay and a pan-flavivirus IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. For virus isolation, each sample was inoculated separately onto C6/36 (ATCC, CRL-1660) and Vero (ATCC, CCL-81) cell monolayers and intracerebrally into 1-2 day old Swiss outbred suckling mice. Cells were incubated for 10 days at 28<sup>o</sup>C (C6/36) or 37<sup>o</sup>C (Vero) and cultures passaged 3 times. Cultures were monitored for virus growth using an immunofluorescence assay<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Mice remained asymptomatic and were euthanized to prepare SMB pools 11 days post-inoculation. SMB pools were screened for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR.</p><p>Viral RNA extraction, RT-PCR and sequencing of complete ZIKV envelope (E) genes were performed as previously described<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

Amplified DNA products from round 1 were diluted 1:100 and 5 &#x000b5;L added to round 2 mixes in a total of 50 &#x000b5;L. Alternatively, ZIKV (A) and ZIKV (B) RT-PCRs could be used as single round overlapping RT-PCRs when viral RNA levels were adequate. Amplification conditions used the following conditions: one cycle of 50<sup>o</sup>C for 15 min and 94<sup>o</sup>C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 94<sup>o</sup>C for 15 sec, 55<sup>o</sup>C for 30 sec and 68<sup>o</sup>C for 1 min followed by a final extension of 68<sup>o</sup>C for 5 min. Sequencing of the complete E gene was performed using the same amplification products and additional sequence primers: 1175 Rev primer 5&#x02019;- <sup>1175</sup>CCGATATTGATGCCTCATAG<sup>1156</sup>-3&#x02019;, 1908 Rev primer 5&#x02019;-<sup>1908</sup>GCTGCGGTACACAAGGAGTATG<sup>1887</sup>-3&#x02019;, 2059 For primer 5&#x02019;-<sup>2059</sup>TAACCCTGTAATCACTGAAA<sup>2078</sup>-3&#x02019; and 2379 Rev primer 5&#x02019;-<sup>2379</sup>ATGAGAATTTGTGAGAACCA<sup>2360</sup>.

</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first known isolation and characterization of ZIKV from a clinical patient from Tonga and the first of this virus in Australia. Although local ZIKV transmission has not yet been detected in Australia, endemic populations of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are present in northern Queensland, a popular tourist destination for overseas travelers, underscoring the potential risk of ZIKV introduction and transmission currently threatening this region. Recent vector competence experiments demonstrated that of 7 common Australian mosquito species tested, only<italic> Ae. aegypti</italic> could transmit ZIKV (Hall-Mendelin, S. <italic>et. al</italic>., 2016, Vector competence of Austalian mosquitoes for Zika virus, in press)<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, the distribution of this species is restricted to northern Queensland and it is primarily this region that is receptive to local transmission of ZIKV.</p><p>In this study, the success of SMB inoculation and failure to recover live virus directly from patient samples using conventional cell culture techniques highlights potential difficulties in ZIKV isolation. Previous intracerebral inoculations of mice with ZIKV have resulted in symptomatic disease 6-10 days post inoculation<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. In our study, mice remained asymptomatic for 11 days which could reflect a potentially low infectious viral dose in the serum. Interestingly, both the SMB and original serum had identical C<sub>t</sub> values of 29, however, only the SMB demonstrated sufficient infectious viral load to infect C6/36 cells and mosquitoes. Further studies are required to ascertain adaptive genetic and phenotypic characteristics of ZIKV in respective mammalian and arthropod hosts. Importantly, given that relatively few ZIKV isolates that have been recovered to date and the inherent constraints in importing ZIKV strains into many countries for diagnostic assay development and research, the successful isolation of TS17-2016 will be essential for continued investigations of ZIKV transmission and pathogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Correspondence</title><p>Alyssa Pyke: Alyssa.Pyke@health.qld.gov.au</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors have declared that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All relevant data has been disclosed within the manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the Logan Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland Medical Laboratory, Brisbane and Forensic and Scientific Services, Brisbane Public Health Virology staff who contributed to patient specimen collection, processing and diagnostic analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Dick GW, Kitchen SF, Haddow AJ.
