<p>To determine whether the bortezomib-induced changes in CHIKV protein levels extended to other proteasome inhibitors as well, we treated CHIKV-infected cells with a number of other proteasome inhibitors carrying different functional groups. Similar to bortezomib, treatment with MG132, MLN2238, lactacystin or ONX-0914 resulted in a reduction in band intensities of capsid (22% to 62% decrease) and nsP3 (9% to 29% decrease) at 6 hpi (
