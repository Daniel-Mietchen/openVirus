<p>Alphavirus infections are known to induce translational shut-off through a variety of mechanisms, including phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Even though phosphorylated eIF2α inhibits global protein synthesis, translation of alphavirus SG RNA remains unaffected [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In fact, in infected cells, SG RNA translation occurs more efficiently in the presence of eIF2α phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, during early alphavirus infection, eIF2α phosphorylation appears to be inhibited by nsP4, possibly to allow accumulation of CHIKV RNA transcripts for subsequent translation [
