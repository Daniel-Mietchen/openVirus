<p>Unlike the consistent and significant reductions observed for structural proteins, the levels of nsP2 and nsP3 fluctuated across different time-points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g005">Fig 5</xref>). There were minor increases in nsP3 levels at 12 hpi (35% increase). At all other time-points, nsP3 levels in bortezomib-treated samples were about 20% to 35% lower than vehicle-treated samples, except for 24 hpi, where it was 70% lower. An increase in nsP2 levels was also observed from 12 hpi (35% increase) to 20 hpi (47% increase). At all other time-points, levels of nsP2 was about 20% to 30% lower than in untreated cells. At 6 hpi, a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of nsP2 and nsP3 was observed upon treatment with increasing concentrations of bortezomib (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These fluctuations suggest that bortezomib may affect structural and ns proteins in different ways, and there may be multiple competing effects on ns proteins, leading to the observed results. Bortezomib may cause an increase in nsP2/nsP3 expression or reduction in degradation, which may be counteracted by the reduced spreading of CHIKV in the monolayer as a result of diminished virion production during each infection cycle.
