<p>Western blot analysis showed major elevations in nsP4 levels upon bortezomib treatment, especially at early time-points of 6 and 8 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The band intensities of nsP4 in bortezomib-treated samples were about 60% to 130% higher than vehicle controls from 4 hpi to 20 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The levels of nsP4 for bortezomib-treated samples were elevated at concentrations from 0.025 μM to 0.1 μM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g006">Fig 6</xref>), which are the same treatment concentrations that resulted in reduction of infectious CHIKV titers for CHIKV-122508 in HeLa cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). However, this increase in nsP4 levels was not dose-dependent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g006">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting that the elevated nsP4 levels may not be the main pathway contributing to the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib. The increase in nsP4 levels upon proteasome inhibition may suggest that the CHIKV nsP4 is degraded by the proteasome, similar to the nsP4 of SFV and SINV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, the CHIKV nsP4 also contains a conserved destabilizing N-terminal Tyr residue [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The CHIKV nsP4 protein showed the highest number of predicted ubiquitination sites (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008336.s002">S2 Table</xref>) with confidence levels of medium or high, further supporting the possibility that the CHIKV nsp4 is a substrate for the proteasome.
