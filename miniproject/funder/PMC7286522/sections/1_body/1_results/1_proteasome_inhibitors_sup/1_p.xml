<p>In order to explore the anti-CHIKV effects of proteasome inhibitors, we tested the inhibitory potential of bortezomib using CHIKV-infected BHK21 cells in both post-treatment and pre-treatment assays. For post-treatment assays, BHK21 cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 prior to treatment with bortezomib. This was performed to establish the effects of bortezomib on post-entry steps. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, treatment with 0.1 μM bortezomib onwards resulted in significant inhibition of CHIKV infectious titer. A maximal 98.5% (2.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> units) inhibition was obtained with 10 μM treatment of bortezomib. Cell viability remained above 70% across all concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), indicating minimal toxicity. In fact, treatment with 0.1 μM bortezomib produced 97% (1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> units) inhibition with no decrease in cell viability, suggesting that bortezomib-mediated reduction in viral titers were not due to cytotoxicity. A pre-treatment assay was also carried out, where BHK21 cells were treated with bortezomib for 2 hours, washed with PBS and then immediately infected with CHIKV. This was to determine whether bortezomib could affect the cells in a way that hindered CHIKV attachment or entry. The inhibitory trend was not observed upon pre-treatment with bortezomib (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Collectively, this data suggests that the anti-CHIKV effects of bortezomib are likely to occur at a post-entry stage in the replication cycle.
