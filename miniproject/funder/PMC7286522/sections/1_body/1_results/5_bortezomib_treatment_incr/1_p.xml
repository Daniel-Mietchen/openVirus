<p>Given the alterations to CHIKV ns protein levels, we also evaluated the effects of bortezomib on CHIKV RNA levels. Bortezomib treatment increased total CHIKV RNA levels from 12 hpi onwards (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This increasing trend was observed for both positive-sense and negative-sense CHIKV RNA at 12 hpi and 24 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g009">Fig 9B</xref>), suggesting that bortezomib induces similar effects on replication of both CHIKV strands. Nonetheless, with no negative effect on CHIKV RNA synthesis, it is clear that the major direct antiviral effect of bortezomib stems from its effect on suppressing structural protein levels, although the precise mechanisms leading to this effect would require more extensive study.
