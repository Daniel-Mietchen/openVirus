<p>As a preliminary step towards elucidating the mechanism of action of the bortezomib, time-of-addition and time-of-removal studies were performed in HeLa cells to identify the window in the CHIKV replication cycle where bortezomib exerts its effects. As displayed in the schematic diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, time-of-addition experiments were performed by adding bortezomib at different time-points post-infection, while time-of-removal experiments were conducted by adding bortezomib immediately after infection and removing it at different time-points post-infection.
