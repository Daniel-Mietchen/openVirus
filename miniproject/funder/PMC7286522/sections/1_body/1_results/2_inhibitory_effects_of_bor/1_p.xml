<p>In order to confirm that the inhibitory effects observed were not due to cell-line- or CHIKV strain-dependent effects, bortezomib was tested in two additional cell lines (HeLa and HSMM) and against two strains of CHIKV. In HeLa cells, bortezomib treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of titer for both CHIKV strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008336.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). A maximal inhibition of 1.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> units and 1.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml was observed with CHIKV-122508 and CHIKV-0708, respectively (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In agreement with results from BHK21 and HeLa cells, CHIKV replication in HSMM cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon bortezomib treatment (

 <sub>10</sub> units was observed in CHIKV-infected HSMM cells upon treatment with 50 Î¼M bortezomib. For investigation into the mechanism of antiviral action of bortezomib, downstream studies were conducted in HeLa cells infected with CHIKV-122508 at MOI 10 (SI = 20.6,

 <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml were obtained.
