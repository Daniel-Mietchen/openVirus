<p>During harvesting, cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with cell lysis solution at 4°C for 10 min, with rocking. The cell lysis solution used was M-PER (Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent, ThermoFisher Scientific) with added Halt Protease Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific) and EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were then scraped and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 x
