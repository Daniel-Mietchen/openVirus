<p>Samples were thawed on ice and quantitated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into each well. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in a semi-dry transfer protocol using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Blots were then blocked overnight and incubated with primary antibodies for 1h while rocking at room temperature. Dilution of anti-CHIKV nsP2 (1:50), anti-CHIKV nsP3 (1:100), anti-CHIKV E1 (1:200), anti-CHIKV capsid (1:300), anti-eIF2α (1:500), anti-phospho-eIF2α (S51) (1:500) and anti-β-actin (1:10,000) antibodies were performed in 5% BSA in TBST. Anti-CHIKV E2 (1:100) was diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST while anti-CHIKV nsP4 (1:1000) was diluted in 2% BSA in PBST. After primary antibody incubation, blots were washed 4 times with TBST or PBST (for nsP4 blots) for 5 min each before incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies (goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG), for 1h. After the incubation period, blots were washed 4 times and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific). Detection was carried out on a C-DiGit Blot Scanner (LI-COR) and band intensities were quantified on the accompanying LI-COR Image Studio programme.</p>
