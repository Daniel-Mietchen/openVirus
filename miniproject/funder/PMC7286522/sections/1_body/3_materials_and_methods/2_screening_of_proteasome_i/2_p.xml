<p>For bortezomib, a pre-treatment assay was also performed, where cells were treated with bortezomib prior to infection with CHIKV. BHK21 monolayers were incubated with various concentrations of bortezomib for 2h at 37°C before being washed twice with PBS. Treated cells were then infected with CHIKV-122508 at MOI 10 for 1.5h. Infected monolayers were washed twice with PBS before being incubated in RPMI-1640 with 2% FCS (without bortezomib) for 24h at 37°C. Plates were stored at -80°C prior to performing plaque assays for titration.</p>
