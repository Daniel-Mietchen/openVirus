<p>Proteasome inhibitors were screened in post-treatment assays. BHK21 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates (Corning) at a density of 12,500 cells per well and incubated overnight at 37째C. Cell monolayers were incubated with CHIKV-122508 at a MOI of 10 for 1.5h at 37째C. After this inoculum was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with proteasome inhibitors diluted to selected concentrations in RPMI-1640 medium with 2% FCS. After an incubation period of 24h at 37째C, the plates were frozen at -80째C prior to quantification of viral titer in cell culture supernatants via plaque assays. Plaque assays were performed using previously described methods [
