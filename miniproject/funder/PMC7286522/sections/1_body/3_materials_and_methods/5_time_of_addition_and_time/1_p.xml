<p>HeLa cells were plated at a density of 15,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, HeLa monolayers were infected with CHIKV-122508 at MOI 10 for 1.5h and washed twice with PBS. For time-of-addition experiments, 0.1 Î¼M bortezomib was added at different time-points after the 1.5h infection period. In time-of-removal experiments, bortezomib was added immediately after the 1.5h infection period and removed at different time-points. Plates from both time-of-addition and time-of-removal experiments were harvested at 48 hpi for titration via plaque assays.</p>
