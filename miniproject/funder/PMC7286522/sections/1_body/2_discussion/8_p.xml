<p>Another important consideration is that a number of proteasome inhibitors also inhibit other cellular proteases. For instance, bortezomib exhibits off-target activity against some intracellular proteases, including cathepsins A and G, although the IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% inhibitory concentration) for non-proteasomal targets is about 10-fold to 100-fold higher than that required for the inhibition of the proteasome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Results from western blot studies showed that proteasome inhibitors apart from bortezomib caused similar changes to CHIKV proteins, suggesting a common antiviral mechanism across proteasome inhibitors with different functional groups. While it is likely that the antiviral effects of the inhibitors used in this study stem from their action on the proteasome rather than non-proteasomal targets, downstream studies confirming this would be essential.
