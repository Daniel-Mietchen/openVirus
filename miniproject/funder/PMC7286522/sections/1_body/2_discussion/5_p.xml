<p>While bortezomib caused some increase in ns protein levels, structural protein levels were consistently and significantly decreased at all time-points. This may suggest that bortezomib may affect SG RNA translation differently from G RNA translation. Indeed, translation of G and SG RNA of alphaviruses are known to have different requirements [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. For instance, the G RNA of SINV requires eukaryotic initiation factors and is believed to be translated in a similar manner as host mRNA, while SINV SG RNA translation proceeds in a non-canonical manner, without the requirement of initiation factors like eIF2 and eIF4, despite bearing a cap structure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These differences in translation requirements for G and SG RNA may explain the different effects of bortezomib on CHIKV ns and structural proteins. A similar phenomenon has been reported for pateamine A, an antiviral compound which was found to block translation of SINV genomic RNA, but not SG RNA [
