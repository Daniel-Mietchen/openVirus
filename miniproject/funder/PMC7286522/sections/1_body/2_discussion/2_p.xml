<p>In previous studies, the antiviral effects of bortezomib has been attributed to a number of different mechanisms. In cells infected with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), bortezomib reduced the ability of the non-structural S-segment protein (NSs) to form nuclear filaments and decreased its interaction with several host factors by affecting their ubiquitination status. Expression of IFN-Î² was also increased, suggesting that host antiviral pathways may have further contributed to the inhibition of viral replication [

As for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a phlebovirus related to RVFV, bortezomib treatment reversed the degradation of RIG-I induced by the viral non-structural protein (NS), thereby removing virus-mediated suppression of host innate immunity [
