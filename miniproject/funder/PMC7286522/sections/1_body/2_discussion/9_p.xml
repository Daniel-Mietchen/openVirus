<p>Given the pleiotropic effects of proteasome inhibitors on host cells, the dissection of antiviral mechanisms requires extensive investigation to determine which pathways are major contributors to their inhibitory effects. Whether the antiviral effects of bortezomib are a result of inhibition of translation of SG RNA, modification of levels of essential host factors, modulation of antiviral pathways, changes to the ratio of ns to structural proteins, or even effects on non-proteasomal targets, it is clear that further evaluation into the potential for these compounds to be used as CHIKV antivirals is warranted.</p>
