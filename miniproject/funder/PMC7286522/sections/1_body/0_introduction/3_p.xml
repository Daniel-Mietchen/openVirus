<p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for degradation of cellular proteins that are damaged, misfolded, or require downregulation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Proteins targeted for proteasomal degradation are usually covalently tagged with at least four lysine-48 (K48)-linked ubiquitin subunits [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the replication of several positive-sense RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The ubiquitin-proteasome system has been found to control intracellular levels of certain viral proteins during replication, including viral proteases, structural proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For instance, the proteasomal degradation of viral proteases has been well documented for picornaviruses, including encephalomyocarditis virus and hepatitis A virus, [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Given the role of the viral protease in triggering apoptosis, researchers speculate that the UPS may be utilized by picornaviruses to maintain sufficiently low levels of the viral protease during early replication to prevent premature apoptosis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Early studies on SINV and SFV suggested that nsP4, which functions as the RdRp, is degraded by the proteasome due to the presence of a highly conserved destabilizing tyrosine residue at the N-terminus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a study with SINV mutants, Shirako and colleagues (1998) found that only nsP4 proteins with N-terminal Tyr, His, Phe or Trp have wild-type activity for RNA replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors suggested that the metabolic instability of nsP4 is not necessary for its function. Instead, they suggested that SINV nsP4 requires an aromatic amino acid or histidine at its N-terminus, and its metabolic instability is simply a consequence of this requirement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Proteasomal inhibition has been found to reduce titers of several alphaviruses, including SFV, Mayaro virus and Una virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For studies on CHIKV, proteomic analyses have revealed differential regulation of several proteasome subunits upon infection, although results differed between studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. For instance, upon CHIKV infection, PSMA6 (proteasome subunit alpha type-6) was reported to be downregulated in one study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and upregulated in another [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008336.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin resulted in a reduction of viral titers in CHIKV-infected GripTite 293 MSR cells [
