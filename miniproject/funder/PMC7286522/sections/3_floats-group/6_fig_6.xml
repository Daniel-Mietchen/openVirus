  <title>Dose-dependent studies of CHIKV protein levels upon bortezomib treatment at 6 hpi.</title>
  <p>HeLa cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with either 0.1 μM bortezomib or vehicle control. Protein samples were harvested at 6 hpi and probed for CHIKV proteins. (A) Western blot images are representative of three independent experiments. Actin was added as a loading control. E2 and capsid were probed on the same blot and share the same actin bands. 0.01B: 0.01 μM bortezomib, 0.025B: 0.025 μM bortezomib, 0.05B: 0.05 μM bortezomib, 0.075B: 0.075 μM bortezomib, 0.1B: 0.1 μM bortezomib. (B) Band intensities of bortezomib-treated samples relative to vehicle control are presented in the bar graph. Band intensities were calculated after normalisation with actin for each sample. Error bars represent standard error of means from three independent experiments. *
