  <title>Inhibitory effects of bortezomib on different CHIKV strains and cell lines.</title>
  <p>(A) HeLa cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 or CHIKV-0708 and post-treated with bortezomib for 24h. CHIKV titers are presented in the bar graphs corresponding to the primary axis. Cell viability is presented by the line graph corresponding to the secondary axis. Error bars for CHIKV-122508 represent standard errors of means from five independent experiments done in triplicates. Error bars for CHIKV-0708 represent standard errors of means from two independent experiments done in triplicates. (B) HSMM cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and post-treated with bortezomib for 24h. CHIKV titers are presented in the bar graphs corresponding to the primary axis. Cell viability is presented by the line graph corresponding to the secondary axis. Error bars represent standard errors of means from at least three technical replicates. Statistical significance of treated samples compared to vehicle control was analysed using one-way ANOVA test and Dunnettâ€™s post-test.</p>
