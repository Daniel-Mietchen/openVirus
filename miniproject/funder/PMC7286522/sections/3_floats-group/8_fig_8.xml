  <title>Changes in total and phospho-eIF2α levels upon bortezomib treatment.</title>
  <p>(A) HeLa cells were infected with CHIKV-122508 and treated with either 0.1 μM bortezomib or vehicle control. Protein samples were harvested at different time-points post-infection and probed for phospho-eIF2α and total eIF2α. Western blot images are representative of two independent experiments. Actin was added as a loading control. M: Mock, Veh: Vehicle control, 0.1B: 0.1 μM bortezomib, hpi: hours post-infection (refers to time-points when samples were harvested), +: indicates treatment with either Veh or 0.1B. (B) Band intensities of bortezomib-treated samples relative to vehicle controls for each time-point are shown in the bar graph. Band intensities were calculated after normalisation with actin for each sample. Error bars represent standard error of means from two independent experiments. *
