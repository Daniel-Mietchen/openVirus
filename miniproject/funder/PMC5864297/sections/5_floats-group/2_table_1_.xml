  <title>Social connectivity: The US Southern region appears to have an unusually high level of social connectivity.</title>
  <p>(In GSS survey results, the number of close friends, close friends who are neighbors, and number of friends who all or mostly know each other is higher in the South, especially in the East/South/Central census region, than in the country at large.)</p>
