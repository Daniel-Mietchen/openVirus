  <title>Comparing influence of short- and long-distance travel on infection propagation Plate A shows land connectivity visualized as a graph with edges between neighboring counties.</title>
  <p>Plate B shows air connectivity as links between airports, with edge thickness proportional to traffic volume. Plate C shows the delay in weeks for the propagation of Granger-causal influence between counties in which major airports are located, and Plate E shows the distribution of the inferred causality coefficient between those same counties. Plates D and F show the delay and the causality coefficient distribution respectively, which we computed by considering spatially neighboring counties. The results show that local connectivity is more important. We reached a similar conclusion using mixed-effect Poisson regression, as shown in Plate G: The inferred coefficients for land connectivity are significantly larger than those for air connectivity, tweet-based connectivity, or exponential diffusion from the top

    <title>Our analysis of the Twitter movement matrix indicates that people most frequently travel between neighboring counties, preferentially towards higher-population-density areas, which shows that the maximum-probability movement patterns follow the local gradient of increasing population density.</title>
