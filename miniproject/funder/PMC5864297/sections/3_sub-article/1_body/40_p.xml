<p>a) The authors offer a comparison with HIV patterns – but is that appropriate as HIV is a chronic disease – how exactly was this done? Did authors extract only ICD codes for new onset HIV or using longitudinal patient-level data (nothing in the Materials and methods section about this)? A better comparison would perhaps be something else epidemic but with another mode of transmission such as rotavirus or norovirus diarrhea epidemics?</p>
