<p>6) While the methods and results are clearly described, the organization of the paper can be improved to facilitate easier reading. We found ourselves flipping back and forth a lot between the text because details that appeared to be missing earlier on would then appear later in different parts of the text. Figures were also cited out of order across the methods descriptions, and in some cases we don't believe all of the figures were discussed. As a few examples, the methods used to generate 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3I-3K</xref> were not discussed until the Results (subsection “Approach 1: Non-parametric Granger analysis”, fourth and fifth paragraphs) but 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> results are first discussed in the Materials and methods (subsection “Analysis of quantized clinical data (Approach 1)”, first paragraph).
