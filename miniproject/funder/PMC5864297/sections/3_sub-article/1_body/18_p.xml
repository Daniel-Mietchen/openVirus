<p>The presentation of the paper is rather confusing. There is hardly any introductory material; the first section is essential a summary of methods and results. This is followed by a more detailed description of the methods and finally a discussion. While 
 <italic>eLife</italic> does not have strict rules about manuscript formatting, the paper should at least follow the general conventions of medical/life sciences journals i.e. the Introduction, Materials and methods, Results, Discussion division which will make finding information easier for most readers. A fuller Introduction section setting the background is also needed e.g. why this is an important problem from a clinical/public health point of view, what other attempts have been made to address it and what their findings and shortcomings have been?
