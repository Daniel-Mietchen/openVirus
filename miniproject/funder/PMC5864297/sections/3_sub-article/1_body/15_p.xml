<p>3) All three approaches used are essentially data mining exercises, followed by post-hoc generation of hypotheses to explain the associations found. This does not mean they are invalid â€“ plenty of science works in this way, and some care has been taken to avoid type I errors. Nevertheless, the possibility of bias, confounding, alternative explanations and simply random error should not be discounted. This is particularly the case because there is strong geographic clustering of many of the variables identified as key drivers (e.g. densely populated areas, coastal areas, places with airports, places at the geographical and climactic extremes of the USA tend to be the same places). Hence the language used should be substantially tempered to be more tentative. While the authors have used 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and HIV spread as controls to ensure that these display different patterns of spatial spread, the problem is that the seasonality of these pathogens is completely different or (in the case of HIV) largely absent. Looking at a non-respiratory but still highly seasonal pathogen e.g. norovirus might be interesting.
