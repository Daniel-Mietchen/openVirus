<p>I'm usually not a stickler for presentation of papers in the classic Introduction/Materials and methods/Results/Discussion format â€“ but given that the authors are presenting several novel methods here, I think the manuscript would really benefit from being more classic. At present, some aspects of the methods are described in the "Approach #" sections, but others are presented in the "Materials and methods". I think it would be much clearer to group all the methods together so that the results could themselves be presented in a more concise format that would highlight the key insights.</p>
