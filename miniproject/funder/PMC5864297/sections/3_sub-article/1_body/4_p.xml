<p>Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we have decided to reject the paper as we think that substantial time and work will be needed to address all the concerns. However, if you would like to substantially revise the paper in a way that takes into account the concerns, we would be interested to consider a revised version of the manuscript as a new submission. Please note that we cannot guarantee review of the revised version until we have seen it.</p>
