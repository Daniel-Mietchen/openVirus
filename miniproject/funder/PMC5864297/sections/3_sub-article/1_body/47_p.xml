<p>Overall, I would like to see a more concise statement of the major innovation from this approach and this analysis. At present, this is a list of variables that were identified as significant (albeit using some really interesting methods and excellent data), many of which have already been identified as predictive of flu in the past. What would be really interesting, if possible, would be to illustrate whether this method was in some way more predictive of flu dynamics than conventional methods. For example, could these analyses be carried out on the first 8 years of ILI data and the resulting model used to predict the 9th; if so, does the addition of Approach 1/3 do better than the standard Poisson regression?</p>
