<p>For more concrete advice, we would remove references to results-related figures from the Materials and methods section so that readers examine the figures only after all of the terms and analyses have been explained, and, having a cleaner separation between Materials and methods and Results will improve readability. There were many times where the authors alluded to some small part of the results in the Materials and methods before the description of the analysis had been completed. Conversely, the Results section had relatively detailed methods descriptions, which seemed redundant since the Results followed the Materials and methods. The authors may also consider a greater overhaul of the manuscript structure that groups the primary results in the text and figures (as opposed to organizing the manuscript by methodological approach) and moves many of the supporting or diagnostic figures to the supplement.</p>
