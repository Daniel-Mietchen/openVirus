<p>3) I am concerned about the robustness of the analysis due to possible low counts of ILI as the authors defined it narrowly as ICD codes 487-488 â€“ which could mean much noise in ILI time series at the local level. The authors may benefit from a very similar study of influenza dissemination in the 2009 pandemic in the US, which was based on IMS CMS1500 claims data (Gog et al., 2014); the underlying paper preparing the medical claims data and validating against CDC influenza data (Viboud et al., Plos One 2013). Viboud et al., established that adding 079.9 (ICD9) to the case definition dramatically (by 90%) increased the sensitivity of the case definition, without much cost on the specificity.</p>
