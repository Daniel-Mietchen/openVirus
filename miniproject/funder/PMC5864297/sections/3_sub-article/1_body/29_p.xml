<p>It is my impression that the paper needs substantial revision in order to be ready for publication. For example, data sources and approaches must be far better described and more sensitivity analyses done. The lack of consideration of genetic drift variants and school schedule patterns, along with the likely consequences of regional differences in Truwen data coverage and ICD coding, if any, should be argued.</p>
