<p>3) The incorporation of antigenic drift, vaccine coverage and school data are important and innovative additions to the paper. However, one missing factor is host immunity not due to vaccination i.e. if there is a strong influenza season in one year with no substantial antigenic drift after that then the population immune to influenza is likely to be greater the following year. Ideally, this could be captured mechanistically by incorporating SIR-type epidemiological models, or by more statistical approaches, ideally informed by measures of prior immunity such as serology. At the very least, the implications of this factor need to be adequately discussed.</p>
