<p>5) Validity of Twitter data to describe mobility? The authors conclude that short-distance land travel is an important determinant of the spread of influenza, using Twitter data to determine mobility. But is this defensible, as only older kids and adults have Twitter accounts â€“ yet we know that children are important drivers of influenza (see fx Gog et al., two major factors determining spread of influenza was school schedules and short distance traveling). Please comment on this possibility that the Twitter data are not determinants of children's movements.</p>
