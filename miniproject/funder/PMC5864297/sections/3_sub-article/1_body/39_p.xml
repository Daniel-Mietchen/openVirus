<p>4) The Truwen data source and extraction of the ILI and other time series should be described in much more detail. Is it CMS
 <sup>-1</sup>500 data? Were influenza codes sought among all codes listed or only the first-listed? Etc. Also, it would be helpful to show graphically the time series data, to allow the reader to evaluate data stability and volume – over time and between locales. Or else, add some summary table that summarizes such observational findings. The Truwen claims database is likely a convenience sample, so it is likely that the coverage increases dramatically over time since 2003, and also that there are substantial differences in coverage by US geographical areas depending on Truwen levels of foot holds. Did the authors see such intrinsic variability in the data (for example, consider another code in summer months? How would such variability in coverage influence the analyses presented here – or is it somehow taken into account?
