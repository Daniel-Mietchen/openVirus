<p>1) One obvious driver of seasonal influenza timing is not mentioned in this paper: the degree of genetic drift of the influenza virus relative to those that circulated in earlier years. That influenza occurs early in big "drift" years is evident from the unusually early onset of the 2003 Fujian H3N2 epidemic, and also of most pandemics in history including the 2009 pandemic. This is not discussed and that is a caveat that should be discussed. If such data are too much trouble, then at the very least consideration of which influenza subtype is dominant in each season would be useful; for example influenza B tends to be epidemic later than influenza A.</p>
