<p>“Accounting for non-vaccination host immunity: Resistance to influenza infection in human hosts arises via two related mechanisms: immunological memory from a previous infection by an identical or sufficiently similar strain, or vaccination against the current strain (or a sufficiently similar strain). […] Likewise, if the absolute deviation from years previous starts decreasing, we would also register a decrease in susceptibility. Incorporating these factors in the diverse set of models that we investigate guarantees that we are indeed considering host susceptibility contributions from a wide range of possible mechanisms.</p>
