 <p>While the authors have used E. coli and HIV spread as controls to ensure that these display different patterns of spatial spread, the problem is that the seasonality of these pathogens is completely different or (in the case of HIV) largely absent. Looking at a non-respiratory but still highly seasonal pathogen e.g. norovirus might be interesting.</p>
 <p>4) One shortcoming of the data analysis is that although a large number of variables related to environmental and demographic factors are considered, there is little consideration of viral and host characteristics which are key to driving influenza spread. For instance, over the nine years the model is run, the United States has experienced waves of different influenza types, a pandemic (which led to a shift in the influenza A/H1 subtype), different levels of vaccine coverage with varying levels of match to the prevailing strains, as well as changes in immune profiles of individuals over the population. There is no attempt to understand these drivers and capture their spatiotemporal heterogeneity even though there are datasets (e.g. vaccine coverage, serology, virological testing) that could be used to inform this.</p>
