<p>The fixed-effect regression coefficients plotted in Plate A are shown on logarithmic scale, meaning that the absolute magnitude of predictor-specific effect is obtained by exponentiating the parameter value. A negative coefficient for a predictor variable suggests that influenza rate falls as this factor increases, while a positive coefficient predicts growing rate of infection as the parameter value grows. The integrated influence of individual predictors, under this model, is additive with respect to the county-specific rate of infection.</p>
