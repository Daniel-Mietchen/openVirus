<p>While we are not disputing Viboud et al.'s conclusions in the paper cited by the reviewer, given the large volume of specific data in our sample (4,009,982 unique people with ILIs), we do not see a compelling reason to add cases with non-specific codes. We directly evaluated “our” stricter-defined ILIs against the CDC data (temporal prevalence of influenza) and observed a very good correspondence (that deteriorates with addition of non-specific viral infection codes).</p>
