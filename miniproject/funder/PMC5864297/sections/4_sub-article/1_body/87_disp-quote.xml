 <p>a) Yet in the "Flammable media" (Discussion section) the authors discuss how 20% of Southeners have ILI each season. This seems way too high, as most people do not seek care for ILI and 20% (and what would the rate have been if the ILI definition was not so narrow?) is already higher than population-based sero-epidemiological assessments of attack rates and it is well known that most of people with ILI do not seek medical care and that at least half of infections are asymptomatic. So 20% ILI population prevalence in Truwen data is unbelievable.</p>
