<p>In the revised manuscript, we provide a whole new section dedicated to this issue. We provide definitions of ICD-9-CM codes, and argue that the narrow definition we chose is most appropriate for our purposes. We argue this while directly accepting that, similar to what is outlined in Viboud et al.â€™s PLOS ONE article, we have no perfect gold standard to evaluate the quality of this choice; precision appears to be more important for our analysis than sensitivity.</p>
