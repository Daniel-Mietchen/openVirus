<p>For example, a coefficient of -0.6for parameter AVG_PRESS_mean tells us that the average atmospheric pressure has a negative association with the influenza rate. As the mean atmospheric pressure for the county grows, the probability that the county would participate in an infection initiation wave falls. As exp(-0.6)=0.54, the rate of infection 
 <italic>drops</italic> by 46 percent when atmospheric pressure 
 <italic>increases</italic> by one unit of zero-centered and standard-deviation-normalized atmospheric pressure. Similarly, an increase in the share of a white Hispanic population predicts an increase in influenza rate: A coefficient of 1.3 translates into a exp(1.3) ⋅ 100% – 100% = 267% rate increase, possibly, because of the higher social network connectivity associated with this segment of population.
