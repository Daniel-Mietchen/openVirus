<p>We added and removed random effects to the model structure, taking out and adding fixed effects, running the regression, and plotting the DIC. Model complexity was simply proxied by the descriptional complexity in terms of how large the model was (the number of factors in the regression equation). We stopped when the drop in DIC stabilized.</p>
