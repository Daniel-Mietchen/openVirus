<p>Our estimates of influenza infection rate are unavoidably inflated. This is because what we are measuring is the week- and county-specific prevalence of influenza-like illnesses 
 <italic>among insured patients who contacted their physician for any reason during the week in question</italic>. In other words, the denominator that we use for computing prevalence is almost certain to be much smaller than the overall population of the corresponding county.
