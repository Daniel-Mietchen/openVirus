<p>There is no mistake; the resulting patterns are what they turn out to be. The intuitive explanation of perceived discrepancy is that the matching method agrees with other analysis types predominantly, but not in all cases. Each analysis has limitations. In the case of the matching analysis, we have less statistical power than in, for example, Poisson regression; matching by numerous parameters reduces the initial set of thousands of counties to a handful of matching “treated” counties (which meet a particular combination of weather and sociodemographic conditions) and “untreated” counties (very similar to “treated” ones in all respects but treatment). The difficult-to-match, “weeded out” counties may happen to be in the coastal areas indicated as the most likely places of influenza wave origin by other analyses.</p>
