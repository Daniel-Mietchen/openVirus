 <p>For more concrete advice, we would remove references to results-related figures from the Materials and methods section so that readers examine the figures only after all of the terms and analyses have been explained, and, having a cleaner separation between Materials and methods and Results will improve readability. There were many times where the authors alluded to some small part of the results in the Materials and methods before the description of the analysis had been completed.</p>
