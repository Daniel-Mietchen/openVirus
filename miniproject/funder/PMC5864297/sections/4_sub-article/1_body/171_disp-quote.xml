 <p>ix) Please provide some explanation of how you developed the 126 models examined in Approach 2. Based on the models listed in 
  <xref rid="table5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and in the supplement, it seems that there is substantial variation in the number of predictors included in the model and all of the models appear to include multiple autoregressive terms for the same environmental and travel predictors. What is the motivation for this approach?
