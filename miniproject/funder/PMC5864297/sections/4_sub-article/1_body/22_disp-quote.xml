 <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
 <p>This is an interesting Big Data study that aims to uncover the causal factors driving the onset of epidemic influenza at the county level in the United States. Authors rely on multiple datasets including medical claim records, demographic characteristics, human movement inferred from Twitter data, and climate data. Authors employed three different methodological approaches and found a complex relationship with influenza epidemic onset. Although the study is of significant interest, I do have several concerns indicated below.</p>
 <p>1) The definition of epidemic onset is loosely defined and is unclear whether the same definition was employed across approaches. They discuss a "trigger period" of several weeks to exponential expansion. Is exponential expansion a necessary condition? This is the response variable in their study and little is discussed about its variation across counties and studied seasons.</p>
