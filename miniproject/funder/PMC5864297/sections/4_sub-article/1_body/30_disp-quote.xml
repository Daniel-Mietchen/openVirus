 <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
 <p>This is a methodologically sophisticated paper which cleverly uses medical claims and other large datasets, and three different computational approaches, to explore whether three factors (weather, X and Y) might explain the timing of seasonal influenza in the US. They find that influenza epidemics tend to start in Southern states.</p>
 <p>My impression is that the paper is highly sophisticated in terms of analytics, but that the data sources that are used to describe influenza and the possible drivers (such as weather, mobility) are not always well developed and ill described (Truwen) or even possibly inadequate (Twitter). The findings of short-distance traveling being important driver corroborates findings by Gog et al., another pioneer study using medical claims data to study influenza dissemination, which is nice.</p>
 <p>Trusting other reviewers will take on an evaluation of the analytic approaches, I will focus instead on the validity of the data (outcomes, explanatory) side of the matter.</p>
 <p>It is my impression that the paper needs substantial revision in order to be ready for publication. For example, data sources and approaches must be far better described and more sensitivity analyses done. The lack of consideration of genetic drift variants and school schedule patterns, along with the likely consequences of regional differences in Truwen data coverage and ICD coding, if any, should be argued.</p>
 <p>On the topic of drivers not considered:</p>
 <p>1) One obvious driver of seasonal influenza timing is not mentioned in this paper: the degree of genetic drift of the influenza virus relative to those that circulated in earlier years. That influenza occurs early in big "drift" years is evident from the unusually early onset of the 2003 Fujian H3N2 epidemic, and also of most pandemics in history including the 2009 pandemic. This is not discussed and that is a caveat that should be discussed. If such data are too much trouble, then at the very least consideration of which influenza subtype is dominant in each season would be useful; for example influenza B tends to be epidemic later than influenza A.</p>
 <p>a) Could authors do a sensitivity sub-analysis of seasons of major drift variants (2003 Fujian and 2009 pandemic flu) to see if their identified drivers also are found for those?</p>
