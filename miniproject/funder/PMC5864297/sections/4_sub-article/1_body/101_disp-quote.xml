 <p>Reviewer #4:</p>
 <p>This manuscript presents an analysis of a large dataset of ILI from insurance records to identify spatial patterns in influenza outbreak initiation and spread. The authors present 3 classes of analysis to identify variables correlated with outbreak initiation. Overall, I found this work very interesting but in dire need of restructuring to clarify the main questions and methods. At present, this reads as an explanation of several very innovative approaches to mining these large datasets for patterns, but doesn't lay out a clear goal or hypothesis. Similarly, the Discussion lists an array of patterns that were discovered, but fails to identify a single (or even just a few) key insight that was gained through this approach.</p>
