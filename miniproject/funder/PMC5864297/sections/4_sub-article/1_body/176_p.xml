<p>No, we did not use an explicit spatial smoothing. The county-level random effects were used to account for possible heterogeneity in disease reporting across counties. However, we used as predictors average values of infection rates of immediate neighbors for the county (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks in the past), this prediction structure afforded an implicit spatial smoothing, dampening spurious fluctuations in infection rates.</p>
