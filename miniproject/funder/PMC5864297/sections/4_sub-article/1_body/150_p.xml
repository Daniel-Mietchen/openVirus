 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>â€™s Plate B shows the distribution of the treatment counties and matched-non-treatment counties. Note that here, we are not directly predicting initiation, so while the patterns in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> should indeed have some similarity, they are not required to match up perfectly. The most similar treated counties do indeed show up in the southern shores.
