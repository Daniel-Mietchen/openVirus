<p>In this study, rather than following the SIR-style modeling tradition, we used statistical epidemiology- and econometric-like approaches, in addition to a causality-network method presented here for the first time. There are some prior studies that are close to ours in spirit (but not in details). For example, (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Barreca and Shimshack, 2012</xref>) used historical US influenza mortality data (1973–2002) in conjunction with collinear humidity and temperature records to establish county-level statistical associations between variables in the datasets. They concluded that absolute humidity was ‘an especially critical determinant of observed human influenza mortality, even after controlling for temperature.’ Another study, focusing on historical influenza records in the Netherlands, (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">te Beest et al., 2013</xref>) used the number of weekly influenza-like patient visits (transformed into an estimated rate of infection) as a response variable in a regression analysis of climate data. They concluded that the bulk of explained variation (57%) was attributed to the depletion of susceptible hosts during the disease season and non-weather-related ‘between-season effects,’ with only 3% explained by absolute humidity, represented as a continuous predictor variable. Additionally, this study observed that school holidays did not have a statistically significant effect on influenza transmission.
