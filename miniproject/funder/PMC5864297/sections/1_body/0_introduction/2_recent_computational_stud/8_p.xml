<p>Our study became possible through access to several, very large longitudinal datasets: (1) a nine-year collection of insurance records capturing the dynamics of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in the United States (Truven MarketScan database, see Materials and methods); (2) temporally collinear, high-resolution weather measurements over every US county; (3) detailed air travel (

 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">The United States Census, 2016</xref>) showing connectivity between US counties; (4) billions of geo-located Twitter messages reflecting long- and short-distance human movement patterns, and; (5) US census data accounting for US county and county-equivalent population distribution, demographic, and socioeconomic properties (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Curiously, the relationship between the two sources of ILI observations is not linear: We attribute this to the lower resolution of the CDC data. These three types of analysis produce congruent–albeit not identical–results.
