<p>As all causality detection methods come with dissimilar limitations and are imperfect in unique ways, we designed our study intentionally to attack the same target problem using three different statistical approaches: Approach 1: A non-parametric Granger analysis (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Granger, 1980</xref>) focusing on infection flowsâ€™ directionalities across the US and whether influenza propagates via long- vs. short-distance travel (we run analysis across all pairs of air- and land-travel county neighbors, respectively). Approach 2: A mixed-effect Poisson regression (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Hedeker and Gibbons, 2006</xref>) explicitly accounting for the auto-correlation of infection waves in time and space, along with the full set of socioeconomic, climate, and geographic predictors. Approach 3: A county-matching, non-parametric analysis to identify the minimum predictive set of factors that distinguish those counties associated with the onset of the influenza season (
