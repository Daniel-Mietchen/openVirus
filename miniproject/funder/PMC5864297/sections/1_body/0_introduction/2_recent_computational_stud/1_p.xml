<p>Computational study of the dynamics and factors influencing infectious disease spread began with compartmental models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) model, which traces its origins to the beginning of the last century (

For instance, one approach, termed ‘gravity wave’ modeling, used geographic, short- and long-range, work-related human movement and demographic data to formulate gravity potentials between US counties in order to infer the dynamics of infection spread (
