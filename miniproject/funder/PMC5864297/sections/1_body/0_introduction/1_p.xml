<p>Seasonal influenza is a serious threat to public health, claiming tens of thousands of lives every year. A large number of past studies have focused on identifying the likely factors responsible for initiating each seasonal disease wave. Typically, each such study focused on one or a few hypothetical factors. Our study aimed at an integrative, joint analysis of numerous suggested disease triggers, comparing their relative importance and possible cooperation in triggering pan-US waves of seasonal influenza infection. The goal of this study was to identify the most informative combinations of statistical predictors associated with the initiation of pan-US influenza infection waves.</p>
