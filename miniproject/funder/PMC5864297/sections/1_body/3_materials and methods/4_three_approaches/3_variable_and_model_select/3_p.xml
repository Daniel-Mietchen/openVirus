 <xref rid="table5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the last model), includes a term d_max_HUS_min_3 * d_t_avg_min_3 that denotes an interaction between the weekly change in the maximum specific humidity and the weekly change in the average temperature, both of which are weather parameter changes recorded three weeks before the current week. Because it does not split datasets, Approach two is more powerful at detecting interactions between explanatory variables and rather complicated models. However, this approach is more susceptible to bias (picking non-causal correlations that are inherent in the raw data), if the data are unbalanced, unlike with Approach 3.
