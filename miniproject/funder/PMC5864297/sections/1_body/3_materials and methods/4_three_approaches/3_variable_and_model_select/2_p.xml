<p>Approach 2 (mixed-effect regression analysis) can use a whole dataset for model selection, that can span individual predictors, their combinations, and even interactions between factors (see

Model selection allows us to choose a model with the right balance of complexity and explanatory power, thus enabling this analysis to detect collinear explanatory variables and drop the weaker predictors that increase model complexity but do not add explanatory power.
