<p>We designed Approach three specifically to balance biased observational data. While Approach three does not allow for explicit model selection, it is good at detecting simpler combinations of predictors putatively ‘causally’ affecting the outcome variable. However, because this approach involves splitting data into smaller and smaller subsets, as the complexity of predictor function (‘treatment’) grows, it quickly runs out of statistical power.</p>
