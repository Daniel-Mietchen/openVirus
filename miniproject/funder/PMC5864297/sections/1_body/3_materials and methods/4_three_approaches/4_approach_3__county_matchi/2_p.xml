<p>These two approaches’ properties explain the perceived misalignment of results from the two streams of analysis. For an intuitive understanding of matching approaches, consider specific humidity’s effect on influenza prevalence. The county-matching method’s goal is to deduce associations putatively interpreted as causality relations. For example, consider testing the question of whether counties with higher-than-average mean maximum specific humidity do, indeed, have higher influenza prevalence, in a statistically significant sense, when compared to counties that do not, provided all other factors are held constant.</p>
