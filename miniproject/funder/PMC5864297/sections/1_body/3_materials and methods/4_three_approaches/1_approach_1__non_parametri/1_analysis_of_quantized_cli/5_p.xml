<p>Additionally, whenever we computed the causality coefficient, it was always associated with a time delay: We calculated the coefficient for predicting the target stream some specified number of steps in the future, and the computed coefficient was thus parameterized by this delay. In our analysis, we computed coefficients up to a maximum delay of

  <math id="inf160">

  </math>
 </inline-formula> weeks, and, for each pair of counties, selected the optimum delay which gave rise to the largest coefficient. For more details on the algorithm, see the Supplement.
