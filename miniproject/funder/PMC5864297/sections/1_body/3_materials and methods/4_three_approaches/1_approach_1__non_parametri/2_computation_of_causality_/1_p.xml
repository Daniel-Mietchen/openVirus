<p>To analyze the propagation dynamics of disease, we defined the notion of a Granger 
 <italic>causal flow</italic> between two counties. Treating county-specific changes in disease prevalence as a time-stamped data stream, we quantified the directional strength of the causal flow between two counties as the degree of predictability of one stream’s future, given the history of the other (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Our new algorithm was able to compute a 
 <italic>coefficient of causality</italic>: an information-theoretic measure of the information in bits that one stream communicates about another in a direction-specific manner. A strong coefficient of this type suggests that either the disease itself, or an underlying cause, may be propagating from the former county to the latter.
