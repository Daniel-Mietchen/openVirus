<p>To explore the country-wide propagation dynamics, we stitched together the properly-aligned, adjacent between-county causal flow vectors across the whole US map into 
 <italic>causality streamlines</italic>, representing the average of multiple spatial infection propagation waves over time. To compute causality streamlines, we needed a precise notion of county neighbors. We considered two counties to be neighbors if either they shared a common border, or if one county was reachable within a line-of-sight distance of 50 miles from any point within another. The latter condition removed ambiguities as to whether counties touching at a point should be still considered as neighbors. The exact distance value (50 miles) does not significantly change our results, as long as it does not vary significantly. With the definition of the neighborhood map in place, we proceeded to compute the direction-specific coefficients of causality between neighboring counties. It follows that we would obtain a set of coefficients for each county and one for each of its neighbors, capturing the degree of causal influence from a given particular county to its respective neighbors. Our algorithm also computed the probability of each coefficient arising by chance alone, and we ignored coefficients that have more than a

 </inline-formula> probability that two independent processes lacking any causal connection gave rise to the particular computed value of the coefficient. Once the coefficients had been calculated for each neighbor, we computed the resultant direction of causal influence outflow from that particular county. This was carried out by visualizing the causality coefficients as weights on the length of the vectors, from the centroid of the considered county to the centroids of its neighbors. We then calculated the resultant vector (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Viewed systematically across the continental US, these local vectors formed a discernible pattern; we observed the emergence of a non-random structure with clearly discernible paths outlining the ‘causality field’ (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Plates G, J, K). To interpret the plots, note that streamlines start at their thinnest part, their direction is indicted with thickening line; typically multiple streamlines coalesce into a river-like pattern.
