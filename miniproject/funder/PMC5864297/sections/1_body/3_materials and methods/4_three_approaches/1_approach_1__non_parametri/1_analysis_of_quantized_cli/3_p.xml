<p>This mapped each data series to a symbol stream over a binary alphabet. The binary quantization is not a restriction imposed by the inference algorithm; while we do require quantized magnitudes, longer data streams can be encoded with finer alphabets to accommodate an arbitrary precision. For this specific dataset, the relatively short length of the county-specific time-series necessitated a coarse quantization in order for the results to have a meaningful statistical significance.</p>
