<p>We did not use an explicit spatial smoothing. The county-level random effects were used to account for possible heterogeneity in disease reporting across counties. However, as predictors, we used average infection rate values of immediate neighbors for the county (one, two, three, and four weeks in the past). This prediction structure afforded an implicit spatial smoothing, dampening spurious fluctuations in infection rates.</p>
