<p>As expected, the predicted incidence does not exactly match the observed out-of-sample data. Nevertheless, we see positive correlation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Plate A). Because we were modeling a necessarily spatio-temporal stochastic process, the predictive ability of the model is difficult to judge simply from the observed positive correlation. To resolve this, we investigated the performance of our model by computing how well it predicted the counties that experience flare-ups during the trigger-periods in the out-of-sample data. This exercise is reduced to a classification problem, by first choosing a threshold on the number of reported cases per week to define what is meant by a ‘flare-up’ (see description below). To quantify the prediction performance, we constructed ROC curves for each of the three target seasons, for each fixed week, as follows:
