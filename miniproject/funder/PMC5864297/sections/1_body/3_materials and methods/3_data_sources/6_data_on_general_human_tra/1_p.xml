<p>Using the complete Twitter dataset, we aggregated a movement matrix to capture people’s week-to-week travels between counties from geo-located Twitter messages (captured during the period of January 1, 2011 through June 30, 2014). This dataset includes approximately

A small, but significant, percentage of Twitter messages are automatically tagged with the author’s current latitude/longitude information, as determined by their mobile device. Each latitude/longitude-annotated tweet was mapped to a FIPS county code based on Tiger/Line shape files from the 2013 Census dataset (

In addition, we calculated a variant of our movement matrix to capture seasonality and other temporal dynamics: A set of 52 movement matrices captured weekly, county-to-county movements, observed in each week of the year, aggregating each week based on the corresponding observations, from each year from 2011 through 2014.
