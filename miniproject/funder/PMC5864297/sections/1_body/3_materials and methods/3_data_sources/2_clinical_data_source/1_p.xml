<p>The source of the clinical incidence data used in this study is the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan
 <sup>Â®</sup> Commercial Claims and Encounters Database for the years 2003 to 2012 (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Hansen, 2017</xref>). The database consists of approved commercial health insurance claims for between 17.5 and 45.2 million people annually, with linkage across years, for a total of approximately 150 million individuals. This US national database contains data contributed by over 150 insurance carriers and large, self-insuring companies. We scanned 4.6 billion inpatient and outpatient service claims and identified almost six billion diagnosis codes. After un-duplication, we identified approximately

 <inline-formula>

 </inline-formula>, at the spatial resolution of US counties. To define influenza in insurance claims, we used the following set of ICD9 codes: 487.8, 488.12, 488.1, 488.0, 488.01, 488.02, 487.0, 487.1, 488.19, 488.09, 488, 487, and 488.11. We also considered including non-specific codes representing 
 <italic>unspecified viral infection</italic> (079.99), as suggested in (
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Viboud et al., 2014</xref>), and decided against it. (We provide explicit annotation for each code, as well as rationale for choosing narrower ICD-code definition of ILIs, in the Supplement Section S-D).
