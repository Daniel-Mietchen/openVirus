 </inline-formula> may seem highâ€“especially given that it is a much greater percentage than the change in seropositivity over most influenza seasons. Note that our

 <italic>among insured patients who contacted their physician for any reason during the week in question</italic>. In other words, the denominator that we used for computing prevalence was almost certain to be much smaller than the overall population of the corresponding county.
