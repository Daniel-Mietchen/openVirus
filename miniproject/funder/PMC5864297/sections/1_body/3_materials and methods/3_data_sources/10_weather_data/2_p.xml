<p>Variables were aggregated to county boundaries based on shapefiles from the GADM database of Global Administrative Areas (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Areas, 2014</xref>). Where appropriate, we considered both the average daily climate variable (for example, the daily maximum temperature averaged over the week) as well as the the maximum and/or minimum of the variable experienced over the week. For precipitation, we considered only the cumulative total precipitation experienced during the week.
