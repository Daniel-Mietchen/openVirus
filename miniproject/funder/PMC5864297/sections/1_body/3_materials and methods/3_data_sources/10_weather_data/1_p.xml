<p>The dataset starts with the week beginning December 31 st, 2002 and includes 522 weeks (which ends exactly on the week ending December 31 st, 2012). Temperature and precipitation data come from the 2.5 arcminute (approximately 4 km) PRISM (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Oregon State University, 2014</xref>) dataset and other variables (wind speed, specific humidity, surface pressure, downward incident, and shortwave solar radiation) come from the 7.5 arcminute (approximately 12 km) Phase 2 North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) dataset (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Mitchell, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Cosgrove et al., 2003</xref>). These datasets were selected in large part due to the fact that both are updated in near real-time, making it possible to use these datasets for future monitoring applications. PRISM is released daily, with an approximately 13 hr delay (data for the previous day is released at 1pm EST each day) while NLDAS is released daily, with an approximately 2.5 day delay).
