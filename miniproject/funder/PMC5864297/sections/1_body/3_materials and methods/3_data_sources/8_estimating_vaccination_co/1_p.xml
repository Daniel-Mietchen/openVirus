<p>We incorporated the effect of vaccination coverage by estimating the cumulative fraction of the population that received the current influenza vaccine within the previous 20 week period. This approach to estimating vaccination coverage does not correct for season-specific antigenic match, or the lack thereof. Nevertheless, because we explicitly included measures of antigenic diversity in addition to vaccination coverage, we expected that effects arising from the degree of antigenic match would indeed be factored in; if there is a significant mismatch, we expected the antigenic diversity in that year to be less and vice verse. This assumes implicitly that vaccination does indeed play a major role in exerting significant selection pressure, the assumption that was reinforced by our observation of a strong dependency between vaccination coverage and normalized antigenic diversity.</p>
