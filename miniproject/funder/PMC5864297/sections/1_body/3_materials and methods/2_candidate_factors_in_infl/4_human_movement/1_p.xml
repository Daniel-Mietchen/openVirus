<p>We considered two measurements of human movement: (1) The first measurement reflects the proximity of counties to major airports. We computed an exponentially-diffusing influence from counties with major US airports, weighted by passenger enplanements at their respective locations. This accounted for people moving to and from both major airports and neighboring counties, and; (2) The second measurement is a large-scale movement matrix representing peopleâ€™s week-to-week travels between counties. These data were culled from a complete collection of geo-located Twitter messages, captured over
