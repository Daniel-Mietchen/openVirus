<p>Social contact among children in schools has been extensively investigated as a determinant of the peak incidence rate. This is one of the few factors that might lend itself to intervention relatively easily, and hence the interest is well-justified. While any reduction in social contact should, in theory, directly impact transmission, quantifying the effect of this specific mode of contact on the incidence rate has been difficult to calculate. Predictions of the reduction in the peak incidence associated with reduced social contact were typically 20–60% (

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh and Heffernan, 2010</xref>). Reductions in the cumulative attack rate (AR, ratio of the number of new cases to the size of the population at risk) were usually smaller than those in the peak incidence. Several studies predicted small (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) predicted that peak incidence might increase markedly under certain circumstances following school closures, for example by 27% if school closures caused a doubling in the number of contacts in the household and community, or by 13% if school systems were closed for two weeks at a prevalence of 1% in the general population. Studies have also investigated the effect of such interventions on children vs. adults; one study predicted an overall reduction in the cumulative AR, but an increase of up to 48% in the cumulative AR for adults in some situations (
