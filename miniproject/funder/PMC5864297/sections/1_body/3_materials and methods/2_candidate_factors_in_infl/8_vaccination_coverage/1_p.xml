<p>Vaccination is widely regarded as our most promising tool to combat influenza, though antigenic variation between seasons makes it difficult to craft an effective vaccination strategy (

Additionally, short-term molecular evolution might rapidly give rise to immune-escape variants that, if detected, might dictate intra-season updates in vaccine composition. More importantly, vaccination itself might exert significant selection pressure to influence antigenic drift. The effect of vaccination on viral evolution has been documented in an avian H5N2 lineage in vaccinated chickens (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that similar processes might be occurring in human counterparts. The diversity of the surface proteins at any point in time between seasons suggests that our current vaccination strategies are limited to confer partial immunity, which can result in a highly immune or vaccinated population selectively pressurizing the viral population to evolve more quickly than usual. Given that influenza moves quickly across geographies and that there are multiple, co-circulating strains that may confer partial cross-protection, changing viral service proteins represent a ‘moving target’ for the human immune system. There are additional complexities due to early-life immune imprinting in humans.
