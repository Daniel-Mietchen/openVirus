<p>Resistance to influenza infection in human hosts arises via two related mechanisms: immunological memory from a previous infection by an identical or sufficiently similar strain, or vaccination against the current strain (or a sufficiently similar strain). In our analysis, we explicitly account for the degree of vaccination coverage. Accounting for host immunity is more difficult, because resistance to infection is not directly observable; however, our analysis also uses the antigenic variation of influenza virus as a proxy to host resistance: If the relative antigenic variation is large, then the susceptibility of non-vaccinated hosts increases, while low antigenic variation increases the probability of encountering a resistant host. In addition, we use the absolute antigenic deviation of the later-season virus from the first-season virus in our data set (winter of 2003â€“2004) as a predictor, in order to capture longer-term effects of immunological memory. Thus, if the magnitude of the relative drift between two succeeding years is small, we have a likely decrease in susceptibility. Likewise, if the absolute deviation from a few years back starts decreasing, we would also register a decrease in susceptibility. Incorporating these factors in the diverse set of models that we investigate, guarantees that we are indeed considering host susceptibility contributions from a wide range of possible mechanisms.</p>
