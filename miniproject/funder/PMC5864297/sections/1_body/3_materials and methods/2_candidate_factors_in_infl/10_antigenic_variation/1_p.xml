<p>The influenza virus counteracts host immunity via subtle genomic changes over time. The more gradual process, known as antigenic drift, is a manifestation of a gradual accumulation of mutations within viral surface proteins recognized by human antibodies, such as hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). These mutations are typically introduced during cycles of viral replication (

 </inline-formula> they do not affect the functional conformation of the viral proteins. However, some of these alterations do, in fact, sufficiently change secondary and tertiary protein structures to have a negative impact on the binding of host antibodies raised in response to previously circulating strains (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Webby and Webster, 2001</xref>). (Many such mutations also reduce the virusâ€™s viability.) Thus, while a single infection episode is potentially enough to provide long-term host immunity to the invading strain, antigenic variation due to intense selection pressure gives rise to novel viral strains, making re-infections possible within the span of a few years (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Andreasen, 2003</xref>). This kind of perpetual Red-Queen arms race injects influenza dynamics with auto-correlative dependencies over multiple seasons. It has been suggested that substantial antigenic drift might be associated with more severe, early-onset influenza epidemics, resulting in increased mortality (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Treanor, 2004</xref>). In contrast to antigenic drift, 
 <italic>antigenic shift</italic> is an abrupt, major change in virus structure due to gene segment re-assortment that occurs during simultaneous infection of a single host by multiple influenza subtypes (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2006</xref>). Antigenic shift results in new versions of viral surface proteins. Antigenic shift due to re-assortment gives rise to novel influenza subtypes that, if capable of sustained human-to-human transmission, can have devastating consequences for human populations,
