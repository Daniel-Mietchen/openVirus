<p>In our analysis, we factor in the potential effect of antigenic variation by estimating the surface protein’s population diversity – hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 1 (M1), and matrix protien M2 – as a function of time and geographical sample collection location. Our rationale for our focus on these proteins is that HA, NA, and to some degree M1, are all present on the viral surface (
