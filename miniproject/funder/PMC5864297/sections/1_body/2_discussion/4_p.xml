<p>Each of our three types of computational approaches has their strengths and weaknesses: (1) The Poisson mixed-effect regression allows for the direct comparison of the predictive strength of numerous predictor variables and accounts for spatial and temporal autocorrelation, but relies on strong modeling assumptions; (2) The non-parametric Granger analysis is not limited by restrictive modeling assumptions in our implementation, though it focuses only on trends of infection propagation between counties, and; (3) The county-matching analysis is also model-free, but this freedom comes at the expense of lesser statistical power.</p>
