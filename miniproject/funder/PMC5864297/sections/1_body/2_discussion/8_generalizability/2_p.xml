<p>We conclude by highlighting the structure of overlapping conclusions delivered by our three approaches. Approach 1: Granger-causality analysis suggests that an epidemic tends to begin in the South, near water bodies and that short-range, land-based travel is more influential compared to air-travel for infection propagation, providing a map of mean infection flow across the continental US. Approach 2: Poisson regression identifies significant predictive factors, ranks these factors by importance, suggests that Southern shores are where the epidemic begins, and corroborates Approach 1â€™s result on short-range vs. long-range travel. Approach 3 (county-matching): This approach drills down further to the epidemic onset source to the Southeastern shores of continental US, and identifies a smaller validated subset of predictive factors.</p>
