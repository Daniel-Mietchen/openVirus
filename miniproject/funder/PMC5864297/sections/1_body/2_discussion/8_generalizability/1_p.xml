<p>Our analysis uses no prior knowledge specific to influenza epidemiology. As such, these methods are not limited by either the pathogen under consideration (influenza), or the geospatial context (United States). The tools developed here are expected to be equally applicable to analyzing general epidemiological dynamics for pathogens other than influenza, unfolding in arbitrary geographical regions. The specific conclusions we draw about the initiation and propagation of the seasonal influenza in US might not hold true for influenza epidemiology in a different geographical context. However, the analysis tools are still applicable. More broadly, our tools delineate a general approach to modeling complex spatio-temporal dynamics, with applications beyond solely disease epidemiology.</p>
