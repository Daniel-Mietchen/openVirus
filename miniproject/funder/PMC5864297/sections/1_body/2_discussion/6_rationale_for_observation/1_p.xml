<p>The traditional empirical approach of testing a causal link between a factor and an outcome of an experiment was to vary one factor at a time, while keeping the other factors (experimental conditions) constant. This ‘all the rest of the conditions are equal’ assumption is often referred to by its Latin form as 
 <italic>ceteris paribus</italic>. R.A. Fisher ([
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Fisher, 1935</xref>], p. 18) noted that, in real-life experiments, perfect 
 <italic>ceteris paribus</italic> is not achievable ‘because uncontrollable causes which may influence the results are always … innumerable.’ Fisher’s proposed solution to this problem is to design experiments to involve random assignment of treatment (the putative causal factorâ€™s states) to individual trials and then use regression analysis to estimate the value and significance of the putative causal effect.
