<p>Likewise, hypothesis-driven science, wherein investigators formulate a single, testable hypothesis and design specific experiments to test it, is a core element of the scientific method, and works well in most scientific fields. However, a new challenge emerges in data-rich scientific fields, such as genomics, epidemiology, economics, climate modeling, and astronomy: How do we choose the most promising hypotheses among millions of eligible candidates that potentially fit data? One solution to this challenge is the many-hypotheses approach, a method of automated hypothesis generation in which many hypotheses are systematically produced and simultaneously tested against all available data. This approach is currently used, for example, in whole-genome association or genetic linkage studies, and often enables truly unexpected discoveries. In contrast to the single-hypothesis approach, the many-hypotheses approach explicitly accounts for the large universe of possible hypotheses through calibrated statistical tests, effectively reducing the likelihood of accidentally accepting a mediocre hypothesis as a proxy for the truth (
