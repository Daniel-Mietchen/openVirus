<p>The many-hypotheses approach provides a complement to carefully controlled and highly focused wet laboratory experiments. Running controlled experiments to test a single hypothesis necessarily ignores many of the complexities of a real-world phenomenon; these complexities are necessarily present in large, longitudinal datasets. Of course, the data-driven ‘many-hypotheses’ approach is only one aspect of the broader scientific process progressing toward the development of verifiable general theories.</p>
