<p>The following aspects make our study of influenza triggers new in the influenza literature: (1) Instead of simulating the plausibility of one particular epidemic trigger model with a dynamic disease transmission model, we used formal model selection tools to compare the goodness of fit of hundreds of plausible models; (2) We explicitly attempted to systematically cross-compare the importance of numerous individual factors typically hypothesized to contribute to epidemic onset; (3) To accomplish this, we collected an unprecedented volume of temporal and spatial data on disease dynamics and the dynamics of putative predisposing factors; (4) We used several orthogonal, computational causality-inference techniques (one of which was developed specifically for this study) to probe associations between disease onset and putative epidemic triggers; (5) We tested our best models for their predictive potential and demonstrated that they are, indeed, suitable for forecasting disease waves, and; (6) We combined, for the first time, numerous candidate factors in a single, integrative study.</p>
