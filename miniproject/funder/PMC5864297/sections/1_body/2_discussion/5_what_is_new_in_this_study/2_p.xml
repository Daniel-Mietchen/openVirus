<p>Convergent conclusions, culled from these radically different techniques, strengthen our claims and make it statistically unlikely that we are observing analysis artifacts. First, the Granger causality analysis results (Approach 1) provide insights into the details of influenza’s epidemiological dynamics.

 </inline-formula> of the streamlines sink in counties belonging to the Southern states, which matches up well with the streamline-encoded dynamics of weekly disease incidence over nine years (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). What drives this particular causality field’s geometry? While we cannot definitively answer this question, a comparison of the global patterns emerges from the local mobility data culled from the aforementioned Twitter database and offers a tentative explanation (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Second, contrary to reported human travel pattern influence on seasonal epidemics (
 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Viboud et al., 2006</xref>) (but consistent with [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Gog et al., 2014</xref>]), we find that short-distance travel contributes more significantly to disease spread (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, we find that long-range air travel is important as an epidemic 
 <italic>trigger</italic>, but once infection waves are triggered, air travel patterns (or proximity to major airports) become less important. Short-range mobility, on the other hand, is apparently important for sustaining infection transmission over each season. Thus, we find short-range travel to be more important for defining the emergent spatio-temporal geometry of infection waves, while proximity to airports is more important for actually triggering an influenza season; the latter loses positive influence once an infection is under way. This conclusion is justified as follows: (1) When we performed regression calculations using all weeks for which data were available (as opposed to wave initiation weeks only) the airport proximity predictor coefficient turned out to be statistically significantly negative (see Supplement). (2) Results from our Granger-causal inference indicate that, on average, the local, putatively causal connections are far stronger compared to the putatively causal connections between counties within which the major airports are located (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). Additionally, from our best mixed-effect regression model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we find that land connectivity effects are significantly stronger than air connectivity effects. The predictive value of Twitter connectivity, which intuitively captures both local and long-distance travel, lies in-between land and air connectivity coefficients. Note that Twitter connectivity is represented as a directed graph, where for each pair of counties,

  </math>
 </inline-formula>. Therefore, intuitively, the Twitter connectivity graph should have the features of both a land-connectivity and an air travel graph; which indeed appears to be close to reality. 3) While airport diffusion is a significant factor in our best Poisson model (using data from the initiation period), the causal streamlines (constructed with the complete, all-year incidence data) do not seem to originate from airport-bearing counties.
