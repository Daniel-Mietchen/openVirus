<p>Also not explained solely by our regression models is the occurrence of relatively high infection prevalence in the central parts of the country. These differences cannot be attributed to long-distance air travel, as discussed before. However, the routes taken by the causality streamlines (as computed by the non-parametric Granger analysis), interpreted as paths followed by an infection on average, suggest an explanation: The close match between the Granger-causal flow and the short-range mobility patterns (derived from Twitter analysis) strongly suggest that average disease prevalence is modulated by short-range mobility.</p>
