<p>Intuitively, we expected that all three approaches would produce similar, if not identical results. In practice, while the three approaches agreed in most cases, this agreement was not perfect. For example, the highlighted areas (greater incidence) in the first influenza season snapshot for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref> each should match relatively well to the maps in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> (or at least some unspecified subset of ‘high incidence treatment counties’). While the county-matching results point to initiation at coasts, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, 2006-2007 initiation seems to spread from the West Coast and, in , 2010 has a scattered pattern across the middle of the US.
