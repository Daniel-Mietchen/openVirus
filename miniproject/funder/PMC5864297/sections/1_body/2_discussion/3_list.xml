  <p>Flammable Media: The Southern US appears to have an unusually high level of social connectivity; it is at least one order of magnitude higher than that in the north of the country (see GSS survey results (
   <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1972</xref>) and 
   <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The number of close friends, close friends who are neighbors, and communities of people who all, or mostly, know each other is much higher in the South than in the country at large. Our conjecture is that a manifestation of this high-connectivity is the highest 
   <italic>apparent</italic> percentage of people infected with influenza (

  <p>Initiation Spark: An initial spark for the infection wave is generated by a combination of weather and demographic factors. Specifically, warm, humid places are conducive to influenza wave initiation - particularly in weeks where specific humidity drops. Airport proximity is important, as well as demographic and economic makeup and also the degree of urbanization. Note that the first static condition (warm humid places) is highly correlated with areas in the South with greater social connectivity. It is possible that static meteorological variables (warm mean temperature and high mean humidity) serve as proxies for high social connectivity or other correlated socioeconomic factors.</p>

  <p>Wind: The ‘wind’ in this analogy is the collective movement of a large number of people, integrated over time, revealing persistent ‘currents.’ These currents reproducibly point from coastlines and move inwards towards the center of the continent, making them perfect vehicles to transmit the infection inland from the shores.</p>
