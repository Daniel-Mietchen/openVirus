  <p>We carried out a direct validation of predictive performance by estimating model parameters using the first six seasons and predicting the epidemic trigger locations using the last three (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and Materials and methods). The out-of-sample predictions of influenza incidence are always positively correlated with observed incidence (Plate A). Perhaps more importantly, we obtained good predictability as measured by the area under the curve (AUC

  <p>As we discuss in the next section, in Approach 3, we conducted a corroborating matched effect analysis on the counties, using combinations of county-specific factors as a ‘treatment,’ not unlike clinical trials in which patients on a drug regimen are matched to patients receiving a placebo (
