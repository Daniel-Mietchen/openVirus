<p>How can colder weather and lower humidity be a predictor of influenza, if influenza epidemic waves tend to start in the South with warmer climates and higher humidity? Our resolution of this seeming controversy is as follows: The stress is on the drop in both humidity and temperature in those areas with high average annual values of these measurements. A blast of colder, lower-humidity weather in these warm-climate areas has two effects: (1) The influenza virus can stay viable in water droplets longer than in hot, sunny weather, and; (2) Humans tend to interact indoors, in more crowded conditions. Both of these factors are favorable for transmission of the virus to the population at large.</p>
