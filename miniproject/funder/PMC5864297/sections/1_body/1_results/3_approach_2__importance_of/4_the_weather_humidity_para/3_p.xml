<p>The first three proteins are directly involved in the viral binding to host cell surface receptors, while M2 activity is needed only during HA biosynthesis. Additionally, proteolysis experiments indicated that M2 proton channel activity helped to protect (H1N1)pdm09 HA from premature conformational changes as it traversed low-pH compartments during transport to the cell surface (
