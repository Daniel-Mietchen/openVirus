<p>We focused on a subset of weeks associated with the initial rise of influenza waves (indicated by the gray bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, and calculated as discussed earlier). The results from our best-fit model are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. We selected this particular model out of a total of 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="inf43">
   <mn>126</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> compared in the Bayesian analysis, a few of which we list in 
 <xref rid="table5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, ranked by their decreasing goodness-of-fit, measured with the Deviance Information Criterion, DIC (see Supplement). From the values of the inferred coefficients corresponding to the different factors, and taking into account their significance levels and credible intervals, we concluded that the roles played by weather variables, particularly humidity, appear to be substantially more complicated compared to what has been suggested in the literature.
