 <italic>Weather</italic> As far as weather effects are concerned, epidemics tend to originate in places with high mean, maximum specific humidity, high average temperature, and low average air pressure, namely, in counties at the Southern, and, to a lesser extent, Eastern and Western US coastlines. Additionally, the spread of an epidemic is significantly influenced by a drop in specific humidity up to four weeks before its onset. However, this effect is weaker than the mean maximum specific humidity effect. Drop in average temperature that dips one to three weeks prior to the epidemic onset is also significantly important (this is consistent with earlier experiments [

However, high levels of solar flux in the week of onset are also important. This complicated set of weather conditions, a signature of the cold air front (
