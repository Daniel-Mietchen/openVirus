<p>We factored in the effect of vaccination coverage by estimating the cumulative fraction of the population that received the current influenza vaccine stratified by geo-spatial location and time of inoculation within each influenza season. Our analysis indicated that vaccination coverage is not a significant predictor of influenza onset/triggering period. It could be a reflection of overall vaccine ineffectiveness, or the choice of outcome predicted (i.e. vaccination might effect overall infection numbers over the entire outbreak, but not the timing of the trigger). It could also reflect the fact that different influenza type/subtypes have different virulenceâ€“so a vaccine against H3N2 during an H3N2 year, may be more effective, but due to that fact that H3N2 is more virulent, more people still wind up seeking medical care.</p>
