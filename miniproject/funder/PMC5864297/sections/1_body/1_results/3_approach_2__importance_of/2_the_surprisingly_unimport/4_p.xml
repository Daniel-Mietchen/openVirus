<p>Vaccination coverage failed to reach predictive significance. The variables corresponding to spatio-temporal indicators of the cumulative fraction of the inoculated population are included in our best model (see the last entry in 
 <xref rid="table5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), but their effect fails to be significant. However, if we drop those variables from the model, the DIC increases. We suggest that the strong dependence between antigenic diversity and vaccination coverage (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Jâ€“M</xref>) is responsible for this effect: Vaccination coverage is important, but its influence is captured by the antigenic variation.
