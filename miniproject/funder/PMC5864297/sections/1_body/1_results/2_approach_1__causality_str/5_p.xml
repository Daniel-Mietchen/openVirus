<p>These approaches produced qualitatively similar results (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and I</xref>), they successfully gain traction near large bodies of water (as evidenced by the most likely places of epidemic onset, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>)). Otherwise, they fizzle out before triggering an actual epidemic cycle (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Seasonal initiation is neither spatially uniform nor simply a reflection of county-specific population density.
