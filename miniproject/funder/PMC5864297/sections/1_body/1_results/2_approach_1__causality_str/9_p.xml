<p>Conclusions associated with Approach 1: The inferred causality streamlines computed from the infection time series in all counties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) show that epidemics are mostly triggered near large water bodies and flow inland and away. They also illustrate that the US continental Southern states act as ‘sinks’ to a large proportion of these streamlines. (‘Sinks,’ in our definition here, are geographic areas that multiple streamlines converge 
 <italic>towards</italic>; sinks are especially obvious when we look at the vector representation of causality direction. The opposite of a ‘sink’ is a ‘source,’ defined as an area at which at least one streamline starts.) This might explain the increased prevalence in the designated region. Additionally, the analysis shows that human travel is a very important driver of emergent epidemiological patterns, and that short-range, land-based travel is more important than air-travel. This result is cross-corroborated by our Poisson regression analysis (described next in Approach 2).
