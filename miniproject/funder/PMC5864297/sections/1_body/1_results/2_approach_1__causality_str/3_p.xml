<p>Do epidemics originate from the same counties season after season? To answer this question, we follow ‘causality streamlines’ back to their source county. Informally, influenza onset in these source counties has little or no causal dependency on their neighbors. That is, their epidemic states are seemingly caused by factors outside of disease prevalence in other counties. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> presents the county-specific likelihood of streamline initiation across our nine years of data. To verify the near-shores position of these source counties is not a mere manifestation of a boundary effect of shore counties (no neighbors at the side of large water body), we carried out identical causality analyses with two different infections, specifically choosing diseases less likely to share etiologies with influenza: HIV and

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infections are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>, which exhibit flow patterns very different from those obtained for influenza. These streamlines almost never originate from the coasts, thus reducing the likelihood that the pattern observed for influenza is a geo-spatial boundary effect. Combined with the exceedingly low probability (
