<p>In addition to looking at the direction of short-range travel, we used our non-parametric Granger analysis to investigate the comparative strength of short- vs. long-range influenza propagation. In the first case, we considered the neighborhood map shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (for a detailed definition of ”neighbors,’ see Materials and methods), and the in the second case, we considered associations between major, airport-bearing counties (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We then plotted the distribution of the maximum pairwise coefficient of causality, where the maximization is carried out by fixing the source and the target and varying the delay in weeks, after which we attempt to predict the target stream.
