<p>Our analysis of the Twitter movement matrix indicates that people most frequently travel between neighboring counties, preferentially towards higher-population-density areas, which shows that the maximum-probability movement patterns follow the local gradient of increasing population density (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, the geo-spatially-averaged movement vectors for each county reveal global flows in the movement patterns (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, along with Methods for the calculation of spatial averages).
