<p>We directly validated our conclusion that influenza waves tend to start in the South by identifying counties which seem to trigger the epidemic. We computed a ‘trigger period’ of five to six weeks for each season, defined as the period immediately preceding an exponential increase in influenza dispersion. To calculate this weekly dispersion, we treated each county as a node in an undirected graph, each with an edge connecting two geographically adjacent counties–only if they had both reported at least one influenza case in the specified week. We defined dispersion as the size of the largest, connected component in this undirected graph. Thus, a trigger period describes the period in which the size of the giant component of the infection graph rises above
