  <p>Local county-to-county movements were much more predictive of influenza wave change than airport movements. In comparing Plates E and F in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we see that the local movement causality coefficient (

    </math>
   </inline-formula>) is, on average, twice as large as that for long-range movement (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that the mean long-range causality coefficient is approximately 0.05, whereas it is just over 0.1 in the local propagation. As the causality coefficient quantifies the amount of predictability (measured as information in bits) communicated about the target data stream per observed bit in the source data stream, it follows that, on average, every ten bits of sequential incidence data from an influencing location tells us one bit about the unfolding incidence dynamics in the target location. Therefore, in case of the long-range movement, informativeness is twice as low, so we need on average 20 bits to infer one bit about the state of infection. These calculations strongly suggest that local movement is predictively stronger with regards to influenza infection propagation.

  <p>While the most frequent value of the computed time delay in influence propagation between counties with large airports is zero weeks, this distribution is significantly flatter compared to that for local, county-to-county influence propagation.</p>
