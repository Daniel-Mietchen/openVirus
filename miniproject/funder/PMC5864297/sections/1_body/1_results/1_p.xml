<p>The logical flow of our analysis is as follows: (1) We first show that our definition of ILIs corresponds well with CDC data, and that our causality coefficients, defined in Approach 1, have similar meanings to coefficients in the regression analysis; (2) We then explain the outcomes of the analysis according to Approach 1; (3) We then analyze the importance of putative casual factors,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; (4) In Approach 2, we pay special attention to the relative importance of short- and long-distance travel in influenza propagation, Figure 4; (5) We further test the best regression model in terms of predictive accuracy, Figure 5, using disjointed data parts for training and testing, and; (6) We culminate our analysis with a county-matching analysis, Figure 6.
