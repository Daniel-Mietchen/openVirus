<p>The results of Approach 3’s analysis are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. We found that no single variable was able to consistently yield a statistically significant odds ratio greater than one; multiple factors interacted to shape an epidemic trigger (see 
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for a few examples). With a total of 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="inf61">
   <mn>47</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> significant variables in our best mixed-effect model, an exhaustive search for all combinations was not feasible. Instead, we performed a standard evolutionary search, looking for combinations that yielded a significant odds ratio for individual seasons. Additionally, we considered all seasons together (by simply adding the contingency tables, element-wise) in order to increase the test’s statistical power.
