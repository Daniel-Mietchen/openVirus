<p>First, we collected the list of all counties with a drop in maximum specific humidity during the weeks leading up to an influenza season in a particular year. This is the ‘treated set’: the set of counties that may be thought of as subjected to the positive ‘treatment’ of a drop in specific humidity. We split this set into two, considering counties that also experience increased influenza prevalence during the epidemic onset, and ones that do not (counties with two different values of the outcome variable). The number of counties in these two sets define the first row of a

 </inline-formula> contingency table. In the second row (the ‘control set’), we focused on counties that do not experience a drop in the maximum specific humidity. However, we only considered counties that have a matching counterpart in the treated set in the following sense: For each county in the control set, we found at least one in the treated set such that the rest of the significant variables (other than specific humidity) had similar variation patterns in both counties. Once we defined the control set, we split it in the manner described for the treated set: We counted the number of control counties that experienced an increased influenza prevalence during epidemic onset, and those which did not. This defined the second row of the contingency table. Finally, we used Fisher’s exact test to compute an odds ratio (the odds of realizing these numbers by chance), along with the test-derived significance of the association between the ‘treatment’ and epidemic wave initiation (
