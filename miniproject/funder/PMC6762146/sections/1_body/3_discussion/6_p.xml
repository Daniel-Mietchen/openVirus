<p>Our study is subject to several limitations. Survey questionnaire items were adapted from prior studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, the robust validation of the instrument in diverse contexts has not been performed. We translated FGDs from the original language which may have resulted in some intended nuances being lost. Because of the need to conduct the survey as the epidemic evolves, the comprehension of survey questions in French or other languages was not evaluated. Furthermore, for survey participants who did not speak French, questions and responses were translated into their preferred language, such that variations in interpretation may have been introduced. Social desirability bias may have influenced some participantsâ€™ responses, which tended to align with official recommendations. We did not examine the relation between knowledge, attitudes, and exposure to health promotion interventions or messages. Finally, the sample was a convenience sample purposively drawn from the area of the outbreak, with an over-representation of students and higher education level, but it would be of interest to assess attitudes toward Ebola in other geographic, political, and cultural contexts through a purposive sampling strategy.
