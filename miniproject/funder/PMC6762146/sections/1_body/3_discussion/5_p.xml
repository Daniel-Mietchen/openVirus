<p>Beyond passive non-compliance, FGD participants recounted acts of overt hostility from community members. Corroborating these eyewitness accounts, news reports of community members blocking health workers from taking patients to the ETC [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], infected people escaping from the ETC [

 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], youth gangs forcibly removing corpses of EVD victims [

 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and mass street protests with destruction of administrative buildings [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] have recently emerged from Eastern DRC. Clashes in Béni resulted in temporary halting of case-finding and vaccination, directly impacting critical response efforts [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Flashpoints of confrontation included burials, as locals bristled at outsiders violating cultural mores [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], attitudes well represented among our FGD respondents. In our survey questionnaire, 9% of respondents felt that such acts of aggression were justified, suggesting that resistance was entrenched in a substantial minority of the community. How to account for such radical opposition to disease control efforts? Violent resistance to EVD teams was also seen in Guinea, where eight outreach workers were killed in 2014, as well as two policemen in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Difficulties in community engagement, riots, and stoning of vehicles were regularly documented in WHO situation reports [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Political origins of mistrust in Guinea [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and in Eastern DRC have explanatory power in both contexts. In both countries, corruption scandals and expropriation of mining resources by foreign business interests set the stage for suspicion of the government and of outsiders [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The motives of foreigners who arrived on scene to control the EVD threat after decades of neglecting the complex humanitarian crisis in the DRC were perceived as disingenuous [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this broader historical context, civil war and ongoing unrest led to a “toxic mix” [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] of chronic mistrust and sense of abandonment, following years of internecine rebel attacks, in which the national government has been ineffectual in restoring order. Some extreme views arose in our FGDs (“EVD is a creation come to exterminate the population”), a theory also promulgated by a local politician [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, it appears that for some in the DRC, as in Guinea, EVD transformed existing grievances into a visceral fear of actual genocide [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, conflict with outside agents can be understood from this backdrop of suspicion, aggravated by panic due to the rapid and lethal nature of the epidemic.
