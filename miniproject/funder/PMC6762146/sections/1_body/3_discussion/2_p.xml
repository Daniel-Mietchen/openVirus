<p>Reticence to comply with early isolation of sick patients, vaccination, and safe burial may provide a window for ongoing EVD transmission. In our survey questionnaire, 15% of participants endorsed one or more non-compliant intentions if one of their family members was ill or died of EVD (not taking person to treatment centre, hiding from authorities, touching body, or refusing official burial team,

In FGDs, lack of confidence in the EVD response appeared to be driven by perceptions of inadequate patient care, callous adherence to protocol (“herd medicine”), and disrespectful handling of corpses (“makeshift plastic morgue”). Similar findings emerged from qualitative data gathered by other organizations in the area and synthesized by the Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform [
