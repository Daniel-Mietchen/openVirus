<p>Through FGDs and survey questionnaires, we sought to understand social resistance to EVD control efforts, which may explain, at least in part, the stubbornly persistent transmission in Eastern DRC. Our qualitative data support findings from the current [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and previous EVD epidemics, in which resistance to national and foreign response teams was fueled by perceived inadequacies of the control efforts, attachment to burial rites, suspicion of motives, lack of engagement of local health care personnel, and a legacy of neglect of public health priorities by the state and international agencies [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our survey results suggest that a substantial minority of respondents endorsed views suggestive of “resistance” and that resistance was associated with denial of the biomedical discourse and dissatisfaction/mistrust of the EVD response team (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223104.s001">S1 File</xref>), suggesting that the questionnaire items were measuring a single unified construct. Likewise, four related questionnaire items pertaining to resistant intentions in case of EVD in a family member were correlated with each other (Table C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223104.s001">S1 File</xref>). These findings suggest that our questionnaire survey was internally consistent.
