<p>Several recommendations emerge from our study that may inform current and future EVD responses. First, international agencies should aspire to a more sustained and wholistic approach to public health issues that matter to the community. The intense, vertical, and focused EVD response during this epidemic has not been well accepted in part because the community is unaccustomed to external aid and suspicious of disingenuous motives. This might serve to build a foundation of trust upon which foreign assistance in an epidemic or crisis situation could build. Second, strong communication and dialogue with community members in the local language should be foundational; language barrier was highlighted as a failing of the EVD response among FGD participants. Third, engaging trusted local experts (e.g., physicians and nurses) for public health messaging and case management should receive more emphasis. The response was characterized by a belief that local physicians and nurses “lacked the capacity” to deal with an EVD outbreak. Rather than build local capacity, the emphasis was on emergency containment, which ultimately became counter-productive as communities resisted the “top-down” control effort. Finally, real-time data collection, capturing emergent, on-the-ground, local barriers and facilitators [
