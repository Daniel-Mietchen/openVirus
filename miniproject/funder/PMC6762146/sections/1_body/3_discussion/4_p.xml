<p>A majority (77%) of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the epidemic would persist as long as local communities are not engaged. In FGDs, some local health workers, initially keen to be involved, were quickly disillusioned with a lack of support (logistics, accommodation, transport) and had disengaged from the control efforts. Similarly, in the 2014â€“16 outbreak, community actors were engaged late in the response, did not receive sufficient support [

In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, when deployment of outsiders proved ineffective due to community mistrust, community health workers who had been providing health services prior to the outbreak had their duties expanded to include EVD-related roles [
