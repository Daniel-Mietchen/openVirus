<p>Another source of animosity in our study was the perception of “disaster capitalism” as a driving motive of the national response team. Based on survey questionnaires, the view that foreign response teams had a profit motive was held by 127/630 (20%) of respondents (

 <italic>Kinois</italic> (residents of the distant capital Kinshasa), referred to as “strangers in our midst” by one FGD participant, were assumed to be well-paid, displayed visible wealth (hired vehicles), took minimal risks, rarely got infected, and rarely quit. Delays in responding to potentially infected patients and corpses, together with the sluggish roll-out of interventions such as vaccine were therefore sometimes cynically interpreted as an attempt to draw out the epidemic for personal gain (“no EVD, no job”). For some participants, this created a sharp contrast between local health workers, undervalued and poorly rewarded yet paying a high toll of illness from treating the sick, and the foreign nationals, viewed as mercenaries profiteering from the epidemic. Likewise, in Sierra Leone in 2014–16, “all sorts of interest groups mushroomed overnight to collect cash from the Health Ministry” [

 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], describing individuals and groups that find ways to make disasters profitable as a new source of income, prolonging relief efforts for personal gain. As an example of “disaster capitalism,”in the context of an earlier environmental disaster (Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, USA, 2005), bureaucratic processes alienated victims seeking assistance for destroyed property (quotation from previous study: “you are guilty until proven innocent. You are guilty of lying that you own a home.”) [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similarly, in our study, bureaucratic processes in accessing the vaccine against EVD created dissatisfaction and mistrust (“there’s a procedure to verify the veracity of the claims of someone asking for the vaccine,” “They don’t believe people.”)
