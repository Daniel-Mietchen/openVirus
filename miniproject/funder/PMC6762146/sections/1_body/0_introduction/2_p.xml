<p>The ongoing EVD epidemic has prompted questions as to what may be driving the persistent transmission. Active conflict, high population density, large numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs), and mass migrations have been identified as promoting factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Past studies during other EVD epidemics suggest that root causes of resistance or reticence relate to five domains: (1) rumours; (2) fear; (3) mistrust and lack of confidence in the authorities; (4) denial of the biomedical discourse; and (5) desire to be autonomous and avoid exogenous contamination [
