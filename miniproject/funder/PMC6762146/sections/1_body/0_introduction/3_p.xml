<p>The objective of this study was to explore social resistance to EVD control efforts during the current persistent outbreak in Eastern DRC. We collected qualitative data through focus group discussions (FGDs), and quantitative data via survery questionnaire, sampling the active EVD transmission region of Butembo and its surrounding communities. Findings from this mixed-methods study may inform public health messaging and control efforts in this challenging epidemic.</p>
