FGDs produced rich qualitative data, from which we derived the following themes: (1) reports of compliance with and resistance to EVD response team; (2) poor quality, insufficiency, and cultural incongruity of EVD response; (3) lack of engagement of local personnel; and (4) mistrust of EVD response team. We elaborate on each theme, below, supported by representative quotations. For all quotations below (translated to English from original French), we include the original verbatim French quotations in Table A in
