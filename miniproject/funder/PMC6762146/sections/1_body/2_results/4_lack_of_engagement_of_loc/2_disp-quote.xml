 <p>“Understanding what is going on is difficult. Me, I quit just a week into it. I was recruited. I arrived in Béni, I didn’t even know whom to speak to. One person says go there, and another says something else. Finally, we start. Now I pay for my own accommodation. I pay for my own food. They tell me, you have to be in [name of town] (30 km away from [name of town] where I was staying) at 6am in the morning. And then in the morning there was no means of transportation. I take a motorcycle, and the evening, the same thing. So look, I left. People are de-motivated… And if the local people disengage from the process, well it will be a serious humanitarian catastrophe.” (doctor, ID#18)</p>
