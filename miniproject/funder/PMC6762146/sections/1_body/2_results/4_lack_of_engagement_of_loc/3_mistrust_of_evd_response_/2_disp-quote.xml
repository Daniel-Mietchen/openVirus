 <p>“We can read the spirit of the 
  <italic>Kinois</italic> [workers from Kinshasa], which is ‘no EVD, no job.’ The

The locals are poorly paid, and that’s the reason for a lot of people quitting. Have you ever heard of a 
  <italic>Kinois</italic> who quit? The disparities are striking and we’ve even written a memo to the authorities. If some locals remain, it’s out of patriotism, a volunteer spirit.” (doctor, ID#17)
