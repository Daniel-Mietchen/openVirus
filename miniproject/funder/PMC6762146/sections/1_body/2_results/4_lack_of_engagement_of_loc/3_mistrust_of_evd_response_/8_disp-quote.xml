 <p>“We helped each other out, mutually. Truth be told, there were others sicker than I was, very weakened…We treated the sick in the ETC. Personally, I bathed another patient who had EVD like me. It was a colleague. Emptying his chamberpot. He had no strength. We reconnected the drips of patients who were psychologically overcome who had disconnected theirs. We communicated with our colleagues who were outside by telephone… We told them the medication needs (requests) and they would throw them to us. We helped a lot of sick people in the face of this [NGO] protocol that doesn’t adapt to the case-by-case.” (nurse, ID#20)</p>
