   <bold>Perceived risk of EVD.</bold> Participants were asked to identify whether they felt they were at high, intermediate or low risk of contracting EVD, as in a previous EVD survey [
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

   <bold>Denial of biomedical discourse.</bold> As a possible upstream cause of social resistance [
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we assessed respondents’ agreement with the statement: “EVD is a fabrication, the disease does not exist here.” Participants were asked to rate their agreement on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1: “strongly agree”; 2: “agree”; 3: “neutral”; 4: “disagree”; and 5: “strongly disagree”). Denial (binary variable) was defined as a response of “strongly agree” or “agree,” and no denial was defined as a response of “neutral,” “disagree,” or “strongly disagree.”

   <bold>Dissatisfaction and mistrust of the EVD response team.</bold> In FGDs, some participants expressed viewpoints that were critical or mistrustful of the EVD response, which may represent root causes of social resistance [
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To assess the prevalence of these views, statements were generated that were representative of some qualitative findings, and respondents were asked to rate their agreement on a 5-point Likert scale. We used five statements to gauge mistrust and lack of confidence in the EVD control efforts: “I am not satisfied with the EVD response in Eastern DRC,” “The EVD response is not well organized,” “The foreigners come to assist with EVD control have a poor understanding of the local culture and regional situation,” “I don’t trust the foreigners come to assist with EVD control,” and “The foreigners have come to make a profit from this epidemic.” Correlation among the five items was assessed using a matrix of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and associated p-values. Dissatisfaction/mistrust (binary variable) was defined as agreement or strong agreement with one or more of these five items.

   <bold>Vaccine acceptability and community engagement.</bold> Some FGD participants felt that ring vaccination as a public health strategy was inadequate, which may have undercut confidence in the response effort. We assessed attitudes toward universal 
   <italic>versus</italic> targeted vaccination using the statement “We should vaccinate everybody against EVD, not only the contacts.” (5-point Likert scale). Lack of engagement of local medical staff and community members was another critique that arose from FGDs. We assessed agreement with the statement “The epidemic will continue as long as the local community is not engaged in control efforts” (5-point Likert scale).

   <bold>Support for incidents of overt hostility.</bold> Beyond non-compliance with public health recommendations, the current outbreak in Eastern DRC has witnessed acts of aggression toward health facilities and EVD response teams [
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As a marker of sympathy or support for more extreme social resistance to control efforts, we evaluated respondents’ agreement with the statement “People are justified in resisting the EVD control efforts (e.g., throwing stones, destruction of hospital property, taking away infected bodies, or chasing away the vaccination team)” (5-point Likert scale). With respect to this putative index of social resistance, participants were classified as “resistant-support hostility” if they agreed or strongly agreed with this statement and were classified as “compliant” otherwise.

   <bold>Intentions to comply with control efforts in case of EVD illness or death in family.</bold> We included four items asking about personal intentions related to EVD control, based on a past study [
   <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: would not bring infected person to the treatment centre, would hide person from health authorities, would touch body of deceased, or would refuse that an official burial team take care of the body. Correlation between the four items was assessed using a matrix of Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients and associated p-values. With respect to this second putative index of social resistance, respondents were classified as “resistant-non-compliant” if they expressed one or more of the four resistant intentions, and “compliant” if they expressed none of these intentions.
