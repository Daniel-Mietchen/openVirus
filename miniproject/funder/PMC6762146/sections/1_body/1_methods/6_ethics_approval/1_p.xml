<p>The study was approved by the Comité d’Éthique du Nord Kivu (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire du Graben, Butembo, DRC). Oral consent was obtained from all participants. The ethics committee waived the need for written informed consent for the following reasons: (1) survey questionnaires and FGDs carried minimal risk to participants; (2) participation in the survey/FGDs constituted tacit consent; and (3) excessive participant contact, including signing paperwork, was discouraged in the context of an EVD outbreak with potential for viral transmission by direct person-to-person contact and/or by fomites.</p>
