<p>Participants of FGDs and survey questionnaires were purposively selected (convenience sample) from the geographic regions affected by the EVD epidemic. Key informants included nurses and clinicians, community members in the cities/villages of BÃ©ni, Butembo, and Mangina, as well as IDPs in the Komanda camp. Each FGD had a mixed composition of these key informants. FGDs were conducted in the fourth month of the epidemic, during a peak in EVD transmission. Participants were 18 years of age or older.</p>
