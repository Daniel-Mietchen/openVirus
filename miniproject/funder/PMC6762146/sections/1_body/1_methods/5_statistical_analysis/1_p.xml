<p>GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA, 2012), and R (version 3.3.3, R core team, 2017) were used for data analyses. Descriptive statistics used proportions or median and interquartile range (IQR) for dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively. Correlations between questionnaire items using a 5-point Likert scale were analysed by the non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) and the associated p-value, testing the hypothesis that the correlation coefficient was different from zero. We hypothesized that denial and/or dissatisfaction/mistrust would be associated with social resistance, measured by two dichotomous indices of resistance: support for overt hostility and non-compliant intentions. For predictor variables, we examined demographic characteristics (age, sex, occupation, and education level) and attitudes (risk perception, denial, and dissatisfaction/mistrust). We used two-by-two contingency tables to test for an association between the predictor variables and indices of social resistance, quantifying the strength of the association using the odds ratio [

The odds ratio is computed as the cross-product ratio of the entries in the 2-by-2 contingency table of two binary variables [

To adjust for potential confounding effects between variables, we constructed multivariable logistic regression models based on the bivarable analysis. Variables were included in the multivariable model if the p-value from the bivariable association was &lt;0.1. Model results were expressed as adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs and associated p-values.
