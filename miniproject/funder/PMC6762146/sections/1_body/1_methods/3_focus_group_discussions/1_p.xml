<p>FGDs were conducted in the local languages (Kinande, Kiswahili, and French) by one of the study authors experienced in FGD methodology (KMC). FGDs included 5 participants in each group and lasted approximately 45 minutes each [
 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Participants were not remunerated. Discussions were recorded, then translated and transcribed by KMC into English for subsequent analysis. FGD questions were elastic, open-ended, and probing, allowing participants to shape the discussion. Questions were adapted from one FGD to the next allowing an iterative approach to confirm findings and explore emerging themes in greater depth. FGDs were continued until a point of saturation, when no new themes emerged in discussions [

 <xref rid="pone.0223104.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Two investigators (JU and MH) read the transcripts several times, noted preliminary ideas, produced initial codes, then generated and refined themes. Microsoft Word was used for qualitative data transcription and thematic analysis. Representative quotations as well as statements of particular interest were extracted to support the themes. Where language was potentially identifying (e.g., names of towns and organizations), these were redacted. Themes that emerged from the FGDs were used to inform quantitative survey content.
