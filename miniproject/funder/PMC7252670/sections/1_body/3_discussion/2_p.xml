Overall, infection rates were moderate (50–60%), suggesting the possible existence of a midgut infection barrier that impedes viral infection of mesenteric epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The dissemination rates, however, were around 50% at 7 dpi and 80–100% at 14 dpi, suggesting a weak midgut escape barrier, if any. Despite this dissemination, the transmission rates did not exceed 50% whichever the dpi, suggesting the presence of a salivary glands barrier. Our experimental design does not allow us to specify whether this barrier occurs at the entry in and/or escape from the salivary glands. Overall, the transmission efficiencies were low with no differences observed between DENV strains in pairwise comparison. These results, however, need to be modulated in view of the results obtained with the log-linear model which revealed that DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” would have a slightly higher transmission risk compared to DENV-3. In addition to these observations, infectious viral titers obtained from the infection and dissemination indices at 14 dpi showed differences between the DENV serotypes, with a tendency towards lower infectious viral titers for DENV-1. These differences do not seem to have an impact on transmission efficiencies: although the low number of positive saliva samples did not allow us to verify this fact statistically, viral titers in saliva seemed similar between all the DENV strains tested. We can suppose that this may be the result of a discontinuous release of virions in the saliva as it was shown that salivary glands are a site for replication and accumulation of DENV [
