<p>Transmission rates at 7 dpi ranged from 0% (DENV-2 and DENV-3) to 33%, with no significant differences shown between the viruses (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008303.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Results obtained from the log-linear model (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008303.s002">S2 Table</xref>) showed that the transmission rate was statistically higher at 14 dpi (OR = 3.57, 95%CI: 1.18–10.82). Transmission rates were also significantly higher for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” and DENV-4 compared to DENV-3 as reference, considering results of the univariate analysis (OR = 6.67, 95%CI: 1.57–28.42 and OR = 7.1, 95%CI: 1.27–39.79 respectively).
