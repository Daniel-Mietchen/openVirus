<p>As part of the molecular characterization of DENV strains circulating in the south Pacific region, the envelope gene sequences of DENV strains from 1997 to 2016 were obtained as described elsewhere [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One epidemic viral strain of each DENV serotype/genotype, selected from 1997 to 2016 during NC outbreaks, was isolated from human serum after no more than three passages in C6/36 cells line (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Briefly, 50 μl of serum (or viral suspension) diluted in Leibovitz medium (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 2% of fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific) and 10% of tryptose phosphate broth (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific) were inoculated onto a monolayer C6/36 cells. After 2 hours, the inoculum was removed and fresh media was added to the flask. The flask was then incubated for 5 days at 28°C.
