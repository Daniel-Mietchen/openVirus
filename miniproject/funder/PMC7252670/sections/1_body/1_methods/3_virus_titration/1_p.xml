<p>Viral titer of each virus was determined by immuno-fluorescent focus assay. This was repeated independently three times. A ten-fold dilution of the viral suspension was inoculated onto C6/36 cells in a 96-well plate. After one hour of incubation at 28째C, an overlay consisting of 1:1 Lebovitz medium supplemented with 10% of FBS and 3.2% of carboxyl methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. The plate was then incubated for 5 days at 28째C. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Pierce, ThermoFisher Scientific) at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. After a first incubation with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Pan Biotech, Dutscher) 0.5% Triton X-100 (Biorad) for 10 minutes at RT, cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with flavivirus-specific monoclonal antibody 4G2 (hybridoma D1-4G2-4-15) for one hour at 37째C. After washing, cells were incubated for one hour at 37째C with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS supplemented with 5% FBS. Foci were counted under a fluorescent microscope (Leica) and the quantity of virus obtained was expressed as Focus Forming Unit per milliliter (FFU/mL).</p>
