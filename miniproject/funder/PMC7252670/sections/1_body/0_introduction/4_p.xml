<p>Although many 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species are vectors of DENV in the Pacific region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the only known DENV vector in NC to date is 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. A previous study of NC 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>Aegypti</italic> showed that the populations of the main island are genetically homogeneous [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This characterization of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations is important as mosquito genetic factors may influence their competence for arboviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous work demonstrated the ability of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from NC to transmit chikungunya or Zika viruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Few data, however, are available regarding DENV and this vector’s capacity to transmit DENV in NC has not yet been investigated except for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
