<p>To assess changes in preprint posting during the 2 epidemics, we examined the subset of all preprints that could be matched with an eventual publication. For Ebola, we matched 45 (60%) of the preprints to PubMed-indexed journal articles, and for Zika, 84 (48%). Four additional Zika preprints were matched to “Review” (1) or “Comparative Study” (3) publications in PubMed. Unmatched preprints may be preprints that were never submitted for peer-reviewed publication (e.g., opinions or preliminary work that was abandoned), were never accepted for publication, or were still in peer review at the end of the selected time periods.</p>
