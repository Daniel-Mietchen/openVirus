<p>Preprints offer numerous challenges and opportunities for science in general but represent a particularly important opportunity to accelerate the dissemination of science in the midst of infectious disease outbreaks, when early actions are critical and evidence is scarce [

Despite this need and the 2016 statement on preprints and data sharing, less than 5% of Ebola and Zika journal articles were posted as preprints prior to publication in journals. This low adoption reflects an intrinsic and established, yet unnecessary, prioritization of the traditional publication process over the dissemination of science. Further progress is essential to ensure that science can be rapidly and broadly disseminated in the context of outbreaks. It is incumbent upon scientists, publishers, and funders alike to recognize the value of preprints and embrace them as a critical component of outbreak science.
