<p>Although preprint adoption in both outbreaks was very low, 4 important advances were clear. First, the relatively higher preprint usage for signatory publishers both before and after the statement indicates that policy supportive of preprints can encourage their use. Second, the number of preprints posted increased between the 2 outbreaks, likely reflecting changing attitudes towards preprints in the life sciences and changing policies, including the data sharing statement [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002549.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pmed.1002549.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Third, preprints generally contained new analyses and increasingly shared novel data. Fourth, with preprints available months before peer-reviewed publications, preprint posting can accelerate the sharing of research.
