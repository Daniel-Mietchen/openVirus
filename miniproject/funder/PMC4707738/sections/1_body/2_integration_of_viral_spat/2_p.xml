<p>The simplest way to combine viral spatial and genetic data is through the mapping of infections attributable to different viral strains. This creates a link to genetic variation because RNA viruses are classified into genotypes and subtypes using analysis of their gene sequences. In recent years, the global geographical distribution of strains of HIV-1 [

 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have been characterized in this way. Despite being primarily descriptive, such studies can be useful in public health planning. For example, severe disease following dengue virus infection is more common in regions where two or more viral serotypes co-circulate, and the success rate of drug treatment for hepatitis C virus infection varies significantly among viral genotypes.
