<p>If transmission is predominantly local and movement unimpeded by geographical barriers then the genetic and geographical distances among sampled infections are expected to be positively correlated. This principle, known as isolation by distance [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], forms a simple yet direct link between genetic and spatial information, and represents an important null hypothesis in spatial genetics. Strong correlations may be observed for viruses that disperse gradually, such as rice yellow mottle virus during its spread across sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, patterns of isolation by distance can be swiftly lost if landscape features affect the dynamics of spread. A study of Zaire ebolavirus in central Africa suggested that the epizootic underwent an abrupt change in direction at a major biogeographic river barrier [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Rerouting geographical distances between virus sequences through this ‘pivot point’ led to much stronger correlations of genetic and geographical distances than when straight line distances were used [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Evidence for isolation by distance may be also eroded by high rates of host movement (a topic discussed later in the context of influenza viruses). The Ebola study, and others (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]), illustrate the importance of using the locations of ancestral infections when reconstructing the geographical distance travelled by the chain of transmission that connects two sampled cases, especially when dissemination is not uniform in space. As discussed above, ancestral locations are typically inferred using one of the ‘trait evolution’ phylogeography methods.
