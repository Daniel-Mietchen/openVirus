<p>Evolutionary analysis of viral genes can be used to validate the putative source of an emerging viral outbreak that has been identified through epidemiological surveillance and contact tracing. For example, the proposed index case of the 2007 outbreak of CHIKV in northeast Italy had hosted a relative from Kerala, India (where the virus was epidemic), and phylogenetic analysis of virus E1 gene sequences from the Italian outbreak showed it to be very closely related to strains previously isolated in India [

Independent testing of an outbreak's source using viral genetics is especially valuable when surveillance data is uncertain or absent, and may become commonplace as viral genome sequencing becomes routine in clinical diagnosis. It is therefore important that public health agencies recruit and retain expertise in the evolutionary analysis of pathogen genetic variation.
