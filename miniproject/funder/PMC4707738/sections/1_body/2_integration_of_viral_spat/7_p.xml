<p>A key goal of viral phylogeography is to help predict future pathogen spread by indicating those social or environmental factors that are associated with virus movement. This is often achieved by qualitative comparison of virus genetic diversity or dispersal history with geographical data. For example, the early spread of HIV-1 in east Africa was explored by combining phylogenetic analyses with regional data on road network architecture and population density, obtained using GIS techniques [

More recent phylogeographic studies have formalized this approach by parametrizing location exchange rates as a function of different potential causal factors, so that the effects of these drivers of spatial spread can be quantified and tested using genetic data [

Retrospective application of this technique to the 2009 influenza A pandemic demonstrated that combining both data sources predicted the global dissemination of the pandemic better than either alone [
