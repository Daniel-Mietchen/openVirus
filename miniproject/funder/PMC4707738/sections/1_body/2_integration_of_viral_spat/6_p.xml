<p>Highly heterogeneous dispersal may be a common feature of all ecological invasions [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This variation has been accommodated in phylogeographic analysis using ‘relaxed random walk’ models that allow dispersal rates to vary significantly among phylogeny branches [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Application of this approach to the West Nile virus invasion of North America that began in New York in 1999 revealed that the epidemic was driven by a heterogeneous mix of local transmission and rare, long-range viral movements that probably represent seasonal migration of birds, the natural hosts of the virus [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. An important consequence of such approaches is that each phylogeny branch becomes an independent observation of viral translocation, conditional on the data. This enables spatial epidemiological parameters, such as the epidemic diffusion coefficient and wavefront velocity, to be readily estimated from viral genome sequences alone [
