<p>Recent modelling work indicates that pathogen diffusion becomes highly regular when measured against a so-called ‘effective distance’ along the relevant mobility or transport network [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Conceptually, this requires translating from variable rates of spread through a space defined by geographical distances, to regular diffusion through a space defined by effective distances. The former process is already accommodated by phylogeographic analysis [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] so implementation of the latter should be possible. This work suggests that empirically derived networks of contacts among hosts may constitute a third common frame of reference by which genetic and epidemiological data can be unified, supplementing the temporal and spatial dimensions that are currently used [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In future, the concept of effective distances could be extended to epizootic or vector-borne pathogens, for which landscape heterogeneity is more important than human contact networks. Previous work has already shown the possibility of defining ‘climatic distances' that account for differences among locations and seasons in their suitability for vector-borne disease transmission [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Integrating genetic data in this context will require a melding of phylogeographic and GIS techniques [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] in order to detect more subtle deviations from distance-dependent movement than those imposed by human transportation networks.
