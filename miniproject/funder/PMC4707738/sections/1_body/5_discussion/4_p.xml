<p>A significant obstacle to further progress is the availability and expense of some of the most powerful and relevant datasets. For air travel, originâ€“destination data derived from air ticket sales are available, but are highly expensive for research purposes, and their use may require legal and confidentiality agreements, resulting in a reliance on modelled datasets [

Although virus genetic data are usually deposited in publicly accessible databases such as GenBank upon publication of the paper that report them, the delay between sequence generation and publication may prevent the opportunity to undertake real-time molecular epidemiology during an outbreak. Further, genetic data obtained by surveillance efforts may be reported without essential epidemiological information, such as the date and location of sampling, or may never be published at all, for reasons of commerce, politics or privacy. The success of GISAID (

We strongly support the recent call for an international and inter-disciplinary consensus towards the open sharing and release of pathogen genetic information during epidemics [
