<p>New outbreaks of infectious disease, especially those caused by viruses, are a common phenomenon in the twenty-first century, and future trends in global mobility and trade seem likely to maintain or even accelerate their rate of appearance. Techniques and data to describe, explain and predict such occurrences can help to measure and mitigate the risks from novel and re-emerging pathogens. Statistical and mathematical models that integrate spatially explicit data on pathogen evolution with information on human movement and environmental variability have much to contribute to epidemic management, as well as deepening our understanding of fundamental evolutionary and ecological processes.</p>
