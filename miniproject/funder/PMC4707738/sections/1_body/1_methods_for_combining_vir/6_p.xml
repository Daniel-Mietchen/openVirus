<p>Several of the most popular phylogeographic methods for reconstructing epidemic spatial spread from genetic data (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) treat the location information assigned to each sequence as a discrete or continuous trait, and represent movement as change in that trait along sampled lineages, using stochastic models that are uncoupled from the processes of molecular evolution. The focus is therefore on the locations and ages of sampled lineages rather than on underlying population genetic processes of selection, genetic drift and migration, an approach that may be viewed philosophically as either a strength or a weakness, depending on one's perspective and interests [

 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This ‘trait evolution’ approach to phylogeography facilitates the inference of the locations of common ancestors in an epidemic and can be practically applied to rapidly evolving pathogens with complex spatial dynamics [
