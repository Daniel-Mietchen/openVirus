<p>Several trends in technology and data availability over the last decade have spurred innovation in this area. The advent of cheap, mobile global positioning systems and their widespread adoption in disease surveys has revolutionized the geospatial recording and analysis of infectious disease incidence and prevalence, especially when combined with geographical information systems (GIS) and pervasive electronic communication [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Further, a wide range of data (e.g. high-resolution satellite images) that depict environmental, infrastructural and socio-economic variables that may determine disease dynamics are now available. Statistical models have been developed to exploit the relationships between these variables and geo-located disease data, and to predict the spatial distribution of infectious diseases (e.g. [

 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that typically generate whole viral genomes rather than sub-genomic sequence fragments. Reported pathogen genomes are now more likely to be annotated with locations and dates of sampling, and for the most intensively studied species, such as HIV-1 and influenza, more than 100 000 virus sequences are publicly available.
