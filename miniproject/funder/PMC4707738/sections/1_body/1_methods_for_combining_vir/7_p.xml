<p>However, it is not always fully recognized that the estimated locations of ancestors can be highly uncertain, particularly those that are only distantly related to the sampled cases. Consequently, viral phylogeography is far more informative when applied to datasets that contain genetic sequences sampled sequentially through time, and which include genomes situated close to the root of the sample phylogeny. A second under-appreciated aspect of phylogeographic analysis is the importance of sample composition [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although a highly detailed spatio-temporal record may not be required to address every important question about pathogen spread, the accuracy with which gene sequences can capture key patterns will depend on the representativeness of sampling. If samples from key locations or regions are absent or rare then virus movement will be underestimated and the inferred locations of ancestors may be biased towards locations that are over-represented in the sample. As a result, phylogeographic results should be interpreted carefully, combined with other sources of epidemiological information and statistically validated whenever possible.
