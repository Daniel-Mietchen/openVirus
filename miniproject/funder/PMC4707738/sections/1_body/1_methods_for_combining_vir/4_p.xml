<p>The term ‘phylogeography’ is commonly applied to studies that use evolutionary trees to combine genetic data with spatial information [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other statistical methods for examining the spatial distribution of genetic variation do not explicitly use phylogenies and are better described as ‘spatial genetics' (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), while some genealogical approaches to population genetics combine aspects of both approaches (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Phylogenetic methods are commonly applied to emerging viral epidemics, partly because the rapid evolution of such pathogens can create sufficient genetic variation for analysis at the level of individual infections, even during the early stages of an outbreak, and also because alternative population genetic approaches typically assume that mutation is negligible or that the processes of genetic drift and migration are in equilibrium [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The latter were developed with animal or plant populations in mind and may not adequately represent the idiosyncratic and dynamic dispersal histories that characterize ecological invasions [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further, a single evolutionary tree (with associated estimation uncertainty) is often sufficient to represent the shared ancestry of all sites in a RNA virus sequence, owing to the absence or low rate of recombination within them.
