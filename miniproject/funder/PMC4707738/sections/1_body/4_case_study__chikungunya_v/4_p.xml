<p>Multiple genetic and ecological factors are thought to have contributed to the global emergence of CHIKV. The two mosquito species principally responsible for human CHIKV transmission are 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The collapse of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> elimination efforts in the Americas [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and growing urbanization in the tropics and sub-tropics has provided suitable habitats for this primary vector. Additionally, the globalization of trade in used tyres during the 1980s and 1990s enabled the secondary vector 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to expand its range from southeast Asia to large parts of the rest of the world [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Further, greater human travel between Africa, Asia and the Americas has increased interchange between locations where 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are prevalent, including at times of the year when the vectors are highly active in both places [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
