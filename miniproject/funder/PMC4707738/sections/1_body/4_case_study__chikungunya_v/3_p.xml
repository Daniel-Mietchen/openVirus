<p>The worldwide expansion of CHIKV has left a clear footprint in the genomic diversity of the virus, despite the fact that its rate of molecular evolution is somewhat slower than that of viruses like influenza and HIV [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20142878F2">figure 2</xref>) shows that two virus lineages (the ‘Asian genotype’ and the ‘Indian Ocean lineage’) were responsible for the recent expansion of its geographical range. The Asian genotype, first detected in India in the 1960s, is the strain that has recently emerged in the Caribbean and appears to have reached there via southeast Asia and Micronesia. By contrast, the Indian Ocean lineage was responsible for the significant epidemics in south Asia from 2005 onwards (
