<p>In addition to these ecological factors, there is strong evidence that, as the geographical range of CHIKV expanded, the virus evolved and adapted to local variation in the distribution of vector species. Specifically, a single amino acid change (A226V) in the viral E1 protein has been shown to increase transmission and infectivity in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. This mutation arose multiple times within the Indian Ocean lineage, usually in locations where 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was the sole or dominant vector species [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and thus represents a remarkable example of convergent molecular evolution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20142878F2">figureÂ 2</xref>). Fortunately, the Asian lineage that has recently emerged in the Americas has, to date, shown no propensity to evolve mutations that elevate transmissibility in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes.
