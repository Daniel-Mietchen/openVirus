<p>CHIKV is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that, while rarely fatal, causes a debilitating fever and sometimes persistent arthralgia, so is of some public health concern. In the 50 years that followed the virus's discovery in 1952 in Tanzania, sporadic outbreaks were reported in central, west and east Africa, and in south and southeast Asia [

Starting from east Africa in 2004, CHIKV epidemics were reported increasingly eastwards, first on Indian Ocean islands (Comoros, Reunion, Seychelles and Mauritius) in 2005–2006, then in India and Sri Lanka in 2006–2007 [

More than 750 000 suspected cases in the Americas have been reported since the detection of CHIKV on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin in December 2013, and several mathematical models that use data on human mobility and vector distributions have already been developed to predict further spread of the virus in the Americas (e.g. [
