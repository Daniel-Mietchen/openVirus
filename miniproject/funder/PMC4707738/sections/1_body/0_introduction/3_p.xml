<p>The increasing connectivity of our world affects transmission in many ways. Greater mobility, through business travel, tourism and labour movement, leads to more pathogen introductions, while social and ecological changes in recipient locations may raise the likelihood that introductions will become entrenched rather than die out. The establishment of new travel routes between previously unconnected locations also contributes. For example, direct air travel between South America, Africa and southeast Asia now links tropical continental regions, where infectious disease burdens are higher and year-round transmission is more common. Further, the increasing volume of global trade through shipping and air freight can spread contaminated goods or introduce disease vectors such as mosquitoes to new locations through accidental carriage (e.g. [
