<p>In addition to generating information essential for vaccine design, the global surveillance of influenza viruses has resulted in an unparalleled collection of virus genome sequences sampled through space and time, providing an opportunity to explore the processes that underpin the global dynamics of this important pathogen [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although human influenza is primarily transmitted in household and community settings, epidemics of IAVs in temperate climates are seasonal and experience strong genetic bottlenecks, implying that transmission in these locations is typically not sustained and that epidemics are re-established by the importation of viral lineages from populations in which transmission is more persistent [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This so-called ‘source–sink’ model of global IAV circulation has been investigated in detail for the H3N2 subtype of IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20142878F1">figure 1</xref>), a dominant strain of human influenza since its emergence in 1968. Various studies have used phylogeographic and population genetic methods to infer the location through time of the ‘source’ population of H3N2 influenza, and most conclude that it resides primarily in east or southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20142878F1">figure 1</xref>). However, temperate regions, particularly the USA, may also contribute as a source [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and there is evidence for viral gene flow into Asia from elsewhere [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], suggesting that the migration dynamics of H3N2 influenza are more complex than those represented by a simple source–sink model. Differences among these studies may however be attributable to variation in analysis methodology and sequence sampling strategy; seasonal fluctuations in sampling and the comparative under-sampling of IAV from south Asia, Africa and Latin America means that conclusions should be interpreted carefully [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, all analyses implicate global mobility as a driver of worldwide human influenza virus dispersal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20142878F1">figure 1</xref>); air passenger flux is a considerably better predictor of the movement of IAV lineages among locations than geographical distance [
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20142878C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Thus, the spatial genetics of human influenza, and possibly of other pathogens, may be better characterized by ‘proximity by mobility’ than by the traditional notion of ‘isolation by distance’.
