<p>The spatial dynamics of influenza are also critical in assessing the evolution of anti-viral drug resistance. The global cycling of IAV lineages and low levels of local persistence mean that resistance mutations can spread worldwide, and can quickly erode any association at the local level between rates of drug usage and viral resistance. Recent examples of anti-viral drug resistance evolution include the rapid spread in oseltamivir resistance in seasonal H1N1 influenza from 2007 to 2009 and the global rise of adamantane-resistant H3N2 influenza during 2003–2006. An investigation of the former that used a stochastic model of international air travel concluded that the oseltamivir-resistant strain rose to global dominance because it exhibited a transmission advantage in untreated hosts, probably conferred by genetic hitchhiking [
