<p>Local persistence of transmission chains also raises questions about the mobility processes that drive IAV spread at sub-national scales. Mathematical analyses of mortality and physician visit statistics have suggested different drivers for the spread of seasonal [

However, it is possible that sub-genomic influenza haemagglutinin gene sequences do not contain sufficient information to answer fine-scaled questions about viral dispersal over very short time scales. Instead, complete viral genome sequences will probably be needed to achieve the phylogeographic resolution required.
