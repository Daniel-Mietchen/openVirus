 <caption>
  <p>The evolution and global spread of CHIKV. On the left is a phylogeny of CHIKV, estimated from whole genomes of viruses sampled from the 1960s to the present day. Major CHIKV lineages are denoted (the west Africa genotype is not shown). The first vertical bar on the right indicates the amino acid present at position 226 in the CHIKV E1 protein (dark grey, valine; light grey, alanine). A change to valine at this site confers increased transmissibility of the virus in 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (see main text). The second vertical bar indicates the geographical location of the viruses (green, south Asia; blue, southeast Asia or China; orange, east Africa or Indian Ocean islands; purple, sub-Saharan Africa; red, Americas; grey, other locations). For returning travellers, the location of infection (not the location of detection) is shown. An arrow indicates the strain that caused an outbreak in Italy in 2007 (see main text). A red box indicates the lineage responsible for the recent emergence of CHIKV in the Americas.
