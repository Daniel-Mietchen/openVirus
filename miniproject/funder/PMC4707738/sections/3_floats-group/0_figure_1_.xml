   <italic>a</italic>) The modular structure of global air travel. Airports (small dots) can be grouped into 14 communities (colours; inset) such that there is high connectivity within communities but low connectivity among them (hence French Guiana belongs to the European, not South American, community). Larger circles indicate the approximate geographical centre of each community. (
   <italic>b</italic>) A phylogeny of the H3N2 subtype of human IAV, estimated from more than 1000 virus haemagglutinin gene sequences that were sampled worldwide between 2002 and 2007. A molecular clock model was used, hence phylogeny branches represent time (time scale shown below the tree). The thickness of each branch is proportional to its number of descendent tips (up to a maximum thickness) and indicates lineage persistence. Each phylogeny branch is coloured according to its most probable location, which was inferred using a phylogeographic model that takes into account the global air travel network. The thicker, uppermost lineage represents the most persistent lineage of H3N2 influenza, which, for most years, is estimated to be located in southeast or east Asia. Figure adapted from Lemey
