<p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the evolutionarily stable proportion of global (or local) infection is related to spatial heterogeneity. We model the evolution of the proportion of global and local infection in a spatially structured SIS model in which some sites are occupied by target cells and other sites are occupied by non-target cells on a lattice space. For simplicity, we assume that whether a site is occupied by a target cell or a non-target cell will never change. Although it may seem unrealistic to assume that an infected cell directly return to susceptible state (SIS model), this would be justified if a susceptible cell fills a blank immediately after an infected cell dies. The manner of target and non-target cell distribution over the lattice space was parameterized by the frequency of target cells and the pair frequency of target cells. We also assume viruses have an ability to establish persistent infection like human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) that have enough time for within-host evolution and thus adaptive dynamics can be applied. The dependence of evolutionary outcomes on parameters that denote spatial structure is the main focus of our research, which has not been clearly shown in previous studies. At first, the infection dynamics are modeled by pair approximation and the endemic condition for a virus with a certain proportion of global infection is calculated. Next, the evolutionarily stable strategy is obtained by an adaptive dynamics framework. Finally, we conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation and compare results with analytical results.</p>
