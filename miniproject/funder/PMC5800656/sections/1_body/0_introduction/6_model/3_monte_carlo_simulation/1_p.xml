<p>To confirm these analytical predictions, we also conducted Monte-Carlo simulations in a 100 Ã—100 lattice space with periodic boundary conditions. At first, two parameters 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CC</italic>
 </sub> are determined. Next, according to the parameters, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates the spatial structure as follows: 1) each site is made to be occupied by a target cell with probability 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub>, 2) exchange the states of two randomly chosen sites if current 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CC</italic>
 </sub> approaches to the goal by exchanging, 3) repeat step 2 until current 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CC</italic>
 </sub> becomes sufficiently close to the goal. For infectious dynamics of a single strain, each target cell changes its state in a short time interval with some probability that is expected by ordinary differential equations Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005952.e010">4</xref>). In the simulation of evolutionary dynamics, we also assume 101 different possible strains and each strain can change by mutation to a strain of adjacent 
 <italic>G</italic> value at a certain rate. Other infectious dynamics, occurrence of new infection and transition from infected to susceptible, is similar to the case of a single strain.
