<p>Viruses have evolved various mechanisms to spread within a host body and between hosts. There are two modes for viral spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles (virions) from the infected cells into the extracellular medium, and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell. The mode of viral spreading depends on the type of virus, their target cells and tissues. For example, viruses that lyse the host cell rely on the release of virions as the only way of spreading. In contrast, viruses that exit host cells by budding or some forms of exocytosis have a potential to spread directly from cell to cell. Conceptually the simplest mechanism of cell-to-cell spread is the fusion of infected and uninfected cells. To enter into a host cell, some viruses have proteins that cause membrane fusion, and these fusion proteins are expressed on the cell surface after viral replication is initiated. Thus, fusion proteins on the infected cell may cause membrane fusion to the adjacent uninfected cell, resulting in a single giant cell (syncytium). For instance, vaccinia virus forms two different forms specific to each mode: mature virus released after lysis of infected cells, and double membrane-enveloped extracellular virus that remains associated with the producer cell surface and spreads by cell-to-cell [
