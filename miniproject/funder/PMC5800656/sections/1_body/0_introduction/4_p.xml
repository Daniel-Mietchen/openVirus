<p>In the ecological context, our focus is interpreted as the evolution of short- vs. long-range dispersal. Harada [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] modeled population dynamics in a lattice-structured habitat and assumed a linear trade-off between global and local dispersal. In this model, the assumption that vacant sites are always available also causes the similar limitation as in Kamo and Boots [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hiebeler [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] assumed the mixture of suitable and unsuitable habitats in the lattice space in which individuals reproduce globally and locally. In these works, pairwise invasibility was examined by Monte-Carlo simulation but the evolution of the proportion of global reproduction along an adaptive dynamics framework was not discussed.
