<p>Both cell-free and cell-to-cell modes of viral spread have their own advantages and disadvantages [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since virions are much smaller and more resistant to environmental change than infected cells, they can disperse farther from the infected cell and even outside the infected host. However, cell-free infection takes a longer time for the virus to encounter a target cell and to engage attachment and entry receptors because the new infection event depends on diffusion and kinetic processes. This is particularly disadvantageous for viruses that bind to receptors that have low expression on host cells and/or those that must engage multiple receptors in order to enter the cell. Immunological barriers to free virions such as antibodies, complement, defensins and macrophages are also factors that discourage cell-free mode. In contrast, viruses that use cell-to-cell infection can avoid many of such obstacles. Another advantage of cell-to-cell infection is the efficiency of new infections: once an infection has occurred, the cell-to-cell mode of viral spread eliminates the rate-limiting step of diffusion. The disadvantage of cell-to-cell infection is a locality of new infection: as infections progress, "self-shading" occurs whereby host cells near infected cells decrease. Cell-mediated immunity, mainly caused by killer T cells, also has a large impact to cell-to-cell infection because infected cells are clustered.
