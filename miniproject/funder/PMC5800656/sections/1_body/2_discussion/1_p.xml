<p>In this paper, we investigated the effect of population structure on an evolutionarily stable proportion of global infection. Before considering the effect, we have obtained the endemic condition of a virus strain in the SIS model on a lattice space using pair approximation. For the extreme cases (completely global or completely local strain), the endemic condition is consistent with previous studies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For the intermediate global infection rate, the condition shows that the strain using both global and local infection can survive with the parameter sets with which the extreme strains cannot. For example, when the global density of target cells is too low to persist for completely global infection, high degree of clustering of target cells promotes the survival of a strain using local infection.
