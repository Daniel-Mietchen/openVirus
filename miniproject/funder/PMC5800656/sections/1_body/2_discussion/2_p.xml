<p>In fact, the invasibility analysis by pair approximation and the Monte-Carlo simulation show that evolutionarily stable strategies or evolutionary outcomes are strongly dependent on the global density of target cells and their degree of clustering. As target cells become aggregated, higher proportion of local infection is selected. This tendency can be seen in the negative slopes in the relationship between ESS 
 <italic>G</italic> and the spatial aggregation measure

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g002">Fig 2</xref>. This effect seems stronger at high global density of target cells because the slope of high 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>

 </sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). When the local density of target cells is high, spread through local infection is easier for finding the next susceptible cell compared to global infection. Thus, a virus that uses local infection may predominantly be efficient in spreading and that trait is selected. However, there is also a difference between invasibilty analysis and simulation, whereby the former predicts the completely local strain can be ESS in some range but the latter does not. This discrepancy may be attributed to the limitation of pair approximation. In the simulation of evolutionary dynamics, we can generate different spatial structures that have the same first and second moment (global and pair densities) but have different higher order moments. In spite of these variations in spatial structure, the evolutionary outcomes were very similar (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g002">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g004">4</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that global and pair densities are enough to explain outcome of evolution of global or local infection, and that parameters which describe higher order configuration do not affect results.
