<p>In a host body, it is rare that cells distribute like two-dimensional cell culture systems except for epithelia. Epithelial cells form a continuous sheet and they may be different in susceptibility because of surface molecule expression, response to interferons and other immune cell activities. Therefore, epithelia can be a place where evolution of cell-to-cell infection can occur, and in fact, some viruses are known to have an ability for cell-to-cell infection in epithelia like MVs [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). In contrast, influenza viruses can also infect epithelial cells but the evolution of local infection is not known. The reason may be the short length of infection period; influenza infection period can be as short as a week but some viruses like HIV survive in the host body for a long time. Such persistent viruses may have sufficient time for the within-host evolution and the adaptive dynamics framework can be applied. Since MVs also have an ability to establish persistent infection, these viruses may also have a chance to evolve efficient cell-to-cell infection in the host body.
