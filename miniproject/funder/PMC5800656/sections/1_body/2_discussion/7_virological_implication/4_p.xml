<p>Our model may explain the emergence of mutant MVs that are isolated from patients of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). These viruses have mutations that provide high ability of cell fusion (i.e. high level of local infection) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Since MVs can spread in a cell-to-cell manner between epithelial cells, epithelia is a candidate place in which the evolution of local infection occurs. Another possibility is lymph nodes because the main target cell of MVs is SLAM (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, also known as CD150) expressing immune cells such as T and B cells etc. [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As discussed in the case of HIV, concentrating target cells in the lymph nodes satisfies the condition under which local infection is selected. Consequently, MVs are prone to evolve local infection in a host body and to gain the ability to infect cells of central nervous system but how MVs reach the central nervous system remains unknown.
