<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the mode of viral spread, global or local infection, may undergo adaptive evolutionary change 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the future, we can consider more realistic situation such as evolutionary dynamics in three-dimensional space or the repulsion of superinfecting virions that attenuates self-shading effect [
