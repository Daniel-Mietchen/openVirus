<p>Our model suggests that spatial structure has an important role, while it is not commonly considered in the field of virology. In 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental cases, two-dimensional cell culture is commonly used and this condition is similar to our model. Hence, there is a possibility that the evolution of global and local infection can occur. In an example of culture of measles viruses (MVs), a higher level of local infection was selected for in continuing passages [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], indicating the emergence of mutant viruses with a high ability to induce membrane fusion 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. When the evolution of global or local infection occur, other viral traits like virulence will evolve as shown in Boots and Sasaki [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They analytically showed that a lower virulence is predicted as infection becomes more local. The importance of local infection in the evolution of influenza viruses is shown experimentally [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]: cell-to-cell transmission promotes a faster expansion of the diversity of virus quasispecies and may facilitate viral evolution and adaptation when influenza virusesâ€™ neuraminidases are inhibited and virus release from infected cells is suppressed [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, we emphasize the relationship between the spatial distribution of target cells and the evolution of viral infection mode when studying 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infectious dynamics. If we manipulate cell density and the efficiency of viral transmission by antibodies, viruses that have favorable level of global and local infection may be obtained.
