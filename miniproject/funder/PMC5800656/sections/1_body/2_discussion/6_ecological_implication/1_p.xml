<p>From an ecological point of view, our model can be applied for considering the evolution of long and short dispersal. Target cells correspond to habitats for animals or plants, with S sites and I sites corresponding to unoccupied and occupied sites, and non-target cells representing unsuitable sites to settle. According to the endemic condition (6), the persistence of a species with some local colonization rate depends on the spatial structure. Our results, if applied to a conservation biological setting, suggest that, even if we conserve the abundance of habitats for an endangered species, extinction might occur only due to the change in spatial arrangement of habitats. In terms of the evolution of dispersal distance, previous studies add other settings such as a trade-off between survivability and dispersal range [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], kin selection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the existence of pests [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or the disturbance structure [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the effect of spatial structure per se has not been clarified yet. We therefore checked how spatial structure affects the evolution of shot and long dispersal. Our results suggest that the ESS proportion of short dispersal depends not only on the degree of clustering but also on the density of habitats per se. Short dispersal is selected when habitats are clustered, and this tendency is strong when the abundance of habitats is high.
