<p>Our model predicts the evolutionarily stable dispersal strategy only but some previous models suggest evolutional branching of dispersal rate [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or evolutionary bistability in which the evolutionary outcome differs in initial state [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In general, branching or bistability may occur when the fitness of a phenotype depends on the frequencies of other existing phenotypes and possible phenotypes have a proper trade-off [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005952.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In our model, there is a trade-off between global and local infection. The reason why we only observe ESS is that the linear trade-off is not suitable for causing evolutionary branching or bistability. In fact, if we assume nonlinear trade-off between global and local infection is assumed, we can observe the evolutionary bistability (
