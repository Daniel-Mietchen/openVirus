<p>To check whether these results are specific to our method of generating a spatial structure, we also conducted the same evolutionary simulations on the several different deterministically generated structures each having the same global and pair densities (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the comparison of results between randomly and deterministically generated structures. These results suggest the robustness of our results on the evolution of local and global infections based on the randomly generated spatial configurations for given singlet and doublet densities,
