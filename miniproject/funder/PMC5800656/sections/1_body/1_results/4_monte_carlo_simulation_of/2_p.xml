<p>The difference between the results from pair approximation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>) and those from simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005952.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>) is that the mean value of 
 <italic>G</italic> in the simulations does not converge to extreme values (the completely global or the completely local). This may be because the population is always polymorphic as a result of mutations. In addition, there are two other reasons for the region in which the completely local is the ESS according to the pair approximation. The first reason is the effect of finite population size. Especially, since the completely local strain spreads only in a contiguous cluster, the number of available hosts is smaller than for other strains. Therefore, diffusing to other clusters becomes adaptive. The second one is the limitation of pair approximation. In this approximation, we approximate 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>σ</italic>/
  <italic>σ</italic>′
  <italic>σ</italic>″
 </sub> the conditional probability that a randomly chosen nearest of a 
 <italic>σ</italic>'
 <italic>σ</italic>'' pair has a 
 <italic>σ</italic> site by 
 <italic>q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>σ</italic>/
  <italic>σ</italic>′
 </sub> the conditional probability that a randomly chosen nearest neighbor of 
 <italic>σ</italic>' site is a 
 <italic>σ</italic> site. When viruses are too biased toward local infection, infected cells tend to form a large cluster and the approximation does not work well. For these reasons, there is a discrepancy between pair approximation and simulation.
