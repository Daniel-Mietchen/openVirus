<p>In the above sections, we assumed a linear trade-off, that is, the proportion of local infection decreases at the same amount as the proportion of global infection 
 <italic>G</italic> is increased. However, this should not be always the case in reality. When the local infection decreases in proportion to 
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sup>0.5</sup>, the result is quite different (
