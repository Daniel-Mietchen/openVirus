 <p>Viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and measles virus can spread through physical contact between infected and susceptible cells (cell-to-cell infection), as well as normal cell-free infection through virions. Some experimental evidences support the possibility that high ability of cell-to-cell infection is selected in the host. Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, it is important to reveal what condition favors high ability of cell-to-cell infection. Here we address what level of cell-to-cell infection is selected in different target cell distributions. Analysis of ordinary differential equations that keep track of dynamics for spatial configuration of infected cells and the Monte-Carlo simulations show that higher proportion of local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. The selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se. Our results suggest viruses have more chances to evolve the ability of local infection in a host body than previously thought. In particular, this may explain the emergence of measles virus strains that gained the ability to infect the central nervous system.</p>
