<p>Our study comes to a different conclusion than a recent study that argued that the acute-stage transmission rate is not a determinant of the long-run effectiveness of TasP [

 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We found that increased acute-stage contagiousness greatly reduced the effectiveness of TasP over a 50-year intervention period. In fact, the preference for PrEP in scenarios with very high acute-stage contagiousness are due to the reduced effectiveness of TasP rather than increased effectiveness of PrEP. This discrepancy is likely due to the fact we assume that the infection is endemic at the start of the intervention. When the endemic risk is fixed as it is in our model, increases in the acute-stage contagiousness must be offset by a reduction in the overall sexual activity level, however these changes nearly balance each other out (
