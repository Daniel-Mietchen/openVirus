<p>We believe that modeling interventions for decision support is a local endeavor that requires explicit modeling of actual interventions. Understanding how population and individual-level parameters change the effects of interventions over time is difficult. However, layering on the economic and programmatic factors that are required to fully specify an intervention model makes intuitive analysis a near impossibility. We have demonstrated how methods from control theory can be applied to practical epidemiologic questions focused on intervention design and decisions support.</p>
