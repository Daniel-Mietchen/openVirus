<p>We found that qualitative aspects of the DOCP (being either TasP-only, PrEP-only, or a combination of TasP and PrEP) were largely determined by the duration of PrEP administration. Budget level had no influence qualitatively, though, unsurprisingly, higher budget levels resulted in greater incidence reductions. Although both of these results are not surprising per se, they illustrate that programmatic factors such as duration of PrEP administration can strongly influence the effectiveness of intervention strategies. The importance of this observation is amplified by the fact that DOCPs were found to be qualitatively robust to a wide range of model formulations across the behavioral and biological spectrum. These behavioral and biological factors have been the focus of many studies of the transmission dynamics of HIV and prevention effectiveness; however, we hypothesize that, when addressing the question of how to optimally allocate limited resources, programmatic and cost-related variables may be as or more important as the behavioral characteristics of different populations. Future studies should focus on disentangling these effects in the context of ongoing intervention efforts.</p>
