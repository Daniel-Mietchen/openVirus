<p>We showed that our algorithms are capable of finding complex DOCPs (involving allocation of multiple intervention resources over time) in a high dimensional parameter spaceâ€”the main analyses involved optimizing over 150-dimensional space of highly co-dependent parameters. Presently our algorithms are tailored to analyzing this specific model with TasP and PrEP controls, however, we are working to generalize our approach to a more general class of deterministic transmission models and interventions. Given the complexity of these problems the algorithms will require additional basic research and development before they can be thought of as a generalized method.</p>
