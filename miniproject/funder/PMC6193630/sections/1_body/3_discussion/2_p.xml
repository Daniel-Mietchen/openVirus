<p>DOCPs were also strongly influenced by the 
 <italic>analytic horizon</italic>, in other words, how far into the future do we consider when we predict the effects of the current intervention. Initially we noticed that in most scenarios the DOCP shifted from homogeneous TasP to heterogeneous PrEP and TasP near the end of the study period regardless of the length of the study period. For example, if optimizing over a 25-year period, the DOCP would shift to PrEP in years 20–25. However, with the same parameterization optimizing over a 50-year period, the shift to PrEP would occur in years 45–50. This effect turned out to be due to the changing analytic horizon. When the algorithm searches for the DOCP over a 50-year window, the horizon in year 1 extends 49 years into the future, however by year 40, the horizon only extends 10 years into the future. That is, by definition, as you approach the end of the study period, the algorithm favors short-term solutions. We addressed this by optimizing over a longer period and discarding the end of the optimization (

 <italic>a priori</italic>. For example, if an institution believes that an efficacious and inexpensive vaccine will be released in 10 years, then perhaps current intervention strategies should only be optimized over this 10-year period, a relatively short horizon which would then favor interventions that are more effective in the short-term like PrEP.
