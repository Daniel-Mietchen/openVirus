<p>The allocation of limited resources between PrEP and TasP produces large differences in population effectiveness. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref> (left) shows the DOCP for the baseline scenario as a function of both the annual budget and the duration of PrEP. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref> (right) shows the proportional reduction in incidence in the baseline scenario under three dynamic control policies: the DOCP, TasP-only, and PrEP-only. The difference between the allocations that we considered (the DOCP, TasP-only, and PrEP-only) were generally large. For example, in the high budget scenario (5 million dollars per year) the difference in the optimal policies in terms of the number of cases prevented over the 50-year study period was 11,201 and 8,596 in the unlimited PrEP and 1-year PrEP scenarios respectively. However, when the DOCP was heterogeneous (i.e. involving both PrEP and TasP) the difference between the DOCP and the next best optimal homogenous control was generally much smaller. For example, the heterogeneous DOCP in the unlimited-PrEP, high-budget, scenario prevents only 562 more cases over the 50-year period than the only-PrEP allocation.
