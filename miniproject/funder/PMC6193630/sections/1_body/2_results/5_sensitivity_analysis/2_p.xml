<p>In contrast, when PrEP was assumed to be taken for the full duration of a high-risk behavioral episode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g005">Fig 5</xref>), we observed the qualitative aspect of the DOCP to be highly sensitive to the model formulation; this relationship holds regardless of the budget (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204741.s004">S4</xref> Figs). The “Static Behavior” panel in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g005">Fig 5</xref> illustrates an interesting DOCP that we only observe in this one case. Here the heterogeneous DOCP is unambiguously superior to either of the homogenous controls as it is equal or superior both in the short-term and long-term. This is likely due to the fact that in the static behavior setting, PrEP is assumed to be taken indefinitely due to the assumption of lifelong high-risk behavior. Thus, in this one setting, the dynamics of PrEP and TasP are qualitatively similar because both are assumed to be lifelong. Identifying scenarios and real populations where similar conditions exist may provide new prevention opportunities by simply rearranging the relative resource allocation between prevention modalities rather than increasing resources.
