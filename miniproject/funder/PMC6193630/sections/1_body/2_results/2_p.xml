<p>Homogeneous TasP or PrEP have different patterns of effectiveness over time. While TasP’s effectiveness is initially relatively low, it gradually increases in future years. In contrast, PrEP’s effectiveness rises rapidly, but soon after gradually declines; this is observed even when PrEP’s duration is unlimited. Because of its rapid rise in effectiveness, PrEP is almost always superior to TasP in the short term. However, because PrEP effectiveness eventually diminishes while TasP’s effectiveness is still increasing, this superiority is often temporary. This temporary superiority can persist for decades when PrEP is ultimately less effective than TasP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g003">Fig 3</xref> the “Only-PrEP” row shows that the number of high-risk susceptible increases faster than the number of people on PrEP after a PrEP-only program is initiated. Over time, the fraction of the high-risk susceptibles that are protected declines, leading to worse outcomes.
