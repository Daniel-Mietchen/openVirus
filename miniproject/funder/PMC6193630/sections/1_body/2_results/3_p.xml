<p>The annual number of persons enrolled into each intervention characterizes the DOCP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref>-left). In these baseline scenarios we find homogenous DOCPs—that is, the DOCP suggests allocation for only one control—in all but one situation. Where the DOCP is homogenous, PrEP duration determines which intervention is optimal. However, in the high budget, “Unlimited-PrEP” situation there is an interesting trade-off. An initial mixed investment in both TasP and PrEP moving to PrEP-only can temper some of diminishing effectiveness of a PrEP-only intervention by increasing the number of treated persons in the period where the effectiveness of PrEP starts to diminish. This is due to the fact that we implicitly model the potential diminishing effectiveness of fixed-budget interventions.
