<p>When either PrEP or TasP has a large effect on transmission dynamics, cost-per-enrollee changes, altering the number of people that can be enrolled given a fixed budget. When the PrEP-only control is most effective (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref>: “Unlimited PrEP” and “Medium Budget”) the intervention both decreases the number of possible enrollees by enrolling them on PrEP, but also increases the number of possible enrollees by blocking future transmissions from the persons on PrEP, in this case, these effects nearly balance out leading to constant enrollment. However, when TasP is most effective (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref>: “1Year PrEP” and “High Budget”) the intervention has the opposite effect, increasing the cost of future enrollment by reducing the intervention’s possible enrollees though both direct enrollment and blocking secondary transmissions leading to fewer people enrolled each year. Thus, if TasP-based intervention is chosen by policy makers, and steady enrollment numbers are desired, the annual budget must be increased yearly to offset the increased cost of enrollment.
