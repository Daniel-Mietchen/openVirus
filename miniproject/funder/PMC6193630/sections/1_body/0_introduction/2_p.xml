<p>Discovering optimal mixtures of intervention strategies has been identified as a key aspect of the program science paradigm for public health intervention [

 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As interventions are rolled out, they are funded at specific levels, thereby determining intervention coverage after accounting for intervention costs. Given two interventions, the relative funding level of each intervention (and therefore the resulting levels of each interventionâ€™s coverage) defines a specific control policy. When the control policy can change each year, the multi-year control policy is defined as the dynamic control policy. There are a very large number of potential dynamic control policies over a multi-year period, which makes finding optimal control policies challenging. We recently developed a computational framework for computing Dynamic Optimal Control Policies (DOCPs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that are defined as the year-to-year relative investment in alternative prevention strategies that minimize the number of incident cases over a specific period. Our method makes several important advances in numerical optimal control that we apply in this paper. First, we represent controls as year-to-year step-functions representing funding of a specific intervention, which allows the control to be flexible in response to changing dynamics. We also consider the joint space of the controls over the entire period of interest. For example, when we calculate the DOCP for 2 controls over a 50-year time frame, we optimize over the full 100-dimentional space (1 parameter for each control for each year). This allows us to take a very long view of optimal control while still accounting for both the effect of the control on the system dynamics and the possibility of external changes to the system. We show in this paper that our method can identify long-term trade-offs in different controls that would be impossible to identify in short-term analyses. Second, we model the costs of not only enrolling eligible individuals but also the cost of attempting to enroll people who are ineligible. By doing so, we naturally penalize interventions that are dependent on enrolling hard to identify people. Finally, our method obeys a strict, and not necessarily constant, budget in each year.
