<p>The methods we have developed and employed in this paper are based on the mathematics of control theory that has been used to address epidemiological resource allocation problems since the 1970s [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, much of the research applying control theory to epidemiologic problems has focused on purely theoretical concerns [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], calculated the optimal allocation strategy for very general settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or assumed a strong a priori form to the control [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies where the underlying model and choice of parameters were tailored to a specific setting [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were less frequent than general studies. Our long-term goal is to provide a pragmatic and rationale bridge between control theoretic methods and infectious disease policy.
