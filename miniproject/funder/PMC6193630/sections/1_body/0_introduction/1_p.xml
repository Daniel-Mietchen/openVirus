<p>Infectious disease intervention effects play out across multiple scales: they protect a person from transmitting or becoming infected at the individual-level, which has population-level effects by decreasing the overall force of infection as a result of these individual-effects (i.e., herd immunity). Predicting the population-level effectiveness of an intervention is difficult because population-level effects 1) are heterogeneous between populations, and 2) are heterogeneous within populations over time. While individual-level effects can be measured in appropriate animal models and carefully designed trials [

For example, a hypothetical Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) drug with 100% efficacy at clearing infection from an individual may not be feasible due to prohibitive cost or availability. The joint non-linear dynamics of both transmission and intervention coupled to budgetary and programmatic factors produce complex patters of intervention effectiveness both within and between populations.
