<p>We applied our method to a mathematical model of HIV transmission in a hypothetical population of men who have sex with men (MSM) considering deviations from a baseline model along five axes representing different aspects of transmission dynamics. We consider variable budget levels and alternative policy restrictions. We consider two interventions which we refer to as controls: a contagiousness control parameterized to have costs similar to a Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) approach and a susceptibility control parameterized to have costs similar to a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).We found that qualitative aspects of DOCPs are often robust to a range of modeling assumptions and that the optimal allocation of resources is often determined by assumptions about the deployment of the intervention rather than the biological and behavioral properties of the transmission system alone.</p>
