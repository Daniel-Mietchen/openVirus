 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> is the rate that acutely infected persons become chronic infected, 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub> is the rate that chronically infected persons are removed due to AIDS, 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> is the per-act probability of transmission with an acute infected person, 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub> is the per-act probability of transmission with a chronic infected person, 
 <italic>π</italic> is the probability that a contact occurs at the preferred mixing site, 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub> is the contact rate of high-risk persons, 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>L</italic>
 </sub> is the contact rate of low-risk persons, x is the rate at which the susceptibility control fails, y is the rate at which the infectiousness control fails, 
 <italic>μ</italic> is the general removal rate, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub> is the rate that high-risk persons become low-risk, and 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>L</italic>
 </sub> is the rate that low-risk persons become high-risk.
