<p>We use the terms 
 <italic>study period</italic>, 
 <italic>analytic horizon</italic>, and 
 <italic>step size</italic> to reflect specific concepts defined here for clarity. We define study period as the period of time over which the DOCP will be reported. We define analytic horizon as the period over which the DOCP will be calculated. The analytic horizon must by definition be longer than or equal to the study period. When the analytic horizon is not much longer than the study period, artifacts may arise as the algorithm becomes “shortsighted”. For example, if one control is very effective in the short-term but ineffective in the long-term, it might be preferred as the end of the analytic horizon is approached. This artifact can be avoided by having an analytic period much longer than the study period. We define step size as the time between steps in the step function; the control policy is constant within a given step.
