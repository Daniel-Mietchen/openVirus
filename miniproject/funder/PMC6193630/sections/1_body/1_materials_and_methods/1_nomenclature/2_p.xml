<p>In the analyses that we report in this paper, the study period is 50 years, the analytic horizon is 70 years, and the step size is 1 year. We selected the analytic horizon such that we believe it is unlikely that we have any artifacts caused by shortsightedness; at no point is the algorithm calculating the DOCP without looking at least 20 years into the future. We selected a study period of one year to balance the temporal resolution of the control with the basic reality that policies cannot be changed instantaneously.</p>
