<p>Finally, to define the cost of attempting to enroll someone we need to define the 18 possible combinations of the 2 interventions and the 9 possible states that a person can be in. To account for each possibility we break each case down into the associated costs for each encounter as a sum of the structural costs and the specific costs of laboratory tests for each case. We assume that there is a general structural cost of setting up the interview that applies to all encounters, A = 267 [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and specific costs associated with a positive rapid test, L1P = 92 [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; a negative rapid test, L1N = 21[
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; a positive immunoassay, L2P = 69[
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; and a negative immunoassay, L2N = 10 [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> gives the values of the per enrollment costs and the assumptions that we used in obtaining those numbers. All costs were adjusted to 2010 USD values; the structural costs were assumed to follow general inflation while the medical costs increased by the medical inflation index.
