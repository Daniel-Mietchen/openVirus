<p>We model two interventions that have either contagiousness or susceptibility effects. The contagiousness intervention costs are parameterized to emulate Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) and the susceptibility intervention costs are parameterized to emulate Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). We assumed that intervention enrollment occurs at a venue that is enriched for high-risk individuals (4-fold increased probability of finding high-risk individuals by random chance compared to the general population). Individuals are selected at random and tested for HIV infection. High-risk susceptibles are eligible for PrEP and infected but unware individuals are eligible for TasP. The intervention model accounts for both the probability distribution of states in the high-risk venue and the differential costs of attempting to enroll different people in each intervention. We assumed that all at-risk persons are potentially enrollable, no one refuses to be tested or treated, and individuals are fully compliant once enrolled. We considered two durations of PrEP administration: either 1 year (“1-Year PrEP”) or for the duration of the high-risk period (“Unlimited PrEP”). At the end of a high-risk interval we assumed that PrEP is discontinued.</p>
