<p>We previously published numerical algorithms for finding DOCPs using this model as an example [
 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, the optimal control policies were computed by using the orthogonal collocation method. This approach consists of parametrizing both the controls and the system trajectory and then determining the missing values of parameters by solving a large system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Along with systemâ€™s equations, the constraints are described by using the introduced parametrization. The optimal control problem is thus formulated as a large-scale nonlinear optimization problem which is solved using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver. Code implementing these algorithms was written in Matlab [
