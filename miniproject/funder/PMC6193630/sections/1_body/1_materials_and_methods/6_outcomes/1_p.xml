<p>As outcomes, we have summarized the DOCP for each scenario as the number enrolled into each intervention program from year to year; that is, we plot the integral of the flow from the target states to the protected or treated states due to the intervention rather, which is more interpretable than the raw control. We have also illustrated the annual proportional reduction in HIV incidence that results from the DOCP compared to no intervention, as well the reduction that occurs when only a single control policy is funded for the entire course. Note that in both the single-control and DOCP cases, the optimal control that reduces the cumulative incidence over the analytic horizon is computed. Besides cumulative incidence, we have also calculated the approximate proportion of transmissions from acutely infected individuals pre-intervention,
