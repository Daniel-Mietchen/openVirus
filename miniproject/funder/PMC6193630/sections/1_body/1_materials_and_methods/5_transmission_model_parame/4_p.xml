<p>The second set, “acute contagiousness”, allows for the difference in the relative contagiousness of the initial acute stage of infection, which is both difficult to estimate and contentious [

 <xref rid="pone.0204741.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This factor matters because TasP effectiveness ought to decrease if people are diagnosed only in the chronic phase (i.e. TasP cannot prevent infections from acutely infected person) with increasing acute-stage contagiousness. Acute-stage contagiousness is also likely to be variable between populations due to biological synergy from the coincidence of other STIs [
