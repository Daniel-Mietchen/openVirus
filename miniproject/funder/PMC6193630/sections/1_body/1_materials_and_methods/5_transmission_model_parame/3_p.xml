<p>The first set, “behavior”, allows for a variable frequency of high-risk episodes that a person will experience in their lifetime, which is known to be a strong determinant of HIV transmission dynamics [

The “static” case assumed that risk-behavior is constant while the “volatile” case assumed that switching between high and low-risk phases was faster than in the baseline model. The static case might correspond to a population where a stable subset of the population has some high-risk behavior (e.g. highly sexually active people), while the volatile case might correspond to a population where individuals engage in periodic high-risk behavior (e.g. occasional partying). Sexual behavior is especially important because it is likely one of the main theoretical differences between populations with respect to HIV transmission and also because it can be used as a criterion for eligibility for certain interventions. For example, the CDC guidelines for PrEP direct clinicians to discuss various risk behaviors when considering PrEP for eligible patients [
