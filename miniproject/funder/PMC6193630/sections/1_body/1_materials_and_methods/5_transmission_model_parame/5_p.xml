<p>The third factor is “mixing”, which governs how frequently different infectious types contact one another, is generally very difficult to measure directly but is also known to be a determinant of transmission dynamics and extinction criteria [

In “random mixing” individuals pick partners from the general population at random (i.e. with no specific preference for their partners risk behavior) while in “self-only mixing” high-risk person only mix with other high-risk persons and the same for low-risk persons.
