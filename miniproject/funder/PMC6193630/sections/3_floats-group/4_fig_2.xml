  <title>Dynamic optimal control policies and intervention effects in the baseline scenario.</title>
  <p>The left panel gives the optimal number of individuals annually enrolled in TasP (red) and PrEP (blue) for 1, 3, and 5 million dollars per year (low, medium, and high budgets respectively) and two different PrEP policies, “Unlimited PrEP” for PrEP provided for the entire duration of a high-risk period or “1-Year PrEP” for PrEP provided for 1 year. The right panel gives the multiplicative-scale reduction in annual incidence for the dynamic optimal (black dots), PrEP-only (blue), and TasP-only (red) control policies.</p>
