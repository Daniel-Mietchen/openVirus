  <title>Sensitivity of dynamic optimal control policies and intervention effects to model formulation for the “1-Year PrEP” scenario given an annual budget of 5 million dollars.</title>
  <p>The optimal number of annual enrollment into PrEP (red) and TasP (blue) interventions is plotted on the left while the multiplicative-scale annual reduction in annual incidence for the optimal (black dots), PrEP-only (blue), and TasP-only (red) interventions is plotted on the right. Each row represents a sensitivity axis where the baseline parameter set, (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204741.g002">Fig 2</xref>), can be thought of as being between the two extremes of each axis. Parameter sets are described in the materials and methods section.
