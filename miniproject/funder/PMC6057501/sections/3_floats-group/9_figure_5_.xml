  <p>Challenge assay. Normalised percent of initial weight (%IW) at day of challenge and 6/10 dpc (A) as well as viral loads at day of challenge and 3/6 dpc (B) are given for all groups (i.e., immunised and control). Viral loads were evaluated on groups of two hamsters at 3/6 dpc. %IW were evaluated on groups of eight, six, and four hamsters at 3, 6, and 10 dpc, respectively. Significant %IW differences observed between non-immunised (Non im.) and the other groups at 6/10 dpc (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P value &lt;0.05) are indicated by a star (*). Viral loads and %IW computations are detailed in the corresponding paragraphs within the ‘Section 4’.</p>
