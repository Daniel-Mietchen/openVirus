  <p>Subgenomic fragments used for wild-type and re-encoded virus production using the Infectious Subgenomic Amplicon method. *For 
   <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain and hamster-adapted re-encoded strain (
   <italic>Ap7M</italic>-derived) production, the subgenomic fragment FIAp7 was amplified from the corresponding plasmid and combined to subgenomic fragments FII (wild-type or re-encoded) and FIII (wild-type). **For each of the YFV re-encoded strains (both 
   <italic>Asibi</italic> and 
   <italic>Ap7M</italic>-derived) production, a different subgenomic fragment FII was amplified from the corresponding plasmid. ***For the production of YFV re-encoded strain rTs4, the subgenomic fragment FIIIR was amplified from the corresponding plasmid and combined to fragments FI (wild-type) and FII (re-encoded).
