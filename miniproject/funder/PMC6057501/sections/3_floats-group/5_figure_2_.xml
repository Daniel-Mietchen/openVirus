  <p>Competition assays: Wild-type and re-encoded-specific patterns counts at tenth competition passage. For each WT/re-encoded virus ratio and each re-encoded virus, pattern counts were calculated as a mean for the three replicates. For each replicate, the pattern count is the mean count for the three virus-specific patterns. Each specific pattern count is the sum of the sense and reverse patterns counts within a given read population (obtained through NGS sequencing).</p>
