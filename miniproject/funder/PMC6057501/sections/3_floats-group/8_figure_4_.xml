  <p>Results of YFV serology at 16-day post-infection. Neutralisation assays were performed on sera obtained from hamsters infected with re-encoded viruses that showed complete loss of mortality 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. For each virus, serum samples were retrieved at 16 dpi from two hamsters. Sera from both uninfected hamsters (
   <italic>n</italic>=2) and vaccinated humans (vaccinees, 
   <italic>n</italic>=4) were used as negative and positive controls. Results are expressed as 50 per cent neutralisation titre (NT
   <sub>50</sub>) and were evaluated using Graphpad Prism Software (v7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
