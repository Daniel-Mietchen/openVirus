<p>Much remains to be learned to understand the multiple mechanisms that shape synonymous codon usage and its contribution to the attenuation process during re-encoding. In this exploratory work, we defined several types of silent mutations and sought to identify which one(s) had the least detrimental impact on viral replicative fitness. In the future, such silent changes could be introduced in large numbers along the genome of vaccine candidates. YFV provides a suitable experimental model because (1) the virus can be produced conveniently and modified using the Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons (ISA) reverse genetics method (
