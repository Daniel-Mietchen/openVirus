<p>YFV is the type species of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, that owes its name (
 <italic>flavus</italic> is the Latin word for yellow) to the jaundice associated with the liver dysfunction characteristic of yellow fever disease. In humans, YFV primarily infects the liver, often resulting in severe viscerotropic infections and high fever (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp
 <italic>.</italic> mosquitoes, inhabit the forest canopy, providing the hosts and vectors for viral maintenance through a sylvatic enzootic transmission cycle. Human–mosquito–human transmission cycles usually arise incidentally when humans encroach on the forest or neighbouring savannah environment and then inadvertently take the virus back to the villages or towns/cities, leading to urban epidemics that can be extensive. The most recent of these large-scale African epidemics happened in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo in 2015 and 2016 (
