<p>A new, promising, approach for virus attenuation called codon re-encoding, was developed a decade ago by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns et al. (2006)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="vey021-B57" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al. (2006)</xref>. Based on the initial observation that usage among synonymous codons is highly non-random in the genome of viruses, they hypothesised that this equilibrium could be modified in a manner that should be relatively detrimental to virus replication. They provided the first evidence supporting this concept by introducing slightly detrimental synonymous codons within the encoding region of the poliovirus genome, that is, without modifying the encoded proteins after which they observed a decrease in viral replication capacity. This codon re-encoding strategy bypasses the limitations of empirical attenuation methods: importantly, the high number of mutations involved decreases the risk of reversion of the attenuating mutations and reduces the likelihood of vaccine strain recombination (with either vaccine or wild-type viruses). The use of silent mutations also lowers the risk of emergence of untoward biological properties.
