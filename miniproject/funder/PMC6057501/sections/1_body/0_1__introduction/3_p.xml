<p>Over the past five or six centuries YFV has killed millions of humans and primates, hence the need for effective methods of prevention. As a response to this need, the live-attenuated vaccine (strain 17D) was developed in 1936 by M. Theiler (
 <xref rid="vey021-B73" ref-type="bibr">Theiler and Smith 1937</xref>). It was first tested in 1938 in Brazil (

 <xref rid="vey021-B52" ref-type="bibr">Monath 2012</xref>) and two substrains (17DD and 17D-204) are still widely used as the source for vaccine manufacture (
 <xref rid="vey021-B17" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et al. 2010</xref>) in Brazil (17DD) and the Old World (17D-204). Throughout decades of use of 17 D vaccine, with twenty to sixty million doses distributed annually (
 <xref rid="vey021-B54" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Vasconcelos 2015</xref>), YF vaccination has proven to be safe and effective, providing long-lasting immunity (

 <xref rid="vey021-B54" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Vasconcelos 2015</xref>). The YF 17 D strain was obtained through serial passages (&gt;200) of the wild-type (WT) 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain in mouse and chicken embryo tissues (

 <xref rid="vey021-B65" ref-type="bibr">Sabin and Boulger 1973</xref>), measles (
 <xref rid="vey021-B66" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz 1962</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey021-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hilleman et al. 1968</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey021-B31" ref-type="bibr">Ikic et al. 1972</xref>), and mumps (
 <xref rid="vey021-B11" ref-type="bibr">Buynak and Hilleman 1966</xref>). This strategy relies on attenuation resulting from a relatively limited number of attenuating mutations that are, most often, non-synonymous. However, with all of these live-attenuated viruses there is a risk of (1) attenuation reversion, as described in the case of the poliovirus vaccine (
 <xref rid="vey021-B48" ref-type="bibr">Minor 2012</xref>); (2) generation of new biological properties, as illustrated by the gain of neurovirulence observed for the YFV French neurotropic vaccine strain (
 <xref rid="vey021-B76" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 1995</xref>); and (3) recombination, as documented for poliovirus (
 <xref rid="vey021-B44" ref-type="bibr">Lukashev et al. 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey021-B48" ref-type="bibr">Minor 2012</xref>;
