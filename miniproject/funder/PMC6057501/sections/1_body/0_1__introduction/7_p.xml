<p>Starting with a bioinformatic analysis of flaviviral genomes, we defined several types of mutations and used them for the design of eight re-encoded sequences. The re-encoded viruses were derived from the wild-type 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain and the hamster-adapted 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain, with which they were compared both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> through fitness assays, infection assays and complete genome deep-sequencing. Although only the most heavily re-encoded virus (741 mutations) showed an observable decrease in replicative fitness 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, a range of attenuation levels was observed for the re-encoded variants when tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The lowest impact was observed for strains that were re-encoded with transitions that did not include new CpG/UpA dinucleotides. In addition, we showed that the strains with the most attenuated phenotypes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> could induce robust protective immunity in hamsters following challenge with the lethal YF 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> virus.
