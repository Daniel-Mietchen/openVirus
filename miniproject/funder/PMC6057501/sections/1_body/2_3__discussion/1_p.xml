<p>Genome re-encoding through synonymous codon replacement is a recognised procedure for attenuating RNA viruses including poliovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, chikungunya virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and dengue virus (

Additional insights into the mechanisms contributing to attenuation of the virus phenotype following synonymous codon replacement should prove valuable for the custom design of, viable, safe, cost-effective vaccine candidates. The initial purpose of this work was to identify the types of synonymous mutations that would impose the least detrimental effect on viral replicative fitness. Previous codon re-encoding studies in our laboratory were achieved for two other arboviruses, CHIKV and TBEV (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes of yellow fever virus (YFV). Our choice was motivated by the availability of a suitable reverse genetics system for re-encoded strains of YFV production, viz., the ISA method (

 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and then the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replicative fitness of our strains before using some of the live-attenuated candidates for hamster immunisation studies.
