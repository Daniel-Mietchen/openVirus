<p>The initial aim of this exploratory work was to identify types of mutation with limited detrimental impact on viral replicative fitness, usable for large scale genome re-encoding. In this regard, ‘non-specific’ transitions (i.e., with no CpG/UpA creation) represent the mutation type that best met our initial criteria. On this basis, we conclude that the introduction of transitions without CpG/UpA increase may constitute a ground rule for the custom-designed large-scale re-encoding of viral genomes. This does not rule out the possible use of mutations that increase the rate of CpG/UpA dinucleotides. We propose that using a limited number of such mutations may ensure that re-encoded genomes are relatively innocuous when tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, because these patterns ensure enhanced activation of host innate immunity. Thus, procedures combining large, pan-genomic non-specific re-encoding with limited bespoke CpG/UpA re-encoding should lead to the development of safe, stable, and effective live-attenuated vaccine viruses with finely tuned phenotypes.
