<p>First, the introduction of simple transitions (i.e., with no modification of putative secondary structures in the genomic RNA) on the replicative fitness of YFV had only minor impact on viral phenotype. They did not cause larger modification of GC%, ENC, Codon Adaptation index (to the homo sapiens codon usage) or in the proportion of codons that are more likely to yield stop codons (‘1-to-Stop codons’, as defined by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B55" ref-type="bibr">Moratorio et al. 2017</xref>) than what can be observed among clinical/field isolates, indicating that additional mechanisms are probably involved in the attenuation process. Similarly, the introduction of transitions at sites involved in putative genomic secondary RNA structures had a relatively mild detrimental impact on replicative fitness. Second, contrary to secondary RNA structures that have been identified in the untranslated regions of YFV (
 <xref rid="vey021-B59" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al. 2017</xref>) and other flaviviruses (

 <xref rid="vey021-B26" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>,
 <xref rid="vey021-B27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), the putative structures within the virus open reading frame appear unlikely to be important determinants of replicative fitness. Rather, role(s) in finely tuning the efficiency of translation (mRNA or co-translational folding) or in interactions with viral, and non-viral proteins have been proposed (
