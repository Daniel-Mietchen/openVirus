<p>This study approach was exploratory. Hence, we chose to focus on the identification of mutations with low deleterious impact on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication and virulence of the yellow fever virus (YFV) rather than on the comprehensive characterisation of the biological mechanisms underlying the attenuation process (e.g., protein translation, RNA replication, activation of innate immunity). Mechanistic insights on the specific effect(s) of the new re-encoding strategies would be most valuable, to gain insight into the finer details of viral attenuation and to facilitate fine-tuning of re-encoded viruses for the specific requirements of their intended use.
