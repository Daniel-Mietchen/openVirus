<p>In addition to deciphering the mechanisms of attenuation, evaluating the stability of viral re-encoded variants is a crucial objective for the development of vaccine candidates. Here, we observed no reversion to the parental 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> sequence of YFV re-encoded viruses when tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and virtually no reversion 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, for several re-encoded strains, the occurrence of consensus non-synonymous mutations in the sequences from the inoculum and/or hamster livers suggests that YFV re-encoded viruses may adapt and evolve both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The molecular evolution of viral re-encoded strains has already been described for HIV and CHIKV-derived strains 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The occurrence of synonymous and non-synonymous consensus mutations correlated with partial recovery of (CHIKV) or full (HIV) WT replicative fitness (

 <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et al. 2013</xref>). In accordance with the observations made on CHIKV evolution 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, some re-encoded strains retained a strongly attenuated phenotype that was not outweighed by the emergence of adaptative consensus mutations. Altogether, these elements suggest that, in some cases, the accumulation of slightly detrimental mutations could trap the virus, with no alternative mutational pathway with which to enable complete restoration of replicative fitness.
