<p>In contrast with previously published re-encoding studies, we performed deep sequencing of infected hamster liver homogenates to correlate precisely each viral sequence(s) with the observed phenotype. Our results indicate that, detailed genetic information and in particular, that retrieved from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, is critical to determine the significance of synonymous substitutions within the attenuation process. When monitoring the evolution of YFV re-encoded strains after production (i.e., transfection followed by three passages 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>) or after one passage in hamsters, we observed the spontaneous emergence of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. These consensus changes may be artefacts of the production methods employed (PCR amplification of DNA fragments, stochastic evolution events) or they may have resulted from the adaptation of re-encoded viruses to the differing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions of replication. In some cases, we observed the emergence of consensus non-synonymous mutations present in major variants of the viral stock used as the inoculum for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. For these viruses, the analysis of the results from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and attempts to correlate them with sequencing data was limited due to consensus NS mutations which impeded the identification of the specific impact of silent mutations on the viral phenotype 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
