<p>As illustrated by the case of poliovirus vaccines, live-attenuated vaccine strains have the potential to evolve following inoculation and in cases of dissemination following vaccination. Hence, the development of re-encoded vaccine candidates should be accompanied by robust studies that address the potential fate of the variants 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evolutionary behaviour of re-encoded viruses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> has never been studied. Since convenient 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> laboratory models and reverse genetics systems are available, potential live-attenuated YFV re-encoded vaccine candidates would provide a convenient experimental model for future 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. In the studies described earlier, we focused mainly on YF variants re-encoded in one specific region of the genome (NS2A-NS4B). These studies were appropriate for our experimental objectives but would not be ideal for evolution studies. An optimised and more realistic design would rely on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> serial passage and deep sequencing characterisation of evenly distributed synonymous mutations, along the entire genome, each with low fitness impact. The major objective would be to assess the stability of re-encoded strains with synonymously modified codon compositions and in particular, their potential to evolve towards modified phenotypes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
