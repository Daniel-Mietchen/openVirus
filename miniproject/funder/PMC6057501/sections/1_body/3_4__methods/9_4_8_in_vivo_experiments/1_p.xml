<p>The laboratory hamster model reproduces the features of human YF but requires the use of adapted strains (
 <xref rid="vey021-B501" ref-type="bibr">Julander 2016</xref>). We recently implemented a hamster model for YFV, based on the use of a strain equivalent to the 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>/hamster p7 strain described by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B47" ref-type="bibr">McArthur etÂ al. (2003)</xref>, 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>. When inoculated into hamsters, this strain induces a lethal viscerotropic disease similar to that described for YF 
 <italic>Ap7</italic> virus in terms of (1) clinical signs of illness, (2) weight evolution, (3) viral loads in the liver, and (iv) lethality (100 per cent). This strain was derived from 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> by including ten mutations in the FI subgenomic region used for viral recovery with the ISA method. As we chose to target the FII subgenomic region for re-encoding, the 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain was well suited for testing the effects of re-encoding on the biological properties of viruses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
