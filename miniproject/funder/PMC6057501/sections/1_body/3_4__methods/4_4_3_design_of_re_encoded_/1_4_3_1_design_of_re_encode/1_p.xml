<p>Re-encoded strains YFV rTs1, rTs2, and rTs3, were designed by introducing increasing numbers of ‘simple’ transitions (siTs) in the CDS of the reference strain 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> (AY640589). The term ‘simple’ refers to synonymous, non-specific (no CpG/UpA introduction) mutations located outside putative secondary structures. Strain YFV rTs4 included all mutations of YFV rTs3 and 388 additional non-specific transitions located between position 6,846 and 9,765 of the CDS, (741 transitions in total).
