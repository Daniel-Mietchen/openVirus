<p>To investigate the impact of introducing TCG patterns on viral replication, mutations allowing the creation of TCG trinucleotides (TCG-Ts) were used for the design of re-encoded strain YFV rTCG (118 additional TCG). Because of the scarcity of editable sites allowing TCG introduction, design rules were relaxed: both transitions and transversions were used and some mutations affected sites corresponding to putative secondary structures (total: twelve) as well as non-editable sites (total: eleven).</p>
