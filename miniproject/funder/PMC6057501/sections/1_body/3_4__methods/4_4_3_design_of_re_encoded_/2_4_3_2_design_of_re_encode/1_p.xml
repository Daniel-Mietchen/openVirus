<p>Viruses YFV rUA and rCG were designed by increasing the number of UpA and CpG dinucleotides in the viral sequence. Transitions leading to UpA dinucleotide introduction (UpA-Ts) were combined with siTs to design strain rUA (fifty-nine additional UpA). Similarly, rCG involved a combination of siTs and CpG-Ts (fifty-nine additional CpG).</p>
