<p>CDS consensus sequence determination was done using CLC genomics workbench software (CLC bio-Qiagen). Substitutions with a frequency &gt;5 per cent were considered for the analysis of intra-population genetic diversity and major/minor variant subpopulations identification (minor variants: 5 per cent &lt; variants frequency â‰¤75 per cent; major variants: variants frequency &gt;75 per cent). No variant was taken into account with a coverage lower than 1,000 reads. No consensus mutation was taken into account with a coverage lower than fifty reads.</p>
