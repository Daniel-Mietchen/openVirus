<p>Nucleotide sequences were determined using NGS methods: overlapping amplicons spanning either the complete genome sequence or a 256 nucleotides region (nucleotide positions: 4,391–4,646) were produced from the extracted RNA using the SuperScript
 <sup>®</sup> III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum
 <sup>®</sup>Taq High Fidelity kit (Invitrogen) and specific primers (detailed in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S7</xref>). Sequencing was performed using the PGM Ion torrent technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
