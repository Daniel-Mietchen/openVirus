<p>The amount of viral RNA was calculated from standard curves using a synthetic RNA transcript (concentrations of 10

 <sup>6</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, and 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/Î¼L). Results were normalised using amplification (qRT-PCR) of the housekeeping gene actin (as described by Piorkowski and colleagues (
