<p>Sera were incubated for 20 min at 56°C prior to viral serology. For each serum, serial five-fold dilutions (first dilution: 1:250) of serum were tested on BHK21 cells for 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain infection inhibition. The plates were incubated for 44 h before nucleic acid extraction. Virus quantification was achieved using the YFV-specific qRT-PCR system as described earlier. Then, a viral RNA yield reduction (per cent of viral inhibition) was calculated for each well as follows:
