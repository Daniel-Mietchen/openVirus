<p>A final amount of 1 µg of DNA (equimolar mix of subgenomic cDNA fragments) was transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) in a 25-cm
 <sup>2</sup> culture flask of subconfluent cells containing 1 mL of culture medium without antibiotics. The cell supernatant media were harvested at 9-day post-transfection (dpi), aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Each virus was then passaged twice in Vero (
