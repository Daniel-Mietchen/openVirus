<p>For producing each of the different YFV strains described in this study, 3 overlapping DNA fragments were synthesised 
 <italic>de novo</italic> (Genscript) and amplified by High Fidelity PCR using the Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity kit (Life Technologies) and specific sets of primers. After amplification, all DNA fragments were purified using Monarch PCR &amp; DNA Cleanup kit 5 µg (BioLabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Details regarding the subgenomic DNA fragments and the sets of primers used for the amplification step are available in the
