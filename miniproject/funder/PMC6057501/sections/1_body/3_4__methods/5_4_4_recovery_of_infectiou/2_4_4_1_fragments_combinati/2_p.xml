<p>Re-encoded strains rTs1, rTs2, rTs3, rUA, rCG, rSS, rN, and rTCG were derived from 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> by combining a re-encoded version of the second subgenomic fragment FII to the WT first (FI) and third (FIII) subgenomic fragments. For the heavily re-encoded rTs4 strain, the WT fragment FI was combined to the re-encoded FII fragment of strain rTs3 and to a re-encoded version of FIII fragment, FIIIR.
