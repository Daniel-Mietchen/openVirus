<p>For 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain production, three subgenomic fragments were used: FI (positions 1–3,919 in CDS and the 5′-UTR (119 nucleotides (nt)), FII (3,843–6,838) and FIII (6,783–10,236 and 3′-UTR (509 nt)). They correspond to the complete genome of the strain, flanked, respectively, at 5′ and 3′ termini by the human cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the simian virus forty polyadenylation signal (HDR/SV40pA) (pCMV and HDR/SV40pA sequences were described by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B4" ref-type="bibr">Aubry et al. 2014</xref>). The hamster-virulent strain YFV 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>, was obtained from 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> virus by substituting the FI subgenomic fragment by the FIAp7 fragment, that includes ten hamster-virulence mutations as described elsewhere (R. Klitting et al., accepted manuscript).
