<p>WT virus was grown in competition with each of the nine, 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived, re-encoded viruses using two RNA ratios in triplicate (WT/re-encoded virus: 10/90 and 50/50). A global estimated MOI of 0.5 was used for the first inoculation. Viruses from each experiment were then passaged nine times with an incubation time of three days. At each passage, the estimated MOI was ∼0.6. After each infection (3 dpi), nucleic acids were extracted from the clarified culture supernatant medium using the QiaCube HT device (see section 4.5) and then used for RT-PCR amplification. The detection of each virus was achieved using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods (see section 4.10), by amplifying a 256 nucleotides region and counting virus-specific patterns within the read population.
