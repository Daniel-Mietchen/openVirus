<p>Unexpectedly, one hamster from the YFV rCGh infected group died at 6 dpi, although it did not show any symptom nor weight loss. Its liver was tested positive for YFV. Twenty-four days after inoculation, two and three hamsters from rCGh and rNh groups, respectively, and a hamster from the non-infected group were euthanised and both serum and liver samples were recovered for neutralisation assay and viral load determination. For all three groups, the eight remaining hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 5×10

 <sub>50</sub> of virus (
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>). Two hamsters were euthanised at three- and six-day post-challenge (dpc) to conduct virology investigations from liver samples while four were kept for evaluating mortality rate (endpoint in case of survival: twelve dpc). The protection was evaluated by determining for each group (1) viral loads in liver at three and six dpc, (2) weight evolution at six and ten dpc, (3) survival. With regard to the number of samples tested for virology and immunology investigations, no statistical test was achieved in this section. Detailed results for this experiment are available in
