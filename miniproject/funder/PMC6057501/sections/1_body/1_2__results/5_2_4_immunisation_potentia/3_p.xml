<p>In agreement with previous observations, no mortality was observed post-challenge in either immunised or control groups, indicating that mortality rate in hamsters decreases importantly in adults (greater than six-week old individuals) (
 <xref rid="vey021-B502" ref-type="bibr">Tesh et al. 2001</xref>). However, there was a great difference in the evolution of viral loads, with no increase in viral yields at three and six dpc in rCGh and rNh immunised animals while high viral loads were detected in the control animals, around ∼10
 <sup>9</sup> RNA copies per gram of liver. Evidence of protection was also provided by the fact that there was no weight loss in immunised groups at six and ten dpc, whereas a significant weight loss up to 18 per cent at ten dpc (Wilcoxon rank sum test P value = 0.00239) was recorded in the control group. Altogether, these results indicate efficient immunisation of hamsters inoculated with YFV re-encoded strains rCGh or rNh.
