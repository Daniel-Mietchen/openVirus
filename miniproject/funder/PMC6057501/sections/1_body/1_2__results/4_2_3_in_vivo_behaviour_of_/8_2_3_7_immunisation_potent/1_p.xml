<p>For each of the re-encoded viruses that showed complete loss of mortality 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, sera were recovered from infected hamsters at 16 dpi during the comparative study of pathogenicity (see above). Sera from both uninfected hamsters and vaccinated humans were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. Neutralisation tests were performed using serial five-fold dilutions of all sera, the YF 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> challenge virus and BHK21 cells. Neutralising antibodies were detected in both hamsters infected with YF-re-encoded viruses (NT
 <sub>50</sub> ranging between 2×10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 1×10
 <sup>−5</sup>) and in a control group of 17D-vaccinated humans (NT
 <sub>50</sub> between 4 and 5×10
 <sup>−4</sup>) while the negative control group did not show any neutralisation activity against 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> (see
