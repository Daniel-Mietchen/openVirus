<p>The infectious titres of viral stocks for 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> and 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>-derived re-encoded strains were established in BHK21 cells, using a TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay (results detailed in 
 <xref rid="vey021-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For the majority of re-encoded viruses, no notable difference was observed with the parent strain 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> (9×10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID50/mL), with infectious titres ranging from 4×10
 <sup>8</sup> to 6×10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID50/mL. However, viruses YFV rNh and rTCGh showed a one- to two-log reduction in viral titre (6×10
 <sup>6</sup> and 6×10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID50/mL, respectively).
