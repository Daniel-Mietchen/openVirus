<p>As observed for 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>-re-encoded viruses, the number of consensus mutations associated with major variants were low, ranging from zero to five, with a mean number of one consensus change/virus and 59 per cent of non-synonymous mutations on an average. Consensus mutations were mainly distributed outside re-encoded regions (90 per cent), with no reversion. As observed for 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>, the parent 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain showed no NS consensus sequence changes associated with major variants. Moreover, the re-encoded viruses which were given a limited number of 
 <italic>in cellulo</italic> passages did not exhibit any evidence of convergent evolution. Based on this evidence, the consensus mutations observed in YFV rTs3h, rNh, and rTCGh are likely to be artefacts of the production method rather than the result of adaptation of re-encoded viruses to culture conditions. Notably, for YFV rTs3h, the consensus NS change observed in the inoculum was not essential for virus survival 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> as it was not maintained following infection in hamsters.
