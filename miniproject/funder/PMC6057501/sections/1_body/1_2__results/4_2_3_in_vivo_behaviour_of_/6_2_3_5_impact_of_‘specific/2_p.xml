<p>On the other hand, the sequence of the stock variant rTCGh (118 TCG) differed from that of the original construct. To conclude, with respect to the compensatory role of the consensus NS mutations that arose during strain production, further experiments would be required. Nevertheless, the attenuated phenotype (loss of lethality, alleviation of weight loss) of the re-encoded viruses following infection in hamsters suggests a detrimental effect of increasing TCG trinucleotides on YFV virulence 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> that was not completely outweighed by the presence of additional consensus NS changes. Hence, the introduction of TCGs may impact on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of YFV following infection in vertebrate hosts. Of note, a recent study by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B55" ref-type="bibr">Moratorio et al. (2017</xref>) highlighted the adverse effect of the introduction of codons that are likely to yield stop codons (referred to as ‘1-to-Stop codons’) on the fitness of Influenza A and Coxsackie B3 viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Namely, these 1-to-Stop codons are UUA, UUG, UCA, and UCG. Only twenty-eight additional UCG were identified within the sequence of YFV rTCG (which was the only re-encoded virus for which there was a change in the number of 1-to-Stop codons). This is four- to eight-fold lower compared with what was introduced into the genomes of Coxsackie B3 (117 codons) and Influenza A (205 codons) viruses. Nevertheless, further experimentation would be useful to determine whether or not there is an increase in the generation of Stop codons during viral replication of rTCG/rTCGh viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
