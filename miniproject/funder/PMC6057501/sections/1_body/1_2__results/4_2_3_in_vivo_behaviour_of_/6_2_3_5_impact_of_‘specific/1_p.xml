<p>Variants with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides exhibited attenuated phenotypes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, with no mortality, alleviated weight loss and no reduction in viral loads. For variant rUAh (fifty-nine UpA), the sequence remained stable throughout the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Hence, the attenuation resulted from the original sequence re-encoding. The originally modified sequence of variant rCGh (fifty-nine CpG) remained constant and consensus NS changes were associated with major variants arising during the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Such consensus mutations are likely to be adaptive but did not result in complete recovery of virulence during the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Altogether, these results are consistent with the attenuating effect of the introduction of CpG/UpA dinucleotides into viral genomes as reported on previous occasions (
