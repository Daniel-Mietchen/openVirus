<p>Finally, for strain rNh, consensus NS mutations were identified in the sequences from both the inoculum and hamster liver samples. It is therefore complicated to determine which of the consensus changes were production artefacts or resulted from adaptation of the virus to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. Nevertheless, the virus exhibited a strongly attenuated phenotype 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (no mortality, alleviated weight loss and viral loads) indicating that, regardless of the emergence of the—potentially compensatory—consensus NS mutations, the combination of several re-encoding strategies led to an important degree of attenuation considering the low number of mutations used for re-encoding (i.e., 233).
