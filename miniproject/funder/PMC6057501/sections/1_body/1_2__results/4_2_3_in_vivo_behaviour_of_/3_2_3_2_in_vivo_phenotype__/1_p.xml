<p>Groups of 12 three-week-old female hamsters were inoculated intra-peritoneally with 5×10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of virus (either 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> or 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>-re-encoded strains) and a control group of two uninfected hamsters was maintained for weight monitoring. Clinical follow-up included (1) clinical manifestations of the disease (brittle fur, dehydration, prostration, and lethargy), (2) body weight (weight evolution was expressed as a normalised percentage of the initial weight (%IW)), and (3) death. Three and four hamsters were euthanised at days three and six post-infection (dpi), respectively, to conduct virology investigations from liver samples, while the other five in each group were retained for evaluating mortality rate (endpoint in case of survival: 16 dpi). Due to an issue in group dispatching, in the case of rTs2h strain, three hamsters were euthanised at 6 dpi while six hamsters were used for mortality rate evaluation. Virology follow-up was achieved by performing qRT-PCR and next generation sequencing on RNA extracted from the liver homogenates. RNA samples were subsequently pooled to obtain one sequence for each virus, reflecting genetic diversity among the five hamsters kept until death/euthanasia. For all viruses, the
