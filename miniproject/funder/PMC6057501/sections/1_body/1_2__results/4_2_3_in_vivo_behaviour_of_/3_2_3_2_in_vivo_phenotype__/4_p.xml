<p>Regardless of the observed mortality rate, clinical signs of illness were observed with varying degrees of severity among groups. No association was observed between mortality and weight evolution at 3 or 6 dpi, with non-lethal viruses inducing limited (rNh, rTs1h) as well as severe weight loss (rCGh, rSSh) in infected hamsters. At 3 dpi, weight evolution was heterogeneous but not significantly different from what was observed in 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>-infected group (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values &gt; 0.05). An increase up to 7 per cent was observed in YFV rTs1h, rTs2h, and rTs3h-infected groups, a slight decrease (between 3 and 4 per cent) in groups infected with YFV rUAh, rNh, and rTCGh, and a greater decrease up to 11 per cent, in YFV rCGh and rSSh-infected groups. At 6 dpi, an important weight loss was observed in most groups (up to 38 per cent) except rTs1h and rNh-infected groups, in which significantly higher %IW values were recorded (8 and 4 per cent, respectively, (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values = 0.00088 and 0.00062, respectively)).
