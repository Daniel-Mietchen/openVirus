<p>A reduction in mortality rate was observed in all groups infected with re-encoded viruses. For most (YFV rTs1h, rUAh, rCGh, rSSh, rNh, and rTCGh), the reduction was significant (Logrank test, P values = 0.03960 in all cases), as no hamsters died. However, for YFV rTs2h and rTs3h, mortality was reduced but still observed (17 and 20 per cent, respectively; Logrank test, P values = 0.05820 and 0.07186).</p>
