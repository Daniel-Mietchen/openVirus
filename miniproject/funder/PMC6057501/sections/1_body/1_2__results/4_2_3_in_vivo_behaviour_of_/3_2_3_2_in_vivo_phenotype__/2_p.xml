<p>Nearly all hamsters inoculated with 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain developed outward signs of illness such as ruffled fur, prostration, dehydration, and lethargy. One hamster did not show any sign of illness, both its liver and blood were tested negative for YFV genomes and it was excluded from analysis. A high mortality rate (80 per cent) was observed, similar to previous observations (
 <xref rid="vey021-B36" ref-type="bibr">Klitting et al. 2018</xref>). Clinical signs of the disease appeared as early as 4 dpi and all animals died within 2/3 days after onset of the symptoms. Weight loss was not observed at 3 dpi (mean of %IW: 97 per cent), but between 3 and 6 dpi, significant weight losses were recorded (mean of %IW: 71 per cent, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value = 0.00032). All livers were found to be YFV-positive by qRT-PCR, with viral RNA loads ranging between 6×10
 <sup>7</sup> and 6×10
 <sup>9</sup> RNA copies per gram of liver and no significant difference between the viral yields at 3 and 6 dpi (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values &gt;0.05). No consensus change was detected in the viral sequence after propagation in hamsters.
