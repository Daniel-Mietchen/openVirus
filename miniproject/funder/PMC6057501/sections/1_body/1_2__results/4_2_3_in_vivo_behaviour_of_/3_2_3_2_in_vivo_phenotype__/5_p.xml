<p>An increase of viral yields at 3 and 6 dpi was not associated with mortality rates. At 3 dpi, viral loads in the liver were close to values observed with YF 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>, with values ranging from 7×10
 <sup>8</sup> to 1×10
 <sup>10</sup> RNA copies per gram of liver. At 6 dpi, viral loads remained close to those observed with 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>. However, in some cases (YFV rTs1h and rNh), significantly lower viral loads were observed (means of 5 and 8×10
 <sup>7</sup>, respectively. Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value= 0.03038 in both cases).
