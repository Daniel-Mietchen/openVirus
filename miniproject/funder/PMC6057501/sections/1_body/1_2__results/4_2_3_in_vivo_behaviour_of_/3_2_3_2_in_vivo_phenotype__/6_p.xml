<p>Several possibilities can explain the apparent absence of association between mortality and the evolution of viral loads. First, significant reduction in viral loads were always associated with a complete loss of lethality (for viruses rNh and rTs1h), hence they were, to a reasonable extent, associated to pathogenesis. Furthermore, in terms of replicative fitness and thus, of viral loads, the threshold that corresponds with the loss of lethality may be subtle and undetectable under the experimental conditions used here. In addition, the viral loads that are reported here are RNA copy numbers and may not reflect the actual amount of infectious particles. Furthermore, they have been evaluated from liver samples and may be less sharply correlated with disease evolution than viral loads in the blood. In addition, variation between individual animals will contribute to the final outcome of the data. Finally, during YFV infection, it is likely that the pathogenesis involves an immunological component (
