<p>In general, low detrimental effects resulted from the introduction of simple transitions (siTs) (i.e., with no modification of predicted secondary structures) on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of YFV. Strain rTs2h (247 siTs) was associated with mild attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, with a decreased mortality rate and a reduction in hamster weight loss at 6 dpi but no significant change in the production of viral RNA (Wilcoxon rank sum, P values &gt; 0.05). As the viral sequence remained unchanged during the course of the experiments, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype can be interpreted as being the result of genome re-encoding. rTs3h (353 siTs) and rTs1h (101 siTs) viruses, respectively, showed mild and strong attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. For both, consensus NS mutations associated with major variants arose during the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infections possibly resulting from adaptation of the re-encoded viruses to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions during the infection. However, they did not correspond with the recovery of an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype similar to that of the parent strain 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic>. Surprisingly, the least re-encoded strain, rTs1h (101 siTs) was more attenuated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> than the rTs2h strain, that included all rTs1h mutations plus 146 additional siTs. We observed a mild detrimental impact following the introduction of transitions at sites involved in predicted RNA secondary structures. The sequence of strain rSSh involved siTs as well as transitions located on predicted secondary RNA structures and remained stable throughout the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The variant showed a partially attenuated phenotype 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (complete loss of mortality, no alleviation in weight loss or viral loads) that can thus be attributed to this second re-encoding strategy. Overall, these results illustrate the relative efficiency of the use of ‘non-specific’ transitions in providing a stable re-encoded infectious genome exhibiting 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation.
