<p>Some conclusions can be drawn by analysing the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes of re-encoded viruses in light of the sequencing data obtained from infected hamsters liver samples (see details in 
 <xref rid="vey021-T5" ref-type="table">TableÂ 5</xref>). For example, the sequences obtained from the livers of hamsters infected with the control strain 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> did not include consensus mutations. This indicates that the sequence of the parent virus was stable under the experimental conditions and that adaptative mutations were not required for efficient replication
