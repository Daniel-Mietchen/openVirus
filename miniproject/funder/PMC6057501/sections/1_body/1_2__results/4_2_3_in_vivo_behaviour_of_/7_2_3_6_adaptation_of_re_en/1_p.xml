<p>Altogether, these results indicate that consensus mutations can arise and stably establish in re-encoded viruses in response to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions. This was observed for most of the re-encoded viruses, notably some with as few as 101 re-encoded sites (rTs1h) or as many as 353 re-encoded sites (rTs3h). In most cases, the consensus mutations did not lead to a full recovery of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> viral replicative fitness. Observable changes in the biological properties of the viruses (e.g., change in tropism, as reported for YF strain 17D), were not reported in any of the viruses that exhibited consensus NS mutations.
