<p>For each of the re-encoded viruses, the replicative fitness was compared with that of the wild-type strain using competition assays. Specific virus detection was achieved for one in two passages using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods by amplifying a 256 nucleotide region and counting virus-specific patterns within the read population. For all re-encoded viruses except rTs4 (≤353 mutations), replicative fitness 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was comparable to that of the 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain: in all competitions, both competing viruses could still be detected at the tenth passage (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey021-F2">Fig. 2</xref>). By contrast, the highly re-encoded rTs4 virus (741 mutations) showed a clear reduction in replicative fitness and could not be detected after the fifth passage.
