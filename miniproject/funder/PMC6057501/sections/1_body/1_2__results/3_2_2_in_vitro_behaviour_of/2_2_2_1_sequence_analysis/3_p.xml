<p>No consensus mutation associated with a major variant was identified in the genome of the parent strain YFV 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>, which only included twelve minor variants. In re-encoded genome sequences, low numbers of consensus mutations were observed, ranging from zero to six, with a mean of two consensus changes/virus and 39 per cent of non-synonymous (NS) mutations on an average. Consensus mutations were equally distributed between re-encoded and non-re-encoded regions and, nearly no convergence was observed between viral sequences. Only two viral sequences (YFV rTs2 and rCG) had consensus mutation reversions. One was common to both strains and corresponded to a siTs mutation (C to T), at CDS position 5,430. The two others were also siTs mutation reversions (C to T and A to G, respectively), located at CDS positions 5,442 and 5,667 of YFV rTs2 and rCG, respectively. The absence of consensus NS change in the sequence of the original 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain and the very limited convergence between viral sequences are in accordance with the low number (3) of 
 <italic>in cellulo</italic> passages. This strongly suggests that the consensus mutations observed in viruses YFV rTs3, rCG, rSS, and rTCG did not result from selective pressure due to culture conditions but may be artefacts of the production method.
