<p>The total numbers of variants, per virus, ranged from one to sixteen, with a mean of nine variants per virus. Interestingly, variants were most frequently observed outside the re-encoded regions (75 per cent of variants outside the re-encoded regions), similar to what was observed for the parental sequence, (92 per cent of variants outside the re-encoded region). The low number of reversions and the limited sequence variability at re-encoded sites accord with previous work showing that re-encoded CHIKV strains evolved mostly through compensatory mutations rather than mutation reversions (
