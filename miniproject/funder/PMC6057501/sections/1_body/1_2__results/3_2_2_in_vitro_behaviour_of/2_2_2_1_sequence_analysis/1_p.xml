<p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed on the cell culture supernatant media (viral stocks, i.e., after three passages). For all viruses, both the integrity of the genome and the intra-population genetic diversity were assessed on the CDS. At the level of intra-population genetic diversity, a variant subpopulation (further referred to as ‘variant’) was regarded as major when its corresponding nucleotide proportion (CNP) was over 75 per cent. Only consensus mutations associated with major variants were considered for further analysis. All sequencing results are shown in
