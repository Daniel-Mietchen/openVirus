<p>Following 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of flaviviral genomes, we defined two major types of synonymous mutations (see below). The creation of additional TCG trinucleotide patterns was considered a ‘specific’ type of mutation. In the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, TCG trinucleotides are frequent in Insect-Specific Flavivirus (ISF) genomes and sparse in both No Known Vector virus (NKV) and arbovirus genomes (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). In addition, this pattern may enhance the innate immunity in vertebrate cells, as suggested by Greenbaum, Jimenez-Baranda and colleagues (

 <xref rid="vey021-B32" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Baranda et al. 2011</xref>). ‘Specific’ mutations also included the creation of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, which were the least frequently introduced dinucleotides (CpG and UpA) in YFV species (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). This is in accordance with the previous observation of dinucleotide bias in the genomes of many viruses, in a fashion that was suggested to, at least partly, mirror the dinucleotide usage of their host(s)

 <xref rid="vey021-B69" ref-type="bibr">Simmen 2008</xref>) and the detection of such patterns may be a part of the host-defence mechanism against non-self RNA (

 <xref rid="vey021-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al. 2013</xref>). The introduction of CpG and UpA dinucleotides has been frequently used in re-encoding studies (

 <xref rid="vey021-B78" ref-type="bibr">Witteveldt, Martin-Gans, and Simmonds 2016</xref>). By contrast, ‘non-specific’ types of mutations did not cause any increase in CpG/UpA dinucleotides. This category includes transitions located on and outside sites associated with the putative secondary structures identified in the YFV genome during 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). All mutation types defined in this study are described in
