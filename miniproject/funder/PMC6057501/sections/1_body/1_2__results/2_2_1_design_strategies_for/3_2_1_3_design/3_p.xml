<p>Finally, eight hamster-adapted re-encoded strains were created from the 
 <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived variants (other than the heavily re-encoded rTs4 virus) by introducing exactly the same mutations in the CDS of the hamster-virulent, YFV 
 <italic>Ap7M</italic> virus. For all re-encoded viruses, the design is further detailed in the ‘Section 4’.
