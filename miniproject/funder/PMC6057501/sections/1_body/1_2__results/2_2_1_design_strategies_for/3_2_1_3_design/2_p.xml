<p>Overall the nine initial re-encoded viruses were designed as follows: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rTs1, rTs2, and rTs3, include increasing numbers of ‘simple’ transitions (siTs).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rSS includes non-specific transitions on sites corresponding to putative secondary structures (SII-Ts).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rUA and rCG include transitions leading to an increase in the number of UpA or CpG dinucleotides into the viral sequence (UA- and CG-Ts), respectively.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rN includes both transitions and transversions, some of which lead to the introduction of eighty-three UpA and fifty-four CpG dinucleotides into the viral sequence.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rTCG includes transitions leading to an increase in the number of TCG dinucleotides into the viral sequence (TCG-Ts). Importantly, this strain was not derived from rTs3 and exclusively includes TCG-Ts.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>YFV rTs4 includes 388 additional siTs that were introduced into the genome of rTs3 virus, between positions 6,846 and 9,765 (in CDS).</p>
  </list-item>
