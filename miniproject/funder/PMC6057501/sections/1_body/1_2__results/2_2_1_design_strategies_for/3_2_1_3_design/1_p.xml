<p>In total, nine re-encoded viruses were designed based on the 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> strain sequence. Aside from the highly re-encoded rTs4 virus, all Asibi-derived re-encoded viruses were designed with 100–400 mutations located between positions 3,924 and 6,759 of YF 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> complete coding sequence (CDS). First, YFV rTs3 was designed by introducing exclusively ‘simple’ transitions (siTs) into the target region, within the CDS of the reference strain 
 <italic>Asibi</italic> (AY640589). The term ‘simple’ refers to synonymous, non-specific (no CpG/UpA introduction) mutations located outside putative secondary structures. YFV rTs3 included 353 substitutions, that is, the highest possible number that could be introduced into the target region. All other re-encoded viruses except YFV rTCG were designed starting from the rTs3 virus by (1) reverting some of the siTs back to the original sequence (rTs1, rTs2), or (2) substituting some of the siTs for a different type of mutation (rUA, rCG, rSS, and rN). The rationale for this design procedure was to obtain viruses that could be compared one to another, as they would share a common background of mutations.
