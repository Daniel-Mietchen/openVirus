<p>Based on those results, we defined a framework for the design of YFV re-encoded strains. For each variant, we used a maximum of 350 synonymous mutations (
 <italic>ca.</italic> one change for every ten nucleotides). We chose to re-encode the region located within the coding sequences of proteins NS2A to NS4B, so that re-encoding would not affect the structural proteins, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or the highly structured, 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome. The highly re-encoded variant rTs4 was reconstructed by the addition of 388 synonymous mutations in the NS5 encoding region. In all cases, the structural proteins encoding sequence remained unchanged, which was an advantage as the production of hamster-virulent YFV variants required the use of a modified E protein sequence. To lower the risk of major detrimental effects of re-encoding (e.g., disruption of cis-acting sequences), we analysed an alignment of thirty-five YFV complete coding sequences (CDS) and defined only synonymous sites for which at least one mutation could be observed as eligible for re-encoding. These will be referred to as ‘editable sites’. Finally, we avoided creating or removing any rare codons during the re-encoding process (see definition in
