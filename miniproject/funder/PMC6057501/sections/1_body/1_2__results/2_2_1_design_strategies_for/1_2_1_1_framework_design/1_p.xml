<p>Previous analyses on the impact of random codon re-encoding on chikungunya (CHIKV) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) viruses, were used as a starting point to obtain observable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and/or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation. 
 <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairède et al. (2013)</xref> observed a decrease in CHIKV replicative fitness 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, using 264–882 mutations located within the NSp1, NSp4 and/or envelope protein encoding regions. Clear 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation of TBEV was achieved by 
 <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">de Fabritus et al. (2015</xref>) using as few as 273 mutations located in the NS5 coding region.
