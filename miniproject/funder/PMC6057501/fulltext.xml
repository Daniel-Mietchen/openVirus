Its core principle is to introduce a large number of synonymous substitutions into the viral genome to produce stable attenuation of the targeted virus. Introduction of large numbers of mutations has also been shown to maintain stability of the attenuated phenotype by lowering the risk of reversion and recombination of re-encoded genomes. Identifying mutations with low fitness cost is pivotal as this increases the number that can be introduced and generates more stable and attenuated viruses. Here, we sought to identify mutations with low deleterious impact on the <italic>in vivo</italic> replication and virulence of yellow fever virus (YFV). Following comparative bioinformatic analyses of flaviviral genomes, we categorised synonymous transition mutations according to their impact on CpG/UpA composition and secondary RNA structures. We then designed seventeen re-encoded viruses with 100&#x02013;400 synonymous mutations in the NS2A-to-NS4B coding region of YFV <italic>Asibi</italic> and <italic>Ap7M</italic> (hamster-adapted) genomes. Each virus contained a panel of synonymous mutations designed according to the above categorisation criteria. The replication and fitness characteristics of parent and re-encoded viruses were compared <italic>in vitro</italic> using cell culture competition experiments. <italic>In vivo</italic> laboratory hamster models were also used to compare relative virulence and immunogenicity characteristics. Most of the re-encoded strains showed no decrease in replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, they showed reduced virulence and, in some instances, decreased replicative fitness <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, the most attenuated of the re-encoded strains induced robust, protective immunity in hamsters following challenge with <italic>Ap7M</italic>, a virulent virus. Overall, the introduction of transitions with no or a marginal increase in the number of CpG/UpA dinucleotides had the mildest impact on YFV replication and virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, this strategy can be incorporated in procedures for the finely tuned creation of substantially re-encoded viral genomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>yellow fever virus</kwd><kwd>attenuation</kwd><kwd>genome re-encoding</kwd><kwd>Flavivirus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">European Virus Archive goes Global</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14CE14-0001</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus (family <italic>Flaviviridae)</italic> includes fifty-three taxonomically recognised species and at least nineteen &#x02018;tentative&#x02019; species (<xref rid="vey021-B35" ref-type="bibr">King and Am 2014</xref>). The flaviviruses display an exceptional diversity of ecological networks that widely correlate with the phylogenetic relationships within the genus (<xref rid="vey021-B79" ref-type="bibr">Zanotto et&#x000a0;al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B19" ref-type="bibr">Gaunt et&#x000a0;al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B22" ref-type="bibr">Grard et&#x000a0;al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B21" ref-type="bibr">Gould and Solomon 2008</xref>). To date, the majority of recognised flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). They are transmitted among vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes (MBFV), ticks, or sandflies (TBFV). The genus also includes viruses with no known vector (&#x02018;NKV&#x02019;) and some that infect only insects (insect-specific flaviviruses, &#x02018;ISFV&#x02019;) (<xref rid="vey021-B40" ref-type="bibr">Kuno et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B56" ref-type="bibr">Moureau et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). Several important (re)-emerging human pathogens fall within the MBFV and TBFV groups, notably dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), West Nile virus (WNV), and the recently emerged, Zika virus (ZIKV). Flaviviruses are spherical, enveloped particles (virions) of <italic>ca.</italic> 50&#x02009;nm diameter, incorporating single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes. The capped, eleven kilobase genome includes a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked at its 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini by structured, non-coding regions, essential for viral RNA translation and replication (<xref rid="vey021-B59" ref-type="bibr">Ng et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>). ORF translation gives rise to a polyprotein that is cleaved co- and post-translationally into the structural (C-prM-E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1-2A-2B-3-4A-4B-5) (<xref rid="vey021-B6" ref-type="bibr">Bell et&#x000a0;al. 1985</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B63" ref-type="bibr">Rice et&#x000a0;al. 1985</xref>).</p><p>YFV is the type species of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, that owes its name (<italic>flavus</italic> is the Latin word for yellow) to the jaundice associated with the liver dysfunction characteristic of yellow fever disease. In humans, YFV primarily infects the liver, often resulting in severe viscerotropic infections and high fever (<xref rid="vey021-B53" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Barrett 2003</xref>). The severity of YF infections ranges from &#x02018;inapparent&#x02019; (i.e., sub-clinical) to fatal haemorrhagic disease with a mortality rate between 20 and 50 per cent among symptomatic cases (<xref rid="vey021-B51" ref-type="bibr">Monath 2008</xref>). YFV originated in the tropical African forests where non-human primates (NHP) and a variety of <italic>Aedes</italic> spp<italic>.</italic> mosquitoes, inhabit the forest canopy, providing the hosts and vectors for viral maintenance through a sylvatic enzootic transmission cycle. Human&#x02013;mosquito&#x02013;human transmission cycles usually arise incidentally when humans encroach on the forest or neighbouring savannah environment and then inadvertently take the virus back to the villages or towns/cities, leading to urban epidemics that can be extensive. The most recent of these large-scale African epidemics happened in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo in 2015 and 2016 (<xref rid="vey021-B2" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed and Memish 2017</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B38" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>).YFV transmission is also maintained in the tropical forests of South-America. However, in this case the sylvatic transmission cycle is epizootic and human cases are primarily &#x02018;spill-over&#x02019; events from these sylvatic outbreaks (<xref rid="vey021-B20" ref-type="bibr">Germain et&#x000a0;al. 1981</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B16" ref-type="bibr">Ellis and Barrett 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B12" ref-type="bibr">Carrington and Auguste 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B28" ref-type="bibr">Hanley et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B49" ref-type="bibr">Mir et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>), as exemplified by the recent epidemic that occurred in Brazil in 2016&#x02013;7 (<xref rid="vey021-B49" ref-type="bibr">Mir et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>).</p><p>Over the past five or six centuries YFV has killed millions of humans and primates, hence the need for effective methods of prevention. As a response to this need, the live-attenuated vaccine (strain 17D) was developed in 1936 by M. Theiler (<xref rid="vey021-B73" ref-type="bibr">Theiler and Smith 1937</xref>). It was first tested in 1938 in Brazil (<xref rid="vey021-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barrett 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B52" ref-type="bibr">Monath 2012</xref>) and two substrains (17DD and 17D-204) are still widely used as the source for vaccine manufacture (<xref rid="vey021-B17" ref-type="bibr">Ferguson et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>) in Brazil (17DD) and the Old World (17D-204). Throughout decades of use of 17&#x02009;D vaccine, with twenty to sixty million doses distributed annually (<xref rid="vey021-B54" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Vasconcelos 2015</xref>), YF vaccination has proven to be safe and effective, providing long-lasting immunity (<xref rid="vey021-B50" ref-type="bibr">Monath 2005</xref>) with rare adverse events (<xref rid="vey021-B54" ref-type="bibr">Monath and Vasconcelos 2015</xref>). The YF 17&#x02009;D strain was obtained through serial passages (&#x0003e;200) of the wild-type (WT) <italic>Asibi</italic> strain in mouse and chicken embryo tissues (<xref rid="vey021-B50" ref-type="bibr">Monath 2005</xref>). Similar empirical methods have also been used for the production of notable live-attenuated vaccines against poliovirus (<xref rid="vey021-B65" ref-type="bibr">Sabin and Boulger 1973</xref>), measles (<xref rid="vey021-B66" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz 1962</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B29" ref-type="bibr">Hilleman et&#x000a0;al. 1968</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B31" ref-type="bibr">Ikic et&#x000a0;al. 1972</xref>), and mumps (<xref rid="vey021-B11" ref-type="bibr">Buynak and Hilleman 1966</xref>). This strategy relies on attenuation resulting from a relatively limited number of attenuating mutations that are, most often, non-synonymous. However, with all of these live-attenuated viruses there is a risk of (1) attenuation reversion, as described in the case of the poliovirus vaccine (<xref rid="vey021-B48" ref-type="bibr">Minor 2012</xref>); (2) generation of new biological properties, as illustrated by the gain of neurovirulence observed for the YFV French neurotropic vaccine strain (<xref rid="vey021-B76" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al. 1995</xref>); and (3) recombination, as documented for poliovirus (<xref rid="vey021-B44" ref-type="bibr">Lukashev et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B48" ref-type="bibr">Minor 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B43" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>).</p><p>A new, promising, approach for virus attenuation called codon re-encoding, was developed a decade ago by <xref rid="vey021-B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns et&#x000a0;al. (2006)</xref> and <xref rid="vey021-B57" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et&#x000a0;al. (2006)</xref>. Based on the initial observation that usage among synonymous codons is highly non-random in the genome of viruses, they hypothesised that this equilibrium could be modified in a manner that should be relatively detrimental to virus replication. They provided the first evidence supporting this concept by introducing slightly detrimental synonymous codons within the encoding region of the poliovirus genome, that is, without modifying the encoded proteins after which they observed a decrease in viral replication capacity. This codon re-encoding strategy bypasses the limitations of empirical attenuation methods: importantly, the high number of mutations involved decreases the risk of reversion of the attenuating mutations and reduces the likelihood of vaccine strain recombination (with either vaccine or wild-type viruses). The use of silent mutations also lowers the risk of emergence of untoward biological properties.</p><p>The first rationale for codon usage bias was that codon abundance correlated with that of isoaccepting tRNAs and could influence the level of protein production within a given host (<xref rid="vey021-B30" ref-type="bibr">Ikemura 1985</xref>). Several other possibilities have been proposed since then, including implication in mRNA structure and its folding (<xref rid="vey021-B67" ref-type="bibr">Shabalina, Ogurtsov, and Spiridonov 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kudla et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>), microRNA-targeting (<xref rid="vey021-B9" ref-type="bibr">Brest et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B8" ref-type="bibr">Birnbaum et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>) and enhanced recognition by the immune system (<xref rid="vey021-B75" ref-type="bibr">Tulloch et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>), that may vary according to the host (<xref rid="vey021-B23" ref-type="bibr">Greenbaum et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B32" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Baranda et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Specific and random re-encoding approaches have been efficiently applied to several human RNA viruses including poliovirus, influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), JEV, TBEV, and DENV (<xref rid="vey021-B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B57" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">De Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B45" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). Considering a major role of genome-wide mutational processes in the shaping of synonymous sites (<xref rid="vey021-B13" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>), specific re-encoding approaches include codon and codon-pair deoptimisation as well as increase of CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequency. On the other hand, the efficiency of random codon re-encoding strategies for the attenuation of CHIKV <italic>in vitro</italic> and of TBEV <italic>in vivo</italic> suggests an important influence of local constraints (e.g., cis-acting sequences, miRNA targeting) on genome encoding (<xref rid="vey021-B74" ref-type="bibr">Thurner et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B77" ref-type="bibr">Watts et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">De Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>Much remains to be learned to understand the multiple mechanisms that shape synonymous codon usage and its contribution to the attenuation process during re-encoding. In this exploratory work, we defined several types of silent mutations and sought to identify which one(s) had the least detrimental impact on viral replicative fitness. In the future, such silent changes could be introduced in large numbers along the genome of vaccine candidates. YFV provides a suitable experimental model because (1) the virus can be produced conveniently and modified using the Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons (ISA) reverse genetics method (<xref rid="vey021-B4" ref-type="bibr">Aubry et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) and (2) an excellent animal model of infection exists in juvenile Syrian Golden hamsters, to enable the comparison of wild-type and re-encoded strains <italic>in vivo</italic>. This model was established in our laboratory using the <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived, YF <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain (<xref rid="vey021-B36" ref-type="bibr">Klitting et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>) derived from the previously described hamster-virulent YF <italic>Asibi</italic>/hamster p7 strain (<xref rid="vey021-B47" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>). When inoculated into hamsters, both strains induce a disease with features close to that of the human disease.</p><p>Starting with a bioinformatic analysis of flaviviral genomes, we defined several types of mutations and used them for the design of eight re-encoded sequences. The re-encoded viruses were derived from the wild-type <italic>Asibi</italic> strain and the hamster-adapted <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain, with which they were compared both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> through fitness assays, infection assays and complete genome deep-sequencing. Although only the most heavily re-encoded virus (741 mutations) showed an observable decrease in replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic>, a range of attenuation levels was observed for the re-encoded variants when tested <italic>in vivo</italic>. The lowest impact was observed for strains that were re-encoded with transitions that did not include new CpG/UpA dinucleotides. In addition, we showed that the strains with the most attenuated phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic> could induce robust protective immunity in hamsters following challenge with the lethal YF <italic>Ap7M</italic> virus.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

(2013)</xref> observed a decrease in CHIKV replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic>, using 264&#x02013;882 mutations located within the NSp1, NSp4 and/or envelope protein encoding regions. Clear <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation of TBEV was achieved by <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">de Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. (2015</xref>) using as few as 273 mutations located in the NS5 coding region.</p><p>Based on those results, we defined a framework for the design of YFV re-encoded strains. For each variant, we used a maximum of 350 synonymous mutations (<italic>ca.</italic> one change for every ten nucleotides). We chose to re-encode the region located within the coding sequences of proteins NS2A to NS4B, so that re-encoding would not affect the structural proteins, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or the highly structured, 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the genome. The highly re-encoded variant rTs4 was reconstructed by the addition of 388 synonymous mutations in the NS5 encoding region. In all cases, the structural proteins encoding sequence remained unchanged, which was an advantage as the production of hamster-virulent YFV variants required the use of a modified E protein sequence. To lower the risk of major detrimental effects of re-encoding (e.g., disruption of cis-acting sequences), we analysed an alignment of thirty-five YFV complete coding sequences (CDS) and defined only synonymous sites for which at least one mutation could be observed as eligible for re-encoding. These will be referred to as &#x02018;editable sites&#x02019;. Finally, we avoided creating or removing any rare codons during the re-encoding process (see definition in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Protocols S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.1.2 Re-encoding strategies</title><p>Following <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of flaviviral genomes, we defined two major types of synonymous mutations (see below). The creation of additional TCG trinucleotide patterns was considered a &#x02018;specific&#x02019; type of mutation. In the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, TCG trinucleotides are frequent in Insect-Specific Flavivirus (ISF) genomes and sparse in both No Known Vector virus (NKV) and arbovirus genomes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). In addition, this pattern may enhance the innate immunity in vertebrate cells, as suggested by Greenbaum, Jimenez-Baranda and colleagues (<xref rid="vey021-B24" ref-type="bibr">Greenbaum, Rabadan, and Levine 2009</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B32" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Baranda et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). &#x02018;Specific&#x02019; mutations also included the creation of CpG and UpA dinucleotides, which were the least frequently introduced dinucleotides (CpG and UpA) in YFV species (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Results</xref>). This is in accordance with the previous observation of dinucleotide bias in the genomes of many viruses, in a fashion that was suggested to, at least partly, mirror the dinucleotide usage of their host(s) <xref rid="vey021-B34" ref-type="bibr">(Karlin, Doerfler, and Cardon 1994</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B64" ref-type="bibr">Rima and McFerran 1997</xref>). In vertebrates, CpG dinucleotide bias is commonly seen as the consequence of cytosine methylation-deamination (<xref rid="vey021-B7" ref-type="bibr">Bird 1980</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B37" ref-type="bibr">Kow 2002</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B69" ref-type="bibr">Simmen 2008</xref>) and the detection of such patterns may be a part of the host-defence mechanism against non-self RNA (<xref rid="vey021-B33" ref-type="bibr">Johnson 1970</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B42" ref-type="bibr">Leyssen et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). The introduction of CpG and UpA dinucleotides has been frequently used in re-encoding studies (<xref rid="vey021-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B75" ref-type="bibr">Tulloch et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gaunt et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B78" ref-type="bibr">Witteveldt, Martin-Gans, and Simmonds 2016</xref>). By contrast, &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; types of mutations did not cause any increase in CpG/UpA dinucleotides.

Aside from the highly re-encoded rTs4 virus, all Asibi-derived re-encoded viruses were designed with 100&#x02013;400 mutations located between positions 3,924 and 6,759 of YF <italic>Asibi</italic> complete coding sequence (CDS). First, YFV rTs3 was designed by introducing exclusively &#x02018;simple&#x02019; transitions (siTs) into the target region, within the CDS of the reference strain <italic>Asibi</italic> (AY640589). The term &#x02018;simple&#x02019; refers to synonymous, non-specific (no CpG/UpA introduction) mutations located outside putative secondary structures. YFV rTs3 included 353 substitutions, that is, the highest possible number that could be introduced into the target region. All other re-encoded viruses except YFV rTCG were designed starting from the rTs3 virus by (1) reverting some of the siTs back to the original sequence (rTs1, rTs2), or (2) substituting some of the siTs for a different type of mutation (rUA, rCG, rSS, and rN). The rationale for this design procedure was to obtain viruses that could be compared one to another, as they would share a common background of mutations.</p><p>Overall the nine initial re-encoded viruses were designed as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>YFV rTs1, rTs2, and rTs3, include increasing numbers of &#x02018;simple&#x02019; transitions (siTs).</p></list-item><list-item><p>YFV rSS includes non-specific transitions on sites corresponding to putative secondary structures (SII-Ts).</p></list-item><list-item><p>YFV rUA and rCG include transitions leading to an increase in the number of UpA or CpG dinucleotides into the viral sequence (UA- and CG-Ts), respectively.</p></list-item><list-item><p>YFV rN includes both transitions and transversions, some of which lead to the introduction of eighty-three UpA and fifty-four CpG dinucleotides into the viral sequence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>YFV rTCG includes transitions leading to an increase in the number of TCG dinucleotides into the viral sequence (TCG-Ts). Importantly, this strain was not derived from rTs3 and exclusively includes TCG-Ts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>YFV rTs4 includes 388 additional siTs that were introduced into the genome of rTs3 virus, between positions 6,846 and 9,765 (in CDS).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Finally, eight hamster-adapted re-encoded strains were created from the <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived variants (other than the heavily re-encoded rTs4 virus) by introducing exactly the same mutations in the CDS of the hamster-virulent, YFV <italic>Ap7M</italic> virus. For all re-encoded viruses, the design is further detailed in the &#x02018;Section 4&#x02019;.</p><p>Following re-encoding, the GC% and Effective Number of Codons (ENC) were calculated for each sequence and compared with those obtained from a dataset of thirty-five YFV genome sequences (non-vaccine strains) using SSE software (v1.3) (<xref rid="vey021-B70" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds 2012</xref>). Apart from the most re-encoded, rTs4 (GC%: 52.3%; ENC: 52.1), all the other strains fell within the YFV species range in terms of both GC% (48.9&#x02013;50.5%) and ENC (52.4&#x02013;54.7).

No consensus mutation was taken into account with a coverage lower than 50 reads.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>During virus production, sequence variability could arise as an artefact of the production method itself (PCR amplification of DNA fragments) and as the result of the adaptation of re-encoded strains to culture conditions.</p><p>No consensus mutation associated with a major variant was identified in the genome of the parent strain YFV <italic>Asibi</italic>, which only included twelve minor variants. In re-encoded genome sequences, low numbers of consensus mutations were observed, ranging from zero to six, with a mean of two consensus changes/virus and 39 per cent of non-synonymous (NS) mutations on an average. Consensus mutations were equally distributed between re-encoded and non-re-encoded regions and, nearly no convergence was observed between viral sequences. Only two viral sequences (YFV rTs2 and rCG) had consensus mutation reversions. One was common to both strains and corresponded to a siTs mutation (C to T), at CDS position 5,430. The two others were also siTs mutation reversions (C to T and A to G, respectively), located at CDS positions 5,442 and 5,667 of YFV rTs2 and rCG, respectively. The absence of consensus NS change in the sequence of the original <italic>Asibi</italic> strain and the very limited convergence between viral sequences are in accordance with the low number (3) of <italic>in cellulo</italic> passages. This strongly suggests that the consensus mutations observed in viruses YFV rTs3, rCG, rSS, and rTCG did not result from selective pressure due to culture conditions but may be artefacts of the production method.</p><p>The total numbers of variants, per virus, ranged from one to sixteen, with a mean of nine variants per virus. Interestingly, variants were most frequently observed outside the re-encoded regions (75 per cent of variants outside the re-encoded regions), similar to what was observed for the parental sequence, (92 per cent of variants outside the re-encoded region). The low number of reversions and the limited sequence variability at re-encoded sites accord with previous work showing that re-encoded CHIKV strains evolved mostly through compensatory mutations rather than mutation reversions (<xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2.2 <italic>In vitro</italic> replicative fitness</title><p>The infectious titre was estimated using a TCID<sub>50</sub> assay in BHK21 cells for both <italic>Asibi</italic> and <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived re-encoded strains using infectious cell supernatant medium (viral stock) (results detailed in <xref rid="vey021-T2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).

However, the least re-encoded virus, YFV rTs1 (101 mutations), was unexpectedly endowed with a remarkably low infectious titre (4&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) while the most re-encoded virus, YFV rTs4 (741 mutations), exhibited the lowest infectious titre (6&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL).</p><p>For each of the re-encoded viruses, the replicative fitness was compared with that of the wild-type strain using competition assays. Specific virus detection was achieved for one in two passages using next generation sequencing (NGS) methods by amplifying a 256 nucleotide region and counting virus-specific patterns within the read population. For all re-encoded viruses except rTs4 (&#x02264;353 mutations), replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic> was comparable to that of the <italic>Asibi</italic> strain: in all competitions, both competing viruses could still be detected at the tenth passage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey021-F2">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). By contrast, the highly re-encoded rTs4 virus (741 mutations) showed a clear reduction in replicative fitness and could not be detected after the fifth passage.

Three and four hamsters were euthanised at days three and six post-infection (dpi), respectively, to conduct virology investigations from liver samples, while the other five in each group were retained for evaluating mortality rate (endpoint in case of survival: 16&#x02009;dpi). Due to an issue in group dispatching, in the case of rTs2h strain, three hamsters were euthanised at 6&#x02009;dpi while six hamsters were used for mortality rate evaluation.

One hamster did not show any sign of illness, both its liver and blood were tested negative for YFV genomes and it was excluded from analysis. A high mortality rate (80 per cent) was observed, similar to previous observations (<xref rid="vey021-B36" ref-type="bibr">Klitting et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>). Clinical signs of the disease appeared as early as 4&#x02009;dpi and all animals died within 2/3&#x02009;days after onset of the symptoms. Weight loss was not observed at 3&#x02009;dpi (mean of %IW: 97 per cent), but between 3 and 6&#x02009;dpi, significant weight losses were recorded (mean of %IW: 71 per cent, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value = 0.00032). All livers were found to be YFV-positive by qRT-PCR, with viral RNA loads ranging between 6&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup> and 6&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> RNA copies per gram of liver and no significant difference between the viral yields at 3 and 6&#x02009;dpi (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values &#x0003e;0.05). No consensus change was detected in the viral sequence after propagation in hamsters.</p><p>A reduction in mortality rate was observed in all groups infected with re-encoded viruses. For most (YFV rTs1h, rUAh, rCGh, rSSh, rNh, and rTCGh), the reduction was significant (Logrank test, P values&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03960 in all cases), as no hamsters died. However, for YFV rTs2h and rTs3h, mortality was reduced but still observed (17 and 20 per cent, respectively; Logrank test, P values&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05820 and 0.07186).</p><p>Regardless of the observed mortality rate, clinical signs of illness were observed with varying degrees of severity among groups. No association was observed between mortality and weight evolution at 3 or 6&#x02009;dpi, with non-lethal viruses inducing limited (rNh, rTs1h) as well as severe weight loss (rCGh, rSSh) in infected hamsters. At 3&#x02009;dpi, weight evolution was heterogeneous but not significantly different from what was observed in <italic>Ap7M</italic>-infected group (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). An increase up to 7 per cent was observed in YFV rTs1h, rTs2h, and rTs3h-infected groups, a slight decrease (between 3 and 4 per cent) in groups infected with YFV rUAh, rNh, and rTCGh, and a greater decrease up to 11 per cent, in YFV rCGh and rSSh-infected groups. At 6&#x02009;dpi, an important weight loss was observed in most groups (up to 38 per cent) except rTs1h and rNh-infected groups, in which significantly higher %IW values were recorded (8 and 4 per cent, respectively, (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P values&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00088 and 0.00062, respectively)).</p><p>An increase of viral yields at 3 and 6&#x02009;dpi was not associated with mortality rates. At 3&#x02009;dpi, viral loads in the liver were close to values observed with YF <italic>Ap7M</italic>, with values ranging from 7&#x000d7;10<sup>8</sup> to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup> RNA copies per gram of liver. At 6&#x02009;dpi, viral loads remained close to those observed with <italic>Ap7M</italic>. However, in some cases (YFV rTs1h and rNh), significantly lower viral loads were observed (means of 5 and 8&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>, respectively. Wilcoxon rank sum test, P value= 0.03038 in both cases).</p><p>Several possibilities can explain the apparent absence of association between mortality and the evolution of viral loads. First, significant reduction in viral loads were always associated with a complete loss of lethality (for viruses rNh and rTs1h), hence they were, to a reasonable extent, associated to pathogenesis. Furthermore, in terms of replicative fitness and thus, of viral loads, the threshold that corresponds with the loss of lethality may be subtle and undetectable under the experimental conditions used here. In addition, the viral loads that are reported here are RNA copy numbers and may not reflect the actual amount of infectious particles. Furthermore, they have been evaluated from liver samples and may be less sharply correlated with disease evolution than viral loads in the blood. In addition, variation between individual animals will contribute to the final outcome of the data. Finally, during YFV infection, it is likely that the pathogenesis involves an immunological component (<xref rid="vey021-B72" ref-type="bibr">Ter Meulen et&#x000a0;al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B5" ref-type="bibr">Barrett 2012</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B62" ref-type="bibr">Quaresma et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). Hence, levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be more closely associated with mortality than viral loads and weight evolution. Such criteria were not included in the experimental design.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.3 Evaluation of the phenotypic impact of re-encoding</title><p>Some conclusions can be drawn by analysing the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes of re-encoded viruses in light of the sequencing data obtained from infected hamsters liver samples (see details in <xref rid="vey021-T5" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;5</xref>). For example, the sequences obtained from the livers of hamsters infected with the control strain <italic>Ap7M</italic> did not include consensus mutations. This indicates that the sequence of the parent virus was stable under the experimental conditions and that adaptative mutations were not required for efficient replication <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.4 Impact of &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; re-encoding strategies</title><p>In general, low detrimental effects resulted from the introduction of simple transitions (siTs) (i.e., with no modification of predicted secondary structures) on the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of YFV. Strain rTs2h (247 siTs) was associated with mild attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic>, with a decreased mortality rate and a reduction in hamster weight loss at 6&#x02009;dpi but no significant change in the production of viral RNA (Wilcoxon rank sum, P values&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). As the viral sequence remained unchanged during the course of the experiments, the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype can be interpreted as being the result of genome re-encoding. rTs3h (353 siTs) and rTs1h (101 siTs) viruses, respectively, showed mild and strong attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic>. For both, consensus NS mutations associated with major variants arose during the <italic>in vivo</italic> infections possibly resulting from adaptation of the re-encoded viruses to the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions during the infection. However, they did not correspond with the recovery of an <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype similar to that of the parent strain <italic>Ap7M</italic>. Surprisingly, the least re-encoded strain, rTs1h (101 siTs) was more attenuated <italic>in vivo</italic> than the rTs2h strain, that included all rTs1h mutations plus 146 additional siTs. We observed a mild detrimental impact following the introduction of transitions at sites involved in predicted RNA secondary structures. The sequence of strain rSSh involved siTs as well as transitions located on predicted secondary RNA structures and remained stable throughout the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The variant showed a partially attenuated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> (complete loss of mortality, no alleviation in weight loss or viral loads) that can thus be attributed to this second re-encoding strategy. Overall, these results illustrate the relative efficiency of the use of &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; transitions in providing a stable re-encoded infectious genome exhibiting <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3.5 Impact of &#x02018;specific&#x02019; re-encoding strategies</title><p>Variants with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides exhibited attenuated phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>, with no mortality, alleviated weight loss and no reduction in viral loads. For variant rUAh (fifty-nine UpA), the sequence remained stable throughout the <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Hence, the attenuation resulted from the original sequence re-encoding. The originally modified sequence of variant rCGh (fifty-nine CpG) remained constant and consensus NS changes were associated with major variants arising during the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Such consensus mutations are likely to be adaptive but did not result in complete recovery of virulence during the <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Altogether, these results are consistent with the attenuating effect of the introduction of CpG/UpA dinucleotides into viral genomes as reported on previous occasions (<xref rid="vey021-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B75" ref-type="bibr">Tulloch et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gaunt et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B78" ref-type="bibr">Witteveldt, Martin-Gans, and Simmonds 2016</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the sequence of the stock variant rTCGh (118 TCG) differed from that of the original construct. To conclude, with respect to the compensatory role of the consensus NS mutations that arose during strain production, further experiments would be required. Nevertheless, the attenuated phenotype (loss of lethality, alleviation of weight loss) of the re-encoded viruses following infection in hamsters suggests a detrimental effect of increasing TCG trinucleotides on YFV virulence <italic>in vivo</italic> that was not completely outweighed by the presence of additional consensus NS changes. Hence, the introduction of TCGs may impact on the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of YFV following infection in vertebrate hosts. Of note, a recent study by <xref rid="vey021-B55" ref-type="bibr">Moratorio et&#x000a0;al. (2017</xref>) highlighted the adverse effect of the introduction of codons that are likely to yield stop codons (referred to as &#x02018;1-to-Stop codons&#x02019;) on the fitness of Influenza A and Coxsackie B3 viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Namely, these 1-to-Stop codons are UUA, UUG, UCA, and UCG. Only twenty-eight additional UCG were identified within the sequence of YFV rTCG (which was the only re-encoded virus for which there was a change in the number of 1-to-Stop codons). This is four- to eight-fold lower compared with what was introduced into the genomes of Coxsackie B3 (117 codons) and Influenza A (205 codons) viruses.

Discussion</title><p>Genome re-encoding through synonymous codon replacement is a recognised procedure for attenuating RNA viruses including poliovirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, chikungunya virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and dengue virus (<xref rid="vey021-B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B57" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">De Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B45" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>). Additional insights into the mechanisms contributing to attenuation of the virus phenotype following synonymous codon replacement should prove valuable for the custom design of, viable, safe, cost-effective vaccine candidates. The initial purpose of this work was to identify the types of synonymous mutations that would impose the least detrimental effect on viral replicative fitness. Previous codon re-encoding studies in our laboratory were achieved for two other arboviruses, CHIKV and TBEV (<xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">De Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>). In the light of this experience, we planned an exploratory study of the effects of re-encoding on both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes of yellow fever virus (YFV). Our choice was motivated by the availability of a suitable reverse genetics system for re-encoded strains of YFV production, viz., the ISA method (<xref rid="vey021-B4" ref-type="bibr">Aubry et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>) and a robust YF hamster model (<xref rid="vey021-B47" ref-type="bibr">McArthur et&#x000a0;al. 2003</xref>). Hence, we could test first the <italic>in vitro</italic>, and then the <italic>in vivo</italic> replicative fitness of our strains before using some of the live-attenuated candidates for hamster immunisation studies.</p><p>Here, we have described the direct impact of synonymous substitutions on YFV replicative phenotype both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. As previously described with TBEV (<xref rid="vey021-B15" ref-type="bibr">De Fabritus et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>), the level of re-encoding necessary to observe viral attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic> was lower than that required to obtain an observable decrease in replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic>. As further suggested by supplementary, basic, growth curve experiments (data not shown), all re-encoded strains with only one re-encoded fragment (101&#x02013;350 mutations) maintained a replicative phenotype close to that of the parental <italic>Asibi</italic> strain <italic>in vitro</italic>. Only YFV rTs4, that included an additional re-encoded fragment (741 mutations in total), showed a severe reduction in replicative fitness <italic>in vitro</italic>. Previous works on Poliovirus, Echovirus, RSV, Influenza, HIV, CHIKV, DENV, and Marek&#x02019;s disease virus (<xref rid="vey021-B10" ref-type="bibr">Burns et&#x000a0;al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B58" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B46" ref-type="bibr">Martrus et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B41" ref-type="bibr">Le Nouen et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B68" ref-type="bibr">Shen et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B14" ref-type="bibr">Conrad et&#x000a0;al. 2018</xref>) brought evidence that the effect of synonymous mutations may vary according to the location within the viral sequence. Hence, a control, <italic>Asibi</italic>-derived virus including only the additional re-encoded fragment (388 mutations in the NS5) was produced. Contrarily to the viruses re-encoded in the NS2-3-4 region, it showed a decrease in replicative fitness during competition experiments (outcompeted by the wild-type virus at passage no. 10). As three consensus non-synonymous mutations (associated to major variants) arose in the viral sequence during the production of this virus, it is not possible to associate the <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype to the re-encoding in the NS5 protein rather than to the additional, consensus, non-synonymous mutations. However, this suggests that in the case of YFV, re-encoding may have a greater effect in the polymerase gene than in other non-structural proteins. In contrast with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results, we observed a broad range of levels of attenuation among all the strains that were tested in hamsters (101&#x02013;350 mutations). While the least attenuated viruses showed no observable loss of replicative fitness and retained a degree of lethality, the most attenuated viruses displayed a complete loss of lethality, together with a ten-fold reduction in viral loads in the liver and significant alleviation of weight loss. We did not produce nor test a hamster-adapted version of the rTs4 strain because such a heavily re-encoded virus would have been unlikely to achieve infection <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In contrast with previously published re-encoding studies, we performed deep sequencing of infected hamster liver homogenates to correlate precisely each viral sequence(s) with the observed phenotype. Our results indicate that, detailed genetic information and in particular, that retrieved from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, is critical to determine the significance of synonymous substitutions within the attenuation process. When monitoring the evolution of YFV re-encoded strains after production (i.e., transfection followed by three passages <italic>in vitro</italic>) or after one passage in hamsters, we observed the spontaneous emergence of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. These consensus changes may be artefacts of the production methods employed (PCR amplification of DNA fragments, stochastic evolution events) or they may have resulted from the adaptation of re-encoded viruses to the differing <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions of replication. In some cases, we observed the emergence of consensus non-synonymous mutations present in major variants of the viral stock used as the inoculum for <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. For these viruses, the analysis of the results from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and attempts to correlate them with sequencing data was limited due to consensus NS mutations which impeded the identification of the specific impact of silent mutations on the viral phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Several conclusions can be drawn regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypic impact of the different strategies used to produce re-encoded YFV strains.</p><p>First, the introduction of simple transitions (i.e., with no modification of putative secondary structures in the genomic RNA) on the replicative fitness of YFV had only minor impact on viral phenotype. They did not cause larger modification of GC%, ENC, Codon Adaptation index (to the homo sapiens codon usage) or in the proportion of codons that are more likely to yield stop codons (&#x02018;1-to-Stop codons&#x02019;, as defined by <xref rid="vey021-B55" ref-type="bibr">Moratorio et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>) than what can be observed among clinical/field isolates, indicating that additional mechanisms are probably involved in the attenuation process. Similarly, the introduction of transitions at sites involved in putative genomic secondary RNA structures had a relatively mild detrimental impact on replicative fitness. Second, contrary to secondary RNA structures that have been identified in the untranslated regions of YFV (<xref rid="vey021-B59" ref-type="bibr">Ng et&#x000a0;al. 2017</xref>) and other flaviviruses (<xref rid="vey021-B25" ref-type="bibr">Gritsun and Gould 2006</xref>, <xref rid="vey021-B26" ref-type="bibr">2007a</xref>,<xref rid="vey021-B27" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), the putative structures within the virus open reading frame appear unlikely to be important determinants of replicative fitness. Rather, role(s) in finely tuning the efficiency of translation (mRNA or co-translational folding) or in interactions with viral, and non-viral proteins have been proposed (<xref rid="vey021-B67" ref-type="bibr">Shabalina, Ogurtsov, and Spiridonov 2006</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B39" ref-type="bibr">Kudla et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B61" ref-type="bibr">Pechmann and Frydman 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that increase in CpG/UpA dinucleotides is an efficient attenuation mechanism (<xref rid="vey021-B3" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B75" ref-type="bibr">Tulloch et&#x000a0;al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B18" ref-type="bibr">Gaunt et&#x000a0;al. 2016</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B78" ref-type="bibr">Witteveldt, Martin-Gans, and Simmonds 2016</xref>) and this was supported by the evidence of a correlation between increased CpG/UpA and attenuation in our hamster models. However, the introduction of TCG trinucleotides affected the <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of YFV. <italic>In silico</italic> analysis predicted that such patterns are likely to be selected against in flaviviruses infecting vertebrates. In addition, studies on influenza virus produced evidence that CpG dinucleotides in an A/U context (e.g., TCG) may enhance virus detection by the host innate immune system (<xref rid="vey021-B23" ref-type="bibr">Greenbaum et&#x000a0;al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B24" ref-type="bibr">Greenbaum, Rabadan, and Levine 2009</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B32" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez-Baranda et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Such trinucleotides can be used to induce a host-dependent attenuation, as recently demonstrated for dengue virus (<xref rid="vey021-B68" ref-type="bibr">Shen et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B71" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et&#x000a0;al. 2015</xref>).</p><p>This study approach was exploratory. Hence, we chose to focus on the identification of mutations with low deleterious impact on <italic>in vivo</italic> replication and virulence of the yellow fever virus (YFV) rather than on the comprehensive characterisation of the biological mechanisms underlying the attenuation process (e.g., protein translation, RNA replication, activation of innate immunity). Mechanistic insights on the specific effect(s) of the new re-encoding strategies would be most valuable, to gain insight into the finer details of viral attenuation and to facilitate fine-tuning of re-encoded viruses for the specific requirements of their intended use.</p><p>The initial aim of this exploratory work was to identify types of mutation with limited detrimental impact on viral replicative fitness, usable for large scale genome re-encoding. In this regard, &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; transitions (i.e., with no CpG/UpA creation) represent the mutation type that best met our initial criteria. On this basis, we conclude that the introduction of transitions without CpG/UpA increase may constitute a ground rule for the custom-designed large-scale re-encoding of viral genomes. This does not rule out the possible use of mutations that increase the rate of CpG/UpA dinucleotides. We propose that using a limited number of such mutations may ensure that re-encoded genomes are relatively innocuous when tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, because these patterns ensure enhanced activation of host innate immunity. Thus, procedures combining large, pan-genomic non-specific re-encoding with limited bespoke CpG/UpA re-encoding should lead to the development of safe, stable, and effective live-attenuated vaccine viruses with finely tuned phenotypes.</p><p>In addition to deciphering the mechanisms of attenuation, evaluating the stability of viral re-encoded variants is a crucial objective for the development of vaccine candidates. Here, we observed no reversion to the parental <italic>Ap7M</italic> sequence of YFV re-encoded viruses when tested <italic>in vivo</italic> and virtually no reversion <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, for several re-encoded strains, the occurrence of consensus non-synonymous mutations in the sequences from the inoculum and/or hamster livers suggests that YFV re-encoded viruses may adapt and evolve both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The molecular evolution of viral re-encoded strains has already been described for HIV and CHIKV-derived strains <italic>in vitro</italic>. The occurrence of synonymous and non-synonymous consensus mutations correlated with partial recovery of (CHIKV) or full (HIV) WT replicative fitness (<xref rid="vey021-B46" ref-type="bibr">Martrus et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid="vey021-B60" ref-type="bibr">Nougairede et&#x000a0;al. 2013</xref>). In accordance with the observations made on CHIKV evolution <italic>in vitro</italic>, some re-encoded strains retained a strongly attenuated phenotype that was not outweighed by the emergence of adaptative consensus mutations. Altogether, these elements suggest that, in some cases, the accumulation of slightly detrimental mutations could trap the virus, with no alternative mutational pathway with which to enable complete restoration of replicative fitness.</p><p>As illustrated by the case of poliovirus vaccines, live-attenuated vaccine strains have the potential to evolve following inoculation and in cases of dissemination following vaccination. Hence, the development of re-encoded vaccine candidates should be accompanied by robust studies that address the potential fate of the variants <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, to the best of our knowledge, the evolutionary behaviour of re-encoded viruses <italic>in vivo</italic> has never been studied. Since convenient <italic>in vivo</italic> laboratory models and reverse genetics systems are available, potential live-attenuated YFV re-encoded vaccine candidates would provide a convenient experimental model for future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. In the studies described earlier, we focused mainly on YF variants re-encoded in one specific region of the genome (NS2A-NS4B). These studies were appropriate for our experimental objectives but would not be ideal for evolution studies. An optimised and more realistic design would rely on <italic>in vivo</italic> serial passage and deep sequencing characterisation of evenly distributed synonymous mutations, along the entire genome, each with low fitness impact. The major objective would be to assess the stability of re-encoded strains with synonymously modified codon compositions and in particular, their potential to evolve towards modified phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>4.

This strain was derived from <italic>Asibi</italic> by including ten mutations in the FI subgenomic region used for viral recovery with the ISA method. As we chose to target the FII subgenomic region for re-encoding, the <italic>Ap7M</italic> strain was well suited for testing the effects of re-encoding on the biological properties of viruses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Three-week-old female Syrian Golden hamsters were inoculated intra-peritoneally with 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> TCID50 of virus in a final volume of 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;L HBSS. In all experiments, a control group of two hamsters was kept uninfected. The clinical course of the viral infection was monitored by following (1) the clinical manifestation of the disease (brittle fur, dehydration, prostration, and lethargy), (2) weight evolution, and (3) death. Weight was expressed as a normalised percentage of initial weight (%IW) and calculated as follows:
