<p>Individual results yielded by WAg, NP and GP I-ELISAs in sera from 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD cases at different times post disease onset and using different cut-off values are given in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00678-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Irrespective of the cut-offs used, the results were similar for the same assay, but the NP I-ELISA was more sensitive in detecting IgG antibody during the first two weeks post disease onset compared to WAg and GP I-ELISAs, the latter being the least sensitive. For example, when using the TG-ROC derived threshold, of 335 EBOD patients bled during the two weeks post onset, 92 (27.5%), 114 (34%), and 75 (22.4%) were positive by WAg, NP, and GP I-ELISA, respectively. Mc Nemar test indicate a disagreement of diagnostic capacity (combined DSe and DSp) between NP and WAg (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0196) or GP I-ELISA (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002) respectively using all Sierra Leone data (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1099). Agreement was found between WAg and GP I-ELISA (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0707; 98.18% κ = 0.9300 ± 0.0348). Most of the discrepant (non-matching) results were recorded during the first two weeks post disease onset. After two weeks post onset, detection of IgG antibody and agreement between assays significantly improved. Of 88 sera tested 15–31 days post onset, all tested positive by WAg and NP I-ELISs irrespective of the cut-off used, and depending on the cut-off, 87 or 86 were positive by GP I-ELISA (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00678-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Mc Nemar test indicate agreement between NP, Wag and GP I-ELISAs ranging from 99.35% (κ = 0.9684 ± 0.0362) to 100% using data from non-EBOD and diseased patients bled on day 15 or later post-onset (
 <italic>n</italic> = 764), except for GP and Wag or NP I-ELISAs with the cut-offs of respectively 26.28, 13.53, 16.44 (
