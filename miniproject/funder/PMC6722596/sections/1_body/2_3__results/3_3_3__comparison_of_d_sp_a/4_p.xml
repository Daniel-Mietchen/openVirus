<p>Mean levels of IgG responses measured by WAg, NP, and GP I-ELISAs in 423 EBOD RT-PCR confirmed cases bled at different times after disease onset are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00678-f003">Figure 3</xref>. On average, the first seroconversions were detectable by NP on days 2–4, then on days 5–7 by NP and WAg, and from day 8 post onset by all I-ELISAs. The mean levels of IgG measured by all the I-ELISAs were not significantly different.
