<p>Estimates of D-Se in sera collected at different times post disease onset are given in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00678-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Between 8–36 days post onset, the D-Se ranged from 82.6% (GP I-ELISA) to 92.65 (NP I-ELISA). Between 15–36 days post onset, the D-Se was 100% for both WAg and NP I-ELISA irrespective of the cut-off used, and ranged from 97.7% to 98.9% for the GP I-ELISA.
