<p>Both within and between the runs, the C++ OD readings for WAg, NP and GP I-ELISAs were within the IQC lower (LCL) and upper (UCL) control limits. Within the runs, the average CV ranged between 3.54 ± 1.99 (NP I-ELISA) and 4.76 ± 2.16 (GP I-ELISA). Between the runs, the average CV ranged between 3.11 ± 1.05 (NP I-ELISA) and 4.8 ± 1.56 (GP I-ELISA) (

For WAg, NP, and GP I-ELISA, the IQC C− OD control limits ranged from −0.08 to 0.06, −0.08 to 0.09, 0.1 to 0.17, and the IQC Cc− OD control limits ranged from −0.05 to 0.06, −0.05 to 0.04, and 0.03 to 0.11, respectively.
