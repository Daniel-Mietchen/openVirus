<p>As highly accurate, robust and safe tests, the ELISAs based on recombinant EBOV antigens have a potential to replace traditional serological diagnostic methods which pose health risks thus necessitating their use only in high biocontainment facilities. Practically simple viral inactivation protocols evaluated in our study do not alter measurable levels of anti EBOV-IgG, thus together with recombinant antigen based ELISAs provide a safe testing application. Long-lasting IgG antibody makes their detection useful for epidemiological investigations.</p>
