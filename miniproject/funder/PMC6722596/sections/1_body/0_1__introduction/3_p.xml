<p>Recombinant filoviral nucleoprotein (NP) is an ideal target for ELISAs due to their high immunogenicity and abundance in infected cells [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The NPs of filoviruses are highly conserved [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and ELISAs based on recombinant EBOV NP antigens have been reported to cross-react with sera from humans and animals infected with different filovirus species [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recombinant NPs are therefore useful for genus-specific screening ELISAs where the specific filovirus species with which a patient is infected is unknown [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The glycoprotein (GP) is another ideal antigen for filovirus ELISAs as it contains epitopes known to be targets for filovirus-neutralizing antibody responses [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Contrary to the NP, the GP is highly diverse [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and is useful for ELISAs where the main purpose is to detect species-specific filoviral antibodies.
