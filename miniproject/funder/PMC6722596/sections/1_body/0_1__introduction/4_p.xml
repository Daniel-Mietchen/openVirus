<p>Recombinant protein-based ELISAs for filoviruses were first developed by Prehaud and colleagues in 1998 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The assays made use of either recombinant NP antigens expressed in an 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) system, or recombinant GP antigens expressed in a baculovirus-
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9) cell expression system. The antigens reacted positively with sera from previously EBOV-infected human patients [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, recombinant antigens expressed in a bacterial expression system are often problematic due to a lack of molecular folding and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Recombinant antigens expressed in baculovirus-insect cell systems prevail over some of the problems presented by those expressed in bacterial expression systems, but the antigenic properties of these antigens may be considerably affected by the differing glycosylation pathways between insect and mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, Nakayama and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] developed the first filovirus ELISAs based on recombinant Histidine-tagged GP expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells using the mammalian expression vector pCAGGS-MCS [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Vu and colleagues developed, optimized, and evaluated a similar ELISA for the quantification of antibodies to EBOV in vaccinated non-human primates, but human samples were unavailable for testing [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A field-validated ELISA based on commercially available recombinant EBOV GP has been reported for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in oral fluid [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, due to the lower sensitivity of oral fluid-based assays compared to serum-based assays, there is a risk of misdiagnosing patients with a low oral concentration of anti-EBOV IgG.
