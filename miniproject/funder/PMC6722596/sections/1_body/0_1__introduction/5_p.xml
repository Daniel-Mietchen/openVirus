<p>Although a number of new generation filovirus serological assays have been developed in recent years, none have been adequately validated to date for the detection of IgG in sera from EBOV-infected humans. This is largely due to the difficulty in obtaining panels of clinical material sufficient in size to allow for statistically sound evaluation. Nevertheless, the validation of serological assays and determination of their basic diagnostic performance parameters are essential for reporting diagnostic results, comparing patient results between different diagnostic laboratories, evaluating ELISA efficacies, determining seroprevalence rates, infection risk population studies, and assessing occurrence of asymptomatic infections [
