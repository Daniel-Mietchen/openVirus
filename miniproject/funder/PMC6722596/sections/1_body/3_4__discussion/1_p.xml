<p>The diagnostic decision limit or cut-off represents a serological assay test value used to dichotomize negative and positive results, and by inference, to define the infection status of an individual against a specific pathogen of disease. The relevance of data used for the determination of cut-off consequently impacts on estimates of D-Se and D-Sp and other measures of test performance [

Important consideration in determining a serological assay cut-off is to select sera from unequivocally infected individuals and sera from individuals who have never been infected with the agent in question. Also, in order to account for the distribution of covariate factors (genetic, nutritional, geographical, and stage of infection) that may influence the estimates of D-Se and D-Sp, the target population should preferably be sampled using simple random, systematic or stratified sampling methods [

An assay validation data should preferably be derived not only from testing samples from reference individuals of known history and infection status but also from the country or region in which the test is to be used. Traditionally, gold standards for selection of truly infected and uninfected subjects include isolation of the agent or pathognomonic histopathological criteria. Because a true gold standard is difficult to accomplish, relative standards of comparison are often necessary, and include results from other serological assays [

In order to ensure EBOV true infection status of individuals whose sera were used in our study, RT-PCR negative sera that tested negative for anti-EBOV IgG by all IgG ELISAs using cut-offs derived from SA IgG EBOV negative reference serum panel were regarded as SL reference negative serum panel. Serum specimens from the SL EBOV RT-PCR positive patients with known dates of disease onset were regarded as SL reference positive serum panel.
