<p>It has previously been reported that the use of single filoviral proteins as antigens is disadvantageous for filovirus serology [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Sera from patients infected with EBOV contain antibodies to several viral proteins and therefore might display reduced activity or later seroconversion in ELISAs based on a single recombinant antigen [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Results of our study indicate that anti-EBOV NP IgG is detectable earlier then anti-EBOV GP IgG antibody during the first week post disease onset. This is likely due to higher abundance of this highly immunogenic protein in infected cells [
