<p>I-ELISA, represents one of the simplest ELISA formats, but can be difficult to validate because of signal amplification of both specific and non-specific components [

For these reasons, to determine the specific binding of antibody, sera should be tested with both a specific viral antigen and its corresponding control or comparison antigen to account for possible non-specific background activity. The GP I-ELISA evaluated in our study was based on a commercially available recombinant GP for which a negative control could not be obtained. Compared to WAg and NP I-ELISAs, which included control antigens, the higher GP I-ELISA test values in EBOV negative serum panels and consequently the higher PP cut-off values derived for this assay are likely due to not having a control antigen. Due to inherent differences amongst assay systems, binding-antibody levels should be expressed in relative rather than absolute terms. One of the advantages of using PP values as a measure of antibody activity in the I-ELISA is that this method of OD readings conversion does not assume a uniform background activity, and therefore it is also more suitable for inter-laboratory standardization [
