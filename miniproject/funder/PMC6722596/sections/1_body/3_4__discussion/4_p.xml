<p>The first ELISAs for the detection of antibodies to EBOV were based on whole antigen prepared from infected cell lysate [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and variations of this assay are still widely used in diagnostic and research laboratories [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While whole filovirus antigens can be relatively easily produced in large volumes, their preparation pose health risks, restricting their production to biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities. These facilities are not only very expensive to construct and operate, but also are not easily available or accessible for countries where fatal filoviruses are endemic. In addition, the binding of antibodies to cellular contaminants present in EBOV-infected cell lysates may lead to cross-reactivity, resulting in reduced specificity [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. High quality filovirus recombinant protein antigens can be safely prepared without the need for high BSL-4 biocontainment facilities and outside EBOV endemic areas. Their use in ELISA has potential to reduce the risk of false positive results and allows for better standardization [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Testing clinical specimens potentially containing a BSL-4 viral agent presents a serious biohazard. While a number of inactivation methods were shown to completely inactivate EBOV [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], they also markedly alter the protein components in human blood, e.g., enzymes and coagulation factors [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Results of viral inactivation protocols evaluated in our study indicate that they do not alter detectable levels of anti EBOV-IgG, thus together with recombinant antigen based ELISAs, provide a safe and reliable testing platform.
