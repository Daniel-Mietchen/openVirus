<p>Evaluation of the efficacy of filovirus vaccines and therapeutics require monitoring of immune responses that correlate with protection and survival using reliable and reproducible serological methods. Anti-EBOV GP IgG ELISA was recently shown to reproducibly quantify levels of anti-EBOV IgG antibodies in sera from EBOD survivors and immunized individuals [

The NP IgG I-ELISA evaluated in this study has a potential to be used for testing immunity and evaluating protection against natural EBOV exposure in individuals immunized with EBOV GP-based vaccines or receiving anti-EBOV GP passive immunization.
