<p>Various statistical analyses used in our study for the selection of the cut-off values provided similar results. A cut-off value determined as two or three SD above the mean in uninfected individuals is frequently used for the interpretation of serodiagnostic tests. However, this assumes a normal distribution of the test values in population targeted by an assay, and provides only an estimate of D-Sp [

Therefore, we also used the TG-ROC analysis for the selection and optimization of cut-off values to account for parametric versus nonparametric distribution of test values. All I-ELISAs evaluated in our study had high estimates of D-Sp, but the D-Se was dependent on the time when the serum was taken post disease onset. High detection rate of anti-EBOV IgG in RT-PCR EBOV confirmed cases was only recorded after two weeks post disease onset. Results of previous study in a small number of the 1995 EBOD patients in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo, suggested that many patients do not have antibody early in the course of their illness, and that many may die without developing detectable antibodies to EBOV. Therefore, measurement of IgG antibody is of rather limited use in the diagnosis of acute EBOD cases [
