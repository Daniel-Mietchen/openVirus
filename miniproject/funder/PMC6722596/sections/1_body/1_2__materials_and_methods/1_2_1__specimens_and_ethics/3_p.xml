<p>In total, 1099 sera obtained from SL patients suspected of having EBOD between August 2014 and March 2015 [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] were used. Of those sera 423 were from EBOV RT-PCR confirmed cases for whom date of disease onset was recorded on EBOD case submission form. Ribonucleic acid from blood was extracted using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as per the manufacturer’s instructions using previously described primers and probes targeting the EBOV L gene [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Specimens with 
 <italic>Ct</italic> values below 40 were considered positive for EBOV RNA [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and thus confirming EBOV infectious status of a patient. Serum specimens from the SL EBOV RT-PCR positive patients were regarded as SL reference positive serum panel.
