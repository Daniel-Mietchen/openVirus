<p>To evaluate the effect of serum inactivation on the levels of the detectable anti-EBOV IgG by WAg, NP and GP I-ELISAs, laboratory protocols previously shown to completely inactivate EBOV virus in human serum were used [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, the C++ was first diluted 1:10 in PBS containing either 0.5% Triton X-100 or 0.5% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkichen, Germany) and heated at 60 °C for 15 min. Then, two-fold log
