<p>Optimisation of cut-off values by MCT TG-ROC was based on the following equation: MCT = (1-p) (1-Sp) + rp (1-Se), where p (prevalence) = 0.5 and r (cost of false-positive and false-negative results) = 1.0. I-ELISAs diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) were calculated as follows [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]: DSe = [TP/(TP + FN)] × 100; DSp = [TN/(TN + FP)] × 100; where TP = true positive sera (true EBOD patients), FN = false-negative sera (confirmed infected EBOD patients that tested negative), TN = true negative sera (individuals that truly are negative for EBOD), FP = false-positive (individuals negative for EBOD that test positive). Using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), we obtained DSe and DSp statistics with their 95% confidence intervals for each of the diagnostic tests.
