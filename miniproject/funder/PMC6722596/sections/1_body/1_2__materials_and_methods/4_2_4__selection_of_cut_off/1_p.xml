<p>Cut-off values were determined as mean +3 standard deviations (SD) of PP values recorded in SA and SL IgG EBOV negative serum panels and also selected at 95% accuracy level by the misclassification cost term (MCT) option of the two-graph receiver operating characteristics (TG-ROC) analysis available from Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA, USA) [
