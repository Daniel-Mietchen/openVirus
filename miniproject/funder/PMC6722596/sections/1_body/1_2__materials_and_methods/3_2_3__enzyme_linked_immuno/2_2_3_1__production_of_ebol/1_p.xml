<p>The EBOV whole antigen (WAg) was produced as previously described with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Vero C1008 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were infected with the SPU 220/96 isolate of EBOV (4th passage in Vero cells) isolated from the serum of a nurse who contracted a fatal infection from a Gabonese physician admitted to a private hospital in South Africa in 1996 [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After incubation at 37 °C when cytopathic effect was observed, cells and supernatant were collected and snap freeze-thawed at −70 °C and 37 °C. Lysed cells and supernatant were separated by centrifugation (10,000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4 °C, 15 min). The collected supernatant was gamma irradiated with 30,000 Gy to inactivate the virus. Saturated ammonium sulphate solution (100%) (Sigma Aldrich, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) was slowly added with constant stirring to the irradiated supernatant to a final concentration of 35%, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The antigen-containing pellet precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 20,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in one tenth of the original supernatant volume of phospate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2. The antigen was further dialysed against PBS to remove the ammonium suphate (3–4 buffer changes). The WAg preparation was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Uninfected Vero C1008 cells were prepared in the same way and used as control antigen.
