<p>Optimal immunoreagents concentrations/working dilutions for I-ELISA were determined using standard checkerboard titration procedures [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Microtiter 96-wells plates (Maxisorb Immunoplates, Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) for WAg, NP, and GP I-ELISAs were respectively coated with WAg and corresponding control antigen, NP and corresponding control antigen or with GP. For WAg and NP I-ELISAs virus and control antigens were added to rows of the top half of the plate (rows A–D:1–12) and the bottom half of the plate (rows E–H: 1–12), respectively. For GP I-ELISA all rows (rows A–H: 1–12) were coated with the commercial GP for which control antigen was not available. The NP and corresponding control antigen were diluted 1:2000 (stock concentration 0.4 mg/mL) in carbonate–bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. All the other antigens were diluted in phosphate PBS without Mg and Ca, pH 7.4; WAg and uninfected Vero C1008 cell culture antigen was diluted 1:300 and the GP was diluted 1:6000 (stock concentration 3.83 mg/mL).
