<p>Each 96-well plate had four replicates of positive serum control (C++), two replicates of negative serum control (C−) and two replicates of conjugate control (Cc). For WAg and NP I-ELISA C++ was added to wells A 1–2 and B 1–2 coated with virus antigen and to corresponding wells E 1–2 and F 1–2 coated with a control antigen. Accordingly, C− was added to C 1–2 and G 1–2, and Cc (diluent buffer) was added to D 1–2 and H 1–2. The remaining wells (A–D 3–12 and E–H 3–12) were used for testing 20 test sera in duplicate with test serum no. 1 added to wells A3 and B3 and corresponding E3 and F3; adding of the remaining test sera followed the same layout principle. For GP I-ELISA, not having control antigen, internal controls were placed as follows: C++ in wells A 1–2 and B 1–2; C− in wells C 1–2; Cc in wells D 1–2. The remaining wells (A–D 3–12 and E–H 1–12) were used for testing 44 test sera in duplicate with test serum no. 1 added to wells A3 and B3 and accordingly test serum no. 44 added to wells G12 and H12.</p>
