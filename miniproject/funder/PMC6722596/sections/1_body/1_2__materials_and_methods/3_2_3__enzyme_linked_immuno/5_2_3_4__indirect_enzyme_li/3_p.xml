<p>All reagents were added to the immunoplates at a volume of 100 µL/well unless otherwise stated. Passive adsorption onto ELISA plates was performed at 4 °C overnight and all subsequent incubations (except for substrate addition) were performed at 37 °C in a humidified chamber for 1 h. Following coating, plates were washed 3 times with 300 µL of PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20; the same washing procedure followed each subsequent stage of I-ELISAs. Plates were blocked with 200 µL 10% non-fat milk powder in PBS. After incubation, plates were washed, and control and test sera diluted 1:400 in 2% non-fat milk powder in PBS (diluent buffer) were added. Each test serum, negative control serum and conjugate control was tested in duplicate, and positive control was tested in quadruplicate. Following incubation with the sera, the plates were washed and goat anti-human IgG HRPO conjugate (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), diluted 1:10,000 in diluent buffer, was added to the wells. After incubation, plates were washed and 2,2’-azinodiethylbenzothiazoline sulfonic acid (ABTS) peroxidase (Seracare Lifesciences, Milford, MA, USA) substrate added to wells. Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature (±22 °C) for 30 min.</p>
