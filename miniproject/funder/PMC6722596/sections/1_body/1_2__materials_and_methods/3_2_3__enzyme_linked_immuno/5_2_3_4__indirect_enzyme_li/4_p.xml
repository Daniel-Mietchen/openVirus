<p>Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the optical densities (OD) readings were measured at 405 nm. OD readings were converted into a percentage of the positive internal control serum (PP) using the equation as previously described [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00678" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, a specific activity of each serum (net OD) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific background OD in the wells with control antigen from the OD in wells with virus antigen (for NP and WAg I-ELISA only). The mean net OD readings were converted to PP using the formula: PP = (mean net of test serum/mean net OD of positive control) Ã— 100 [
