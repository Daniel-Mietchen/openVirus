<p>The codon optimized nucleotide sequence for EBOV nucleocapsid (NP) (GenBank accession number AF086833.2) was synthesized with a C-terminal glycine linker to a 6× Histidine tag (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and subcloned into the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-15b expression vector (Novagen, Merck, USA). The sequence verified plasmid (pET-15b ZEbov NP) was used to transform competent BL21 Star (DE3) 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. A starter culture was grown overnight at 37 °C, then diluted 10 fold and allowed to reach exponential-phase growth (OD
 <sub>600</sub> of between 0.6–0.8) before protein expression was induced using 1 mM IPTG (Sigma Aldrich, Merck, USA) for 20 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and lysed using a combination of Bugbuster and Lysonase (Novagen, Merck, USA) treatment, freeze-thaw cycles and sonication. The recombinant NP protein-containing soluble phase was collected by high speed centrifugation (15,000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 30 min, 4 °C) and loaded onto Profinity IMAC (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) cobalt-charged resin. The protein was left to bind overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C, using a ratio of 1 mL resin to 16 mL soluble protein fraction. Contaminating proteins were removed by washing the resin twice with 20 packed-resin volumes of sodium phosphate buffer containing 12.5 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), using gentle centrifugation (1000× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 2 min, 4 °C). The recombinant NP was then eluted overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C in 2 packed-resin volumes of sodium phosphate buffer containing 250 mM imidazole (pH 8.0). Eluted protein was dialysed into 0.05 M carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (Sigma Aldrich, Merck, USA). To remove any residual contaminating proteins, the purified protein was passed through a SEC 650 size exclusion column (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) and the fractions containing the NP were collected. Collected fractions were pooled and concentrated using Amicon Ultra filters (Millipore, Merck, USA) with a 50 kD cut-off. The purified NP was quantified using the Bradford Concentration Assay kit (Pierce, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and aliquots were stored at −70 °C for later use. For the control antigen, the same process was followed using an expression vector (pET-15b) without an insert.
