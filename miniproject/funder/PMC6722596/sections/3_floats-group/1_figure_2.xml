  <p>Optimization of cut-offs for Wag (
   <bold>A</bold>), nucleocapsid (
   <bold>B</bold>) and glycoprotein (
   <bold>C</bold>) ELISAs using the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis (TG-ROC). The insertion point of the sensitivity (Se, smooth line) and specificity (Sp, dashed line) graphs represents a cut-off PP value (13.53, 16.44 and 26.28, respectively) at which the highest and equivalent test parameters (Se = Sp) are achieved at 95% accuracy level. Using the misclassification cost term (MCT) option of the TG-ROC, at these cut-of values, the overall misclassification costs for WAg (
   <bold>A1</bold>), NP (
   <bold>B1</bold>), and GP ELISA (
   <bold>C1</bold>) become minimal (0.0003, 0.0069, 0.0001, respectively) under assumption of 50% disease prevalence and equal costs of false-positive and false-negative results. The two MCT curves represent values based on non-parametric (dashed line) or parametric (smooth line) estimates of Se and Sp derived from data sets analyzed. Optimization of cut-off values was based on the non-parametric program option due to departure from a normal distribution of data analyzed. Cut-off values are expressed as percentage positivity (PP) of an internal positive serum control.
