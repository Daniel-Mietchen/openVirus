<p>The (static) spatial and spatio-temporal pattern of HFMD and potential physical and socio-economic factors associated with the disease have been previously studied, but risk factors and population mobility are seldom considered in dynamics of HFMD. In our study, we employed wavelet time series analysis to characterize temporal dynamics of HFMD and modeled the disease transmission using an SEIR framework to investigate the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in two typical regions of Western and Eastern China. This is the first study, to our knowledge, that finds the phenomena of travelling waves for HFMD (i.e., the disease wave emanated from a center county and moved radially in each region).</p>
