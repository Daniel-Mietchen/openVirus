<p>The reproductive number (i.e., EA-RN) used in our analysis is largely different from those used in previous studies which typically make use of the basic reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) or the effective reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>). EA-RN takes into account all temporal and spatial factors that affect the exposure process and thus reflects the instant change of these factors on the infectious behavior of a disease. Further, EA-RN considers the nonlinear effect on the contact rate of the number of infectious individuals and is capable of overcoming under-specification of the exposure process (i.e., when some exposure factors are unknown or not available) [

 <sub>0</sub> or 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>. Therefore, we believe EA-RN is more suitable for epidemiological studies focused on disease control and prevention and should be recommended for use in the future.
