<p>Qinghai with sparsely population from Western China and Shanghai with densely population from Eastern China have marked geographic differences and different HFMD incidence, but their epidemiological characteristics of HFMD cases are largely similar (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The periodicity of HFMD is also different for Qinghai (period of one year) and Shanghai (annual and intermittent semi-annual periodicity), which is consistent with the general view of one annual peak (June) in Northern China and two peaks (May and September-October) in Southern China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pairwise phase difference analyses shows that Huangzhong and Fengxian lead all counties’ incidence pattern in Qinghai and Shanghai, respectively (i.e., all counties in Qinghai and Shanghai lag behind Huangzhong’s and Fengxian’s incidence pattern, respectively). Huangzhong and Fengxiang are therefore expected to play central role in dynamic of HFMD in respective region. Specifically, in Qinghai, as distance from Huangzhong increases, the phase difference expands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) which indicates that the time shifting of HFMD incidence at peaks (or troughs) becomes larger with increasing distance, and the degree of phase coherence declines which suggests that synchrony of HFMD incidence are present at nearby locations (

 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] away from Huangzhong. The wave was particularly well defined up to 70 km from Huangzhong (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) with a wave speed of around 31 km per week. Similarly, a repeating travelling wave emanates from Fengxian at a speed of around 11 km per week (
