<p>A number of limitations of our study deserve discussion. First, we were not able to fully compare the spatio-temporal dynamics of specific virus serotype of HFMD cases in the two regions given the limited number of HFMD cases in Qinghai. Second, we used a basis function to account for the temporal variation of the disease incidence but interpretation of the three temporal basis parameters in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> is not so straightforward; in this regard, consideration of climatic factor and socio-economic changes as should be warranted in a future study. Finally, we faced a common challenge for studies using surveillance data on a self-limited disease, possible under-reporting, particularly for mild and subclinical cases [
