<p>For the instant change of infectious behavior of HFMD pathogens, the overall decreasing trend of EA-RN in Huangzhong suggests an outbreak of HFMD declines over time and would eventually die out. The same profile is seen in most other counties in Qinghai (

Nevertheless, in Fengxian, EA-RN trend indicates the disease repeatedly declines from epidemic during the study period. Counties in suburban areas have similar profile with Fengxian, but most of those in urban areas experience constant low incidence, suggesting heterogeneity in transmission behavior in Shanghai. Note that the disease still exists although EA-RN is below one over time in Qinghai. This might indicate that, in addition to direct transmission via human contact, indirect transmission via free-living viruses from the environment exists. In the environment, the pathogen EV-71 can survive for a long period in suitable condition outside the host [
