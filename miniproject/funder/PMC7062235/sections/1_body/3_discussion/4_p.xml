<p>Besides population, we further identified other factors that might affect the traveling waves using a spatial mechanistic model for the spread of HFMD. Qinghai and Shanghai have different significant factors. In particular, GDP had opposite effects in the two regions (negative in Qinghai but positive in Shanghai). A possible explanation for this difference is that Qinghai is a relatively underdeveloped region within which economic inequality is large [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], thus the wealthier families have better health resources and higher consciousness about the disease. Shanghai, however, is one of the most developed regions in China [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; wealthier families tend to have children participating in extracurricular classes, increasing the infection risk. In addition, the density of county-level roads and the density of hospitals may have significant impacts on infection risk in Shanghai. Denser county-level roads might indicate a higher exposure to the infected individuals and denser hospitals might suggest better health resources. In Qinghai, however, the two factors are not significantly associated with infection risk, which might be explained by imperfect and comparatively limited traffic infrastructure and medical resources. A temporal basis function, included in the exposure process to account for temporal variability of HFMD cases due to seasonality and socio-economic changes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] not captured by our covariates, is validated by the Bayes factor results favoring the model with this function. The differences in the three temporal basis parameters between Qinghai and Shanghai reflects a difference in the residual temporal trend of HFMD incidence.
