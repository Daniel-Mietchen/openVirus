<p>In summary, we investigated the transmission dynamics and mechanism of HFMD in Qinghai and Shanghai, which are typical regions with a large difference in physical and socio-economic environments in Western and Eastern China. HFMD in Qinghai declines over time, but in Shanghai a fluctuated trend is repeatedly present. The potential factors associated with heterogeneities in the spatio-temporal transmission dynamics were analyzed and the inherent mechanisms driving these patterns were captured. Our results suggest that traveling waves are present in both regions, each of which is associated with a different set of significant covariates. The population mobility is characterized by cross-region movement in Qinghai and neighboring movement in Shanghai, respectively. Our findings facilitate the understanding of HFMD transmission mechanisms over geographic regions and may be crucial for assisting the appropriate design of interventions, such as deploying optimal vaccine and changing local driving factors in Huangzhong and Fengxian, to prevent or limit disease spread in these areas.</p>
