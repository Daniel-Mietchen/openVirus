<p>We further find that the phase difference decreases as peripheral populations increase in size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) and a closer examination on population size over all counties in Qinghai reveals that Huangzhong has the largest population with the exception of Mangya (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, a county located in corner of the northwest with few HFMD cases in the northwest) while all its nearby counties are relatively small, in which persistent epidemics or sporadic outbreaks occurred. This is in line with hierarchical epidemic waves present in measles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Compared to Qinghai, traveling waves of HFMD emanating from Fengxian in Shanghai occurred among counties that have large populations and persistent major epidemics. The approximation of local spatial synchrony to the regional average with distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3H</xref>) and the large regional average (&gt;0.70, shown by the blue line) indicate that spatial clustering of epidemics occur over the whole region.
