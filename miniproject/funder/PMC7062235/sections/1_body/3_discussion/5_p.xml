<p>We also found that the pattern of population mobility varies between the two regions with results of model comparison (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008070.s009">S2</xref> Tables). In Qinghai, the population tends to move larger distances across the region which indicates that both close and distant HFMD transmission occur and large counties play an important role in starting outbreaks in smaller counties in this sparsely populated region (

The minority nationalities accounted for about half of the population in Qinghai, who live in large and sparsely-populated regions and work on agricultural and animal husbandry production [

Those in Shanghai tend to move between neighboring areas and the neighborhoodsâ€™ contributions to epidemics in one county should be responsible for the travelling waves in this densely populated region. Together with the two centers (i.e., Huangzhong and Fengxian) for the travelling waves, the pattern of population mobility suggests that Huangzhong and Fengxian are the priority areas for targeted interventions in the respective region.
