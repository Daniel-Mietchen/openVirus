 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The median time from illness onset to diagnosis is both 1 day and HFMD occurred more frequently in children under 3 years, male, and scattered children. However, their incidence is quite different. In Qinghai, the annual average HFMD incidence is low (&lt;60.38 per 100,000) in most areas except Xining (the capital city) and Guide (60.38â€“92.83 per 100,000,
