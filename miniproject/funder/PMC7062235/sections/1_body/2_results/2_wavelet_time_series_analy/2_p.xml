<p>Phase difference analysis reveals that epidemics in Huangzhong and its neighboring counties were “in phase”, with Huangzhong subsequently leading the epidemics in surrounding areas (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). The local population size plays a role in these epidemic waves, that is, counties with a smaller population size lag more than ones with larger populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3B and 3F</xref>); this role is more evident in Shanghai (with more extreme slopes). Phases in nearby locations are generally found to be highly correlated. The correlation declines with distance to yield an average phase coherence of around 210 km (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), which can be taken as a rough reflection of the spatial extent of the two dominant travelling waves in Qinghai. The pattern of spatial synchrony in HFMD matches the trends in phase coherence, declining with distance. The case is a little different in Shanghai. The phase coherence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3G</xref>) declines over distance as with in Qinghai while the local spatial synchrony (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g003">Fig 3H</xref>) fluctuates which is not significantly different from the regional average. In addition, the regional averages (&gt;0.70) of phase coherence and spatial synchrony of Shanghai is much larger than those (&lt;0.25) of Qinghai.
