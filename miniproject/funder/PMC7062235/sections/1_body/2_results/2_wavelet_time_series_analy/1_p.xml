<p>We select one county in each region to show results of wavelet analysis. In Huangzhong of Qinghai, both local (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and global (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) powers are the largest at the period of 1 year, suggesting that HFMD cases show a major annual periodicity (i.e., the continuous red region at period of one year in both maps). However, the local maximum power value at the period of 1 and 0.5 years in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g002">Fig 2G</xref> suggests that HFMD cases in Fengxian show a major epidemic of annual periodicity combined with an intermittent semi-annual cycle. The reconstructed curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g002">Fig 2D and 2H</xref>), which show a satisfactory overall agreement with the raw data, confirm the correctness of the identified major epidemic period. Results for all other counties (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008070.s002">S1 Fig</xref>) indicate that there are only 11 counties showing persistent major annual epidemics in Qinghai during the study period while the rest showing sporadic outbreaks, and all counties in Shanghai (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008070.s003">S2 Fig</xref>) show persistent major annual epidemics.
