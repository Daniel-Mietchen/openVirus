<p>The posterior predictive distribution demonstrates an acceptable fit in Huangzhong (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and much more reasonable fits are seen in Fengxian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The EA-RN curves show obvious seasonality in both regions. The reproduction number in Huangzhong is always below one and exhibits both a repeating annual cycle as well as an overall decreasing trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In Fengxian, the EA-RN curves reveal repeating cycles that lie above one in the first half-year and below one in the second half-year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Similar results can be seen in other counties in Qinghai and Shanghai (

This link between big and small counties does not seem to depend on geographic distances, while the amount of incoming infections is mostly dependent on distances between locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008070.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) since its edges connecting different counties are shorter than that in
