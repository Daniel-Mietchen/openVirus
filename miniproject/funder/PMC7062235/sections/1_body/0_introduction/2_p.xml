<p>Understanding the spreading dynamics is vital to limiting HFMD and thereby reducing its adverse impact. However, it is difficult to interpret the transmission pattern of HFMD owing to the presence of nonstationarity and nonlinearity in incidence data. Several factors, including climatic and socio-economic factors, are found to influence the pattern of HFMD, which reflects complex interactions among these factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. As a result, incidence data of HFMD show strong seasonality, oscillations, and changes in period over time. These all increase the difficulty of characterizing the particular spatio-temporal transmission dynamics of a host-pathogen system. Previous studies mostly focus on the static spatio-temporal pattern of HFMD [

Characterization of the particular spatio-temporal dynamics of a host-pathogen system can be used to illuminate the mechanisms most important in the dynamic system [
