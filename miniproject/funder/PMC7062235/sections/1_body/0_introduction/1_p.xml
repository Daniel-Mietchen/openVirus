 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is caused by a spectrum of pathogens in the enterovirus (EV) family [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Under most circumstances, HFMD is self-limiting and resolves within 7–10 days[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but some patients can rapidly develop neurological and systemic complications that can be fatal, especially in cases associated with the serotype of EV71 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] since outbreaks of the disease have been documented in Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, and Cambodia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In China, HFMD has been prevalent since 2007 and there was a sharp rise in incidence since the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH) listed HFMD as a notifiable Class-C communicable disease on May 2, 2008 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During 2008–2015, approximately 13 million HFMD cases were reported, including 123,261 severe cases and 3,322 deaths in 31 provinces of mainland China [
