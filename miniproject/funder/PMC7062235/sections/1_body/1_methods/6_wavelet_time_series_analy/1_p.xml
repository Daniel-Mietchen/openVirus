<p>Then, to analyze the periodicity of serotype-specific HFMD cases, we conduct wavelet time series analyses on weekly reconstructed HFMD cases using the Morlet wavelet function [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All series are log-transformed first and then scaled to have zero mean and unit variance. To minimize biases due to edge effects, we pad all series with excess zeros. The dynamic patterns of HFMD incidence are then identified by calculating the pairwise phase difference and coherence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (which refer to the relative time of peaks and troughs in incidence of geographically disjunct populations) and spatial synchrony [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008070.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (which refers to coincident changes in incidence of geographically disjunct populations) between county pairs in each region.
