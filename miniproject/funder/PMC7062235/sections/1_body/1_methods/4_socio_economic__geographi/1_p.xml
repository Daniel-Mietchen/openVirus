<p>Gross domestic production (GDP), birth population, altitude and density of county-level road, province-level highway, hospital, health workers, and primary and middle schools were collected. Altitude was obtained from an interpolated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Global Land Information System (GLIS) of the United States Geological Survey (

The remaining data were obtained from the Bureau of Statistics of Qinghai and Shanghai, respectively. Collinearity was investigated between all possible pairs of factors and if any pair had a correlation coefficient &gt;|0.4|, the member of the pair believed less likely to be biologically important was excluded. The finally included variables are density of county-level road, GDP, density of hospital, birth population, and altitude. In addition, we use a temporal basis functions (i.e. natural splines with 3 degrees of freedom) to account for temporal variability in the HFMD incidence data.
