<p>Qinghai, located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau with an average elevation of over 3,000 meters above sea level, spans approximately 721,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> in Western China and has a population of 5.98 million (2017) composed of a number of ethnic groups including the Han, Tibetans, Hui, Tu, Mongols, Salars, and several others. Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions of which six are autonomous; in turn these are subdivided into 46 counties. Due to the high altitude, Qinghai has quite cold winters (harsh at the highest elevations), mild summers, and a large diurnal temperature variation. Its mean annual temperature is approximately -5 to 8°C, with January temperatures ranging from -18 to -7°C and July temperatures ranging from 15 to 21°C. Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.
