<p>According to China’s law on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, personal identifiers should be collected for individual cases with diagnosis of a notifiable disease, for the purposes of public health surveillance and response. The National Health and Family Planning Commission of China decided that the collection of individual data for all notifiable diseases, including HFMD, was part of an ongoing public health response and was thus exempt from institutional review board assessment. The co-authors of this paper in Qinghai and Shanghai Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention were given access to the surveillance data for the purposes of research. All the individual HFMD data were anonymized by deleting the personal identifiers (such as patient name, parent name, home address, and telephone number) for the purpose of protecting patients’ privacy.</p>
