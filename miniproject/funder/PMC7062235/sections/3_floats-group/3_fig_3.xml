  <p>
   <bold>a/e</bold>. Mean phase difference from Huangzhong and Fengxian (as a function of distance from the county). Within 70km of Huangzhong and 50 km of Fengxian, there is an increasing trend in the phase difference with increasing distance (
   <italic>r</italic>
   <sub>HZ</sub> = 0.456, 
   <italic>r</italic>
   <sub>FX</sub> = 0.760). The error bars are standard deviation from mean phase difference. 
   <bold>b/f</bold>, Phase difference from Huangzhong and Fengxian (as a function of population size for neighboring counties, within 70 km of Huangzhong and 50 km of Fengxian). There is a decreasing trend of phase difference with increasing population size (
   <italic>r</italic>
   <sub>HZ</sub> = -0.350, 
   <italic>r</italic>
   <sub>FX</sub> = -0.611). The error bars are standard deviation from mean phase difference. 
   <bold>c/g</bold>, Phase coherency curve (as a function of distance) of HFMD in Qinghai and Shanghai with 95% confidence limits. 
   <bold>d/h</bold>, Spatial synchrony curve (as a function of distance) of HFMD with 95% confidence limits in Qinghai and Shanghai. All the plots were created using R software (R Development Core Team 2013).
