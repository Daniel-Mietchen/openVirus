  <title>Temporal pattern and periodicity of HFMD.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a/e</bold>. Weekly pattern of HFMD in Huangzhong (Qinghai) and Fengxian (Shanghai). 
   <bold>b/f</bold>, Local wavelet power spectrum in Huangzhong and Fengxian. 
   <bold>c/g</bold>, Global wavelet spectrum (red points represent periods with 95% statistical significance) in Huangzhong and Fengxian. 
   <bold>d/h</bold>, Major epidemic component of the incidence series in Huangzhong (mainly annual) and Fengxian (mainly annual and semi-annual), reconstructed with wavelet spectral analysis from the components in their respective period. All the plots were created using R software (R Development Core Team 2013).
