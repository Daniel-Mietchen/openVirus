  <p>HI titers against vaccine viruses. Shown is titration of antibodies against each virus by HI assays after vaccination and challenge. Six-week-old female DBA/2J mice were inoculated i.n. with QIV containing Ty/04 
   <italic>att</italic>, Ca/04 
   <italic>att</italic>, B/Bris 
   <italic>att</italic>, and B/Wis 
   <italic>att</italic> viruses. The mock-vaccinated control group received PBS. At 21 dpv, the QIV-vaccinated mice were boosted with a second dose of the QIV, whereas the PBS control mice were mock vaccinated. At 21 dpb, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of either the Ca/04 (QIV-Ca/04 and PBS-Ca/04 groups) or B/Bris (QIV-B/Bris and PBS-B/Bris) virus. A third group was mock challenged with PBS (PBS-PBS group). (A to D) Serum HI titers against each of the homologous viruses in the QIV measured at 20 dpv and 20 dpb. (E to H) Serum HI titers against each of the homologous viruses in the QIV at 21 dpc with either Ca/04 or B/Bris. Horizontal bars indicate samples collected at 21 dpc. Error bars correspond to median and range.
