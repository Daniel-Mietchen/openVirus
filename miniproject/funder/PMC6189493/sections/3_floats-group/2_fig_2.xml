  <p>Protective efficacy of QIV against lethal challenge with the Ca/04 or B/Bris virus. (A, B, E, and F) Percentages of change in body weight and survival following challenge with either Ca/04 (A and B) or B/Bris (E and F) virus. (C, D, G, and H) At 5 dpc, a subset of mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3/group) were sacrificed, and NTs and lungs were collected. Virus titers in NTs (C and G) and lung homogenates (D and H) were measured by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> in MDCK cells. (E and F) The asterisks denote one mouse outlier in the PBS/B/Bris group that did not show body weight loss, probably due to imperfect inoculation of the B/Bris challenge strain. The same mouse was the only one that survived the challenge with the B/Bris strain. The error bars indicate standard deviation.
