<p>In this study, we evaluated whether a QIV version of the 
 <italic>att</italic> strategy was safe, immunogenic, and protective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a mouse model. We used DBA/2J mice because they are more susceptible to IAV and IBV strains and develop anti-influenza humoral responses comparable to those of other mouse strains (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We opted for a prime-boost strategy in order to determine whether we could further stimulate humoral responses against all the components of the vaccine. Such a 2-dose strategy (1 month apart) is recommended for children 2 to 8 years old who receive the LAIV in the United States. It must be noted that, except for the Ca/04 
 <italic>att</italic> strain, the viral components in the QIV do not carry mouse-adapted mutations. Thus, it was remarkable to realize that a second dose of the QIV stimulated HI responses to all components in the vaccine to within the protective range (HI titers of â‰¥40) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Differences in the levels of HI responses, particularly the B/Wisc 
 <italic>att</italic>, could be due to a number of factors, including replication fitness differences, competition between IAV and/or IBV strains, and antigenic/immunogenic differences. Further studies, including refinements in virus particle versus infectious dose, will be needed but are beyond the scope of the present report.
