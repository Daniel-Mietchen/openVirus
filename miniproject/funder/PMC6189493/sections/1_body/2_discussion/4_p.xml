<p>LAIVs have been shown to heighten innate immune responses (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and to stimulate cross-protective responses to heterologous or antigenically divergent strains (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We explored anti-IAV and anti-IBV IgA and IgG responses using whole-virus preparations in an ELISA. NTs and lung homogenate samples collected at 5 dpc provided an indication of preexisting immunity against all the components of the QIV. Although direct comparisons are not possible because the 4 viruses in the QIV are different, a trend toward higher OD values for IgA and IgG against the Ca/04 and B/Bris strains than against the Ty/04 and B/Wisc strains was observed, consistent with the first two being the viruses used for challenge. It is expected that cross-protective antibodies and/or antibodies against conserved proteins are represented at some level in the ELISAs, and this appears to be the case for the IBV strains. However, it is important to emphasize that anti-influenza responses are skewed toward the HA and NA proteins. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the IgA and IgG profiles observed are bona fide representations of antibody responses against each of the viruses in the vaccine (and cross-reactive IBV HA and/or NA antibodies).
