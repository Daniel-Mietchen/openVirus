<p>QIV-vaccinated mice were fully protected against lethal challenge (∼10,000 50% mouse lethal dose [MLD
 <sub>50</sub>]), with the Ca/04 strain showing minor body weight losses within the first 2 days after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The Ca/04 strain used in this study carries mutations on the surface and internal gene segments that increase its virulence for mice (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, by 5 dpc, no evidence of Ca/04 replication was detected in the lungs or NTs of the QIV-vaccinated/challenge mice, unlike the mock-vaccinated/challenged mice. QIV-vaccinated mice also survived challenge with the B/Bris strain carrying the PB2 F406Y mutation and by 5 dpc showed no evidence of virus replication in lungs and NTs. We have previously shown that the PB2 F406Y mutation increases the virulence for mice of the wild-type B/Bris strain (it also slightly increases the virulence of B/Wisc) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Unexpectedly, the B/Bris challenge dose (≤10 50% lethal doses [LD
 <sub>50</sub>]) was sufficient to cause significant body weight loss in the QIV-vaccinated/challenged mice compared to the PBS-PBS mice. It is possible that the IAV 
 <italic>att</italic> strains had a competitive advantage over the IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> strains in the QIV that affected humoral and cellular responses against the latter. Whether the effect is due to the mouse model or to true competitive-fitness advantages of one virus over the rest in the QIV remains to be determined. The potential for interference between type A and type B live attenuated influenza viruses has been previously described in the mouse model, although early studies did not contemplate the use of QIV formulations (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). As expected, by 21 dpc, HI titers were increased against the challenge viruses, but only in their respective groups, whereas HI titers against other viruses were slightly lower than at 20 dpb. It was also noted that the HI responses to the H3 HA proteins were limited to the Ty/04 strain with very limited cross-reactivity to other older or newer seasonal H3 strains (not shown).
