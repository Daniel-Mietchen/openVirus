<p>In this study, we sought to evaluate whether a QIV with the two laboratory 
 <italic>att</italic> backbones was safe, immunogenic, and protective. Thus, reverse genetics was used to generate the following viruses: Ty/04 
 <italic>att</italic> (H3N2), Ca/04 
 <italic>att</italic> (H1N1), B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic> (Victoria lineage), and B/Wisc 
 <italic>att</italic> (Yamagata lineage). The Ty/04 
 <italic>att</italic>, Ca/04 
 <italic>att</italic>, and B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic> viruses have been previously described (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), while the B/Wis 
 <italic>att</italic> virus was prepared for this study (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Like the B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic> virus, the B/Wis 
 <italic>att</italic> virus displayed a 
 <italic>ts</italic> phenotype 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> that is typically associated with attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). The QIV formulation was prepared with doses containing equal amounts (2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> 50% tissue culture infectious doses [TCID
 <sub>50</sub>]/ml) of each 
 <italic>att</italic> virus.
