<p>DBA/2J mice were randomly distributed into two different groups and received either the QIV or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (mock vaccination) by intranasal inoculation. The mice were boosted at 21 days postvaccination (dpv) following the same strategy. No clinical signs of disease, body weight loss, or mortality were observed after prime or boost. HI titers were evaluated at 20 dpv and 20 days postboost (dpb) from 4 mice/group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Mice in the QIV group showed low but discernible HI titers at 20 dpv against the four HA components in the vaccine (HI titers of 20 to 160 against Ca/04, 20 to 80 against B/Bris, 20 to 160 against Ty04, and 10 to 40 against B/Wisc). After boost, HI titers increased and were all within the range considered to be predictive of protection against clinical disease (HI titers of 160 to 1,280 against Ca/04, 160 to 640 against B/Bris, 320 to 640 against Ty/04, and 40 to 160 against B/Wisc). As expected, mice in the PBS group showed HI titers below the limit of detection. These results indicated that the QIV was safe and immunogenic in mice.
