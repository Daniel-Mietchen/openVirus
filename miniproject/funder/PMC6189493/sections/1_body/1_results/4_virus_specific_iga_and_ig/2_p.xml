<p>Ty/04- and B/Wisc-specific IgA and IgG absorbance readings provided some evidence of the relative levels of QIV-induced responses. However, it must be noted that the samples were collected after challenge with either Ca/04 or B/Bris virus, and the whole-virus ELISAs do not discriminate between the potential postchallenge stimulation of specific anti-Ty/04 or anti-B/Wisc antibodies versus cross-reactive antibodies and/or antibodies against more conserved antigens. Stimulation of antibodies against conserved antigens helps to explain the higher levels of IgA against the Ty/04 virus at 5 dpc in NTs from the QIV-Ca/04 mice than in NTs from the QIV-B/Bris mice. Likewise, IgA and IgG responses against the B/Wisc virus were higher in samples collected at 21 dpc from the QIV-B/Bris mice than in those from the QIV-Ca/04 mice. However, in the remaining samples, the IgA and IgG responses were similar among QIV-vaccinated mice. Thus, the anti-Ty/04 IgA levels in lung homogenates at 5 dpc and in NW, BALFs, and serum at 21 dpc and the anti-Ty04 IgG levels in all the samples (except BALFs at 21 dpc) were similar among mice in the QIV-Ca/04 and QIV-B/Bris groups. Likewise, anti-B/Wisc IgA and IgG responses were similar among QIV-vaccinated mice in 5-dpc NT and lung homogenate samples. Interestingly, BALF samples collected at 21 dpc showed a higher anti-Ty04 IgG response in samples obtained from the QIV-B/Bris group than in those from the QIV-Ca/04 group. These results indicated that mice immunized two times with the QIV produced virus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Challenge with the Ca/04 or B/Bris virus resulted in stimulation of a combination of virus-specific antibodies and antibodies against conserved viral antigens.</p>
