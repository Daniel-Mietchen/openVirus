<p>To further explore virus-specific antibody responses, we evaluated IgA and IgG levels against the 4 viruses in the vaccine. Enzyme-linked immune absorbent assays (ELISAs) using whole-virus-coated plates were performed to detect IgA and IgG antibodies in samples from lungs and NTs collected at 5 dpc and sera, nasal washes (NW), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) collected at 21 dpc. Optical density at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) values â‰¥2-fold above background were considered positive for virus-specific antibodies. Consistently, virus-specific IgA antibodies against the 4 vaccine viruses were detected in all samples diluted between 1:40 and 1:160 (or even at higher dilutions, depending on the virus and the samples) (

The samples collected at 5 dpc from the QIV-vaccinated mice (QIV-Ca/04 and QIV-B/Bris groups) had absorbance readings well above those of negative-control samples (mock vaccinated and mock challenged [PBS-PBS]) or samples obtained from unvaccinated mice challenged with either Ca/04 or B/Bris virus (PBS-Ca/04 and PBS-B/Bris, respectively), strongly indicating that the QIV had stimulated IgA responses in the mice (

 <sub>450</sub> values, IgA responses against the Ca/04 and B/Bris challenge viruses were high in NTs and lung homogenates at 5 dpc and remained high in BALFs and NW at 21 dpc compared to PBS-PBS control group samples (note that mock-vaccinated mice did not survive beyond 7 dpc, except for 1 mouse in the PBS-B/Bris group). As expected, virus-specific IgA levels were also high in fecal samples (not shown) but moderate in serum samples collected at 21 dpc. Similarly, IgG responses were relatively high against the challenge viruses in samples from QIV-vaccinated mice collected after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Typically, virus-specific IgG was consistently detected well above background in samples diluted between 1:100 and 1:1,000 (up to 1:100,000 in serum) from QIV-vaccinated/challenged mice but not in similarly diluted samples from mock-vaccinated/challenged mice.
