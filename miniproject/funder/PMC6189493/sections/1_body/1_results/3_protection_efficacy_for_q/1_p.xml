<p>In order to assess the protective effects of the QIV regime, mice were challenge with 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> per mouse of either the Ca/04 or B/Bris virus by the intranasal route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). No signs of disease and minor weight loss were observed in the QIV-vaccinated mice within the first 2 days after challenge with the Ca/04 virus (QIV-Ca/04), but the mice quickly recovered from day 3 onward. All of the QIV-Ca/04 mice (8 out 8) survived the challenge by 14 days postchallenge (dpc). In contrast, the PBS-Ca/04 mice showed rapid body weight loss and weakened after challenge and succumbed or had to be euthanized by 6 dpc. Despite not showing overt clinical signs of disease, the mice in the QIV-B/Bris group showed substantial weight loss (10 to 15%) within the first 3 days after challenge and slowly recovered. By 10 dpc, the mice in the QIV-B/Bris group showed average body weights similar to those of unchallenged control mice. By 14 dpc, all the mice (8 out of 8) in the QIV-B/Bris group had survived the challenge. By comparison, the body weights of mice in the PBS-B/Bris group declined rapidly, and by day 7, 7 out of the 8 mice had succumbed to the challenge. It must be noted that one mouse in the PBS-B/Bris group appeared not to have been infected properly because it showed no body weight loss during the follow-up at 14 days postchallenge (and thus, it was not considered for the calculation of body weight changes in the group). The same mouse is shown as a survivor in the survival curve (an asterisk is used to denote the outlier in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>). The protective effects of the QIV were also reflected by the lack of detectable virus in lung homogenates and nasal turbinates (NTs) collected at 5 dpc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Conversely, significant virus titers were observed in lung and NT homogenates obtained from mice in the PBS-Ca/04 and PBS-B/Bris control groups. As expected, HI titers at 21 dpc against the challenge virus were increased in each group but remained unchanged (or slightly lower than at 20 dpb) against other viruses in the vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). These observations suggest that the QIV protected the mice against lethal IAV H1N1 or IBV (Victoria lineage) challenge.
