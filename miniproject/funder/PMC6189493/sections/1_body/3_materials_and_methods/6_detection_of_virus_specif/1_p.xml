<p>NW samples, BALFs, and serum samples collected at 21 dpc, as well as NT and lung homogenates prepared at 5 dpc, were screened for the presence of virus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies using an ELISA. Whole-virus preparations were obtained by centrifuging 180 ml of virus (about 5,120 HAU/ml) at 24,000 rpm (∼105,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>) for 2 h in a Beckman SW32 Ti swing bucket rotor and a Beckman Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge. The pelleted viruses were resuspended in 1.2 ml of PBS. The resuspended virus protein concentration was titrated with a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) and diluted to 50 μg/ml in coating buffer (0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.6). The plates were coated with diluted virus (100 μl/well) at 4°C overnight. Then, the plates were blocked with 10% skim milk in PBS at room temperature for 2 h and washed twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). The plates were incubated with test samples diluted in 2% skim milk in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. After washing 3 times with PBST, the plates were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgA antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) or anti-mouse IgG antibody (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) at room temperature for 1 h and then washed 3 times with PBST. Then, 100 μl TMB solution (ThermoFisher, Vienna, Austria) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 3% H
