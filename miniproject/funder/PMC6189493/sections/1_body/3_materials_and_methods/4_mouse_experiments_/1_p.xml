<p>Five- to 6-week-old female DBA/2J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). The mice were randomly distributed into 2 groups. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and subsequently inoculated via the i.n. route with 50 μl of an inoculum containing either PBS (mock vaccinated; group 1; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 33) or QIV (10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID

 <italic>n</italic> = 22). At 21 dpv, the mice in group 2 were boosted i.n. with QIV, whereas the control mice in group 1 received PBS. At 20 dpv and 20 dpb, 4 mice/group were bled from the submandibular vein, and serum samples were collected and used to measure neutralizing and virus-specific antibody responses. At 21 dpb, mice were challenged with an inoculum of 50 μl containing either the Ca/04 virus (10

 <italic>n</italic> = 11; group PBS-PBS). After challenge, the mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, body weight loss, and mortality. At 5 dpc, 3 mice per group were sacrificed, and lungs and NT samples were collected to determine virus titers. At 21 dpc, all the mice were sacrificed, and serum samples, NW, and BALF samples were collected for evaluating virus-specific antibody responses.
