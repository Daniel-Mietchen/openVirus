<p>Serum samples collected at 20 dpv, 20 dpb, and 21 dpc were screened for the presence of neutralizing antibodies by the HI assay using the wild-type Ty/04, Ca/04, B/Bris, and B/Wisc strains (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Briefly, the sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme at 37°C overnight and then heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. Then, the sera were diluted 1:10 with PBS and subsequently serially diluted 2-fold and mixed with 8 hemagglutination units (HAU) of virus in a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The HI activity was visualized by adding 0.5% turkey red blood cells to the virus-serum mixtures and further incubation at room temperature for 30 min before reading.
