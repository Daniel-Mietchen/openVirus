<p>Human embryonic kidney 293T and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The cells were propagated at 37°C in 5% CO
