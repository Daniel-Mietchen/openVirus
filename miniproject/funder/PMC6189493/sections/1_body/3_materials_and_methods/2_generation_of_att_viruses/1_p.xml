<p>The Ty/04 
 <italic>att</italic> (H3N2) and B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic> virus vaccines have been previously described and are referenced in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The Ca/04 
 <italic>att</italic> (H1N1) virus carries the PB1 and PB2 segments from the Ty/04 
 <italic>att</italic> virus and 6 gene segments from the mouse-adapted Ca/04 virus. B/Wisc 
 <italic>att</italic> carries the HA and NA surface gene segments of B/Wisc and the backbone of B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic>. The 
 <italic>att</italic> viruses were rescued by reverse genetics using coculture of 293T and MDCK cells as previously described (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The IAV 
 <italic>att</italic> and IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> rescued viruses (passage 0 [P0]) were expanded in fresh MDCK cells to produce P1 viruses. The P1 viruses were used in a second round of amplification in MDCK cells (P2) and in 9-day-old SPF eggs (E1). The IAV 
 <italic>att</italic> and IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> viruses were amplified in eggs at 35°C and 33°C, respectively. Virus stocks were titrated by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> using the Reed-Muench method (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The virus stocks were sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The NGS results showed integrity of 
 <italic>att</italic> mutations and absence of spurious mutations. The QIV was formulated to contain equal doses (2 ×10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml) of Ty/04 
 <italic>att</italic>, Ca/04 
 <italic>att</italic>, B/Bris 
 <italic>att</italic>, and B/Wisc 
 <italic>att</italic> viruses.
