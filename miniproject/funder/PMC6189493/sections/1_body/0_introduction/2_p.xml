<p>Vaccines against seasonal influenza viruses are manufactured to confer protection against circulating IAV and IBV strains. Current vaccines rely primarily on antibody responses to the virus' hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein. However, HA undergoes antigenic drift, requiring regular vaccine updates in order to antigenically match them to the currently circulating strains (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Seasonal influenza virus vaccines have traditionally contained three influenza virus strains, two IAV strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one IBV from either the B/Yamagata or the B/Victoria antigenic lineage (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In recent years, however, the two IBV lineages have shown not only seasonal variations, but also significant differences in prevalence in different countries. Thus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quadrivalent vaccines that incorporate both IBV antigenic lineages, in addition to the two IAV strains (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). To date, the FDA has approved three types of influenza virus vaccines for human use: inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV), recombinant influenza protein (RIP) vaccine, and live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The most widely used influenza virus vaccine is IIV, which can elicit protective humoral immunity by inducing the production of neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes on the virus HA (and, to a lesser extent, the neuraminidase [NA] surface protein). The RIP vaccine, similar to IIV, can induce neutralizing antibodies that target the HA protein (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, LAIVs can elicit not only humoral but also cell-mediated immunity, which is considered more cross-protective, since it targets more conserved viral epitopes (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). LAIVs for human use were independently obtained by serial passage in eggs at low temperatures, resulting in cold-adapted (
 <italic>ca</italic>) and temperature-sensitive (
 <italic>ts</italic>) mutations that resulted in an attenuated (
 <italic>att</italic>) phenotype in 
 <italic>vivo</italic>. In the United States, the only FDA-approved LAIV consists of viruses carrying a series of mutations in the internal gene segments of the master donor viruses (MDVs) (A/Ann Arbor/6/60 [H2N2] [MDV-A] and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 [MDV-B]) (
