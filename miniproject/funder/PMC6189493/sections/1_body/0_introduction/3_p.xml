<p>Early work in our laboratory demonstrated that a combination of an HA tag at the C terminus of PB1 and 
 <italic>ts</italic> mutations in PB2 (S265) and PB1 (E391, G581, and T661) showed remarkable stability over multiple passages in IAV backbones of avian, human, and swine origin. This strategy—referred to as IAV 
 <italic>att</italic>—is safe and effective, resulting in protection against avian- and mammalian-origin influenza virus strains in a variety of avian and mammalian species (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We recently demonstrated that an IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> strain modified with a similar strategy (PB1 with mutations G580, A660, and a C-terminal HA tag) resulted in a stable virus over multiple passages in tissue culture and eggs and with an 
 <italic>att</italic> phenotype 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. A single intranasal (i.n.) dose of the IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> protected mice against lethal challenge with antigenically matched and mismatched IBV strains (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In this study, we used the IAV 
 <italic>att</italic> and IBV 
 <italic>att</italic> backbones to generate a quadrivalent LAIV (QIV) containing H3N2 and H1N1 IAV antigenic subtypes and two antigenic IBV lineages. We used the QIV to immunize mice intranasally in a prime-boost regime. We show that 2 doses of the QIV elicited discernible hemagglutination inhibition (HI) responses against the 4 viruses in the vaccine. We also observed that the QIV protected mice against lethal challenge with either IAV H1N1 or IBV.
