<p>Type A (IAV) and type B (IBV) influenza viruses, within the family 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Orthomyxoviridae</named-content> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), are responsible for yearly epidemics of respiratory disease in humans. The Word Health Organization (WHO) estimates that seasonal influenza virus infections result in about 1 billion infections, 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, and between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths around the world every year (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For the United States, influenza virus infections result in an average economic impact of $87 billion due to prophylactic, therapeutic, and hospitalization costs, as well as missed school days or workdays (
