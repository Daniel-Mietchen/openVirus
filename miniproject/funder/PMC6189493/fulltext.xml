Vaccination is considered the first line of defense against influenza. Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIVs) may provide superior responses compared to inactivated vaccines because the former can better elicit a combination of humoral and cellular responses by mimicking a natural infection. Unfortunately, during the 2013&#x02013;2014, 2014&#x02013;2015, and 2015&#x02013;2016 seasons, concerns emerged about the effectiveness of the only LAIV approved in the United States that prevented the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) from recommending its use. Such drawbacks open up the opportunity for alternative LAIV strategies that could overcome such concerns. Previously, we developed a combined strategy of temperature-sensitive mutations in the PB2 and PB1 segments and an epitope tag in the C terminus of PB1 that effectively attenuates influenza A viruses of avian and mammalian origin. More recently, we adopted a similar strategy for influenza B viruses. The resulting attenuated (<italic>att</italic>) influenza A and B viruses were safe, immunogenic, and protective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a variety of animal models. In this report, we provide evidence of the potential use of our <italic>att</italic> strategy in a quadrivalent LAIV (QIV) formulation carrying H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A virus subtype viruses and two antigenic lineages of influenza B viruses. In naive DBA/2J mice, two doses of the QIV elicited hemagglutination inhibition (HI) responses with HI titers of &#x02265;40 and effectively protected against lethal challenge with prototypical pandemic H1N1 influenza A and influenza B virus strains.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Seasonal influenza viruses infect 1 billion people worldwide and are associated with &#x0223c;500,000 deaths annually.

The Word Health Organization (WHO) estimates that seasonal influenza virus infections result in about 1 billion infections, 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, and between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths around the world every year (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For the United States, influenza virus infections result in an average economic impact of $87 billion due to prophylactic, therapeutic, and hospitalization costs, as well as missed school days or workdays (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). IBVs contribute less to seasonal epidemics than IAVs, but they are a significant disease burden in the pediatric and elderly populations (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In addition, IAVs have been associated with pandemic episodes when novel strains from animal reservoirs are introduced into humans (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Public health concerns are aggravated by the inherent ability of influenza viruses to develop resistance to available antivirals (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Thus, vaccination remains the best choice to protect humans against influenza virus infections, and it is considered the first line of defense against influenza virus-associated illness.</p><p>Vaccines against seasonal influenza viruses are manufactured to confer protection against circulating IAV and IBV strains. Current vaccines rely primarily on antibody responses to the virus' hemagglutinin (HA) surface protein. However, HA undergoes antigenic drift, requiring regular vaccine updates in order to antigenically match them to the currently circulating strains (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Seasonal influenza virus vaccines have traditionally contained three influenza virus strains, two IAV strains (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and one IBV from either the B/Yamagata or the B/Victoria antigenic lineage (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In recent years, however, the two IBV lineages have shown not only seasonal variations, but also significant differences in prevalence in different countries. Thus, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quadrivalent vaccines that incorporate both IBV antigenic lineages, in addition to the two IAV strains (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). To date, the FDA has approved three types of influenza virus vaccines for human use: inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV), recombinant influenza protein (RIP) vaccine, and live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The most widely used influenza virus vaccine is IIV, which can elicit protective humoral immunity by inducing the production of neutralizing antibodies that target epitopes on the virus HA (and, to a lesser extent, the neuraminidase [NA] surface protein). The RIP vaccine, similar to IIV, can induce neutralizing antibodies that target the HA protein (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In contrast, LAIVs can elicit not only humoral but also cell-mediated immunity, which is considered more cross-protective, since it targets more conserved viral epitopes (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). LAIVs for human use were independently obtained by serial passage in eggs at low temperatures, resulting in cold-adapted (<italic>ca</italic>) and temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) mutations that resulted in an attenuated (<italic>att</italic>) phenotype in <italic>vivo</italic>. In the United States, the only FDA-approved LAIV consists of viruses carrying a series of mutations in the internal gene segments of the master donor viruses (MDVs) (A/Ann Arbor/6/60 [H2N2] [MDV-A] and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 [MDV-B]) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Early work in our laboratory demonstrated that a combination of an HA tag at the C terminus of PB1 and <italic>ts</italic> mutations in PB2 (S265) and PB1 (E391, G581, and T661) showed remarkable stability over multiple passages in IAV backbones of avian, human, and swine origin. This strategy&#x02014;referred to as IAV <italic>att</italic>&#x02014;is safe and effective, resulting in protection against avian- and mammalian-origin influenza virus strains in a variety of avian and mammalian species (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We recently demonstrated that an IBV <italic>att</italic> strain modified with a similar strategy (PB1 with mutations G580, A660, and a C-terminal HA tag) resulted in a stable virus over multiple passages in tissue culture and eggs and with an <italic>att</italic> phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>. A single intranasal (i.n.) dose of the IBV <italic>att</italic> protected mice against lethal challenge with antigenically matched and mismatched IBV strains (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In this study, we used the IAV <italic>att</italic> and IBV <italic>att</italic> backbones to generate a quadrivalent LAIV (QIV) containing H3N2 and H1N1 IAV antigenic subtypes and two antigenic IBV lineages. We used the QIV to immunize mice intranasally in a prime-boost regime. We show that 2 doses of the QIV elicited discernible hemagglutination inhibition (HI) responses against the 4 viruses in the vaccine. We also observed that the QIV protected mice against lethal challenge with either IAV H1N1 or IBV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Generation of a QIV.</title><p>In this study, we sought to evaluate whether a QIV with the two laboratory <italic>att</italic> backbones was safe, immunogenic, and protective.

No signs of disease and minor weight loss were observed in the QIV-vaccinated mice within the first 2 days after challenge with the Ca/04 virus (QIV-Ca/04), but the mice quickly recovered from day 3 onward. All of the QIV-Ca/04 mice (8 out 8) survived the challenge by 14 days postchallenge (dpc). In contrast, the PBS-Ca/04 mice showed rapid body weight loss and weakened after challenge and succumbed or had to be euthanized by 6 dpc. Despite not showing overt clinical signs of disease, the mice in the QIV-B/Bris group showed substantial weight loss (10 to 15%) within the first 3 days after challenge and slowly recovered. By 10 dpc, the mice in the QIV-B/Bris group showed average body weights similar to those of unchallenged control mice. By 14 dpc, all the mice (8 out of 8) in the QIV-B/Bris group had survived the challenge. By comparison, the body weights of mice in the PBS-B/Bris group declined rapidly, and by day 7, 7 out of the 8 mice had succumbed to the challenge. It must be noted that one mouse in the PBS-B/Bris group appeared not to have been infected properly because it showed no body weight loss during the follow-up at 14 days postchallenge (and thus, it was not considered for the calculation of body weight changes in the group).

Conversely, significant virus titers were observed in lung and NT homogenates obtained from mice in the PBS-Ca/04 and PBS-B/Bris control groups.

Optical density at 450 nm (OD<sub>450</sub>) values &#x02265;2-fold above background were considered positive for virus-specific antibodies. Consistently, virus-specific IgA antibodies against the 4 vaccine viruses were detected in all samples diluted between 1:40 and 1:160 (or even at higher dilutions, depending on the virus and the samples) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). The samples collected at 5 dpc from the QIV-vaccinated mice (QIV-Ca/04 and QIV-B/Bris groups) had absorbance readings well above those of negative-control samples (mock vaccinated and mock challenged [PBS-PBS]) or samples obtained from unvaccinated mice challenged with either Ca/04 or B/Bris virus (PBS-Ca/04 and PBS-B/Bris, respectively), strongly indicating that the QIV had stimulated IgA responses in the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Based on OD<sub>450</sub> values, IgA responses against the Ca/04 and B/Bris challenge viruses were high in NTs and lung homogenates at 5 dpc and remained high in BALFs and NW at 21 dpc compared to PBS-PBS control group samples (note that mock-vaccinated mice did not survive beyond 7 dpc, except for 1 mouse in the PBS-B/Bris group). As expected, virus-specific IgA levels were also high in fecal samples (not shown) but moderate in serum samples collected at 21 dpc. Similarly, IgG responses were relatively high against the challenge viruses in samples from QIV-vaccinated mice collected after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Typically, virus-specific IgG was consistently detected well above background in samples diluted between 1:100 and 1:1,000 (up to 1:100,000 in serum) from QIV-vaccinated/challenged mice but not in similarly diluted samples from mock-vaccinated/challenged mice.</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG 3</label><caption><p>Virus-specific mouse IgA antibodies against homologous viruses in QIV after challenge.

However, it must be noted that the samples were collected after challenge with either Ca/04 or B/Bris virus, and the whole-virus ELISAs do not discriminate between the potential postchallenge stimulation of specific anti-Ty/04 or anti-B/Wisc antibodies versus cross-reactive antibodies and/or antibodies against more conserved antigens. Stimulation of antibodies against conserved antigens helps to explain the higher levels of IgA against the Ty/04 virus at 5 dpc in NTs from the QIV-Ca/04 mice than in NTs from the QIV-B/Bris mice. Likewise, IgA and IgG responses against the B/Wisc virus were higher in samples collected at 21 dpc from the QIV-B/Bris mice than in those from the QIV-Ca/04 mice. However, in the remaining samples, the IgA and IgG responses were similar among QIV-vaccinated mice. Thus, the anti-Ty/04 IgA levels in lung homogenates at 5 dpc and in NW, BALFs, and serum at 21 dpc and the anti-Ty04 IgG levels in all the samples (except BALFs at 21 dpc) were similar among mice in the QIV-Ca/04 and QIV-B/Bris groups. Likewise, anti-B/Wisc IgA and IgG responses were similar among QIV-vaccinated mice in 5-dpc NT and lung homogenate samples. Interestingly, BALF samples collected at 21 dpc showed a higher anti-Ty04 IgG response in samples obtained from the QIV-B/Bris group than in those from the QIV-Ca/04 group. These results indicated that mice immunized two times with the QIV produced virus-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Challenge with the Ca/04 or B/Bris virus resulted in stimulation of a combination of virus-specific antibodies and antibodies against conserved viral antigens.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Influenza virus vaccine effectiveness ranged from 19% to 48% during the past three influenza seasons (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During the 2013&#x02013;2014, 2014&#x02013;2015, and 2015&#x02013;2016 seasons, a number of issues emerged that called into question the effectiveness of the only FDA-approved LAIV in the U.S. market (no evidence of similar problems appears to have existed in other markets where the same vaccine is approved). Although such issues appear to have been resolved for the 2017&#x02013;2018 season and alternative LAIVs approved for other markets (based on the A/Leningrad and B/USSR MDV strains) do not seem to have faced similar issues, there is a need for the development of novel LAIV strategies that will likely impact the future development of influenza virus vaccines. In general, weakened (attenuated) forms of viral pathogens offer the longest-lasting protection because they produce multidimensional responses by stimulating the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. The IAV <italic>att</italic> component in the QIV studied here, based on the internal gene segment constellation of the Ty/04 strain, contains mutations found in the A/Ann Arbor MDV-A (PB2 S265 and PB1 E391, G581, and T661). These mutations can confer an <italic>att</italic> phenotype on some, but not all, IAV strains, as we have previously shown (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, the incorporation of the HA epitope tag at the C terminus of PB1, along with the <italic>ts</italic> mutations (<italic>ts</italic> + HA tag = <italic>att</italic>) resulted in attenuation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The IAV <italic>att</italic> strains that we have produced so far are remarkably stable and show optimal safety and protective profiles when used as monovalent vaccines. The most widely used MDV-As (A/Leningrad/and A/Ann Arbor) were isolated nearly 60 years ago. Over this period, IAVs have continued to evolve and reassort and have accumulated mutations on relevant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes that differ from those in the MDV-A internal backbones (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Altering the gene constellation of MDV-A would require further preclinical and clinical testing. Thus, a major advantage of our strategy is the possibility to impart the <italic>att</italic> phenotype to virtually any IAV strain. We favored the Ty/04 <italic>att</italic> backbone because it carries the potential to act as a universal <italic>att</italic> backbone for use in avian and mammalian species, including humans. To be used in humans, however, a complementary IBV <italic>att</italic> strategy is highly desirable. For that reason, we incorporated an IBV PB1 gene segment carrying the G580 and A660 mutations and the C-terminal HA tag and established that it resulted in attenuation of the B/Bris strain. We further demonstrated that the B/Bris <italic>att</italic> strain was stable, safe, and immunogenic and protected mice against lethal IBV challenge. The modifications of the IBV <italic>att</italic> are unique to our virus and are not shared with the B/Ann Arbor or B/USSR MDV-B.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated whether a QIV version of the <italic>att</italic> strategy was safe, immunogenic, and protective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a mouse model. We used DBA/2J mice because they are more susceptible to IAV and IBV strains and develop anti-influenza humoral responses comparable to those of other mouse strains (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). We opted for a prime-boost strategy in order to determine whether we could further stimulate humoral responses against all the components of the vaccine. Such a 2-dose strategy (1 month apart) is recommended for children 2 to 8 years old who receive the LAIV in the United States. It must be noted that, except for the Ca/04 <italic>att</italic> strain, the viral components in the QIV do not carry mouse-adapted mutations. Thus, it was remarkable to realize that a second dose of the QIV stimulated HI responses to all components in the vaccine to within the protective range (HI titers of &#x02265;40) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Differences in the levels of HI responses, particularly the B/Wisc <italic>att</italic>, could be due to a number of factors, including replication fitness differences, competition between IAV and/or IBV strains, and antigenic/immunogenic differences. Further studies, including refinements in virus particle versus infectious dose, will be needed but are beyond the scope of the present report.</p><p>QIV-vaccinated mice were fully protected against lethal challenge (&#x0223c;10,000 50% mouse lethal dose [MLD<sub>50</sub>]), with the Ca/04 strain showing minor body weight losses within the first 2 days after challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The Ca/04 strain used in this study carries mutations on the surface and internal gene segments that increase its virulence for mice (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, by 5 dpc, no evidence of Ca/04 replication was detected in the lungs or NTs of the QIV-vaccinated/challenge mice, unlike the mock-vaccinated/challenged mice. QIV-vaccinated mice also survived challenge with the B/Bris strain carrying the PB2 F406Y mutation and by 5 dpc showed no evidence of virus replication in lungs and NTs. We have previously shown that the PB2 F406Y mutation increases the virulence for mice of the wild-type B/Bris strain (it also slightly increases the virulence of B/Wisc) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Unexpectedly, the B/Bris challenge dose (&#x02264;10 50% lethal doses [LD<sub>50</sub>]) was sufficient to cause significant body weight loss in the QIV-vaccinated/challenged mice compared to the PBS-PBS mice. It is possible that the IAV <italic>att</italic> strains had a competitive advantage over the IBV <italic>att</italic> strains in the QIV that affected humoral and cellular responses against the latter. Whether the effect is due to the mouse model or to true competitive-fitness advantages of one virus over the rest in the QIV remains to be determined. The potential for interference between type A and type B live attenuated influenza viruses has been previously described in the mouse model, although early studies did not contemplate the use of QIV formulations (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). As expected, by 21 dpc, HI titers were increased against the challenge viruses, but only in their respective groups, whereas HI titers against other viruses were slightly lower than at 20 dpb. It was also noted that the HI responses to the H3 HA proteins were limited to the Ty/04 strain with very limited cross-reactivity to other older or newer seasonal H3 strains (not shown).</p><p>LAIVs have been shown to heighten innate immune responses (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and to stimulate cross-protective responses to heterologous or antigenically divergent strains (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). We explored anti-IAV and anti-IBV IgA and IgG responses using whole-virus preparations in an ELISA. NTs and lung homogenate samples collected at 5 dpc provided an indication of preexisting immunity against all the components of the QIV. Although direct comparisons are not possible because the 4 viruses in the QIV are different, a trend toward higher OD values for IgA and IgG against the Ca/04 and B/Bris strains than against the Ty/04 and B/Wisc strains was observed, consistent with the first two being the viruses used for challenge. It is expected that cross-protective antibodies and/or antibodies against conserved proteins are represented at some level in the ELISAs, and this appears to be the case for the IBV strains. However, it is important to emphasize that anti-influenza responses are skewed toward the HA and NA proteins. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the IgA and IgG profiles observed are bona fide representations of antibody responses against each of the viruses in the vaccine (and cross-reactive IBV HA and/or NA antibodies).</p><p>In summary, we provide proof of principle of the potential of an alternative QIV as a safe and effective vaccine against IAV and IBV in mice. The strategy increases the arsenal of LAIV options against seasonal and pandemic influenza.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec4-1"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293T and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
