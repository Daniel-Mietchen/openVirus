  <title>Comparison of vector competence studies of ZIKV.</title>
  <p>Virus titres calculated by the method of Reed and Muench are expressed as the reciprocal of the log
   <sub>10</sub> dilution, which killed 50% of the mice inoculated. The TCID
   <sub>50</sub> test quantifies the amount of virus required to produce cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated tissue culture cell. PFU is a measure of the number of particles capable of forming plaques per unit volume. FFU is the unit of a variant of the plaque assay, the FFA based on immunostaining techniques. The infection rate corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with virus-infected bodies among those tested. The dissemination rate corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with virus-infected legs among those infected. The transmission rate corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among those infected. The transmission efficiency corresponds to the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among those tested. In the table, high infection, dissemination, or transmission were arbitrarily chosen as values greater than 60% among the tested mosquitoes, a moderate value between 40% and 60%, and a low value less than 40%. AP-61, 
   <italic>Aedes pseudoscutellaris</italic> 61; CHIKV, chikungunya virus; DPI, day post infection; FFA, focus forming assay; FFU, focus forming unit; NA, not available; PFU, plaque forming unit; TCID, tissue culture infectious dose; ZIKV, Zika virus.
