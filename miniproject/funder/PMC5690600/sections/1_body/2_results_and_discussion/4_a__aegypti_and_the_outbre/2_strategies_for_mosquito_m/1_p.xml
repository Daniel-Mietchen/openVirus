<p>The project of eradication of the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito began in the first half of the 20th century, after it had been established that this mosquito transmitted the urban yellow fever. Sanitation reform, in particular getting rid of stagnant water, where this mosquito lays its eggs, was the most effective way to eradicate 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, in combination with the use of insecticides to fight adult mosquitoes [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, through a combination of public education and fumigation, mainly with the organochlorine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Five years later, several South American countries, in association with the Pan American Sanitary Organization, planned on wiping out 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> across the continent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In 1962, after years of indoor residual spraying of high doses of DDT, military-grade organization, and funding to train personnel and buy equipment, the eradication of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> became successful in 18 countries of the Americas plus several islands of the West Indies. As these efforts succeeded, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> control lost political importance, and attention and funding declined [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The failure to maintain this success was and is still now complicated by population increase, extensive and sprawling urbanization, and the lack of municipal infrastructure such as piped water. This failure could mainly explain the regular invasions of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in South America.
