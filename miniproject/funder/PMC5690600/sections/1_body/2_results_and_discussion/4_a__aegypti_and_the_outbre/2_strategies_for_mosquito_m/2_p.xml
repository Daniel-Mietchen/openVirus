<p>Today, the use of insecticides is one of the major components in the global strategy to control mosquito-associated diseases. Indeed, to fight populations of mosquitoes, the available tools include insecticide spatial spraying and reducing the production of larvae. Other methods are used around the world, depending on the legislation of the country, such as introducing

 <italic>aegypti</italic> individuals with the intent to shorten the lifespan of female mosquitoes [

In the absence of controls over these methods, which are highly controversial and also depend on the countryâ€™s legislation, the main global mosquito management strategy remains removing breeding sites and the use of insecticides. The use of insecticides always implies a delicate balance between, on the one hand, their efficacy and the resistance of the target populations and, on the other hand, the demonstrated or supposed toxicity for humans and the environment. In South America, the main target of the antivectorial fight to prevent ZIKV spread was the urban mosquito
