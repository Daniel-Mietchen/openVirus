<p>However, if ZIKV had a sylvatic cycle in South America, it would involve other mosquito species that would not be compatible with the current vector control. In Africa and Asia, sylvatic cycles have been described with ZIKV, involving many species of animals in which the virus or antibodies have been isolated, such as monkeys, rodents, bats, orangutans, and carabaos [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. In the Americas, studies on ZIKV in vertebral hosts are scarce, but the remarkable diversity of Latin American wildlife species provides a potential to establish a sylvatic ZIKV cycle, along with more than 200 mosquito species, which needs to be explored and surveyed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. A sylvatic cycle of ZIKV would make its elimination almost impossible, and the use of insecticides remains focused on the urban mosquito

 <italic>aegypti</italic>. However, the widespread use of these chemical compounds around the world has led to resistant phenotypes in vector populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. These resistant phenotypes are due to a combination of multiple and complex mechanisms, such as the greater metabolic detoxification of insecticides before they reach the nervous system [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] and the decreased sensitivity of the targeted proteins through mutations of the neural targets of the insecticides [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. A question remains to be elucidated; namely, can insecticide resistance interact with pathogen transmission and particularly for ZIKV in mosquitoes? First, insecticide resistance may have a direct impact on ZIKV outbreaks by making it more difficult to satisfactorily reduce mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Secondly, the molecular mechanisms involved in detoxification or in gene response to insecticide exposure such as immune response may interact with signaling pathways involved in response to viral infection, as observed in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> with the parasite 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, in which positive or negative interactions were observed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The number of mosquitoes in a population and the lifespan of resistant insects may be higher in regions where insecticides are used [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Consequently, the observed high resistance rates in the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population of South America may have enhanced the transmission and spread of ZIKV.
