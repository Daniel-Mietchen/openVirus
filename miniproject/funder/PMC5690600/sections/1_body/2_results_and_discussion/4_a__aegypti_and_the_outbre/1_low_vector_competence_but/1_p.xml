<p>Even if in experimental conditions 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>albopictus</italic> show little vector competence, this does not reflect their potential to cause epidemics, driven not only by their vector capacity (i.e., their large populations and host feeding preferences and frequencies) but also by human parameters. Indeed, one of the hypotheses explaining the drastic spread and virulence of the outbreak concerns the origin of the virus. In the Americas, the virus has been described to belong to the Asian genotype and is closely related to the strain that circulated in French Polynesia in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Moreover, vector competence assays with the strain circulating in the Americas did not show high infectivity for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, suggesting that the sole origin of the virus could not explain the differences between the outbreak in the Americas and previous outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The limited diagnostic capabilities in Africa and Asia (i.e., the absence of field research in areas where other arboviral infections were present), combined with a relative immune population, might partly explain why it became a threat in the Americas with a naïve human population. Increased global travel, uncontrolled urbanization associated with areas where the possibility of maintaining proper hygiene is poor, and populations with limited access to water—requiring them to store water, leading to increased mosquito breeding sites—might explain the extent of this epidemic.
