<p>Moreover, despite the absence of evidence, some studies hypothesized that a link exists between climatic events such as El Niño and the spread of ZIKV from Brazil to North America [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. El Niño leads to extreme temperatures in northern South America, which might enhance the development of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Moreover, higher temperatures can increase the habitat of this tropical mosquito and might have an influence on the physiology of the mosquito through higher biting rates, lower mortality, and smaller extrinsic incubation periods. However, the link between ZIKV outbreak in the Americas and this climatic event should be taken with caution insofar as the major CHIKV outbreak in the same area, which is transmitted by the same vector—
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>—occurred in 2014, which was not an El Niño year. Even if 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> does not have a good vector competence, the main reason for its good vectorial capacity relies on the fact that most of the individuals mainly feed on humans with multiple bites in a single gonotrophic cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], which contrasts with the behavior of other mosquito species found during the 2015 outbreak. Moreover, locally, cases of ZIKV were all acquired in areas where 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is present, suggesting that if other species were involved in any significant extent, then there would have been cases in other areas.
