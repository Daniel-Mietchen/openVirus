 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs are desiccation-resistant and can consequently survive for long periods, leading to the potential persistence of arbovirus in the eggs. Like for other flaviviruses such as DENV [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>albopictus</italic> was demonstrated [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The filial infection rate (FIR) in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes injected intrathoracically with ZIKV was 1/290 [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>albopictus</italic> receiving a viremic blood meal had a FIR of 1/84 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This value is not entirely consistent with the previous study and appears to be high compared with the FIR observed for other flaviviruses. ZIKV seems to have a great capacity to be transmitted vertically by 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, and it has been observed that this vertical transmission may be different depending on the origin of the mosquito. It seems that vertical transmission may play a role in the propagation and maintenance of ZIKV, but the impact of this transmission appears to be negligible compared with horizontal transmission [
