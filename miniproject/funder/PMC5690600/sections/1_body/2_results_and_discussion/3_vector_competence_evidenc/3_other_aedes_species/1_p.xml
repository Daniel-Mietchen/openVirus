<p>Although recent studies have mainly focused on the above species, other mosquito species from the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> or 
 <italic>Culex</italic> may have the potential to be good vectors, depending on their geographical distribution. Most of the studies concerning vector competence in other species were conducted after the beginning of the outbreak in the Americas, except for some old studies conducted in the 1950s in Africa. Indeed, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> may not alone account for the extent of this epidemic, and some other species coexisting in the same urban areas might potentially be ZIKV vectors. In addition to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, 11 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, including sylvatic and urban species, have been tested experimentally for their competence (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005933.s001">S1 Table</xref>), showing that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>luteocephalus</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>vittatus</italic> from Senegal have the viral genome in their saliva 15 DPI and, consequently, the potential to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the same study, 
 <italic>Aedes unilineatus</italic> had low infection and dissemination rates and was not able to transmit the virus. Similarly, laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>Aedes triseriatus</italic>, a mosquito known to be a vector of La Crosse virus, tolerant of a wide range of temperatures and broadly distributed across North America, was able to be infected by ZIKV but exhibited dissemination and transmission rates of 0% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, in this study, samples were in too short supply, which could explain this null rate, and further investigation on 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>triseriatus</italic> competence for ZIKV is required. Other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, including 
 <italic>Aedes notoscriptus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes procax</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aedes vigilax</italic> collected in Australia were also infected by ZIKV with a prototype of the African strain. Although methods were similar to other studies performed with 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, these species did not contain virus in the saliva expectorates and, consequently, were not able to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, in another study, Australian 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>notoscriptus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes camptorhynchus</italic> had a low transmission efficiency, suggesting that even though they are probably unable to sustain large outbreaks, these species could trigger some secondary cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Other vector competence studies on 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> collected in the northern US revealed its capacity to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>vexans</italic> is one of the most abundant mosquito species in the northern US. This aggressive mosquito has a long flight range, feeds primarily on large mammals, and attacks humans both day and night [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Its feeding behavior, combined with its ability to transmit ZIKV, could contribute to its role as a potential vector of ZIKV in the Northern Hemisphere. No evidence of ZIKV transmission was highlighted in a population of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> sampled on Tahiti Island, France, without any viral particle found in the saliva [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], nor in 1 
 <italic>Aedes taeniorhynchus</italic> strain from the US coast of the Gulf of Mexico that was refractory to ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> was nevertheless highly suspected in transmission on the Pacific Islands because of its ability to transmit DENV, CHIKV, and the Ross River virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>â€“
