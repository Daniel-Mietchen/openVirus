<p>There is, consequently, a need to conduct field studies to identify the largest number of species from various genera that are potential vectors of ZIKV, as well as laboratory studies to confirm the lack of competence of these species. Moreover, the distinction between vectorial capacity and vector competence must be observed with caution. Vectorial capacity refers to all of the environmental, behavioral, cellular, and biochemical factors that may have an influence on the association between a vector, the pathogen transmitted by the vector, and the vertebrate host to which the pathogen is transmitted [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Vectorial capacity is essentially determined by both environmental and behavioral factors. For example, a particular mosquito species might be genetically and biochemically compatible for the complete development of a particular pathogen (i.e., vector competent for this pathogen), but if this species does not coexist temporally and spatially with a vertebrate host that harbors the pathogen, or if the preferred blood source for this species does not include that vertebrate, this mosquito would not be a suitable vector for this pathogen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Therefore, a mosquito species that has a high vector competence would not automatically imply that this species is a vector of epidemiological importance. For these reasons,
