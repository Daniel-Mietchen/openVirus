<p>Only 2 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species have been tested in vector competence studies, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These 2 species were not able to be infected, suggesting that they do not play a role in ZIKV transmission to humans. Although 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are mostly known to transmit parasites, they are also responsible for transmission of Oâ€™nyong-nyong virus, which is closely related to CHIKV [
