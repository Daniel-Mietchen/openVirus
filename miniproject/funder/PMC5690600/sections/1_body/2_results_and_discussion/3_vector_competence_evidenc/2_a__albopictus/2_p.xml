 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This study revealed that this species was susceptible to the Ugandan strain of ZIKV, with high dissemination rates and high transmission rates and efficiency. Seven DPI, all infected mosquitoes exhibited ZIKV in their salivary glands, contrasting with the results observed during the ensuing years, when transmission efficiency was much lower [
