<p>The extrinsic incubation period for ZIKV in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> varies between these different studies, as do the infection rate, the dissemination rate (with first detection of the virus in the salivary glands between 6 and 14 days post infection [DPI]), and the transmission rate and efficiency. These disparities might be explained by the way these studies were conducted. Several studies have shown that feeding on a viremic animal tends to produce significantly higher infection, dissemination, and transmission rates than feeding on an artificial blood meal through a membrane [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Similarly, using nonfrozen, freshly grown virus tends to produce significantly higher infection (and dissemination and transmission) rates than feeding on an artificial blood meal made with frozen stock virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, the origin—African or Asian—of the ZIKV strain, as well as the origin of the population of mosquitoes, may impact the infection, dissemination, and transmission rates [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, even if the coupling mosquito virus strain is important, the origin of the virus is not sufficient to explain the differences observed in the vector competence studies. Some conflicting results concerning viral transmission were also described. A study on a Senegalese 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population described a high transmission rate of about 88% from 7 DPI [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but mosquitoes were inoculated with ZIKV, a method which cannot be compared with standard vector competence studies. An 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population from Singapore orally infected with ZIKV via an artificial blood meal resulted in salivary gland infection rates of 100% at 10 DPI [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Mexico exhibited high transmission efficiency [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with ZIKV revealed high transmission efficiency, up to 90% at 14 DPI [
