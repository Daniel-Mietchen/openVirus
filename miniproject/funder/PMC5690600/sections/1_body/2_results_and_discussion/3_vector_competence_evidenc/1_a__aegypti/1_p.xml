<p>The first evidence of ZIKV transmission via mosquito bites was found experimentally for an African strain of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in 1956 in Nigeria; even though 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic> was presumed to be the vector, the number of samples was insufficient at that time [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was not primarily suspected to be involved in the transmission of ZIKV, that study demonstrated that the virus was probably able to multiply in this species and that infected mosquitoes were capable of transmitting the virus to a susceptible host. In that study, mosquitoes infected via an artificial blood feeding on a mouse skin membrane transmitted ZIKV to a rhesus monkey up to 72 days post mosquito infection, suggesting the high persistence of the virus in the salivary glands [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> having blood meal on that human [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Only 1 study was conducted in the next 50 years, and this study confirmed the ability of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to transmit the virus to a new host in experimental conditions. This observation was made during a comparison between experimental transmission of yellow fever and ZIKV and observing effects on mice previously inoculated intracerebrally with homogenates of infectious mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While methods of ZIKV titration were generally based on intracerebral inoculation of the virus in mice, after 2012, the literature describes less-invasive methods such as Vero cell line or plaque assay (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005933.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The infectivity titers of a virus can be determined by infecting a particular cell line with increasing dilutions of the virus material and determining the highest dilution producing cytopathic effect in 50% of the inoculated cells. In this case, the 50% endpoint dilution is expressed as tissue culture infectious dose
 <sub>50</sub> (TCID 50/mL). Plaque assays remain one of the most accurate methods for the direct quantification of infectious virion through the counting of discrete plaques [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and are the most used method in ZIKV vector competence studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005933.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These methods are generally complemented with molecular techniques such as quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR that can easily show that viral RNA is present. However, the sole use of this technique indicates the presence of RNA and does not mean that any live virus is present, and the technique needs further testing.
