<p>Nevertheless, to our knowledge, these are the only studies providing such a high transmission efficiency for this species, contrasting with the generally low or moderate transmission efficiency observed in various strains of

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The methods used in the latter competence studies are overall in agreement regarding the origin of the virus (mainly the Asian strain), the viremia of the blood meal, and the mode of administration (mainly artificial blood feeding through membrane). Methods to evaluate ZIKV transmission are generally based on detection or titration of the virus (mainly plaque or TCID assays on saliva expectorates, complemented by qRT-PCR;

However, the engorgement methods (mosquitoes feeding on viremic animal or with an artificial blood meal, the type of membranes), the preparation of the blood meal (virus freshly grown or from a frozen stock), the different virus primers used for detection, the microbiome, the virome, and the origin of the mosquito population are all factors that may lead to the observed conflicting results and require further investigation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005933.s001">S1 Table</xref>). For example, significant variation in competency for ZIKV transmission among

 <italic>Aedes</italic> species may largely explain those differences, as was observed for the transmission rate for several distinct populations of
