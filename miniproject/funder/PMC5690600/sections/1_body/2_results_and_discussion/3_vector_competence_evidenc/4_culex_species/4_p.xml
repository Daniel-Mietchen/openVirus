<p>Based on their refractoriness to infection and the absence of viral particles in the saliva, it appears that the tested

 <italic>pipiens</italic> in which the mosquito midgut barrier was bypassed by inoculating the virus directly into the hemocoel, but neither dissemination nor transmission was observed [
