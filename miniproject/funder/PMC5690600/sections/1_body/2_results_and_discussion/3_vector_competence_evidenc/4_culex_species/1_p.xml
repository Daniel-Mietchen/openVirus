<p>Despite the lack of evidence that various other mosquito species can transmit ZIKV, the supposition that a genus other than 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, such as 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, might be competent in transmitting this virus remains strong. For example, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> is one of the most abundant mosquitoes in anthropized tropical and subtropical areas, as is 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> in anthropized temperate regions. These species have been studied since the beginning of the outbreak in the Americas, and some discrepancies exist concerning their ability to transmit the virus. The absence of, or very low, infection rates, without any subsequent ZIKV transmission, was observed experimentally in 
 <italic>C</italic>.

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, this experiment is based on ZIKV RNA detection without detection of infectious virus, leading to the need for assessing their result. Meanwhile, Chinese 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> was described as a competent vector for ZIKV in experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Though controversial, these studies suggest that caution should be taken with regard to the status of C
 <italic>ulex</italic>. As suggested for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, the method by which the mosquitoes were fed, the different levels of viremia delivered to the mosquitoes, the virome, the microbiome, and the origin of the mosquito population may influence the experimental vector competence of this species.
