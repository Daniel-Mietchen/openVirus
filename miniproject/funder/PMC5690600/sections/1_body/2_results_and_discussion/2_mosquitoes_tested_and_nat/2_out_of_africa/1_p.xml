<p>Between the end of the 1960s and the 2000s, ZIKV dispersed to several Asian countries, as observed through seroprevalence studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], but few vector studies were conducted, possibly because of the clinical similarity of the symptoms of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections. In 2007, after the ZIKV outbreak reported in the Pacific Island of Yap, entomological studies mainly focused on 
 <italic>Aedes hensilli</italic> because of its abundance and the presumption that it was the most likely vector of DENV. Even if 73% of Yap residents were estimated to have been recently infected by ZIKV, the virus was not isolated from the sampled 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hensilli</italic> or 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, high rates of infection were found in a study in which the probable vector 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>hensilli</italic> was experimentally infected, reinforcing the plausibility that this species served as a vector during the ZIKV outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> nevertheless remained the suspected vector in the transmission of ZIKV in Asia.
