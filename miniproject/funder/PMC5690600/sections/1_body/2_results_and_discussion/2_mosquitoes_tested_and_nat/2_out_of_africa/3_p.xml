<p>In 2015, some cases of humans infected by ZIKV were reported in Brazil, developing into an outbreak that spread throughout South America, the Caribbean islands, and Central America. Originally adapted to a zoonotic cycle in Africa, ZIKV evolved into an urban cycle involving a human reservoir and domestic mosquito vectors. In South America, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> are among the most abundant species in urban areas and were first suspected to be the main vectors of ZIKV. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> is both a domestic and opportunistic mosquito in its feeding behavior. Because it does not have a marked trophic preference, the blood meals it takes are largely conditioned by the host populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In South American urban areas, the community of vertebrates is dominated by humans. In this case, the probability that one of these 
 <italic>Culex</italic> takes 2 consecutive blood meals on a human more than 7 days apart is high and could imply a significant role of this species in the transmission of ZIKV. Consequently, at the beginning of the outbreak in the Americas, the questions surrounding the detection of ZIKV only in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species and not in other species remain: was this due to a lack of data, or did this reflect the reality of the situation?
