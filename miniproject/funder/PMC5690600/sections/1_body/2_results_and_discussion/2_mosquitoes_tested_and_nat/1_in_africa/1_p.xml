<p>Historically, the first detections of ZIKV in mosquitoes were observed in species of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> in studies carried out in Africa through methods of immunoassays for detection of antiviral antibodies (mostly hemagglutination inhibition test). The first isolation of ZIKV occurred in 1947 during a routine surveillance for yellow fever in the Zika Forest, Uganda, from a sentinel rhesus monkey [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic>, a sylvatic mosquito, by intracerebral neutralization test in the same forest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The use of defined antisera in these tests permitted differentiation of ZIKV from other known viruses such as yellow fever or DENV. Over the next 10 years, knowledge about ZIKV increased. Primates, including humans, were considered to be the main reservoirs of ZIKV, with transmission to humans primarily through mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In the interim, several arboviruses were isolated in various mosquitoes from the Zika Forest, including 
 <italic>Aedes ingrami</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex annulioris</italic>, but ZIKV remained identified only in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic> (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The first isolation in a species other than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic> occurred in 1969 in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Malaysia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In that study, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was also sampled but did not exhibit ZIKV infection. However, by 2000, ZIKV was detected from 13 distinct mosquito species among the 43 species studied in several African countries (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005933.t001">Table 1</xref>). During a yellow fever outbreak in Nigeria, 
 <italic>Aedes luteocephalus</italic> was shown to be infected by ZIKV. Surprisingly, in that study, neither 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic> nor 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> exhibited the presence of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the primary vector of ZIKV was suspected to be 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, first because of its urban habitats concomitant with the high prevalence observed in human populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and also because its ability to transmit the virus to a new host was shown experimentally [
