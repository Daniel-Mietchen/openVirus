<p>Several arbovirus surveillance studies conducted in Africa highlighted an increasing number of mosquitoes naturally infected with ZIKV. Thus, in the Central African Republic, ZIKV was isolated from 
 <italic>Aedes opok</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>.

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In Senegal, 
 <italic>Aedes furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes taylori</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes dalzieli</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes vittatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>uniformis</italic> were infected by ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as were 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africanus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes neoafricanus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes fowleri</italic>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In the latter study, ZIKV was also isolated from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>coustani</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gambiae</italic>, and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>uniformis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast, ZIKV was isolated from various 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In 2014, another study conducted in Senegal revealed that several 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species were naturally infected by ZIKV, as were 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>perfuscus</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>uniformis</italic>, suggesting that ZIKV was still circulating in Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. ZIKV isolated from 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, or 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> species might reveal their potential role as secondary vectors in the transmission and viral maintenance of ZIKV. However, based on recent studies revealing that neither 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> nor 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> can be considered competent species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], it seems more plausible that this infection was caused by an undigested blood meal after a bite on animals infected with ZIKV. Some nonvector species could also develop gut-limited infections without transmitting the pathogen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Vector competence studies are nevertheless not consensual concerning the ability of these 2 species to be infected and to transmit ZIKV, suggesting that 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species but also other potential vectors transmitting ZIKV should be explored [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. A study performed in Gabon in 2007 isolated ZIKV in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, revealing a new potential threat from this invasive species in Africa but also out of Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although ZIKV hosts are not clearly identified, the ZIKV transmission cycle involves one or more vertebrate hosts and one or more mosquito vectors. In Africa, ZIKV is mainly maintained by a sylvatic cycle involving nonhuman primates; however, some serological studies suggest that other mammals could be reservoirs [
