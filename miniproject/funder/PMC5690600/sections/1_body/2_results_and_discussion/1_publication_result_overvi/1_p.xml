<p>The Boolean search identified 562 articles for “Zika vector,” 865 for “Zika mosquito,” 398 for “Zika culicidae,” 654 for “Zika Aedes,” 73 for “Zika Culex,” and 35 for “Zika Anopheles.” Among these 2,587 records, after eliminating duplicates and irrelevant records, 127 studies were considered eligible, finally resulting in 60 considered relevant to this review (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005933.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among these 60 articles, 37 were related to ZIKV vector competence and 23 corresponded to mosquitoes naturally infected in the field (
