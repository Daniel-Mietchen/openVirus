<p>Despite several years of entomological investigations and the discovery of many mosquito species naturally infected by ZIKV, recent advances revealed that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> may be the major vector driving recent epidemics, while other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species may contribute to the sylvatic transmission cycle of ZIKV. Since the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, the number of studies has soared, and it has been shown that the epidemic resulted from a combination of several factors, including highly anthropophilic mosquito behavior, environment parameters, and human factors such as population increase, urbanization, and the failure to provide municipal services such as piped water. Although our knowledge increases concerning the vector competence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and C
 <italic>ulex</italic> species, there is still a need to explore which other species could be competent for ZIKV. At a time when data on sexual transmission in humans are oriented towards specific public health measures, including state recommendations on sexuality and the procreation of individuals living in an epidemic area, further research on mosquito infection and transmission is fundamental.
