<p>This study was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed and ScienceDirect with a cutoff date of August 15, 2017. Search terms included “Zika” and one of the following search items: “vector,” “mosquito,” “Culicidae,” “Aedes,” “Culex,” and “Anopheles.” Articles reviewed for this study were exclusively in English and French, in addition to some articles obtained through classical search engines because they were not referenced in the above-mentioned databases. After screening the abstracts, titles, and keywords of the identified citations, ineligible articles that mainly focused on outbreaks and the ensuing issues for humans were discarded. Eligible articles were considered relevant if they mentioned one or more aspects of the research question (i.e., entomological studies), regardless of when or where the studies were conducted.</p>
