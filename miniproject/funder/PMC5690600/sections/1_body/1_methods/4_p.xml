<p>The validity of species determination was based on the “Systematic Catalog of Culicidae” provided by the Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the abbreviations for genus follow the recommendations of Reinert [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering that there is no consensus concerning the internal classification of the Aedini tribe proposed by Reinert et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], in the current revision, we decided to use the traditional classification for Aedini.
