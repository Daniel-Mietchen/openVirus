<p>To incriminate a species as a pathogen vector, different criteria are merged into the term “vectorial capacity,” which describes the dynamic relationship between the vectors of infectious diseases and vertebrate hosts, including environmental parameters [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The primary components used in estimating the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes are vector density in relation to host density, host preference, and host feeding patterns. In addition, daily survival rates and the longevity of mosquitoes are used, as well as their extrinsic incubation period and vector competence, which is the intrinsic ability (genetic) of a species (mosquito) to be infected, multiply, and transmit a pathogen to another host [
