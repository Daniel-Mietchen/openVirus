<p>Presently, various facts incriminate the mosquito 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as the main vector of ZIKV, given that it has been shown to be competent in transmitting this virus. This species is the main vector of dengue fever virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and yellow fever virus. It originated in Africa and spread to Neotropical areas in the 17th and 18th centuries. Urbanization is the main factor, which facilitates an increase in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations through the proliferation of human-made containers used to store water in and around inhabited areas, which provide the aquatic larval environment required by these mosquitoes. For this reason, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> appears to be predominant in the transmission and spread of the virus during the recent ZIKV outbreak. Facing the strength and spread of the South American ZIKV epidemics and the fact that 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is not the only mosquito species living in epidemic areas, other species have been suspected to transmit the virus. Moreover, a mosquito that would transmit ZIKV needs to feed on a viremic person and become infected, and the virus must disseminate to the hemocoel, infect the salivary glands, and be secreted into the saliva (this is the vector competence portion of vectorial capacity). That same mosquito must then feed on one or several other person(s) to disseminate ZIKV into the population. For most species of mosquitoes other than 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (and a few closely related species), this would be extremely unlikely because of their lower anthropophilic behavior but would need to be accounted for in determining how that species would be an important vector. This information is critical when determining whether a particular mosquito species can be a vector of epidemiological importance, and that is why studies mainly focused on 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> because they are the most abundant urban mosquitoes in South America and because they preferentially feed on humans. Moreover, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are known to transmit several viruses from the same viral family as ZIKV, such as the West Nile virus or the Japanese encephalitis virus, and current knowledge about 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species needs to be examined with greater consideration. This paper is a systematic review intended to evaluate whether studies performed on ZIKV vectors have brought enough evidence to formally exclude mosquitoes other than the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species (and particularly 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>) as ZIKV vectors. To that end, we discuss the well-established and potential vector competence and capacity of various mosquito species. The relevance of looking more closely at the role played by the mosquito 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, which was considered the main vector of Zika during the American outbreak, was highlighted. The assumption that other mosquito species could have been involved in the past or are involved in current epidemics is reviewed, focusing on vector competence and mosquitoes naturally infected by the virus.
