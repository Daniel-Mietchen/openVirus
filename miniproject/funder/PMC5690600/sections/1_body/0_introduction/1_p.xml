<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) belonging to the family Flaviviridae and the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. It is a single-stranded RNA virus that was first isolated in 1947 from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest in Uganda and in 1948 from

This virus may have been subsequently introduced into Brazil, but the origin of this introduction remains uncertain, and several hypotheses have been proposed, all related to international travel. These hypotheses include the visit of the Pope, with many young Catholics from Africa and Asia visiting Brazil during World Youth Day in July 2013, the World Cup in 2014 gathering thousands of people in stadiums and in various regions of Brazil, and the canoeing championship in Rio de Janeiro in 2014, with participants from Pacific countries in which ZIKV circulated during 2014 [

There has been an increasing interest in ZIKV since the outbreak started in Brazil in 2015 and spread into most of the countries of South and Central America, as well as Florida in the United States, with evidence that infection by ZIKV is associated with neurological complications such as microcephaly and several other neurological malformations in fetuses and newborns [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Current evidence is that ZIKV is not only transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito but also through sexual intercourse [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005933.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, mosquito bites remain the predominant route of virus transmission, with an incubation period of about 9 days and then the onset of symptoms [
