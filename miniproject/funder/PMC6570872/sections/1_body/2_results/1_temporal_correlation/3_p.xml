<p id="Par34">In examining Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we observed a sharp increase in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets that predated the increase in total ZIKV cases by 1 week. In examining the relationship between weekly ZIKV cases and weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets during the study period, applying a 1 week lag term for 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets improved the correlation from 0.64 (zero lag) to 0.77. As with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, a peak in tweets during February coincided with the previously described high media activity.
