 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> is a time-series plot of total (local- and travel-related) ZIKV cases and 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in Florida for each week during the year 2016. As with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the pattern of case reports and tweets was very similar, exhibiting a strong increase during the months of July, August, and September. Tweet counts exhibited a trimodal distribution during the peak of the outbreak. A very similar pattern was apparent for ZIKV cases. Locally acquired ZIKV was not reported until the end of July and peaked during the month of September, after which the pattern of decline followed a similar trajectory as total ZIKV cases.
