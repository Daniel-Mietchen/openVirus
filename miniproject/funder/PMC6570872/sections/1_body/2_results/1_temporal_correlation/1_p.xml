 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is a time-series plot of total (local- and travel-related) ZIKV cases and 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in the United States for each week during the year 2016. As shown, the pattern of case reports and tweets was very similar, exhibiting a gradual increase in both tweets and cases during the spring months, with a prominent peak occurring during summer months. An increase of ZIKV cases during summer months is consistent with the primary mode of ZIKV transmission, namely mosquito bites, since mosquitoes are more prevalent in warmer, humid conditions. After the summer months, tweets and cases both declined. A prominent spike in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets that did not coincide with ZIKV cases was apparent in the first half of February. This peak coincides with the occurrence of the high profile media events previously described; namely, reports of the first ZIKV cases in the U.S., as well as the public health emergency announcement by the WHO and the ZIKV-related emergency funds requested by President Obama. In examining the relationship between weekly ZIKV cases and weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets during the study period, applying a 1 week lag term for 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets resulted in a better correlation (r = 0.67) when compared with either no lag (r = 0.51) or greater lag periods (r = 0.50–65).
