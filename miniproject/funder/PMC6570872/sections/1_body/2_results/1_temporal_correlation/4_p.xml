<p id="Par35">Use of 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets was explored for its potential to serve as an advanced warning signal for impending rises in ZIKV cases. A very similar pattern in tweet frequency existed between the 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> and 
 <italic>zika</italic> keywords. A time-series plot of weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets and 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets occurring in Florida in 2016 is presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1. The correlation between weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> and 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets during 2016 was 0.87 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which is considerably high. Use of the keyword 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> therefore provided no added benefit as a temporal indicator of ZIKV compared to the keyword 
 <italic>zika</italic>. This was most apparent during the peak of the outbreak, when both keywords responded nearly identically over time.
