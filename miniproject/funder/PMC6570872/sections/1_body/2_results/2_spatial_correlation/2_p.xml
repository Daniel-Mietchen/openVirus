States that were in the top quartile for tweets, but not for ZIKV cases, were states that were geographically adjacent (shared border) to states with the highest ZIKV case counts. Such states included Louisiana, Nevada, and Arizona. Of the ten states with the fewest ZIKV cases, six also had the lowest
