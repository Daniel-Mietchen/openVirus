 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> depicts predicted versus measured weekly ZIKV case counts after calibrating the univariate model using only Twitter data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and the multivariate model (Eq.
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) using Twitter data and prior ZIKV case counts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b) for the state of Florida. Models were calibrated using 52 weekly data points. However, since forecasts required 3 weeks of prior data, only 49 points could be predicted and plotted. Results for predicted and observed case counts in Florida using the univariate model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) demonstrated that Twitter data alone can be a useful predictor of weekly case counts (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.60), predicting about as well as prior ZIKV case counts (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.61). However, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b demonstrated that combining prior ZIKV case counts and Twitter data results in a substantially improved model, with a higher R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.74 (RMSE = 11.7 cases). The combined model using prior ZIKV and Twitter data suggests good predictive ability. Plotting predicted and observed case counts following cross-validation of the multivariate model produced an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.67 and RMSE of 13.3 cases. This further indicates reasonable performance of the model considering that in this case no information from the plotted points was used in model calibration.
