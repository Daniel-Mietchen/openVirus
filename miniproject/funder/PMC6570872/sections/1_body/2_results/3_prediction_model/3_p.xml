 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents regular effect estimates and standardized estimates for covariates, along with standard errors, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-values for the multivariate and univariate models calibrated in Florida and the U.S. The R
 <sup>2</sup> value for the fit of observed versus predicted weekly ZIKV case counts following calibration for each model is also presented. All covariates in the presented models were significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Intercept effects were not significant, thus contributing little to the models. This is expected since first-order differencing was applied (mean should approximate zero).
