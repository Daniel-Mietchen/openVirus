 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is similar to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, depicting predicted versus measured weekly ZIKV case counts according to a univariate model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) and multivariate model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In this case, however, the U.S. model was applied using data for the entire nation. Similarly, results for predicted and observed case counts using the univariate model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) demonstrated that Twitter data alone can be a useful predictor of weekly case counts (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.63); again predicting about as well as the univariate model using prior ZIKV case reports. However, in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b we again observed that combining prior ZIKV case counts and Twitter data led to model improvement, with a higher R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.70 (RMSE = 44.5 cases). Following internal cross-validation of the multivariate model, predicted and observed case counts in the U.S. resulted in an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.57 and RMSE of 54.2 cases. This suggests that the Florida model performed better following validation than the U.S. model. Upon elimination of a single outlier prediction in October, however, validation results for the U.S. model improved markedly, with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.63 and RMSE of 49.4 cases.
