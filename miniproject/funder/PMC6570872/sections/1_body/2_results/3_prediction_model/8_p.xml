 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows a time-series plot of observed and predicted weekly ZIKV case counts during 2016 in the U.S using the nationally calibrated multivariate model. Similar to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, predictions represent results from the internal cross-validation process. As shown, the national model predicted the general increase in case counts during spring, followed by a summertime peak, and subsequent decline in the fall. However, the model missed the onset of the first major peak in summer case counts and under-predicted the second peak. The third and highest peak that occurred in August, however, was predicted well by the model in terms of timing, magnitude, and duration. A subsequent summertime peak was predicted prematurely, followed by a false prediction peak. Overall, the correlation between predicted and measured weekly ZIKV case counts was still high, with a correlation coefficient of 0.75 (
