 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows a time-series plot using cross-validation results of observed and predicted weekly ZIKV case counts during 2016 using the multivariate Florida model. Since validation results were used, none of the predicted data shown in this plot was incorporated in the model calibration process. Rather, each weekly prediction represents the single held out point that was predicted on during each iteration of the validation process. As shown, a very similar pattern in weekly predicted and observed case counts exists over time. The general increase in case counts during spring, followed by a summertime peak, and subsequent decline in the fall is predicted well by the model. The two major outbreak peaks observed during summer were also predicted well in terms of magnitude and time of onset. However, in the case of the largest peak, the duration of this major outbreak period was under-predicted slightly. The correlation between predicted and measured weekly ZIKV case counts was high, with a correlation coefficient of 0.82 (
