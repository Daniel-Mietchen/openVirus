<p id="Par19">In this study, we demonstrate the value of utilizing time- and geo-tagged information embedded in the Twitter data stream to 1) examine the relationship between weekly ZIKV cases and ZIKV-related tweets temporally and spatially, 2) assess whether Twitter data can be used to predict weekly ZIKV cases and, if so, 3) develop weekly ZIKV predicative models that can be used for early warning purposes on a state and national level. This study contributes to the body of literature.</p>
