<p id="Par11">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne arbovirus that causes serious public health consequences. Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species mosquito (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Currently there is no medicine or vaccine to cure or prevent ZIKV infection. Therefore, infection containment, vector control and personal protection are the most important measures to prevent infections and contain viral spread [
