<p id="Par18">In one study, Teng et al. (2017) developed models to forecast cumulative ZIKV cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, these models were developed to predict ZIKV cases cumulatively, and on a global basis. Further, these studies did not make use of the Twitter data stream, but rather Google Trends. Similarly, Majumder et al. (2016) developed models to forecast ZIKV case counts in Columbia during the recent ZIKV epidemic [

In our research, we identified only a single study that attempted to forecast ZIKV using the Twitter data steam, and on a weekly basis. In this study by McGough et al. (2017), the authors demonstrated the utility of developing Twitter-based models to forecast ZIKV in countries of South America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, given the lack of robust diagnostic capabilities in the region, the study was limited to using “suspected,” rather than “confirmed,” ZIKV cases. Additionally, the study did not examine spatial patterns of ZIKV cases and tweets, nor did it compare local- versus national-level modeling. To the best of our knowledge, there has been only a single study to date to harness digital data streams for near-real time weekly forecasting of ZIKV cases, and no such study to date that has utilized Twitter data for ZIKV forecasting in the United States and offered a comparison of national- and state-level models [
