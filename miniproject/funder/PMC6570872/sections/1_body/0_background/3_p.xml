In the United States, disease surveillance is supported by the CDC Division of Health Informatics and Surveillance and is carried out through a variety of networks that involve the collaboration of thousands of agencies at the federal, state, territorial, and tribal levels across health departments, laboratories, and hospitals [

Importantly, while ZIKV cases reported from official sources such as the CDC are of high quality, such reporting is not timely due to an internal protocol of these offices to collect and verify data prior to formal publication. In addition, the cases reported by any single source do not always reflect all the cases that truly exist. More importantly, in many countries or regions with poor infrastructure and healthcare systems, established systems for such case reporting do not exist. To collect as much ZIKV case information as possible with minimal delay, other services are available that can publish such information more timely.
