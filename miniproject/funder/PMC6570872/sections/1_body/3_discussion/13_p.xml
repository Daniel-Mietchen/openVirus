<p id="Par58">When comparing national versus Florida ZIKV cases and tweets, time-series analyses showed national tweets to increase more dramatically during the major outbreak period, responding less to weekly vicissitudes in case counts (Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Although this could suggest the potential for over-prediction of ZIKV cases for a national-based model, application of a U.S. model showed this to not be an issue. However, false prediction and timing of high ZIKV activity periods were apparent issues in the national model. That U.S. tweet counts responded less sensitively to ZIKV case counts, and that the U.S. model did not perform as well as the Florida model, makes sense given the higher spatial coverage of the entire U.S. relative to ZIKV hotspot regions (e.g. FL, CA, NY, and TX).
