<p id="Par54">Understanding why 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets correlate well with ZIKV case counts and therefore offer utility as a surveillance tool is an interesting question. It is possible that 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets are capturing tweets related to first-hand illness, or that such tweets are merely capturing ZIKV awareness, or a combination of both. While this is an area of active research, the lack of a complete understanding of this relationship does not prevent 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets from serving as a useful predictor variable in the development of ZIKV forecasting models.
