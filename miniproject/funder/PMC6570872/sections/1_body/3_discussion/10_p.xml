 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. That is, while our models demonstrate the ability of Twitter data to serve as an indicator of disease activity, such data should not be viewed as a substitute for traditional data collection and analysis, but rather a supplement to such traditional approaches. In future work, combining Twitter data with traditionally collected data related to vector population density, vaccine injection, transmissibility, and basic reproductive number would be useful to incorporate into modeling efforts.
