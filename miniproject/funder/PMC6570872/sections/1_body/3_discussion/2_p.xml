<p id="Par47">During model development, 1 week lagged 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets were best correlated with weekly ZIKV cases. This is visually apparent during the major outbreak period in Florida, where a sharp rise in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets appeared to precede ZIKV cases by 1 week. A possible explanation is that an inherent temporal difference exists between Twitter chatter and ZIKV diagnosis. For instance, it is plausible that discussion of ZIKV (potentially due to the presence of symptomatic or hospitalized family members or friends) predates actual diagnosis. In this case, a rise in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets would predict a rise in ZIKV cases. Whether or not this temporal difference in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets is truly reflecting chatter related to the impending rise in ZIKV cases, however, cannot be confirmed here.
