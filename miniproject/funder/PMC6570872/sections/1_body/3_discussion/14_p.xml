<p id="Par59">The keyword 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> was also examined for its potential to serve as an early signal of locally acquired ZIKV, given that a rise in mosquitoes (the primary ZIKV vector) would expectedly lead to a rise in ZIKV. This keyword, however, provided no added benefit over use of the keyword 
 <italic>zika</italic>. Rather, 
 <italic>zika</italic> and 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets were tightly correlated throughout the entire year.
