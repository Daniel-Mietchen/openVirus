<p id="Par48">It is worth noting that reports of the first locally acquired ZIKV in Florida corresponded with the sharp rise in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in August. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the initial sharp rise in 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets occurring in summer could reflect chatter related to the first few cases of locally acquired ZIKV, rather than the impending increase in total ZIKV cases that occurred the following week. This explanation, however, fails to explain the overall higher correlation between ZIKV case counts and 1 week lagged 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets over the entire study period.
