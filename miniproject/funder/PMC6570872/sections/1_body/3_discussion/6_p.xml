<p id="Par51">Also noteworthy, since these are statistical models that depend on previous case reports, they cannot be used to predict a ZIKV outbreak where no prior case reports exist. Additionally, given their dependence on historical trends, these models are limited in their ability to predict historically anomalous events that could give rise to dramatic changes in disease prevalence. To this end, mechanistic models that take into account meteorology, vector distribution, population distribution and movement would provide more insight. Also, a diagnosis issue related to the cross-reactivity of diagnostic assays with other arboviruses presents a unique challenge for ZIKV surveillance. This challenge exists with traditional surveillance methods and is still an issue using our modeling approach.</p>
