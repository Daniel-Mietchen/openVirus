<p id="Par61">In terms of spatial distribution across the U.S., ZIKV case reports were highly correlated with population-adjusted 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets. States with the most ZIKV cases also had the highest 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweet prevalence while states with the fewest cases had the lowest tweet prevalence. This suggests that in addition to temporal accuracy, Twitter data may be a useful tool for predicting disease prevalence spatially. Additionally, this reinforces the potential utility of using Twitter data for ZIKV disease surveillance at the national level.
