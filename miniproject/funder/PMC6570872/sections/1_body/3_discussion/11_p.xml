<p id="Par56">A prominent, temporary spike in tweets that did not coincide with ZIKV cases occurred in early February. This was visible in total U.S. data and Florida data. Such a spike was months ahead of actual major ZIKV activity in the U.S. and can be explained by several important media-related occurrences. This time period marked the occurrence of the first cases of ZIKV to be reported in the United States by the CDC (week of Jan. 30). Of additional relevance was the WHO having declared a ZIKV public health emergency of international concern (Feb. 1) and President Obama announcing a request for $1.8 billion in ZIKV-related emergency funds the following week (Feb. 8). This was a very high profile week for ZIKV in terms of media attention. The inflation of such tweets by these respective events was reflected in actual Twitter content. A qualitative content analysis of trending ZIKV-related topics during this time period supported the existence of particular concern among the population over the arrival of ZIKV to the U.S., showing an overwhelming prevalence of such tweets as “Zika Health Emergency,” “Zika Virus is in the US!,” and “Great, Zika cases here.” Additionally, tweets that included “#CDC” were 2–4 times higher during the period when these events took place than during any week over the following 3 month period. Since these instances of media-related tweet inflation were infrequent, they did not appear to impact our predictive models. In using Twitter data for disease surveillance in the future it is nonetheless important for researchers to be mindful of the influence such major media headlines can have on tweet count, so as not to infer disease.</p>
