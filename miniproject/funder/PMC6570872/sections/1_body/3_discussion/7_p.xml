<p id="Par52">Residuals plots for our models exhibited a departure from normality, with models tending to over-predict at low case count values and under-predict at high case counts. The modelsâ€™ capability in predicting the full range of cases is compromised because of its over-prediction at extremely low values and under-prediction at extremely high values. Although this tendency toward extreme value prediction is quite common in statistical predictive models trained based on a limited number of measurement data, it nonetheless represents a limitation in this type of statistical modeling that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
