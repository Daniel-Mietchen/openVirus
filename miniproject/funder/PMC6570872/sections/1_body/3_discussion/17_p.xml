<p id="Par62">More research is necessary to identify an appropriate national-level predictive model. Additionally, future modeling efforts should attempt to separate tweets indicating awareness from tweets indicating infection. This could be accomplished by conducting a detailed content analysis of 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets. For instance, researchers could assemble a list of keywords or phrases in order to filter out non-infection related 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets. Once validated, this approach would produce a new time-series dataset of 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts that could be used to calibrate a new predictive model of ZIKV case counts. This approach would enable us to understand the underlying relationships between tweets and case counts. Lastly, calibration of other state-wide models for comparison with our Florida model is a worthwhile area of future research in order to understand how the relationship between Twitter data and disease incidence might vary from state-to-state, and to better utilize such data for predictive purposes in other regions.
