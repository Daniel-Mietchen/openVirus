<p id="Par46">Weekly ZIKV case reports and 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets in the U.S. and in Florida exhibited very similar temporal patterns, peaking during summer and declining in fall. A multivariate auto-regression analysis using Florida and U.S. data demonstrated 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets to be an important predictor of weekly ZIKV case counts during the 2016 study period. Combined with information of previous ZIKV case counts, we calibrated two models that were able to estimate weekly ZIKV cases 1 week in advance with reasonable accuracy; one model for Florida and one model for the U.S. Both models performed best when both prior ZIKV case count data and Twitter data were included. Following calibration of the models, and subsequent internal cross-validation, a comparison of predicted versus observed weekly ZIKV case counts demonstrated reasonable model performance for the Florida model and reduced, but still moderate, performance for the national model. A time-series plot of predicted and observed case counts similarly showed the Florida model to predict reasonably well and the national model to predict moderately well. While a comparison of observed and model-predicted ZIKV case counts produces R
 <sup>2</sup> values ≥0.70 for the Florida model, we must be careful not to overstate the model performance given that disease forecasting models can sometimes yield R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9. Nonetheless, results for both models in this study suggest that Twitter data can be used to help track ZIKV prevalence during outbreak periods. Given that Twitter data is immediately available, compared to a delay of cases often reported by the CDC, Twitter represents a particularly useful tool for epidemiologist and public health officials involved in disease surveillance.
