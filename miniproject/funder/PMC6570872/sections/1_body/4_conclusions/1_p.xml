 <italic>Zika</italic> tweets exhibited a very similar temporal pattern as ZIKV case counts in the U.S. during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic. An auto-regression analysis using data from Florida showed 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets to be a significant predictor of ZIKV cases, with model evaluation demonstrating that weekly ZIKV case counts could be predicted 1 week in advance with reasonable accuracy. By comparison, a nationally calibrated model showed reduced, but still moderate predictive ability. Model performance was improved for both models with the inclusion of prior ZIKV case count data, as opposed to just Twitter data. This study suggests that Twitter data can serve to signal changes in disease activity during an outbreak period. Additionally, spatial mapping of ZIKV and 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets across the U.S. showed similar patterns. States with the most ZIKV cases had the highest 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweet prevalence while states with the fewest cases had the lowest tweet prevalence, indicating that spatial ZIKV predictive modeling may be possible at the national level.
