<p id="Par24">Time-series analysis was conducted for weekly ZIKV cases and 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets to illustrate their patterns over the 2016 study period. This was also conducted for 
 <italic>mosquito</italic> tweets. To assess the correlation of weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets with weekly ZIKV cases, we produced Pearson correlation coefficients. To assess the potential lag in time between ZIKV cases and each tweet keyword, we examined the change in these coefficients after applying lags ranging from 0 to 6 weeks. This time range takes into account the approximately 1–2 week incubation period of ZIKV as well as the potential 2–4 week delay between ZIKV laboratory testing and reporting [
