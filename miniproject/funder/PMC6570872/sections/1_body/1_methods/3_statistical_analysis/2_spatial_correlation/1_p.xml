<p id="Par25">The cumulative prevalence of ZIKV cases was also examined and correlated (using Pearson correlation) with cumulative 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweets spatially across the U.S. Results were depicted in the form of two maps, each divided into four shaded quartiles. For this analysis, cases and tweets for each state were calculated as the sum of cases and tweets from January 1, 2016 through January 24, 2017. Cases were depicted as raw case counts. However, for proper spatial comparison, cumulative tweets were adjusted according to state population, using 2016â€‰U.S. Census Bureau population estimates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Therefore, tweets per 100,000 people were reported, and referred to as tweet prevalence. Cumulative data was calculated through January 24, 2017 because the CDC only provides cumulative state-by-state ZIKV prevalence data for the date that data is accessed, not historically. That is, the CDC maintains an online report that is updated each week, at which point historical numbers are no longer available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In our case, we accessed the CDC website on January 24, 2017. This additional 24 day period is unlikely to have impacted our analysis as the ZIKV epidemic had dramatically slowed by this point, adding relatively few additional cases.
