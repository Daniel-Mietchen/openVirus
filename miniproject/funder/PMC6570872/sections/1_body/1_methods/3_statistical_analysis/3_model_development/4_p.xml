<p id="Par29">In testing models, two highly inflated weekly 
 <italic>zika</italic> tweet counts that occurred well before the major onset of the ZIKV epidemic, and which could be explained by high profile media events, were reduced to the mean of their before and after values. These inflated points occurred during the first 2 weeks of February, coinciding with the timing of the first ZIKV cases reported in the United States by the CDC (week of Jan. 30). Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared a ZIKV public health emergency of international concern that same week (Feb. 1) followed by an announced request by President Obama the following week (Feb. 8) for $1.8 billion in ZIKV-related emergency funds [
