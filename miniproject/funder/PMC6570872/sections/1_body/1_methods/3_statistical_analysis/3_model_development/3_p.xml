<p id="Par28">In order to select an appropriate predictive model for Florida and a model for the U.S., several steps were taken. First, candidate models were identified. A model was considered a candidate model only if all predictor terms were significant at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and if auto-correlation of residuals passed the white noise test (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Candidate models were then compared and the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was selected as the final model (one model for Florida and one for the U.S.). Using the AIC criterion ensured that the chosen models were not over fit. Final models were also evaluated to ensure normality of residuals.
