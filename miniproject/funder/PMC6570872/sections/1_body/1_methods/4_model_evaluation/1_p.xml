<p id="Par31">To validate the models we applied forecast evaluation with a rolling origin, which is a form of leave-one-out cross-validation. That is, a model was fit to all but one (left out) weekly data point. The fitted data was then used to predict the left out data point. This process was repeated 52 times (for all weeks), with each iteration holding out a new weekly data point. This process generated a new data set composed entirely of predicted weekly ZIKV case counts for each model. The predicted and measured values for these aggregated datasets were then plotted in the form of two scatter plots (one for the Florida model and one for the U.S. model) as well as two time-series plots. Goodness of fit for predictions was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>) and root mean squared error (RMSE) for the scatter plots of predicted and measured weekly ZIKV case counts.
