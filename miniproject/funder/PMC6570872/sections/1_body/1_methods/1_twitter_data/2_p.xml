<p id="Par21">Live tweet counts from Cloudberry were collected using Twitter’s open streaming API, which has been shown to be representative of Twitter’s greater information database and therefore useful for research purposes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The Streaming API can take three parameters; namely, keywords (words, phrases, or hashtags), geographical boundary boxes, and user ID. For the first two parameters, in order to identify and compile tweets that were relevant to ZIKV, we filtered data for the entire U.S. and for Florida during the year 2016 using the keywords 
 <italic>zika</italic> and 
 <italic>mosquito</italic>. The latter keyword was employed to explore whether it could provide an early warning signal of impending ZIKV activity. For the third parameter, no user ID was specified so as not to restrict sample size. Tweet counts were summed by week in order to be used in weekly prediction models. In using Twitter data for this study, we complied with Twitter’s terms, conditions, and privacy policies.
