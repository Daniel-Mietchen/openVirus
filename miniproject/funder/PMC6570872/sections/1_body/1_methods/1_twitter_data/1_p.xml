<p id="Par20">We utilized a general-purpose system called Cloudberry to filter a 1% random sample of U.S. Twitter data. Cloudberry is a subscription client of the Twitter stream application program interface (API). It is connected to the big data management system Apache AsterixDB, which allows for the efficient transformation of front-end data requests, and the continuous ingest and storage of data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the Cloudberry system, the geographic location filtering parameters are set by a rectangular bounding box that includes all U.S. territory. Since this boundary box also covers Canada and parts of Mexico, tweets that are not published in the U.S. are deleted. Cloudberry enables interactive analytics and visualizations of large amounts of data containing temporal, spatial, and textual components common to Twitter and other social media applications. Data collection from Cloudberry began on November 17, 2015, with approximately one million tweets stored per day, and over 874 million tweets collected so far. The Cloudberry system enables the filtration of millions of tweets according to specific parameters set by the API user.
