    <bold>Figure S5.</bold> Scatter plot of residuals for the a) Florida and b) U.S. models. A very similar pattern in tweet frequency exists between the keywords 
    <italic>zika</italic> and 
    <italic>mosquito</italic>. Use of the keyword 
    <italic>mosquito</italic> therefore provided no added benefit as a temporal indicator of ZIKV compared to the keyword 
    <italic>zika</italic>. In terms of model selection, AIC values for various candidate models as well as univariate models for Florida and the U.S. are presented. Zero mean test results are also shown, suggesting that we can reject the null hypothesis that a unit root exists. Diagnostic results for the Florida and U.S. predictive models include an assessment of white noise, normality of residuals, heteroscedasticity, and partial auto-correlation (PACF). The white noise assessments indicate that more complex models were not necessary, while residuals plots assessing normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals suggest that residuals were not normally distributed for either model. In general, our models tended to over-predict at low case count values and under-predict at high case counts, thus suggesting a limitation of our models. PACF analyses support our choice as it relates to the number of lag terms used for the Florida model and the U.S. model. (DOCX 456 kb)
