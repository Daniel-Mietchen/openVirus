<p>We developed logistic regression models to assess correlates with current IPV at baseline, and with current IPV during follow-up study visits. For current IPV at baseline, 431 women contributed complete data (
 <xref rid="pone.0202992.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Of the women excluded from the analysis, 2 were missing data on current IPV at baseline, 13 were missing data on age at sexual debut, 6 were missing employment status, and 3 were missing household asset index. Household asset index, education, age at sexual debut, and social support were excluded from the adjusted model. In the adjusted model, being married (ARR 2.33, 95% CI 1.13â€“4.81) was associated with higher risk of experiencing current IPV.
