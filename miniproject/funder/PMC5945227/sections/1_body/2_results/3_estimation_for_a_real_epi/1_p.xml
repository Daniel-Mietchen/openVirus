<p>Once validated on simulated epidemics, we used the developed inference framework to estimate the dispersal kernel of 
 <italic>Plum pox virus</italic> (and thus of the flight distances of the infectious aphid vectors) based on survey data. As a first step, we inferred the number of introduction patches. For 
 <italic>κ</italic>&lt;10, no combination of introduction patches returned a finite posterior log-likelihood. The Fisher information criterion was maximised at 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 11 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g005">Fig 5</xref>), indicating that improvement in model fit saturates beyond this point. This suggests that the most robust inference is obtained with 
 <italic>κ</italic> = 11. These 11 introduction events among 547-579 orchards planted over 22 years (planting date is unknown for 32 orchards) correspond to disease introduction probabilities of 0.5 per year and 1.90-2.01×10
 <sup>−2</sup> per orchard planted.
