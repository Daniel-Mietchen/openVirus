<p>A key inovation in our estimation procedure is the BWME dispersal kernel. This kernel provides close approximations to exponential-power and power-law kernels for all tested values of the shape parameter (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s005">S5</xref> Figs). Such flexibility is an interesting property when one does not know which kernel type to assume, which is a common issue. However, the fit to the 2Dt kernels was more approximate (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This is not surprising since the 2Dt kernel is essentially a continuous mixture of Gaussians. Thus, switching the basis functions from exponential to Gaussian (giving a BWMG kernel) may greatly improve the fit.
