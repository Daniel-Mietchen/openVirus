<p>The estimated values of the other parameters are generally close to the values used for simulation, but the relative bias varies among parameters, kernel ranges, and introduction scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). Detection sensitivity (
 <italic>ρ</italic>) is the most precisely estimated parameter, followed by the shape of the latent period (
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>) for which the estimates are also almost unbiased. Bias can be more severe for the scale of the latent period (
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) and the transmission coefficient (
 <italic>β</italic>), with up to 45% under- and over-estimation (respectively) in the worst-case combinations of kernel and introduction scenarios (

 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and bottom row for 
 <italic>β</italic>). For these two parameters, the impact of the introduction scenario on parameter estimation increases with kernel range.
