<p>The distribution of Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances between simulated and estimated kernels demonstrates that estimation accuracy is not affected by the inclusion of sensitivity and latent period parameters in the estimation scheme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Neither is the median accuracy of the estimated kernels affected much by the range of the dispersal kernel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, for longer-range dispersal kernels, KL distances can become more extreme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and the span and variance of their 95% credibility intervals increase (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). This shows that the precision of the estimated kernel decreases with increasing dispersal range. The most influential factor on the accuracy and precision of estimated dispersal kernels is the introduction scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). However, the effect of the introduction scenario is neither strongly related to the number of introduction patches nor to the associated initial prevalence, but rather to the presence of an introduction patch in the dense central cluster of patches (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The impact of kernel range and introduction scenario on kernel estimation can also be seen by the visual comparison between simulated and estimated kernels (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s009">S9</xref> and
