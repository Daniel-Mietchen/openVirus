<p>The simulation-estimation study on 
 <italic>ρ</italic> shows that the estimation procedure is robust to detection sensitivities below the default value (0.8) used in the rest of this work. Indeed, although reducing 
 <italic>ρ</italic> reduces (by definition) the proportion of detected cases, the link between detection and epidemic control results in a disproportionate increase in the total number of infected hosts as 
 <italic>ρ</italic> decreases, providing more data for statistical inference–except when 
 <italic>ρ</italic> reaches extremely small values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). As a result (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s014">S14</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s015">S15</xref> Figs): (i) accuracy of kernel estimation is not reduced as detection sensitivity decreases; (ii) precision of kernel estimation is only affected when 
 <italic>ρ</italic> is very close to 0 or 1; (iii) increasing the precision of the prior on 
 <italic>ρ</italic> only affects the accuracy of kernel estimation for 
 <italic>ρ</italic>&gt;0.8 (i.e. when epidemic size–and thus data available for inference–is strongly reduced by effective control). Finally, we note that stochastic variations among replicated epidemics have more influence than 
 <italic>ρ</italic> on the KL distance between simulated and estimated kernels (
