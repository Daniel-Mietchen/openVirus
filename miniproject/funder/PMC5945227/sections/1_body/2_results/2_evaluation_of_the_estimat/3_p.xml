<p>For each of the 3 simulated kernels, the distribution of KL distances was summarised by its minimum, quartile and maximum values across all 7 introduction scenarios × 10 epidemics per scenario. The comparison between simulated kernels and their estimates within the most exhaustive scheme (Θ
 <sub>4</sub>) shows that the 3 kernels are very accurately estimated for some simulated epidemics (left column in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). However, dispersal distances are often overestimated, with the median KL distance increasing from 5.2×10
 <sup>−2</sup> to 6.1×10
 <sup>−2</sup> with increasing kernel range. A closer look at the estimation curves corresponding to the median KL distance reveals that estimated distances do not exceed the simulated distances by more than 0.25 on the log
 <sub>10</sub> scale. Dispersal distances are thus overestimated by a factor below 1.8 (1.2 for the mode; see central column in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). Even for the most challenging of the 70 epidemics simulated with the long-range dispersal kernel (bottom-right panel in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), the difference between the two curves remains below 0.6 on the log
 <sub>10</sub> scale. This value translates into less than 4-fold estimation errors (less than 4.3 for the mode; see right column in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s011">S11 Fig</xref>), which is high but still within one order of magnitude. By contrast, precision is very high for all kernel ranges, as indicated by a median span below 0.04 for the 95% posterior credibility interval of KL distances (
