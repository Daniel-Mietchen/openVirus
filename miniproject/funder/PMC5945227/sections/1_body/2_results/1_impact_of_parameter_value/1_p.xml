<p>The parameter combinations chosen to test the inference procedure cover a wide range of epidemic behaviour, from local to widespread epidemics and from low to high incidence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The general trends are that the stochastic variability has less effect than the introduction scenario or kernel type, that more introduction patches generally lead to more widespread epidemics, and that higher disease prevalence in the introduction patches does not necessarily increase the final local cumulative incidence (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s003">S3</xref> Figs). Increasing kernel range generally decreases the cumulative incidence (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s003">S3</xref> Figs), especially near the introduction patches, although these epidemics are more widespread (
