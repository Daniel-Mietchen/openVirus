<p>In order to test whether BWME kernels provide a good approximation of other dispersal kernels, we fitted a BWME kernel to 3 standard [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] dispersal kernel types (exponential-power, power-law, and 2Dt), all with the same mean distance travelled (100 m). Model fitting was performed by minimizing the total absolute difference between the marginal cumulative distribution functions at 20,000 points spaced evenly between 0 and 1000 m. For each type of disperal kernel, 4 values of the shape parameter were tested.
