<p>Our model has a compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (
 <italic>SEIR</italic>) structure that aims to reduce bias in parameter estimates by accounting for irregular patch geometry, detection-dependent removal, imperfect detection sensitivity, interval censoring of between-compartment transition times, missing data and parameter uncertainty. We address these challenges by: (i) integrating a mixture of exponential dispersal kernels over source and receiver patches to compute between-patch connectivity; (ii) splitting the infectious state 
 <italic>I</italic> into hidden (
 <italic>H</italic>) and detected (
 <italic>D</italic>) sub-states (

 <italic>SEHDR</italic> model–one for stochastic simulations and the other for Bayesian inference–are described below (for further details, see Texts A and B in
