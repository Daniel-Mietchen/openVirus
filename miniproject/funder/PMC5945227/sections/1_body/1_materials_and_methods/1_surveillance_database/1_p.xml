<p>In the early 1990’s, an outbreak of the M strain of PPV was detected in peach/nectarine patches (orchards) in southern France [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The plant health services implemented a control strategy based on disease surveillance and removal of symptomatic trees. This process involved the routine collection of patch-level data comprising the observed number of new cases (trees with PPV-typical discolouration symptoms on flowers and leaves) and the corresponding inspection dates, as well as patch attributes (location, planting and removal years, planting density, etc.). We aggregated the information about a 5.6×4.8 km production area over surveillance years 1992-2006 into a unique georeferenced database, with patch boundary coordinates obtained from digitised aerial photographs. With 4820 inspections over 15 years in 553 patches (mean area: 0.95 ha; 52 orchards were replanted in these patches during that period), this database is a precious resource for inference on aphid-mediated viral dispersal in patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscapes. Moreover, to account for seasonal variation in the number of flying aphids, we used in our model the average (over 17 years) weekly number of flying aphids collected from a 12-m-high Agraphid suction tower located within the bio-geographical region of the study area.
