<p>Using PPV surveillance data, estimation was carried out under the most exhaustive scheme (Θ
 <sub>4</sub>) to infer parameters of the spatial 
 <italic>SEHDR</italic> model. As above, and for the same reasons, we ran multiple MCMC chains and retained the chain with the highest mean posterior log-likelihood (Text C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s018">S1 Texts</xref>). The number of introduction patches 
 <italic>κ</italic> was fixed at integer values in the range 1-24, and 30 chains were run per fixed 
 <italic>κ</italic>. This approach was taken because each unit increase in 
 <italic>κ</italic> adds two parameters (additional introduction patch identity and initial prevalence) to Θ, which always increases the posterior log-likelihood (various uninformative and weakly informative priors were tested). Thus, to avoid over-fitting, identification of 
 <italic>κ</italic> was treated as a model selection problem for which we maximised the Fisher information criterion
