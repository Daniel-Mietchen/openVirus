<p>To assess the accuracy (i.e. amount of bias) and precision (i.e. amount of variance) of the estimation of dispersal parameters, 10 epidemics were simulated under each combination of 7 disease introduction scenarios × 3 dispersal kernels × 4 parameter estimation scenarios. All simulations were performed under the same virtual landscape derived from the surveillance database: we retained the spatial coordinates (and thus the geometry) of the patch polygons, but all other potential spatio-temporal dependencies were suppressed through the random permutation of orchard-level data including planting densities and patch planting/removal/replanting dates. When density or planting date were missing in the database, their values were drawn from the corresponding empirical distribution. Simulations were performed with 1 time step per day, and 1 survey per patch per year, with inspection days drawn from the corresponding empirical distribution. The transmission coefficient
