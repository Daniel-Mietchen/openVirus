<p>Finally, to assess the impact of detection sensitivity (
 <italic>ρ</italic>) on the accuracy and precision of the estimation of the dispersal kernel, we performed an additional simulation-estimation study. For 99 equally spaced values of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> between 0.01 and 0.99, a unique epidemic was simulated. Each epidemic started at year 1 from a single introduction patch with 25% prevalence, and spread under the long-range kernel scenario (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006085.t001">Table 1</xref>). Default values were used for all other parameters. For each of the 99 simulated epidemics, independent estimations were carried out under the most exhaustive scheme (Θ
 <sub>4</sub>) with 3 prior distributions for detection sensitivity 
 <italic>ρ</italic> corresponding to different levels of available prior information (Text B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s018">S1 Texts</xref>). For each combination of prior × detection sensitivity, 10 MCMC chains were run, leading to 2970 MCMC chains. For each value of 
 <italic>ρ</italic>, posterior distributions were inferred using all chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood.
