<p>A rigourous assessment of connectivity between patches is also necessary because of its influence on parameter estimation. Our study shows that kernel range affects both the KL distance between simulated and estimated dispersal kernels (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) and the cumulative incidence (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s003">S3</xref> Figs). This pattern reflects how parameter identifiability depends on statistical power, which depends on cumulative disease incidence, which in turn depends on landscape connectivity. Short-range kernels imply greater local connectivity than long-range kernels, leading to relatively intense local transmission but reduced transmission at greater distances. Whether or not shorter-range kernels generate larger epidemics depends on the proportion of potential transmission events falling outside host patches, and thus on landscape configuration. Here, larger cumulative incidences were obtained using smaller kernels because, in our patchy agricultural landscape, many dispersal events generated by long-tailed kernels do not end within host patches.
