<p>Our inference procedure explicitly accounts for patch geometry and patch-level aggregation of surveillance data. Although this choice was data-driven (infected tree numbers–not individual locations–were included in the database), for landscape-scale studies this approach appears to strike an interesting compromise between computational feasibility and spatial realism. Indeed, considering the disease status of over 401,000 individuals simultaneously would cause major computational issues given the size of the resulting connectivity matrix. Conversely, spatial models commonly use the coordinates of patch centroids in connectivity calculations (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). However, this neglects patch geometry and can be expected to bias connectivity estimates (i) when patch shapes and sizes are disparate, or (ii) when patch dimensions are of the same order of magnitude as the distances between patches. To exemplify (i), consider a small patch located next to a large patch, where many of the propagules leaving the small patch can be expected to land, but a much lower proportion of the propagules leaving the large patch are expected to fall in the small patch. To exemplify the importance of (ii), consider that many more propagules can be exchanged between two large adjacent orchards than would be calculated using the distance between their distant centroids. Although our approach neglects the effects of disease aggregation within patches, it does account for patch size and geometry that both impact disease spread [
