<p>Overall, inference of epidemiological parameters is easier for epidemics where disease introductions are well characterized, or at least infrequent. Unfortunately, this was not the case with the PPV-M dataset, and estimating the number of introduction patches 
 <italic>κ</italic> was challenging. Such difficulty is by no means unique to the current study (see e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Reversible-jump MCMC (RJMCMC) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] is a method for performing MCMC when the dimension of the parameter space is unknown and inferred from data. We initially attempted various implementations of RJMCMC, but found it impossible to construct priors that could both prevent over-fitting and provide robust posterior probabilities for 
 <italic>κ</italic> under a wide variety of epidemiological scenarios. To circumvent this issue we inferred 
 <italic>κ</italic> based on the Fisher information. This gives a minimum-variance estimator that provides robust inference with a good balance between under- and over-fitting–although it does not permit the estimation of posterior probabilities associated with the various 
 <italic>κ</italic>. This approach has been used successfully in similar situations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
