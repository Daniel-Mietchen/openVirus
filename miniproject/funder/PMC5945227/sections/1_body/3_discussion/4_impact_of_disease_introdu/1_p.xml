<p>Disease introduction scenarios had a substantial effect on the accuracy and precision of the inferred dispersal kernel (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Surprisingly, this effect does not seem related to either the number of introduction patches or the associated initial prevalence. However, we note that lower KL distances between simulated and estimated dispersal kernels (in introduction scenarios 1, 6 and 7) are associated with introductions occurring in the highly connected central patches (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The resulting higher cumulative incidence probably improves estimation for the reasons given above.
