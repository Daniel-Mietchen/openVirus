<p>During parameter estimation, we did encounter multi-modality in the posterior likelihood surface, which may arise when fitting ecological dynamic models to data, even without observation error and model mis-specification [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. For epidemic scenarios with both a short-range kernel and a high number of introduction events, misidentifying some of the introduction patches had a large negative effect on the likelihood, and some MCMC chains were trapped in degenerate solutions. For this reason, we ran the MCMC algorithms many times and carefully compared the posterior likelihoods and parameter estimates of all chains before making inference. We also considered alternative algorithms such as parallel tempering [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which increase the likelihood of between-mode transitions. However, the extra computational burden of these approaches was considered superfluous given that the observed differences in the posterior likelihoods of various modes were typically relatively large. Thus, launching a large number of chains to increase the likelihood of identifying the global mode was a reasonable compromise. We have extensively tested this approach, reporting here the results of several thousand MCMC chains, and have found that in practice results are consistent.
