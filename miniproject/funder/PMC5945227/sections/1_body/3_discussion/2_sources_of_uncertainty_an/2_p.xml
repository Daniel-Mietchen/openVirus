<p>A unique feature of the present work is the validation of the estimation of the dispersal kernel through comparing known functions used in simulations and the corresponding functions estimated from these simulated epidemiological data sets. Although this is an intuitive and standard practice [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], previous estimations of plant disease dispersal parameters instead used goodness-of-fit statistics between actual and simulated spatiotemporal patterns as a way to validate their inference models [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This general trend to rely on goodness-of-fit statistics, without performing simulation-based validation tests, may be due to the high computational burden associated with such validation procedures which require several simulation scenarios and several independent estimations per scenario to assess the accuracy and precision of the estimation algorithms. Since we focus on dispersal kernel estimation, rather than on model predictions as in [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], simulation-based validation was useful to demonstrate that, despite the approximations of the pseudo-likelihood, dispersal kernel estimation was generally very precise. Accuracy was often high for short-range kernels, and dispersal distance estimates ranged from very accurate to overestimated for longer-range kernels (Figs
