<p>Since the dispersal kernel is the key component of spatial epidemiological models, we focused attention on its estimation and treated the other parameters as nuisance parameters (i.e. parameters than are inferred to limit bias in the estimation of the distribution of interest). 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s012">S12 Fig</xref> shows how simulated and estimated values compare for all nuisance parameters. Recent methodological advances have permitted the extraction of crucial information on the dispersal kernel of four plant diseases from surveillance data [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These estimation procedures all account for unobserved infection times, with additional methodological challenges related to large heterogeneous landscapes [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The present work handles these various processes and, contrary to the abovementioned studies which all assume a known detection sensitivity, also accounts for this poorly known variable which adds a layer of uncertainty into the surveillance process. Inclusion of parameters for detection sensitivity and the latent period in the estimation procedure (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006085.t002">Table 2</xref>) barely affects the KL distance between simulated and estimated kernels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s007">S7 Fig</xref>); hence the inclusion of these extra parameters during inference based on PPV surveillance data. The resulting estimate of detection sensitivity is 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.66 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006085.t003">Table 3</xref>). Although a previous analysis showed that the presence of undetected infectious individuals resulted in slightly overestimated dispersal distances [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], here we show that our estimation procedure is robust to detection sensitivities far below one, even with weak prior information on 
 <italic>ρ</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s014">S14</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006085.s015">S15</xref> Figs). The dataset used for inference contains information on the disease status of more than 401,000 trees over 15 years, and is associated with a substantial level of censoring (on the dates of planting, inspection, infection, end of the latent period, and removal). For these reasons, using data augmentation to infer the transition times was unlikely to scale successfully to our analysis. Instead, we used a pseudo-likelihood where the unknown numbers of infectious and removed trees were replaced by their expected values. Intuitively, this approach can be expected to work best in highly connected landscapes, where epidemics are more likely to follow their expected course, and to become more erroneous in patchy landscapes where stochastic events can deflect epidemics away from their expected course. This might explain in part why the smaller KL distances in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006085.g003">Fig 3C</xref> correspond to those introduction scenarios where a source patch was located in the most highly connected region of the study area.
