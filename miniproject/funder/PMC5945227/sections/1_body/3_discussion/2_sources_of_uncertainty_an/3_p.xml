<p>The observed overestimation is not likely to be caused by insufficient flexibility in the BWME kernel because, even for the 2Dt dispersal kernel (which the BWME kernel does not fit perfectly), the magnitude of the difference between the two kernels is negligible in comparison with the difference between simulated and estimated kernels. It is not likely either to be caused by choosing the MCMC chain with the highest mean posterior likelihood (among 10 chains) since this procedure was just used to remove degenerate chains (and coherence between all other chains was high). Although this procedure is rather wasteful of problem-free chains, and provides lower precision than alternative approaches to multi-chain analysis, there is no reason to expect any bias concerning the mean (or other statistics) of the posterior distribution. It is most likely that the estimation bias reported here arose from approximations made (for practical reasons) within the pseudo-likelihood.</p>
