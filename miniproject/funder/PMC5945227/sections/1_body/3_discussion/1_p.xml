<p>In this work, we developed a spatially-explicit Bayesian inference framework for the estimation of disease dispersal parameters when surveillance data are gathered at the patch level. The simulation and inference procedures take into account that disease status assessment is incomplete because surveillance has an imperfect detection sensitivity and a finite spatio-temporal coverage. We assessed the quality of the inference procedure through comparison between parameter values used for simulation and corresponding estimates. Then, we applied this approach to 
 <italic>Plum pox virus</italic> surveillance data, to obtain the first estimate of an aphid dispersal kernel at the landscape scale. We discuss below the interest and limitations of the proposed approach and results.
