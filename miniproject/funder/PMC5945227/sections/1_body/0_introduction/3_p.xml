<p>Most aphid-borne viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic> genus and are transmitted in a non-persistent manner, i.e. by winged aphids that acquire and transmit the virus immediately while probing on various plants in search of a suitable host species [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Potyviruses are transmitted by a wide range of aphid species, and aphid infectivity is lost after the first probes. For these reasons, estimating the natural dispersal kernel of a potyvirus provides an indirect way of estimating the dispersal kernel of infectious winged aphids. 
 <italic>Plum pox virus</italic> (PPV) is a potyvirus that is listed as one of the 10 most important plant viruses [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This virus is the causal agent of sharka, a quarantine disease affecting trees of the 
 <italic>Prunus</italic> genus (i.e. mainly peach, apricot and plum), reducing fruit yield, quality (modified sugar content and texture) and visual appeal (due to deformations and discolouration) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Sharka is a worldwide plague that has infected over 50 countries in Europe, Asia, America and Africa [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], inflicting estimated economic losses of 10 billion Euros over 30 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The transfer of infected (possibly symptomless) plant material can disseminate PPV over long distances [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and the natural spread of the disease is ensured by more than 20 aphid species [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Virus-infected trees cannot be cured, and insecticides do not act fast enough to prevent the spread of the virus by non-colonising aphids [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, resistant or tolerant peach and apricot varieties are too scarce to provide a short-term alternative to cultivated varieties. However, aphid-mediated transmission can be reduced by removing infected trees as soon as they are detected. As a result, various countries have implemented PPV eradication or control strategies based on regular surveys and removal of trees or orchards when PPV is detected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given the cost of surveillance, tree removal and compensation, these strategies should benefit from model-assisted optimisation, which requires estimating the aphid dispersal kernel.
