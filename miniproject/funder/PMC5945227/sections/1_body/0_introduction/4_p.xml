<p>In this context, the aims of this study are: (i) to develop a Bayesian inference framework for estimating, from surveillance data, the parameters of a spatially-explicit epidemiological model that accounts for patch geometry and for interactions between disease spread, surveillance and control, (ii) to assess through simulations the accuracy and precision of the dispersal parameters estimated under various epidemic scenarios, and (iii) to apply our method to 15 years of geo-referenced surveillance data collected during an epidemic of
