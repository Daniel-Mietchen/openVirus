<p>In the case of aerial vector- or wind-borne diseases, dispersal kernels critically depend on the flight properties of the vectors or infectious propagules [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. When the probability of dispersal decreases more slowly than an exponential distribution, kernels are termed “long-tailed” and lead to non-negligible long-distance flights [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Such events are an important component of disease epidemiological–and evolutionary–dynamics and call for kernel estimation at the landscape scale [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, among plant diseases, there are few available kernel estimates. The dispersal kernel of black Sigatoka (a fungal disease of banana) has been estimated experimentally up to 1 km from a point source, based on the direct observation of spore-induced lesions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is the only available direct estimate at this scale for the dispersal kernel of a plant disease, which reflects the extreme practical difficulties of such field studies and highlights the critical need for developing 
 <italic>in silico</italic> solutions. A promising way forward is to infer dispersal parameters indirectly, i.e. from spatio-temporal patterns observed in epidemiological data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] whilst accounting for the added complexity (outlined above) of observational studies. This approach has been used to infer the dispersal kernels of the wind-dispersed plantain fungus 
 <italic>Podosphaera plantaginis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the fungus 
 <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> affecting oilseed rape and dispersed both by wind and wind-driven rain [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and two pathogens transmitted only by wind-driven rain: the oomycete 
 <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> that is responsible for sudden oak death [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the bacterium 
 <italic>Xanthomonas axonopodis</italic> that causes Citrus canker [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A dispersal kernel has been estimated for two other Citrus diseases: Bahia bark scaling of Citrus, a disease with an elusive etiology [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Huanglongbing, which is caused by bacteria from the ‘
 <italic>Candidatus</italic> Liberibacter’ genus and transmitted by psyllids [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To date, this is the only vector-borne plant disease for which the dispersal kernel is documented. Although aphids are responsible for transmitting almost 40% of more than 700 plant viruses [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and impose large economic burdens, their dispersal remains ill-characterized at the landscape scale [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For a vast number of aphid-borne diseases, this lack of basic knowledge affects science-based control strategies by undermining the reliability of quantitative risk assessment and predictive epidemiological models.
