<p>Infectious diseases of humans, animals and plants severely impact the world’s health and economy. To gain knowledge on disease dynamics, powerful mathematical models have been developed [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, for predicting the relative efficacies of competing control strategies across realistic heterogeneous landscapes, spatially-explicit 
 <italic>in silico</italic> simulation models provide the main avenue [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The dispersal parameters of such models critically affect the predicted spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease, and thus the predicted outcome of potential control strategies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Obtaining reliable estimates for these parameters is therefore a fundamental issue in epidemiology [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Models frequently employ dispersal kernels to represent how the probability of dispersal events diminishes as a function of distance, and simulation studies have proven that dispersal parameters can be identified in idealised scenarios [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, this has been achieved for simple models or small-scale datasets [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent advances in Bayesian methods and computing power have enabled fitting more realistic models to larger-scale surveillance data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, most dispersal kernels are still unknown. Indeed, estimation gets more complex when graduating from idealised toy problems to reconstructing the spatio-temporal dynamics of real epidemics. The first issue is the mismatch between the spatio-temporal coordinates of the epidemic, sampling and model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, the timing of key events (e.g. when a susceptible individual becomes infected) is often censored (i.e. known only within certain bounds), and failure to account for this can bias estimates. Moreover, the challenge of inference is increased by uncertainty arising from missing observations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] or imperfect sensitivity of disease detection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006085.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further difficulties arise when surveillance data are aggregated at the patch scale because a landscape comprising patches of various shapes or sizes often cannot be summarized by patch centroids without biasing connectivity estimates. All these issues require appropriate correction measures to avoid biased inference and prediction [
