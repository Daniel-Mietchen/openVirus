 <p>The PPV-M dataset was provided by the “Fédération départementale de défense contre les organismes nuisibles”. Sylain Grizard provided invaluable technical assistance with geographical information systems. We are also grateful to Annie Bouvier (INRA) for her technical support regarding the software CaliFloPP, and to Eric Montaudon and Véronique Martin (INRA) for their help with the MIGALE computer cluster.</p>
