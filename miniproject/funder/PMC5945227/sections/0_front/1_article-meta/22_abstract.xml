 <p>In spatial epidemiology, dispersal kernels quantify how the probability of pathogen dissemination varies with distance from an infection source. Spatial models of pathogen spread are sensitive to kernel parameters; yet these parameters have rarely been estimated using field data gathered at relevant scales. Robust estimation is rendered difficult by practical constraints limiting the number of surveyed individuals, and uncertainties concerning their disease status. Here, we present a framework that overcomes these barriers to permit inference for a between-patch transmission model. Extensive simulations show that dispersal kernels can be estimated from epidemiological surveillance data. When applied to such data collected from more than 600 orchards during 15 years of a plant virus epidemic our approach enables the estimation of the dispersal kernel of infectious winged aphids. This kernel is long-tailed, as 50% of infectious aphids leaving a tree terminate their infectious flight beyond 90 m whilst 10% fly beyond 1 km. This first estimate of flight distances at the landscape scale for aphids–a group of vectors transmitting numerous viruses–is crucial for the science-based design of control strategies targeting plant virus epidemics.</p>
