  <title>Influence of introduction scenarios on the estimation of a long-range dispersal kernel.</title>
  <p>For each introduction scenario, 10 epidemics were simulated with a long-range kernel (black dashed curve), and 10 MCMC chains were run per simulated epidemic. The posterior distributions of the kernel obtained under the most exhaustive estimation scheme (Î˜
   <sub>4</sub>) are represented for all chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood. The proportion of MCMC chains with negligible mean posterior likelihood is low (mean proportion: 0.4%) for all the introduction scenarios. Kernels are represented by their marginal probability density function
