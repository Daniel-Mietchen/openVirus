  <title>Boxplots of distances between simulated and estimated dispersal kernels.</title>
  <p>Impact of (A) estimation scenario, (B) kernel range, and (C) disease introduction scenario [number of introduction patches (with initial disease prevalence)] on the accuracy of estimated dispersal kernels. Accuracy is measured by the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between simulated and estimated dispersal kernels. Each panel consists of 840 points, which correspond to 10 epidemics × 7 disease introduction scenarios × 3 dispersal kernels × 4 parameter estimation schemes.</p>
