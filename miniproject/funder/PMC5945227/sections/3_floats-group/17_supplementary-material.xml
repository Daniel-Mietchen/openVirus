  <title>Influence of introduction scenarios on the estimation of a medium-range dispersal kernel.</title>
  <p>For each introduction scenario, 10 epidemics were simulated with a medium-range kernel (black dashed curve), and 10 MCMC chains were run per simulated epidemic. The posterior distributions of the kernel obtained under the most exhaustive estimation scheme (Î˜
   <sub>4</sub>) are represented for all chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood. The proportion of MCMC chains with negligible mean posterior likelihood varies among introduction scenarios, with a mean proportion of 2.6%. Kernels are represented by their marginal probability density function
