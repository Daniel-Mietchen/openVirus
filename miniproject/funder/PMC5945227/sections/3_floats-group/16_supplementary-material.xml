  <title>Influence of introduction scenarios on the estimation of a short-range dispersal kernel.</title>
  <p>For each introduction scenario, 10 epidemics were simulated with a short-range kernel (black dashed curve), and 10 MCMC chains were run per simulated epidemic. The posterior distributions of the kernel obtained under the most exhaustive estimation scheme (Î˜
   <sub>4</sub>) are represented for all chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood. The proportion of MCMC chains with negligible mean posterior likelihood (mean proportion: 10%) increases quadratically with the number of source orchards. Kernels are represented by their marginal probability density function

   </sup> with the distance from the source represented on the natural scale (middle row) or on the log
   <sub>10</sub> scale (bottom row).
