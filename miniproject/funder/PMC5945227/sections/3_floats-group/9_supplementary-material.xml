  <title>Simulated planting years and introduction patch locations used in the simulation study.</title>
  <p>The first map (top left) represents the randomisation of the first planting years of the 553 patches. These years were sampled without replacement from their empirical distribution. The other maps show the location and planting year of each introduction patch in the seven introduction scenarios. The number of introduction patches and their initial prevalence are indicated for each introduction scenario. Note the greater landscape connectivity in the central area.</p>
