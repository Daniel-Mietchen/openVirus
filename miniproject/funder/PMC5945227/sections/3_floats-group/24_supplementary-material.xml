  <title>Estimated weights of the (BWME) dispersal kernel for the sharka epidemic.</title>
  <p>The posterior distribution of the weights (calculated with (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006085.e030">Eq 11</xref>) for a mixture of 100 exponential kernels) is obtained for 
   <italic>Îº</italic> = 11 (i.e. the number of introduction patches maximising the Fisher information). The plotted posterior distribution of weights (as a function of the expected distance of each kernel) was obtained from 4000 MCMC samples. One line is plotted per sample.
