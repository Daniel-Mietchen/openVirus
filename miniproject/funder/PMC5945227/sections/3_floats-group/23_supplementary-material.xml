  <title>Influence of detection sensitivity on the distance between simulated and estimated long-range dispersal kernels.</title>
  <p>For each of the 99 detection sensitivities, a single epidemic was simulated using the long-range kernel. For three levels of prior information, each bar represents a 95% credibility interval on the Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between simulated and estimated dispersal kernels (obtained from all MCMC chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood). The grey vertical lines correspond to the values of detection sensitivity used in
