  <title>Influence of detection sensitivity on the estimation of the long-range dispersal kernel.</title>
  <p>For each detection sensitivity, a single epidemic was simulated using the long-range kernel (black dashed curve). The posterior distributions of the estimated kernels (obtained from all MCMC chains with non-negligible mean posterior likelihood) are shown for three levels of prior information. Kernels are represented by their marginal probability density function

   </sup> (top row), and by their marginal cumulative distribution function

   </sup> with the distance from the source represented on the natural scale (middle row) or on the log
   <sub>10</sub> scale (bottom row).
