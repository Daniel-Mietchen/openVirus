  <title>Cumulative detected incidence at the end of year 22 across the range of detection sensitivities (
   <italic>œÅ</italic>) tested in the dedicated simulation study.
  </title>
  <p>Each polygon represents one peach orchard. All eight simulations start at year 1 from a unique introduction patch with 25% initial prevalence and spread is determined by the long-range kernel. Note that the final detected prevalence varies non-monotonically with detection sensitivity because the removal of detected trees reduces disease spread.</p>
