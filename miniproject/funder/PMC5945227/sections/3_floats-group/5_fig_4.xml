  <title>Comparison of simulated and estimated dispersal kernels.</title>
  <p>From left to right: kernels with the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum Kullback-Leibler (KL) distances (posterior mean), as estimated (red) under the most exhaustive scheme (Î˜
   <sub>4</sub>), based on simulated epidemics with short-, medium- and long-range kernels (from top to bottom; black). Kernels are represented by their marginal cumulative distribution function

   </sup> (with distance from the source represented on the log
   <sub>10</sub> scale). The mean KL distance is indicated for each estimation.
