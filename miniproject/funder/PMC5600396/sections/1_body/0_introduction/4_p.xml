<p>These observations highlight the urgent need for a clear understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in USUV infection, in particular in terms of neurovirulence and neuronal tropism. In this study, we used several cellular models to better understand USUV neuronal tropism and associated physiopathological effects. We demonstrated that USUV can efficiently infect murine mature neurons, astrocytes and microglia. We also compared the cellular effect of USUV with those of ZIKV, an emerging flavivirus that has been described to be link with neurological disorders including microcephaly and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. ZIKV induces more rarely meningitis and encephalitis, and is thus consider to be less neuroinvasive than encephalitic flaviviruses in adults [

Here, we show that USUV infects human astrocytes more efficiently than ZIKV, reduces cell proliferation and induces stronger anti-viral response. Finally, we show that USUV strongly infect induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSc)-derived human neuronal stem cells (NSCs) and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis.
