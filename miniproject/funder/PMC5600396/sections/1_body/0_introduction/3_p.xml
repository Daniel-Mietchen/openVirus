<p>Although USUV is an emerging pathogen and dispersed quickly in Europe, very little is known about its pathogenesis, biologic features and host spectrum. It is nonetheless described that USUV infection upregulates the cellular autophagic pathway [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and can induce type 1 IFN production [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Susceptibility of adult wild type (WT) mice to USUV is limited [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], whereas mice lacking the interferon type 1 receptor (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Experimental infections of 1-week-old suckling WT mice by intraperitoneal injection reproduced neurological signs such as depression, disorientation, paraplegia, paralysis and coma [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Spinal cord examination showed moderate neuronal death, especially in the ventral horns, and multifocal demyelination [
