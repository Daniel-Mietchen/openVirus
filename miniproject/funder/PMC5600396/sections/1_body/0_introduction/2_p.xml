<p>Most of the sequences from USUV strains isolated in Europe can be differentiated from the originally isolated USUV strain SAAR 1776, whereas other sequences are closely related to the original isolated strain [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This suggests that USUV had been introduced in Europe several times from endemic areas in Africa, probably by migratory birds [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Interestingly, USUV has been detected in the wild (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Infected birds present severe neurological signs, often fatal, such as depression, incoordination and inability to fly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These signs are associated with brainstem and cortical neuron necrosis [

Molecular and serologic evidences of USUV infection in Italian and German blood donor indicate that the virus is also silently circulating among asymptomatic humans in Europe and could thus be a concern for blood transfusions or organ transplants, as previously evidenced for the closely-related WNV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since 2009, some neurological disorders such as encephalitis, meningitis and meningoencephalitis were found associated with USUV-infection in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [
