<p>The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak has reminded us that the emergence of new viruses depends on multiple factors and is therefore extremely difficult to predict. Among potential emerging viruses, Usutu virus (USUV) has recently focused attention. USUV is an African mosquito-borne virus closely related to West Nile virus (WNV) that belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serogroup in the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family) [

 <italic>Culex neavei</italic> species in South Africa and isolated by intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice [

The USUV genome is a positive, single-stranded RNA genome of 11,064–11,066 nucleotides with one open-reading frame encoding a 3434-amino-acid-residue polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into three structural (core, membrane, and envelope) and eight nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5) proteins [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. USUV natural life cycle is similar to WNV: it involves birds as reservoirs and ornithophilic mosquitoes as vectors like the common 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>. Notably, USUV-infected mosquitoes were recently detected in several European countries [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mammals including horses or wild boars, were described as accidental or dead-end hosts [
