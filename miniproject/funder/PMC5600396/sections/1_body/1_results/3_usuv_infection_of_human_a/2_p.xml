<p>To compare the anti-viral response elicited by flavivirus infection in astrocytes, mRNAs were collected from USUV- and ZIKV -infected astrocytes 4 dpi and subjected to retrotranscription. cDNA relative abundance was then analyzed by qPCR. Under these conditions, we found that 33 genes were significantly upregulated (more than 2 fold) by USUV in astrocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref>). Several cytokines and chemokines genes were found upregulated upon both USUV and ZIKV infections such as 
 <italic>IFN-Β</italic>, 
 <italic>TNF</italic>, 
 <italic>IL12A</italic>, 
 <italic>IL15</italic>, 
 <italic>IL6</italic>, 
 <italic>CCL5</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL8</italic> OR 
 <italic>CXCL11</italic>. Moreover, gene expression of PRR genes such as 
 <italic>Ddx58</italic> (RIG-I), 
 <italic>Dhx58</italic> (LGP2) or 
 <italic>Tlr3</italic> were also upregulated by both viruses, whereas 
 <italic>Tlr9</italic> was only modulated by USUV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Importantly, in all cases, the upregulation of these antiviral genes was stronger following USUV than ZIKV infection, up to 100 times for the chemokines 
 <italic>CCL5</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic> and for the 
 <italic>IFN-Β</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Other genes, such as the chemokine 
 <italic>CCL3</italic>, 
 <italic>CD40</italic>, 
 <italic>CTSB</italic> and the transcription factors 
 <italic>FOS</italic> and 
 <italic>IRF7</italic> were specifically upregulated in USUV infected astrocytes. Interestingly, other differences in the cellular responses triggered by USUV 
 <italic>vs</italic> ZIKV were observed, in particular regarding the MAPK pathway (
 <italic>MAP2K1</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP3K7</italic>, 
 <italic>MAPK1</italic>, 
 <italic>MAPK3</italic>), the peptidyl-prolyl isomerases 
 <italic>PIN1</italic> and members of the inflammasome pathway such as 
 <italic>Nlrp3</italic> and 
 <italic>Il1β</italic> that were preferentially modulated by ZIKV (
