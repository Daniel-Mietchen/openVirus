<p>The recent ZIKV epidemic highlighted that developing brains can be highly sensitive to flavivirus infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Moreover, in the adult brain, specific niches such as the hippocampus are involved in adult neurogenesis and are potential targets for viral infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To study the potential tropism for USUV to human NSCs, we used IPSc-derived NSCs obtained according to standard methods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. NSCs were infected with USUV and ZIKV at a MOI of 2 and efficient USUV and ZIKV infectivity were detected 2 dpi using the pan-flavivirus antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Moreover, we detected 77% infected cells by USUV and only 21% by ZIKV using immunofluorescence pan-flavivirus staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Production of infectious particles was observed as attested by viral titers of approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID50/ml obtained from supernatants of USUV-infected NSCs, which was significantly higher than ZIKV at 2, 4 and 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Interestingly, and in contrast to astrocytes, USUV-infected NSCs at 4 dpi showed round-up morphology and condensed nuclei, suggestive of an apoptotic cell death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Quantification of cell viability by trypan blue showed that ~80% of USUV-infected NSCs were indeed undergoing cellular death at 4 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Similarly, activated-caspase 3 was observed by immunoblotting, confirming that USUV infection triggered apoptotic pathways in IPSc-derived NSCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). USUV-associated cellular death could be strongly decreased by pre-treating NSCs with the anti-apoptotic agent Z-VAD (pan-caspase inhibitor) prior to USUV infection. Indeed, NSCs treated with Z-VAD for 4 days concomitantly to USUV showed fewer apoptotic nuclei than USUV-infected cells without Z-VAD treatment (
