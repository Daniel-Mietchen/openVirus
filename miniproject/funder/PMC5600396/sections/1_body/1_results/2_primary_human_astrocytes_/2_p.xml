<p>Here, we aimed to compare astrocyte tropism/virulence of USUV and ZIKV, another Flavivirus recently described for its neurotropism and its ability to infect this cell type [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To this end, we infected astrocytes with USUV or ZIKV at a MOI of 2. We first monitored whether both viruses were inducing cytopathogenic effects (CPE) that are often characterized by cells rounding up in the process of dying by apoptosis, pyroptosis or necrosis. Four dpi, USUV-infected astrocytes appeared sparsely populated compared to non-infected and ZIKV-infected, and showed little if any CPE (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Importantly, upon USUV infection, at MOI of 0.1 and 2, we could not detect cell death, suggesting that apoptosis is not triggered in infected astrocytes (

Because bright light pictures of USUV-infected astrocytes seem to indicate a possible defect in cellular proliferation, we next investigated whether cell division was affected by USUV infection. The nucleotide analog BrdU was applied to astrocytes infected or not by USUV, and was quantified at 1, 3 and 6 dpi by ELISA. Compared to non-infected cells, USUV-infected astrocytes showed a decrease in proliferation from 3 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Finally, supernatants from USUV or ZIKV-infected astrocytes (MOI 2) were collected at different time post-infection to measure growth kinetics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). For USUV, a plateau in replication was observed between 24 h and 96 h post-infection, followed by a decrease in viral titer. However, ZIKV viral titer was significantly lower than USUV and the plateau lasted longer (
