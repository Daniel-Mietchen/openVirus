<p>Finally, the proteins AXL and DC-SIGN have been reported to act as cellular receptors for some flaviviruses, including ZIKV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. To monitor whether USUV is using these proteins to infect astrocytes, we performed a competition experiment by pre-incubating cells with either anti-AXL or anti-DC-SIGN antibodies prior to infection with USUV or ZIKV. By measuring viral titer 4 dpi, we confirmed that blocking AXL decreased ZIKV replication (
