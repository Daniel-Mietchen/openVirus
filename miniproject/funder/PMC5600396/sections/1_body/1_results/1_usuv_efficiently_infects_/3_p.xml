<p>Moreover, as the culture contains sparse glial cells, we observed that astrocytes were also infected as co-labeling pan-flavivirus and GFAP could be observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). To study more precisely viral replication in glial cells, we took advantage of a culture of spinal glial cells that contains ~80% of astrocytes and ~20% of microglial cells. Four dpi, antigens were observed by immunofluorescence in GFAP- and Iba1-positive cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) and viral titer of the supernatant was estimated as being around 9x10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID50/ml while titer after inoculation was 2Ã—10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID50/ml.
