<p>To better understand the involvement of USUV in neurological impairments, we first aimed to describe the cellular neurotropism of European strain of USUV (Vienna, 2001). Report of USUV-associated neuropathology in mice suggest that this animal model is pertinent to study USUV cellular interactions both

 <sup>5</sup> tissue culture infective dose 50% (TCID50) per slice) on top of the slices, which were further maintained in culture. 4 days post-infection (dpi), slices were fixed, astrocytes, microglial cells and neurons labeled by GFAP, Iba1 and NeuN staining respectively and USUV antigens were observed using a pan-flavivirus antibody (4G2) that recognizes the envelope protein of several flavivirus [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g001">Fig 1A</xref> shows that in mock-treated slices, no pan-flavivirus labeling was observed, whereas USUV-infected samples showed strong pan-flavivirus staining, indicating an efficient USUV infection. Co-labeling with neuronal- (NeuN), astrocyte- (GFAP) and microglial- (Iba1) specific antibodies with the pan-flavivirus antibody showed a broad tropism of USUV for brain cells (
