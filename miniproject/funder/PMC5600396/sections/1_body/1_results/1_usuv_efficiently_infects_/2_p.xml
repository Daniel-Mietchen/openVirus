<p>To confirm these observations 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we infected quasi-pure primary hippocampal neuron cultures with USUV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. Strong labeling was observed 4 dpi, with patches of viral proteins also found along neurites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Quantification showed that around 70% of cells with neuronal morphology were efficiently supporting the replication of USUV at 2 and 4 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Supernatants from USUV-infected cells at 4 dpi were collected and applied to Vero cells to measure viral titer, quantified by tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50. Efficient viral replication was observed with viral titer quantified around 1.6×10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID50/ml while titer after inoculation was 1×10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID50/ml. Similarly to what we observed in hippocampal slices, we detected viral antigens not only in mature neurons (labeled with NeuN, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) and in cell bodies but also in axons (labeled with Tau, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005913.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Of note, neuronal damage was observed at late time post-infection, showing refringent cell bodies and neurite destruction in USUV-infected neurons at 8 dpi, suggestive of cellular toxicity (
