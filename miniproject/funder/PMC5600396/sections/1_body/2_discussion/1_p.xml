Following CNS infection, homeostasis can be altered as inflammation can arise in distinct anatomical regions causing inflammatory diseases such as myelitis, meningitis, encephalitis and meningoencephalitis that can severely affect human health and be associated with long-term sequelae. Symptoms and severity of the disorders caused by neurotropic viruses depend on several factors, including cell tropism, viral cytopathogenicity and the host immune response.</p>
