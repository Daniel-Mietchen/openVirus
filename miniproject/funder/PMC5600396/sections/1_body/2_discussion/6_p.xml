<p>In conclusion, we showed that USUV is capable of infecting mature neurons, microglia, human neuronal precursors and primary human astrocytes. Whereas USUV infection kills neurons and NSCs, astrocyte infection causes cell proliferation arrest and induction of cytokines and chemokines. Our findings suggest that USUV infection may lead to encephalitis and/or meningoencephalitis via neuronal destruction and inflammatory response. There results, and the recent observations that USUV circulation in human may be more common than previously thought, highlight the need to include USUV in the differential diagnosis of encephalitis/meningoencephalitis cases of unknown etiology in areas where the virus is known to circulate. A better understanding of the epidemiological and biological characteristics of USUV infection is necessary to provide tools for anticipating the potential threat of USUV emergence.</p>
