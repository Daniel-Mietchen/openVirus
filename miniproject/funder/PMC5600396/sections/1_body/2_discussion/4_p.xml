<p>Finally, several receptors have been reported to facilitate flavivirus entry, including DC-SIGN, a type 2 transmembrane C-type lectin and AXL that belongs to the Tyro3 AXL Mer (TAM) family, a group of tyrosine kinase receptors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. We observed that the blocking antibody anti-AXL, and in a lesser extend anti-DC-SIGN, inhibits ZIKV replication in human astrocytes as previously described for AXL in human glia cells [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, neither blocking AXL nor DC-SIGN has effect on USUV replication, suggesting that this flavivirus uses other entry receptor(s) in astrocytes that remain to be identified.
