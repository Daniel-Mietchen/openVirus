<p>Recent observations showed that some flavivirus as ZIKV infection can also impair neurodevelopment while other neurovirulent Flaviviruses such as JEV and WNV are rarely linked to congenital malformations. Indeed, numerous studies demonstrated that ZIKV can infect human cortical NSCs, attenuates their proliferation and induce apoptosis, both in monolayer culture and in cerebral organoids or neurospheres [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this study, we show that USUV can also infect neuronal progenitors with high efficiency and induces massive caspase-dependent apoptosis. A previous study showed that deleterious consequences of ZIKV infection in human NSCs are not a general feature of the flavivirus family, as this effect was not observed with DENV [

It remains to be determined if USUV can access the fetal brain, but in regards of our results more investigations are necessary to investigate whether USUV infection can cross placental and blood brain barrier and have an impact during different stages of fetal development.
