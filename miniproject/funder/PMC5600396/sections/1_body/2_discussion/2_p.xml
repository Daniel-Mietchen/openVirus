<p>Numerous flaviviruses have been described to access to the CNS and cause neuronal impairment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], in particular Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Tickâ€‘borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), WNV and ZIKV, [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. JEV, TBE and WNV are particularly neurovirulent and can cause encephalitis in humans. In contrast, DENV is more viscerotropic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and ZIKV appears to be less neuroinvasive in adults in comparison to the typical encephalitic flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Neurotropic viruses are continually emerging and are particularly problematic because they are often less adapted to their new host, and they can spread rapidly in the population and induce severe disorders, as experienced during the recent ZIKV epidemics. In this study, we report for the first time that USUV is able to infect efficiently a wide range of neuronal cells

 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], whereas the ability of the virus to infect humans is known since 1981 with a case in Central African Republic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In 2009, a severe meningoencephalitis case related to USUV infection was reported in an immunocompromised Italian patient, demonstrating the zoonotic potential of USUV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An additional case was also detected after orthotropic liver transplantation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Later, a study in Croatia revealed also the ability of USUV to infect immunocompetent patients as three additional USUV neuroinvasive infections in humans (meningitis and meningoencephalitis) were described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 2016, a retrospective study detecting USUV RNA and USUV antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples revealed the presence of anti-USUV antibodies in more than 6% of samples analyzed in Italy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, the authors detected USUV RNA in eight cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs). Among them, four patients were identified with neurological symptoms (encephalitis and meningoencephalitis). This last study suggest that USUV infection in humans may be more common than previously thought, at least in specific areas, and highlights the need to better understand the pathophysiology of this virus.
