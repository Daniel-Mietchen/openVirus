<p>Neurons are a direct or indirect target for neurotropic flaviviruses. Mechanisms of neuronal injury after viral infection could be explained by several non-exclusive mechanisms such as direct cell death, destruction of infected cells in the CNS by cytotoxic T lymphocytes or neuronal cell death or dysfunction by bystander-infected cells. Notably, as USUV seems to infect different types of CNS cells (neurons, microglia and astrocytes), we could expect a combination of mechanisms that ultimately could lead to neuronal dysfunction. WNV, a closely related flavivirus that is also associated with encephalitis and other neurological disorders, has also been described to target neurons in the CNS, leading to their alteration or death (by caspase-3 driven apoptosis) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition to direct damage, WNV infection may also trigger apoptosis in neurons as a result of bystander effects caused by cytotoxic factors released by (dying) neuronal and non-neuronal cells as it can also infect astrocytes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Neuroinvasion does not seem to be a major feature of ZIKV virus infection as only few cases of encephalitis and meningoencephalitis have been reported for ZIKV. Studies indicate that it can poorly infect mature neurons, suggesting that its effects in the adult CNS could be mostly due to infection of glial cells such as astrocytes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Following flavivirus infection activated glial cells release TNF, IL1β, IL6, and RANTES, all of which promote bystander damage to neurons. However, while the extent to which glial infection contributes to JEV-induced neurological disease has been well studied, its relevance in WNV-induced disease has received less attention [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our data show that USUV can efficiently infect mature neurons that undergo cell death at late stage of infection. Resident cells of the CNS have developed innate immune antiviral strategies to defend against neurotropic viruses. While neurons are a target of neurotropic flaviviruses, other cell types (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes) might also be infected and contribute to the resolution of infection by generating immune responses against viral infections. Astrocytes are one of the most abundant cell types in the brain and spinal cord and mediate diverse supportive functions and immune regulation. Activated astrocytes produce a wide variety of cytokines and chemokines, including IFNs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In our study, we found that primary human astrocytes respond to USUV infection by strongly upregulating chemokines and cytokines. The inflammatory profile is partially different following ZIKV infection, which is mainly characterized by less inflammatory response and by the specific induction of several MAPK genes (
 <italic>MAP2K1</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP2K3</italic>, 
 <italic>MAP3K7</italic>, 
 <italic>MAPK1</italic>, 
 <italic>MAPK3</italic>). Notably, we observed upregulated mRNA expression levels of 
 <italic>IFNα/β</italic>, 
 <italic>IL6</italic>, 
 <italic>TNF</italic> and several chemokines as 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic> or 
 <italic>CXCL11</italic> after USUV infection. Generally, innate immunity is mandatory for clearance of viral infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and when clearance is inefficient, an exaggerated cytokine release could be detrimental and associated with adverse effects such as cancers or CNS disorders [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Therefore, the highest risk during neurotropic viral infection is the spread of the virus to the CNS, causing induction of inflammatory responses and the destruction of neuronal cells. For example IL-6 and TNF production by astrocytes can lead to increased permeability of the BBB [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], moreover CXCL10 has been reported to induce neuron apoptosis or direct damage in neuronal cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and has been described to be activated in astrocytes after WNV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Notably, we found that USUV induces astrocyte proliferation arrest. This phenotype could be related to the strong immune response observed after USUV infection. Indeed, some cytokines such as IFN-β and CXCL10 are known to cause cell death directly or to inhibit cell proliferation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. As astrocytes are essential for providing trophic support to neurons and maintain synaptic functions, loss of astrocytes can induce significant neuronal dysfunction and damage. In fact, when activated in an uncontrolled manner, astrocytes can release various substances, such as reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, triggering the cascade of events leading to neuronal degeneration. The most notable inflammatory response following USUV infection is the very strong upregulation of IFNβ (&gt;7000 times). Interestingly, this strong IFN-β induction did not prevent USUV replication. These findings further support the hypothesis that USUV do not possess mechanisms that interfere with IFN induction as previously suggested in other studies on dendritic and epithelial cell [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The type I IFN response can limit viral dissemination by different mechanisms: restricting the spread of progeny viruses to neighboring cells or/and reducing overall viral replication. In this context, USUV infection inhibits IFN antiviral activity through a mechanism that remains to be determined and that could allow USUV to overcome this response to establish a productive infection. The absence of efficient protective effect of type 1 IFN has been demonstrated for other neurotropic flavivirus. For example in the case of DENV, type I IFN response limits only initial viral replication but has no apparent effect on controlling the virus from the CNS and disease development [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Similarly, functional type I IFN response was not protective against lethal encephalitis during WNV infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Moreover, there are several examples demonstrating that flaviviruses produce effective immune modulatory proteins and use multiple immune evasion mechanisms that limit host immune responses and favor viral replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005913.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Indeed, viruses possess specific mechanisms to subvert IFN antiviral effects through proteins that mimic and interfere with host proteins by delaying the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with the cellular PRRs, suppressing the IFN-signaling or impairing functions of antiviral ISG. Thus, it could be hypothesized that the association of USUV with human diseases, such as encephalitis or meningitis, could be linked to the inability of the virus to suppress type I IFN production combined with the ability of the virus to overcome response in infected cells.
