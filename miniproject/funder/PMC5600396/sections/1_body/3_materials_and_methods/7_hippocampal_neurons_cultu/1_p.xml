<p>Mouse hippocampal neurons were obtained from OF1 embryonic day 18 (E18) embryos using standard procedures (Harlan). Briefly, hippocampi were isolated, dissociated with 0.025% trypsin and plated in Neurobasal medium (ThermoFischer) containing B27 (ThermoFischer), L-glutamine (Sigma), Glutamax (ThermoFischer), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and antibiotics. Hippocampal neurons were then incubated at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 under a humidified environment. At day 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (DIV) 4, 2/3r of the medium was replaced with medium without L-glutamine and FBS. Neurons were used at DIV8-10.
