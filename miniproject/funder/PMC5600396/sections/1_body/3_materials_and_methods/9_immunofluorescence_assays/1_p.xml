<p>NSCs were plated on poly-D-ornithine/laminin coverslips and astrocytes plated on poly-D-lysin coverslips. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at room temperature (RT), followed by a blocking step with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% horse serum for 30 min to 1 h at RT. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated sequentially for 1h at RT. Samples were then mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Prolongold, Thermofischer) with DAPI (Sigma) and imaged by confocal microscopy using the Zeiss SP85 confocal microscope, with 40× or 63× 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil-immersion objectives.</p>
