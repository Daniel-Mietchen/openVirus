<p>Astrocytes infected with USUV and ZIKV or mock-treated cells were harvested in RLT buffer (Qiagen). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen). Complementary DNA was synthesized using Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). RT2 Profiler PCR arrays for Human Antiviral Response (96 well format, Qiagen) were used for real-time quantitative PCR analysis, with the use of the LC480 real time PCR instrument (Roche) and the Light Cycler 480 SYBR Green I master Mix (Roche). Volumes of mix, cDNA, RNAse-free water, and cycling conditions were determined according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Data on gene expression were normalized according to data from the 
 <italic>HPRT</italic> housekeeping gene. Genes with uninterpretable amplifying curves were excluded from the analysis.
