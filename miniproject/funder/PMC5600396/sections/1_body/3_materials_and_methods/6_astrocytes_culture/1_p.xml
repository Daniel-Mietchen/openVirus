 <sup>TM</sup> and cultured according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction. Cells were cultured on poly-D-lysine coated plates and were used between passage 4 and 8. Cell proliferation was assessed seeding 5000 cells in 96 well plates. At days 1,3,6 a bromodoxyuridine ELISA assay was performed (Calbiochem BrDU cell proliferation assay) following manufacturer instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer (TECAN).
