<p>Primary cultures of glial cells were established from the spinal cord of 16-day-old C57/Bl6 mice (Harlan). Animals were sacrificed in aseptic conditions. Spinal cords were dissected, freed from meninges and collected in cold HBSS supplemented with calcium and magnesium (Gibco), glucose (Sigma, 6 g/L) and 1% antibiotic solution (penicillin/streptomycin, Gibco). Tissues were chopped and rinsed (3 times) in HBSS (without calcium and magnesium, 1% antibiotic solution), supernatant was removed. Tissues were re-suspended in 1.5 ml of DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and treated with 2 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) for 20 minutes at 37°C. Trypsin was inactivated by adding 10% FBS. DNAse1 (10mg/ml, Rotkreuz. Switzerland) was then added. Cells were mechanically dissociated and re-suspended in 10ml of culture medium consisting of DMEM/F12, glucose 6 g/L, glutamax 100X (Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Centrifugation (5min, 500g, room temperature) was done and supernatant removed. Cells were re-suspended in the same culture medium and plated at a final concentration of 50 000 cells/well on glass coverslips treated with 25 μg/ml of low-molecular weight poly-D-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in 24-well dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Danemark).</p>
