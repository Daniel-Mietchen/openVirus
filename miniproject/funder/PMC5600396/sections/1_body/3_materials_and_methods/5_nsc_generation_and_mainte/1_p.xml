<p>NSCs were obtained from the SAFE-IPSc platform at IRMB (

Briefly, iPSCs were individualized with Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (Stemcell, 07174). They were rinsed out with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/Ham’s F12 (DMEM/F-12, Gibco, 31330038) and centrifuged at 300 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Dissociated cells were plated on matrigel at a density of 20,000–40,000 cells/cm
 <sub>2</sub> and cultured in neural induction medium (Stemcell, 05835) supplemented with 10 μM ROCK-inhibitor (Y-27632). Cells were allowed to reach 80–90% confluence over 6 days. Medium was changed daily with neural induction medium without Y-27632. IPSc-derived NSCs were passaged by incubation with trypsin at 0.005% to allow dissociation, and then seeded on poly-D-ornithine/laminin coated plates at 20,000 cells/cm
 <sub>2</sub> in 50% DMEM/F-12 and 50% Neurobasal medium (Thermoscientific) supplemented with 1X N2 (Thermoscientific), 1X B27 (Thermoscientific), glutamax (Thermoscientific) and β-FGF plus EGF (Peprotech, 20 ng/mL each). The medium was changed every two days. Cells were used between passage 5 and 8.
