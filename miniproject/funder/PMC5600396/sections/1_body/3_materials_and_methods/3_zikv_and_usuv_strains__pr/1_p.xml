<p>PF-13 ZIKV was produced and provided by the National Reference Center for arboviruses (NRC) and has no more than 5 passages on Vero cells (ATCC). USUV Vienna Austrian strain of USUV (Vienna2001-blackbird, USUV 939/01, GenBank acc: AY453411.1), was provided from Department of Biotechnology, INIA Madrid and was propagated three times in Vero cells. Viral stocks were prepared by infecting sub confluent Vero cells at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in D-MEM medium (Thermoscientific) supplemented by 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Cell supernatant was collected 6 days later and viral stock harvested after centrifugation at 300 
 <italic>g</italic> to remove cellular debris. Viral titers were determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50), which was calculated using the Spearman-KÃ¤rber method [
