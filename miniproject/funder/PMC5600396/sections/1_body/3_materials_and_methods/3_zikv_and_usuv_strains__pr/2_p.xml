<p>Cells at 60–70% confluence were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and ZIKV and USUV diluted to the required MOI was added to the cells in a low medium volume. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C with permanent gentle agitation and then culture medium was added to each well, and cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. As control, cells were incubated with the culture supernatant from Vero cells (mock condition).
