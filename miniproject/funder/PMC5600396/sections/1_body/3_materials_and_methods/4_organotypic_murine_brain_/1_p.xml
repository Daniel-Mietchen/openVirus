<p>All pups were anesthetized prior to brain extraction. Briefly, hippocampi from 6- to 7-day-old mice (Janvier, France) were dissected under aseptic conditions and transverse sections were obtained using a tissue chopper. Slices were placed on a 30-mm porous membrane (Millicell-CM) and kept in 100-mm diameter dish. Petri dishes were filled with 5 ml of culture medium composed of 25% heat inactivated horse serum, 25% Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), 50% minimum essential medium (MEM), 25 U/ml penicillin, 25-μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 36°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Two days later, media were changed and the temperature set to 33°C.
