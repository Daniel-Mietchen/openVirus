  <title>Anti-viral responses in USUV- and ZIKV-infected human astrocytes.</title>
  <p>mRNA from supernatants of primary human astrocytes infected with USUV or ZIKV at MOI = 1 for 3 days were subjected to qRT-PCR analyses. (A) Scatter plot. Up regulated genes appears in the top-left cadran (boundary 2). (B) Volcano plots, (boundary 2, scatter 0.05: 
   <italic>p</italic>-values based on student’s t-test of three replicates). Statistically significant changes in fold regulation appear in the top right part of the graph (genes upregulated). The experiment was performed in triplicates and each point represents the mean. (C) Fold regulation of statistically significant genes modulated upon USUV and ZIKV infection are shown. Results are expressed as means ± SD and analyzed using an unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test *
   <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05.
