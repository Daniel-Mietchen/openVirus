  <title>USUV infects multiple murine neural cells 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>Primary murine hippocampal neurons were infected with USUV at a MOI of 2. (A) At 4 dpi, cells were fixed and labeled with a pan-flavivirus antibody. Strong labeling was observed in cells of neuronal morphology, both in soma and neurites. (B) Quantitative measurement showed that ~70% (+/- 4%) of cells of this quasi-pure culture were infected at day 2 and day 4 (n = 3 independent experiments). (C-D) USUV infects efficiently neurons 
   <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Co-labeling from fixed USUV-infected cultures at 4 dpi demonstrates that USUV replicates in neuronal cell bodies (nuclei expressing NeuN) and axons (labeled with Tau). (E) USUV elicits neuronal toxicity. Bright light imaging of USUV-infected neurons at 8 dpi shows neurite damage. Arrows are showing dying cellular bodies. (F) Glia cells are infected by USUV. Cells expressing GFAP (astrocytes) were infected by USUV as shown by indirect IF studies at 4 dpi. Scale bars 20 Î¼m.
