<p>Charge-reversal at these residues, NP-R111E and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E, produced dramatic phenotypes, including significantly increased BRET signal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), indicating increased oligomerization and/or structural changes that brought the NLuc and HaloTag tags (at the NP C-terminus) into closer proximity. This increase in BRET signal is seemingly paradoxical, since charge-reversal should disrupt the K109-E349 electrostatic interaction between NP monomers. However, even if this interaction is lost, a nearby residue, K352, may be able to stabilize E349, thereby altering the structure of NP oligomers. Computationally modeling how NP-R111E would affect NP oligomer structure is challenging because the interface between the two NP monomers is very hydrophilic and likely filled with water. Generating cryo-EM structures of these mutants may further elucidate the mechanism of NP oligomer self-assembly.
