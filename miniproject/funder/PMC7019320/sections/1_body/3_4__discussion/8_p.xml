<p>Revealing the importance of the NP 111 residue and establishing experimental systems represent steps towards characterizing a key EBOV substitution, NP-R111C, that arose during the 2013â€“2016 Western African EVD epidemic. Given current limitations and restrictions of BSL-4 settings and the potential global threat of EVD epidemics, BSL-2 model systems can facilitate rapid and broad exploration of any potentially consequential EBOV mutations. We demonstrate that NP-R111C modestly increased VLP production while slightly decreasing viral transcription and replication. On the other hand, a charge-reversal substitution at the same site, observed in SUDV but not other EBOV or other ebolaviruses, caused drastically increased oligomerization and ablated transcription and replication. These findings provide additional insight into the interplay between the many functions of NP in oligomerization, viral assembly and budding, and transcription and replication, and suggest that NP-R111C and other substitutions at the 111 residue merit further study using live virus.</p>
