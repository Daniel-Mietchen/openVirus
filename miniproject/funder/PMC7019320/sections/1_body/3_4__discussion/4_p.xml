<p>By contrast, the epidemic-associated EBOV substitution, NP-R111C, produced more intermediate phenotypes—slightly increased oligomerization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), moderately reduced transcription and replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D), and moderately increased VLP production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). EBOV virion assembly is a complex process, and how NP enhances budding of VLPs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>C) is not fully understood. By studying the host interactome of NP, we confirmed a strong interaction between NP and the clathrin adaptor AP-1 complex (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>), which mediates intracellular transport and could facilitate virion assembly. AP-1 members were among the few proteins that co-purified with NP in multiple MS/MS experiments [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], but the interaction was not specifically validated by a second approach like reciprocal co-IP in those studies. In retroviruses, the Gag protein facilitates budding by hijacking the AP-1 complex [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Because retroviral and EBOV virions bud using the same cellular pathway and machinery [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], EBOV NP might also co-opt the AP-1 complex for virion egress and trafficking, which could explain how NP promotes VLP formation [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Yet both NP-R111 and NP-R111C bound to AP-1 with similar affinity (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S5C</xref>). Thus, the interaction with AP-1 did not explain NP-R111C’s increased ability to promote VLP production. Much work remains to be done to better understand how NP enacts so many roles during the viral life cycle.
