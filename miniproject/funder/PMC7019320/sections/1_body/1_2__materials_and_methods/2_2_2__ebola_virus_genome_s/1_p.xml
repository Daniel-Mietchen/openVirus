<p>We obtained Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) through the web site at

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] in October 2017. We removed short sequences, sequences from tissue-cultured EBOV isolates, duplicate sequences from the same clinical EVD case, and sequences with &gt;0.2% ambiguous or missing nucleotide calls. The final dataset consisted of 1823 EBOV complete or near-complete genomes.
