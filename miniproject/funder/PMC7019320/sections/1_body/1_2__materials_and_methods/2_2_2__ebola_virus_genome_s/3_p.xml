<p>For cloning and functional characterization, we used the genome sequence of Ebola virus/H.sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Makona-C15 (EBOV/Mak-C15; GenBank #KJ660346.2; 
 <italic>Filoviridae: Zaire ebolavirus</italic>) as the EBOV Makona variant reference sequence for NP, VP40, VP35, and GP, unless otherwise noted. The structural analysis of EBOV NP was based on the Ebola virus/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga NP (EBOV/Yam-May) crystal structure under Protein Data Bank (PDB) #4YPI [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with manual annotation of key residues based on other studies [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The structure of EBOV/Mak-C15 NP has not yet been elucidated, but the amino acid sequence is 98% identical (14 mutations/739 residues) to EBOV/Yam-May NP, and the N-terminal 450 amino acids of the two isolates are 99.3% identical (3 mutations/450 residues). The EBOV/Yam-May crystal structure #4YPI was visualized using PyMOL (Schr√∂dinger, New York City, NY, USA) (
