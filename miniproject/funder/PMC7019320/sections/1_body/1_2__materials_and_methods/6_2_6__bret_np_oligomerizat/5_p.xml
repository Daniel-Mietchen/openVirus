<p>For the donor saturation procedure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), we reverse-transfected cells in each well with 2 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-NLuc. To test a range of NP-HaloTag expression, we co-transfected cells with decreasing amounts (160, 40, 10, 0 ng) of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-HaloTag or pcDNA3.3/eGFP negative control. To ensure that cells in each well received the same total amount of DNA, we serially diluted pGL4.23-CMV/NP-HaloTag or pcDNA3.3/eGFP in control pcDNA3.3/eGFP plasmid, as described in the manufacturerâ€™s protocol.
