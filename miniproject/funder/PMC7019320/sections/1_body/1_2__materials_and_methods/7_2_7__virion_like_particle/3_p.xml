<p>For the thermal stability assay, we reverse transfected cells in each well with 50 ng of pcDNA3.1/NLuc-VP40 per well as above. After filtration, we heated 1.2 mL of filtered supernatant at 4, 22, 37.1, 43.8, 60.2, or 95 °C, for 30 min on a Mastercycler pro S thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). We saved 50 µL of heated supernatant for direct NLuc measurement. Subsequently, we performed the remainder of the protocol described above (ultracentrifugation of 1 mL of heated supernatant through sucrose to purify VLPs, and subsequent measurement of NLuc activity).</p>
