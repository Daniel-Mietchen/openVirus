<p>At 16 h post-transfection, we removed supernatant, washed the cells with DMEM, and added 1.5 mL of fresh DMEM. At 40 h post-transfection (24 h later), we filtered culture supernatant through an Acrodisc 0.45 µm low protein-binding filter (Pall Laboratory, Port Washington, NY). We underlaid 1 mL of filtered supernatant with 1 mL of 20% (

We aliquoted resuspended VLPs into 3 × 50 µL as technical triplicates, added 50 µL of Nano-Glo assay reagent (Promega) to each, and incubated in 96-well non-binding-surface plates (Corning) in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. We measured total luminescence on a SpectraMax L (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) over a 1-s integration. Technical triplicates were averaged and considered as a single biological replicate.
