<p>We followed an existing protocol for the tetracistronic (4MG) minigenome assay [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], with some modifications. We first generated transcription- and replication-competent (tr)VLPs using HEK 293T as producer (P0) cells. We seeded HEK 293T cells into collagen-coated 6-well plates, grew to 40% confluency, and transfected cells in each well with the previously described plasmid ratio (125 ng of pCAGGS/NP, 125 ng of pCAGGS/VP35, 75 ng of pCAGGS/VP30, 1000 ng of pCAGGS/L, 250 ng of 4MG plasmid encoding RLuc, 250 of ng pCAGGS/T7pol) [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], plus 250 ng of a FLuc-encoding plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. We changed media 24 h post-transfection, collected and clarified trVLP-containing P0 supernatant by centrifugation, and measured intracellular luminescence in P0 cells 96 h post-transfection.
