<p>To measure intracellular luminescence in P0, P1, and P2 cells, we lysed cells with 500 ÂµL 1X Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual Luciferase Assay Kit, Promega) at room temperature for 15 min, freeze-thawed lysates, and detected FLuc and RLuc luminescence with the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit as described above.</p>
