<p>We used trVLP-containing supernatant to infect target Huh7 cells for a total of two trVLP passages (P1 and P2 cells). We seeded Huh7 cells into collagen-coated 6-well plates as P1 cells, grew to 40% confluency, and transfected cells in each well with the plasmid ratio above except without the 4MG plasmid or the pCAGGS/T7pol [

We inoculated P1 cells with 3 mL of trVLP-containing P0 supernatant 24 h post-transfection, changed media 24 h post-inoculation, and measured luminescence in P1 cells and collected trVLP-containing P1 supernatant 96 h post-inoculation. We performed the procedure again by transfecting fresh Huh7 cells, inoculating these P2 cells with P1 trVLPs, and measuring luminescence.
