<p>We performed most assays with the same mammalian expression vector for EBOV/Mak-C15 NP and its mutants, except where indicated. We synthesized EBOV NP-R111 in 2 dsDNA gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT], Coralville, IA) and cloned these gBlocks into pGL4.23-CMV [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] modified with a C-terminal V5 peptide tag. To generate all NP mutants, we performed a modified site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) protocol, as described in [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For many assays, we expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in cells in place of NP as a negative control. We generated the corresponding vector by cloning eGFP into pcDNA3.3-CMV (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) modified by an in-frame C-terminal V5 peptide tag.
