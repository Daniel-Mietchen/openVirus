<p>For the BRET experiment to study the NP-VP35 interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), we modified the pcDNA3.3 backbone with a woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to increase insert expression, using pcDNA3.3/KLF4 (a gift from Derrick Rossi; Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA; plasmid #26815) [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and pLV-WPRE/mCherry (a gift from Pantelis Tsoulfas; Addgene; plasmid #36084) as source material. We then cloned in eGFP, porcine teschovirus 1 2A ‘self-cleaving’ peptide (P2A) [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and EBOV/Mak-C15 VP35 amino acids 1–80 containing the NP-binding peptide (NPBP) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] from a gBlock (IDT) into a single open reading frame (eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP]) upstream of the WPRE, resulting in pcDNA3.3-WPRE/eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP]. As a negative control, we cloned a V5-tagged blue fluorescent protein mTagBFP2 into the pcDNA3.3-WPRE backbone, using mTagBFP2-pBAD (a gift from Michael Davidson; Addgene; plasmid #54572) [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] as source material.
