<p>We washed cells in 6-well plates with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping, pelleted and resuspended cells in 30 µL of 1.2% (

To capture the target protein, we prepared a mixture of 25 µL each of Protein A and Protein G SureBeads Magnetic Beads (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and immobilized 1–2 µg of primary antibody on the beads by rotation at room temperature for 20 min. We washed the bead—antibody complexes thrice with lysis buffer, and then incubated with cleared cell lysate while rotating the mixture at 4 °C for 2 hours (h). After capture, we washed beads six times with wash buffer followed by a final wash with PBS, and eluted proteins by boiling the beads in 50 µL of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) at 95 °C for 10 min.
