<p>For the 1MG and 4MG minigenome assays and EM, we performed forward transfection by incubating DNA with 
 <italic>Trans</italic>IT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA) in a 1:3 DNA:reagent ratio in Opti-MEM for 15â€“20 min at room temperature, and then added the mixture dropwise onto cells in 6- or 12-well plates.
