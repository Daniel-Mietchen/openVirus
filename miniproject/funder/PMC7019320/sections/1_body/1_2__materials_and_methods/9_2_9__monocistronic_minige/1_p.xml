<p>Monocistronic (1MG) minigenome plasmids and procedure were previously described [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We seeded HEK 293T cells into 12-well plates, grew to 70% confluency, and transfected cells in each well with 2 µg of pCAGGS/L, 0.25 µg of pCAGGS/VP30, 0.5 µg of pCAGGS/T7 RNA polymerase (T7pol), 0.5 µg of 1MG plasmid encoding FLuc, 0.1 µg of pCAGGS encoding RLuc, and 0.75 µg of pCAGGS/NP-2A-VP35 for each NP mutant. After 2 days, we washed and lysed cells with 100 µL of 1X Passive Lysis Buffer (Dual Luciferase Assay Kit, Promega), freeze-thawed lysates, and cleared by centrifugation. We incubated 10 µL of lysate with 50 µL of Luciferase Assay Reagent II, let the mixture settle for 2 s, and integrated luminescence for 10 s on a Spark 10M microplate reader (Tecan, Zürich, Switzerland) to measure FLuc activity. We then added 50 µL of Stop &amp; Glo reagent and integrated luminescence for 10 s to measure RLuc activity.
