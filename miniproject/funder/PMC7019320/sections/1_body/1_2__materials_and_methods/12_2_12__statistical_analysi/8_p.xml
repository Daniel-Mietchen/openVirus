<p>To measure the impact of NP genotype on 4MG minigenome activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), we expressed NP-R111 or NP mutants with the rest of the EBOV replication complex, the RLuc-encoding 4MG minigenome, and an FLuc-encoding plasmid to control for transfection efficiency (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3–9 biological replicates each). Due to significant day-to-day (replicate-to-replicate) variability, we normalized RLuc by FLuc luminescence for each replicate, then normalized all values to the average RLuc/FLuc ratio of the GP-A82/NP-R111 replicates prepared on that day. We performed ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test, in which each condition was compared to each other condition to generate corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-values using Prism 7. To measure the change in minigenome activity between passages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>D), we passaged cell culture supernatant from P0 to P1, and then from P1 to P2 cells, keeping track of each replicate. We normalized P1 and P2 RLuc/FLuc values to their own P0 replicate, and then normalized all values to the average value of the GP-A82/NP-R111 replicates prepared on that day. We assessed statistical significance using ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test to generate corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-values using Prism 7.
