<p>To measure the impact of NP genotype on 1MG minigenome activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), we expressed NP-R111 or NP mutants with the rest of the EBOV replication complex (VP35, VP30, L), the FLuc-encoding 1MG minigenome, and an RLuc-encoding plasmid to control for transfection efficiency (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates each). We normalized FLuc by RLuc luminescence for each replicate, then normalized all values to the average FLuc/RLuc ratio of the NP-R111 replicates. We performed ANOVA with Dunnettâ€™s post-test, in which each condition was compared to NP-R111 to generate corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-values using Prism 7.
