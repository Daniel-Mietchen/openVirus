<p>For donor saturation assay using BRET (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>D), we performed the BRET protocol with NLuc- and HaloTag-tagged NP-R111 or NP mutants or eGFP control for 4 amounts of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-HaloTag plasmid (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 biological replicates each). We fitted the data to saturation curves using the ‘nls’ function in R:
 <disp-formula>BRET ~ Max * NP-HaloTag/(BRET
  <sub>50</sub> + NP-HaloTag),
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> in which the amount of NP-HaloTag plasmid was the independent variable, BRET was the dependent variable, and Max and BRET
 <sub>50</sub> were constants to be fitted. For NP-R111 or each NP mutant or eGFP control, we estimated Max and BRET
 <sub>50</sub> and generated 95% confidence intervals using ‘nlstools’ as described above. Data points from eGFP failed to generate an appropriate curve fit. To determine whether the remaining curve fits were significantly different from each other, we performed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post-test in which NP-R111C, NP-R111E, and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E were compared to NP-R111, and generated multiple hypothesis corrected 
 <italic>p</italic>-values using Prism 7.
