<p>To measure VLP production from NLuc-VP40, NLuc-VP40-L117R, or NLuc alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), we quantified raw NLuc intensities (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 biological replicates each). To assess statistical significance, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA (rANOVA) with Dunnettâ€™s post-test, in which each condition was compared to NLuc-VP40 to generate corrected
