<p>To detect peptides, we performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We matched MS/MS fragmentation spectra to human forward protein databases and against reverse databases to a 1â€“2% false discovery rate using the SEQUEST database search program (Thermo Fisher Scientific) [
