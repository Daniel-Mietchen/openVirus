<p>We performed co-IP of myc-tagged NP complexes using 25 µg of mouse α-myc IgG or irrelevant normal mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight, and bound complexes to 250 µL of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. We washed beads as described above and eluted proteins in 120 µL of Laemmli sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min. We separated proteins on denaturing PAGE gels, visualized with PageBlue Protein Staining Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and excised lanes excluding IgG chains.</p>
