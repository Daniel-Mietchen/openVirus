<p>To generate a list of putative NP interacting partners, we filtered proteins with at least 2 unique PSMs in co-IPs of both NP-R111 and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E, and at least 2-fold greater-than-average PSM enrichment of α-myc co-IP over both IgG controls combined. To eliminate abundant and ‘sticky’ proteins, we normalized average PSM enrichment against PSMs identified in all 411 Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification (CRAPome) version 1.1 experiments [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], a collection of proteins identified in negative control isolations. From each replicate, we used the top 10% proteins enriched versus CRAPome experiments for Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/proteins (STRING) version 10 analysis [
