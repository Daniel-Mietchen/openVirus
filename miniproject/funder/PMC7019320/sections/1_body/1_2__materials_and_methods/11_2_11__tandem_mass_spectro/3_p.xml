<p>We cut gel bands into approximately 1-mm
 <sup>3</sup> pieces and performed a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We dehydrated pieces with acetonitrile for 10 min, dried them completely in a speed-vac pump, and rehydrated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/µL of sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) at 4 °C for 45 min. To extract peptides, we replaced the solution with 50 mM trypsin-free ammonium bicarbonate solution and incubated at 37 °C overnight. We washed peptides once with 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid, dried in a speed-vac pump for ≈1 h and then stored at 4 °C. On the day of analysis, we reconstituted peptides in 5‒10 µL of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). We packed nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary columns with 2.6 µm C18 spherical silica beads into fused silica capillary tubes (100 µm inner diameter x ≈25 cm length) using flame-drawn tips [
