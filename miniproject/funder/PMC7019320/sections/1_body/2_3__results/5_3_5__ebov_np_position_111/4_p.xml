<p>We used trVLP-containing culture supernatant from P0 cells to inoculate a first round of target cells (P1), and repeated the procedure using P1 trVLPs to inoculate a second round of target cells (P2). P1 and P2 cells were not transfected with plasmid encoding 4MG; instead, these cells contained 4MG minigenome if and only if a trVLP entered the cell. Since P1 and P2 minigenome activity depended on transcription, replication, and viral entry and spread, we calculated fold-change in reporter gene activity relative to P0 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). In the presence of ancestral GP-A82, NP-R111C (solid red lines) modestly decreased reporter activity compared to NP-R111 in P1 (solid tan lines; 77% of fold-change in activity; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.053, ANOVA-Tukey’s test) and further in P2 (59% of fold-change in activity; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.35, ANOVA-Tukey’s test). NP-R111E (solid blue lines) appeared completely unable to spread in P1 (1% of fold-change in activity; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA-Tukey’s test) and P2 (0.05% of fold-change in activity; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0003, ANOVA-Tukey’s test) cells. As expected, GP-A82V (dashed lines) spread much better than ancestral GP-A82 (solid lines) in the context of NP-R111 (tan; P1: 137% of fold-change in activity, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA-Tukey’s test; P2: 218% of fold-change in activity, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA-Tukey’s test) and NP-R111C (red; P1: 77% to 104% of fold-change in activity, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.014; P2: 59% to 67% of fold-change in activity, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.999), though NP-R111E was completely defective regardless of GP-82 allele (dashed and solid light blue lines overlap along the
