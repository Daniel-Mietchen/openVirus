<p>To investigate the functional importance of the NP-R111 residue, we examined existing annotations and functions of NP. The NP-R111 residue lies outside of key sites known to interact with EBOV RNA and VP35 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Moreover, in NP crystal structures [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the R111 residue appeared on the same face of the protein as the NP oligomerization domain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, left), opposite the key VP35 and RNA interaction residues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>B, right). Electron microscopy (EM) subtomogram averaging indicated that R111 is proximally located to key NP oligomerization residues [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, R111 lies amidst a conserved stretch of 3 basic residues, K109, K110, and R111, on the surface of the NP protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>C, yellow). Recent cryo-EM structures identified K110, adjacent to R111, as a residue forming a key electrostatic interstrand NPâ€“NP interaction [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] that is highly conserved (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). Indeed, deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicated that K110 and R111 residues were partially buried in wild-type NP compared to an oligomerization-incompetent NP [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on whether NP-R111C affects oligomerization during the EBOV life cycle, and further queried this residue by generating charge-reversed mutants (NP-R111E and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E).
