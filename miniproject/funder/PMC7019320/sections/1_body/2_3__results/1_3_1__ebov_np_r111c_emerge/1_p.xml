<p>Among the viral mutations that rose to dominate the EBOV population during the 2013â€’2016 Western African EVD epidemic, the NP-R111C substitution is of great interest because it shares features with the GP-A82V substitution that enhanced viral infectivity in vitro [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. GP-A82V and NP-R111C were two major clade-defining substitutions that rose to high frequency during the epidemic; other mutations did not affect the amino acid sequence of EBOV proteins [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on phylogeny of EBOV genomes from clinical samples, the NP-R111C substitution (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Indeed, few EBOV Makona variant genomes encoded GP-A82V in the absence of NP-R111C (23 cases, 1.26% of total), and the overwhelming majority of genomes encoded both substitutions (1653 cases, 90.67% of total).
