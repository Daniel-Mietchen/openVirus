<p>To address whether substitution at NP-R111 could influence NP–NP interaction and thereby NP oligomerization, we developed an assay to measure intracellular NP oligomerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Traditional oligomerization assays in cell culture involve tagging a protein separately with two different tags, co-expressing both tagged proteins, and then targeting one tag with co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and detecting the other tag by Western blot (WB) [

However, WB often has linear dynamic range issues; furthermore, co-IPs can introduce non-specific or spurious protein–protein interactions using different cell lysis and binding buffers. To overcome these deficits of co-IPs and WBs, we used BRET to study NP oligomerization in live cells. We tagged the NP C-terminus with either the chemiluminescent enzyme NanoLuc (NLuc) or the HaloTag protein (which covalently binds to an acceptor fluorophore). We co-expressed both tagged NPs in cells, and activated NP-NLuc with substrate, resulting in emission of light at 465 nm. Spatial proximity of NP-NLuc to NP-HaloTag due to NP oligomerization results in energy transfer and a second light emission at a longer wavelength, 625 nm (
