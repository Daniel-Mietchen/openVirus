<p>Next, we measured the propensity of NP-R111 mutants to oligomerize and found that NP-R111C, and to an even greater extent NP-R111E and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E, increased NP oligomerization. To quantify oligomerization, we expressed increasing amounts of acceptor NP-HaloTag in cells to saturate the donor NP-NLuc signal. The resulting oligomerization curves fit well to saturation curves, parameterized by Max (maximum oligomerization) and BRET
 <sub>50</sub> (ratio of NP-HaloTag:NP-NLuc plasmid needed to reach half Max) (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.74, ANOVA with Dunnett’s test to correct for multiple hypotheses), whereas the charge-reversed NP-R111E (light blue; 36% lower BRET
 <sub>50</sub>; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.031, ANOVA-Dunnett’s test) oligomerized at even lower NP concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). The triple charge-reversed NP-K109E/K110E/R111E oligomerized at similarly low NP concentrations (dark blue; 28% lower BRET
 <sub>50</sub> than NP-R111). Though this difference in BRET
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.11, ANOVA-Dunnett’s test) failed to reach traditional statistical significance cut-offs, NP-K109E/K110E/R111E produced significantly higher mean BRET signal than NP-R111 when the ratio of NP-HaloTag to NP-NLuc was 5 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0003; ANOVA-Dunnett’s test) or 20 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0007; ANOVA-Dunnett’s test), and its biochemical similarity to NP-R111E further suggested that its increased oligomerization was meaningful. We verified that different NP variants were expressed at similar concentrations by comparing the luminescence of NP-NLuc mutants in the absence of the HaloTag substrate (
