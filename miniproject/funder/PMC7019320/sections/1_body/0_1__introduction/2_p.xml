<p>Given the past and current public health threats caused by Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks, rapidly evaluating whether EBOV genomic mutations change viral phenotypes is critically important. As an RNA virus, EBOV generates many mutations over the course of an outbreak. The vast majority of these mutations likely will not be adaptive and will instead have negligible or negative effects on EBOV viability and replication [
