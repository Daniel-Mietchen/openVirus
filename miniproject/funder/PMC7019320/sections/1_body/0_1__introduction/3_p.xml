<p>The need to better understand EBOV evolution became clear during the 2013â€“2016 EVD epidemic in Western Africa caused by the EBOV Makona variant. This epidemic is the largest EVD epidemic on record with over 28,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. EBOV replication generated thousands of mutations over numerous rounds of human-to-human transmission [

One key mutation, C6283U, results in an A82V substitution in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP-A82V) and has been studied extensively through well-established BSL-2 surrogate model systems and live virus BSL-4 studies. GP-A82V increases EBOV infectivity in human and other primate cell types in vitro, suggesting that the mutation confers a selective advantage to EBOV [
