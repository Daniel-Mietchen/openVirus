<p>Ebola virus (EBOV) remains a serious hazard to human health; however, studying live virus requires maximum (biosafety level 4 [BSL-4]) containment, restricting experiments to a handful of laboratories around the globe. Therefore, reporter assays can complement live virus experiments in two ways. First, reporter assays can selectively study one or a handful of viral phenotypes for better understanding of specific molecular mechanisms. Second, many reporter assays can be performed at BSL-1 or -2 containment, expanding performance of EBOV studies to many more laboratories. Therefore, reporter assays can be a first-line tool to assess how rapidly evolving viral genotypes affect phenotype before time- and resource-intensive BSL-4 studies are conducted.</p>
