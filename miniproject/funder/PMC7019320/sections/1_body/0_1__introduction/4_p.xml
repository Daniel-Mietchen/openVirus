<p>A second high-frequency mutation that emerged amidst the epidemic, C800U, results in an R111C substitution in the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP-R111C). Both the GP-A82V and NP-R111C substitutions arose on the same viral lineage and rose to &gt;90% frequency. In contrast to GP-A82V, NP-R111C has not been thoroughly studied. Though NP has many functions, a limited number of assays are available for studying these functions. This limitation presents an important challenge and opportunity to develop assays to gain mechanistic insight into NP biology and variation.</p>
