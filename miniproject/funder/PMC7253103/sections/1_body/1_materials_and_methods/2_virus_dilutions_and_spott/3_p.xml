<p>For DENV1, each dilution was loaded onto 39 RDTs, three RDTs were immediately processed (D0), and the rest were divided into three groups and placed at three different temperatures: 4°C, −80°C, and 35°C. After different storage times, 2 days (D2), 1 week (W1), 1 month (M1), and 2 months (M2), three RDTs were taken out from each storage condition and then processed.</p>
