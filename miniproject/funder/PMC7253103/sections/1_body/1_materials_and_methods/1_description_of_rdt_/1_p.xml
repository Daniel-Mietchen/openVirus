<p>The SD Dengue DUO RDT (Standard Diagnostics, Kyonggi-do, Korea) is an in vitro immunochromatographic assay for the detection of DENV NS1 Ag and anti-dengue IgM/IgG antibodies in human serum, plasma, or whole blood, from finger-prick or venous blood. This test comprises a pair of test devices, a DENV NS1 Ag test on the left side, and a DENV IgM/IgG Ab test on the right side. Each device contains a strip, enclosed in a plastic cassette. The strip is made of three compartments: 1) an absorptive pad where the patient sample (serum, blood, or plasma) is applied and which then moves along the strip; 2) a conjugate or reagent pad which contains antibodies, specific to the targeted analyte, conjugated to colored particles; and 3) a nitrocellulose membrane on which the immunocomplexes move until the zone of reaction where they are immobilized and appear as a colored band. The test is easy to perform—three drops (using a dropper provided with the kit, ∼100 μL) and 10 μL (using a capillary provided with the kit) of the sample are applied into the two small wells on the NS1 and Ab cassettes, respectively. Four drops of the diluent (provided with the kit) are then applied on the Ab cassette. The test results are obtained in 15 minutes.</p>
