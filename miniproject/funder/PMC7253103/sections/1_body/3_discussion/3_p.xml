<p>As a development of a previous study,
 <sup>

 </sup> we show here that the storage of the used RDTs for a few weeks at elevated temperature does not compromise detection of DENV RNA by RT-qPCR. DENV RNA was purified and could be detected for the three tested dilutions even after 1 month storage of the RDTs at 35°C. Similar Cq were obtained in comparison to the RDTs tested at day 0. Some RNA degradation seems to occur after a 2-month storage at 35°C. For the dilutions “high” and “medium,” the RT-qPCR results were four Cq higher for the RDTs at 35°C than for the RDTs tested at day 0, and RT-qPCR was negative from the RDTs loaded with the “low” dilution. However, the “low” dilution was chosen to be at the LOD, and we showed in our previous study that the quantity of RNA recovered varies between RDTs.

 </sup> This may explain why DENV RT-qPCR was negative for some “low” RDTs tested after 1 month at 4°C, and 1 week and 2 months at 35°C.
