<p>Rapid diagnostic tests have the potential to be a unique, simple, and cost-effective tool to improve laboratory detection of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV across wide geographical areas. Large-scale implementation of surveillance for these viruses is of crucial public health importance, to inform intervention strategies and for the early detection of epidemics. Combined surveillance is of particular importance in the current context of recent expansion of arboviral diseases because of increasing urbanization and expansion of long distance transportation.
