<p>Association between MSM transmission route and clustering within the subtype B infected cases has been previously reported in various cohorts [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Clinical characteristics of the clustered sequences followed the patterns observed in other studies including lack of prior antiretroviral treatment exposure, higher CD4 lymphocyte counts, earlier stage of HIV disease and more recent sampling [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also observed clustering frequencies were within the 18.2â€“60% range observed across European and North-American datasets [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and similar to the 31.2% observed in SPREAD cohort using the same internode genetic distance threshold of 3% [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Transmission networks observed in our study were not limited to the single geographical site with 13% of the total analyzed sequences (39.25% of the clustered ones) dispersed across HIV treatment centers. Of note, this may be associated with clustering networks, but also reflects the patient migration for personal and professional reasons.
