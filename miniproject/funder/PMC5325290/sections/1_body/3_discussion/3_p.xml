<p>It should be noted, that in the aforementioned SPREAD report, within a much smaller dataset of 193 Polish sequences from different geographical sites than the current study, a large cluster of 15 sequences was found. This is consistent with the identification of large, interregional clusters in our analysis including the ones comprising of 13 and 20 sequences. These large clusters may reflect rapidly growing sub-epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and have been found throughout subtype B infected populations worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], however the exact transmission pattern within the transmission clusters is difficult to analyze in the cohort of chronically infected individuals. As expansion of the clusters over time has been reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] this finding supports the need for early introduction of antiretroviral therapy in populations with frequent clustering aiming to break the transmission chains [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
