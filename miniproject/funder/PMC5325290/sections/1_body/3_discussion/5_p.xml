<p>Although interval modeling was performed using data inferred from samples with unknown duration of HIV infection, the results are highly consistent with the ones obtained for the Dutch observational cohort Athena [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with reported median time to onward transmissions of 17 months (IQR: 7–17 months). Moreover, our data are in accordance to the study by Lewis et al., indicating that 22.4% (23.1% among MSM) of new infections occurred within the first 6 months from the index case [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Also, our observation that in the clusters ≥5 sequences 25% percent of transmissions occurred during the first 5.3 months and 50% of transmissions within the 13.2 months is consistent with the report by Brenner et al., modeling that 25%–30% of clustered transmissions occur within 6-months and 50% over a 14- to 17-month period [
