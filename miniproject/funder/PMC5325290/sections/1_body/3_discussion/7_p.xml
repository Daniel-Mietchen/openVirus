<p>Limitation of the study is related to the convenience of sampling—certain proportion of cases representing intermediate transmissions may have not been indentified and therefore not included in the analysis. This may result in the overestimation of the transmission intervals. Additionally, the data are limited only to the centers participating in the study—mostly Western and Southern provinces, however this is the largest sequence dataset available for the multiple sites in the country. Also, it should be emphasized that sequence datasets are not sufficient to determine the specific transmission events and ideally should be coupled with contact information [

It should also be noted, that definitions of genetic distance based clustering are inconsistent across the published studies ranging from 1.5% (most widely used for recent infections and local cohorts) to 4.5% (chronically infected individuals from nationwide analyses) [
