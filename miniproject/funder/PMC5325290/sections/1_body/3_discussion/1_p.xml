 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] we focused this study on the phylodynamic analysis of transmission networks. Data from different centers were analysed to minimize the sampling bias related to the localized epidemics and to reflect countrywide trends in the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1. The dataset included HIV sequences collected for genotyping purposes, and was limited to the subtype B as this clade remains the most prevalent in the country [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We have shown that the frequency (31%) of clustering is associated with MSM transmissions and early stage of HIV infection with common (13%) interregional transmission networks reflecting patient mobility Moreover, it was demonstrated that clustering is becoming more frequent over time, which indicates the uncontrolled, expanding epidemics and forward infections from individuals probably unaware of their HIV status, especially among MSM populations. This is in line with the surveillance data in Poland with the rapid increase in new HIV diagnoses in MSM, especially aged 24â€“34 years. In this group the number of newly diagnosed infections increased &gt;20 fold, from 13 in the year 2000, to 313 in 2011 [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Clustering may only partially be explained by the earlier diagnosis during the course of infection over time, as the percentage of the late presenters reported from the epidemiological data was increasing [
