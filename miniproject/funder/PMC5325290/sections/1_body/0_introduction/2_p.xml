<p>This increase was associated with injection drug use (IDU) in Eastern Europe including countries such as Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and upsurge of new infections among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in West European countries [

Also, recent models have indicated a high proportion (68.3%, 95%CI 53.9–76.1%) of undiagnosed HIV among MSM, which is related to low testing rates in Poland and lack of uniform preventive strategy focused on this group, despite higher testing rates associated with MSM exposure [
