<p>Time between transmission events was calculated from the dated MCMC tree using distances between MRCAs for each cluster (internode intervals)—for each identified cluster/pair the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was calculated. Medians and interquartile ranges for these intervals were calculated separately both for all clusters and clusters ≥5 sequences.</p>
