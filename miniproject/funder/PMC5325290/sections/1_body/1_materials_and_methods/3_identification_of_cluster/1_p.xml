<p>First, clusters were identified using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method with the NNI-SPR sub-tree algorithm under the GTR+Î³ with the PHYML v 3.0 using automatic model selection [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Monophyletic clusters were identified with Cluster-picker software using 3% within-cluster distance (substitutions/site) threshold and 0.9 aLRT bootstrap values. Phylogeographic interregional links within the clustered sequences were investigated.
