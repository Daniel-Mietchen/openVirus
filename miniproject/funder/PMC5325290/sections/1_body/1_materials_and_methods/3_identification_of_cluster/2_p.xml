<p>Additionally, for the 321 clustered sequences Bayesian Monte Carlo Marcov Chain (MCMC) was used. Pooling of clustered sequences was performed for computational reasons. Three replicates of 35 million generations were run in BEAST v2.3.1 (2015) [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] using a coalescent constant population prior and a GTR model with uncorrelated relaxed exponential molecular clock [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This model was cosidered the most fit using phyML modeling. The molecular clock was calibrated using parameters derived from the phyML analysis, namely gamma shape: 0.33, estimated proportion of invariant sites with the initial value of 0.5, and the following GTR substitution rates: AC: 2.621, AG: 7.422, AT: 0.922, GC: 0.943, CT: 14.36, GT: 1.0. Lognormal priors were applied to the coalescent population size, proportion invariants sites for partitions and clock mean on partitions. All prior and posterior effective sample size (ESS) values exceeded 200. A consensus tree with posterior probabilities for branch support was obtained and annotated with TreeAnnotator v 1.5.4 using a 10% burnin. All trees were visualized in Figtree v.1.2.2.
