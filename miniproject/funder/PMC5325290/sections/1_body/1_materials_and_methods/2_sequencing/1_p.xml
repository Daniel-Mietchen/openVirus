<p>HIV RNA extraction, as well as reverse transcriptase and protease genotyping, were performed using a genotyping assay (Viroseq 2.8, Abbott Molecular, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protease/reverse transcriptase sequences obtained were 1302 b.p. long; location from the start of HXB2 genome: positions 2253 to 3525. Identification of subtype B was performed based on the partial

All sutype B sequences included in the analysis were assessed for recombination using two methods: a simplot bootscan (2-parameter Kimura model, window size 200 b.p., 20.p. step) [

 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Recombinant sequences were removed from the final dataset. Thirty-seven codon sites associated with protease and reverse transcriptase resistance mutations were manually deleted from the sequence alignments. The final alignment was 1191 b.p. long.
