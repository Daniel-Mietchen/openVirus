<p>Statistical comparisons were performed using Fisher’s exact and Chi
 <sup>2</sup> tests for nominal variables. Continuous variables were analysed using the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-test for nonparametric statistics (HIV viral load, age at diagnosis, baseline and nadir CD4 lymphocyte counts, internode intervals). Commercial software (Statistica 10PL, Statasoft, Warsaw, Poland) was used for above statistical calculations. Time trends for the frequency of transmission pairs and clusters were calculated using the logistic regression (R statistical platform version 3.1.0, package MASS). Two separate analyses (pairs + clusters ≥3 sequences and clusters ≥3 sequences only) were performed, with presence (coded as 1) or lack of clusters (coded as 0) investigated for every year. For analyses of time trends in the clustering the 707 (73.2% of the total cohort) patients diagnosed from 2009–2014 were included, as the sample size for the years 1989–2008 did not exceed 50 sequences. This sample (707 cases) represents 10.8% of the new HIV-1 diagnoses in Poland for the years 2009–2014 (6560 cases).
