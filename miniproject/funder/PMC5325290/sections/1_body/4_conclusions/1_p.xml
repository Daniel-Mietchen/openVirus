<p>Clustering networks reflect expanding HIV epidemics among MSM in Poland. Interregional clustering reflects high dynamics of the nationwide HIV epidemics in the MSM group. Presented molecular data allow to emphasize the need for the evidence-based interventions which should focus on the proactive identification of populations at the highest risk, testing and early referral to antiretroviral treatment. Pre-exposure antiretroviral drug use should be implemented as preventive strategy among MSM in Poland as this group contributes significantly to onward HIV transmissions.</p>
