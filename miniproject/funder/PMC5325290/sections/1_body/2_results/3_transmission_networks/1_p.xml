<p>To reflect the dynamics of the HIV transmissions in Poland in recent years we analysed the transmissions networks among the sites participating in the study. For this purpose the clusters and pairs containing sequences from patients followed-up at different centers were identified. Such interregional networks were found in 31 clusters/pairs containing 126 (13%) sequences from various centers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172473.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and were more common among MSM compared to other, transmission routes. In clusters/pairs containing patients from ≥2 centres 112 (11.6%) sequences were derived from MSM patients compared to four (0.4%) from IDU and 10 (1%) from heterosexually infected cases [p&lt;0.001, OR:4.7 (95%CI: 2.55–8.96))]. As expected, frequency of clusters containing interregional sequences increased notably with the cluster size (OR for trend: 2.94 (95% CI: 1.51–5.64), p&lt;0.001) (
