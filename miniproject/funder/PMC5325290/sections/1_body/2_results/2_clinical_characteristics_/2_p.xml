<p>In multivariate analyses of clusters/pairs adjusted for transmission route, gender, clinical category at diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment history (treated vs. naive) and HCV status the factors associated with clustering were MSM transmission route [OR: 2.24 (95%CI: 1.38–3.65), p&lt;0.001] and CDC category A [OR: 1.93 (95%CI: 1.4–2.64), p&lt;0.0001]. Similar results were obtained for clusters of ≥ 3 cases with OR: 2.093 (95%CI: 1.14–3.85), p = 0.018 for MSM transmissions and OR: 2.64 (95%CI: 1.71–4.04), p&lt;0.0001 for asymptomatic infection at HIV diagnosis.</p>
