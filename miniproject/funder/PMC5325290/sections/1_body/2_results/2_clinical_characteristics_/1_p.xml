<p>Univariate associations between clustering and group characteristics are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Sequence clusters/pairs were notably more frequent among MSM (229 cases, 71.3%) compared to other transmission routes (injection drug use (IDU): 32 (10.0%) and heterosexual transmissions: 60 (18.7%) cases, respectively [p&lt;0.001, OR: 3.5 (95%CI: 2.6–4.6)]. Furthermore, clusters (groups of ≥ 3 cases) predominantly contained MSM-derived sequences (n = 131, 79.4%) with only 24 (14.5%) ones from patients infected by heterosexual contact and 10 (6.1%) by IDUs route. Moreover, patients with sequences forming pairs and clusters were younger at HIV diagnosis [median: 31 (IQR: 26–37) compared to 32 (27–39) years for unclustered sequences, p = 0.023], mostly asymptomatic at the time of analysis (67.8%, p&lt;0.001), predominantly antiretroviral treatment naive (90.0%, p&lt;0.001), and free of hepatitis C virus coinfection (83.3%, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, CD4 lymphocyte counts at genotyping and CD4 lymphocyte nadirs were significantly higher for clustered/paired patients [baseline CD4 median: 407 (IQR: 209–565) cells/μl versus 290 (111–467) cells/μl, p&lt;0.001 and nadir CD4 median 356 (IQR: 187–493) versus 223 (IQR: 88–383) cells/μl, p&lt;0.001 for paired/clustered and unclustered sequences, respectively], while HIV viral load was similar across these categories. Those clinical, immunologic and virologic patterns were similar for clusters of ≥ 3 cases (after removal of sequence pairs from the analysis).
