<p>Based on the constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree a total of 109 clusters and pairs containing 321 (33.2%) sequences were found, including 36 clusters of ≥3 individuals incorporating 165 (17.1%) sequences (

Frequency of transmission pairs and clusters notably increased over time: from 26.92% in 2009 to 50.6% in 2014 [OR: 1.18 (95%CI: 1.06–1.31), p = 0.0026; slope for the frequency increase 2.8%/year]. This trend was similar when sequence pairs were excluded from the clustering analyses (increase from 9.62% in 2009 to 25.3% in 2014 [OR: 1.21 (95%CI: 1.06–1.38), p = 0.004; slope for the frequency increase 2.2%/year] (
