<p>To further investigate phylogenetic relationships between the clusters and pairs dated Bayesian MCMC phylogeny using a subset of 321 closely related sequences forming clusters and pairs was reconstructed (marked in blue on the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172473.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Median genetic distances for clusters/pairs were 0.0199 (IQR: 0.013–0.0237) and 0.023 (IQR: 0.0199–0.0276) for clusters ≥ 3 sequences.
