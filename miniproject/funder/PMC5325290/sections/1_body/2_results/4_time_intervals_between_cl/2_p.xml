<p>To reflect the time between transmission events we have inferred a dated tree and calculated distances between tMRCA and previous nodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0172473.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] for clusters of ≥ 3 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172473.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Separate analysis was performed for clusters of ≥ 5 cases (exact topology for the time-scaled phylogenies for the clusters ≥ 5 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172473.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Time between the estimated times of infection for the clusters, reflecting time to onward transmission, ranged from 0.05 to 6.08 years [median 1.38 (IQR: 0.59–2.52) years]. For clusters of ≥5 sequences the internode intervals were significantly shorter compared to the smaller clusters [median 1.1 (IQR: 0.43–1.9) years versus median 2.13 (IQR: 1.1–3.66) years, p = 0.0026, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172473.s002">S2 Fig</xref>]. Distribution of the internode distances for the clusters indicates that 22.4% of clustered onward transmissions occurred within the first 6 months, while 37.6% within the first year from infection; Analyzing only MSM clusters, the model suggests that the 23.1% and 35.9% of clustered transmissions occur within the first 6 months and one year from index case infection, respectively. This indicates that at least 3.9% (7.0% for MSM) of transmissions in the studied group occurred within 6 months and 6.6% (10.9% for MSM) within the first year of infection.
