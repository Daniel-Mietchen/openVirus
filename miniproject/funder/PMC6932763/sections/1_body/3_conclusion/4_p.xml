<p>Our results show that in each province, a different set of weather variables should be used in the best prediction model. Different geographical and spatial locations may be the cause of local effects that lead to a different dengue model. Each province has its unique local factors that cannot be generalized to other provinces. Our results indicate that the independent weather variables needed to accurately predict future dengue cases are not fixed. These variables are locally determined. Hence, the best prediction models should be constructed at a local level, such as the provincial level, not on a larger scale, such as the national level. The application of this study provides high accuracy from the predictive model for the predicted weather parameters. The public health institute may use these models in considering future strategies and hospital preparation. Thailand is a small country in Southeast Asia and our results show different independent variables in each province. The individual geographical locations are the factors that could be important for dengue incidences. We can observe the relations of variables overlapping (by areas) in the same province. Weather variables of the model are locally determined so that a province-level model provides an appropriate and accurate model. A dengue prediction model should be determined on a small scale, not on a large scale such as the national level. In conclusion, the best model prediction depends on the geographical variability of each model location. With the presented accuracy, our models can be used to predict the dengue incidences at the provincial level in the future.</p>
