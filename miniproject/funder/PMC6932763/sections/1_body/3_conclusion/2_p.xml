<p>From our study, we found that the 1-week-lag case variable (coefficient of determination from a minimum of 0.026 to a maximum of 0.954, average of 0.6383, 95%CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355) is the best predictor associated with dengue incidences for all provinces. However, some provinces are predictable without previous case variables. The 2-week-lag case (coefficient of determination from a minimum of 0.391 to a maximum of 0.714, average of 0.5485, 95%CI: 0.4384, 0.6585) and 3-week lag case (coefficient of determination from a minimum of 0.642 to a maximum of 0.759, average of 0.7005, 95%CI: 0.0428, 1.4438) variables are the most influential variables in many provinces.</p>
