<p>We constructed predictive models to forecast provincial-level future dengue cases based on weather and dengue incidences from 2001 to 2014 in Thailand. There are a total of 35 independent variables, which include the one to three week previous cases and the 0 to 3 week lag for each weather variable (average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average humidity, precipitation, vaporization, wind direction, and wind power). By using a combination of 1–12 variables to find the best model, we create a total of 77,663,266 models for one method of the generalized linear model. We create predictive models based on three statistical regression models and two time-series analysis methods: Poisson, negative binomial, quasi-likelihood regression models and ARIMA and SARIMA series analysis methods. The models for each province were combined for 2–12 independent variables. In total, 232,989,800 models are built for a province. We construct 15,144,337,000 models for all provinces in Thailand. For all provinces, the model with the highest coefficient of determination is the quasi-likelihood regression model, which is chosen as the predictive model. We then use the three best predictive models to further analyze the relations among weather variables and dengue cases using pairwise scatter plots, line plots, and ACF and PACF to investigate our results. The results show an average coefficient of determination of 0.6339 (95%CI: 0.57802, 0.6898) for all provinces, which are from a minimum of 0.026 in Sakon Nakhon to a maximum of 0.954 in Lampang.</p>
