<p>Wind direction and wind power are also influential weather variables. For example, the best-fit model of Phayao province, which uses both wind direction and power factor, shows the highest dengue incidences for 5â€“6 knots of wind power. This suggests that wind power is significant for the dispersion of dengue by mosquitos. The positive coefficient in many provinces shows that higher wind power may affect dengue incidences. The more wind power on water surface, the larger the region of evaporation. The increase in humidity may help adult mosquitos to survive longer and spread dengue. Wind direction variables are most influential in provinces located in northern and northeastern Thailand. These regions are mountainous areas. Human populations are not spread equally in all directions. A suitable wind direction may help distribute dengue carriers to a more populated area. This can result in a wider spread of dengue incidences.</p>
