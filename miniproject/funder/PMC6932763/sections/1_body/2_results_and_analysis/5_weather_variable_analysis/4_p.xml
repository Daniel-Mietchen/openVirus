<p>Current and lag pressure effects are minor weather variables for all provinces of Thailand. In our results, pressure has negative associations to dengue cases. Average pressure also has a negative association in many provinces, especially in the southern and northern regions. Because the northern provinces are mountainous, there is a seasonal pattern leading to a decrease in local pressure and temperature. Lower pressure intensifies the water storage in the environment by increasing precipitation. The seasonal pattern in the northern provinces causes an increase in the number of mosquitoes, leading to more dengue viral cases while increasing the residence time of incubation, which indicates a pressure-controlled variable.</p>
