<p>Even though previous cases have strong effects on dengue cases in most provinces, the best-fit model of two provinces, i.e., Phichit and Krabi, contain solely weather variables, with no previous case variables. The best-fit prediction model yields a high coefficient of determination of 0.715 (Phichit) and 0.637 (Krabi). These two provinces indicate that previous cases (alone) are not enough to accurately predict future dengue cases. Weather variables play non-negligible roles in highly accurate prediction models.</p>
