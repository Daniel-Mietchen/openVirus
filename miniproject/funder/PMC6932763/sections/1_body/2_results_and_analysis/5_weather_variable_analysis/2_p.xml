<p>Although the previous dengue cases are significantly associated with dengue incidences, weather variables do have merit in the prediction models. In fact, the best models for all provinces contain some weather variables. The most frequent weather variable among all provinces is the current-week precipitation, which is used in 20 provinces. The second frequent weather variable is the 3-week-lag precipitation, which is associated with predicted dengue incidences. In some provinces, like Bangkok, both the current-week precipitation and the 3-week-lag precipitation are used in the best-fit prediction model. Our results show that precipitation for up to three weeks has a high (positive and negative) influence on dengue incidences. Although heavy precipitation could convey the mosquito’s larva away at the current week, the amount of precipitation can substantially affect a mosquito’s habitat by increasing water storages for the eggs, which has positive correlation with the 3-week-lag precipitation. This duration corresponds to the life cycle of mosquitos which take up to 14 days to become an adult period. High precipitation for 30 days has a substantial effect, rapidly increasing the risk of infection for dengue, as shown in our pairwise plots. This may be because precipitation initially creates the offspring habitats for mosquito reproduction. More precipitation induces an increased risk of infection. In contrast, massive precipitation can decrease mosquito habitats by destroying the mosquitoes’ offspring in water storage or convey mosquito larvae away. Therefore, our results present both positive and negative relationships for precipitation, depending on the location in each province. Our findings strongly show that precipitation is the most influential weather factor for all provinces of Thailand. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226945.g007">Fig 7</xref>, some of the highest cases occur at low precipitation. However, theses cases contains higher 1 to 3-week-lag precipitation. High cases may also correspond to the life cycle of mosquitos which take up to 14 days for a female mosquito to become fully grown.
