<p>For the temperature and time-lag effects, our results show that the maximum temperatures from current to 3 week-lag time are more influential in Thailand than the effects of minimum temperatures. However, the best-fit model of a province with a high dengue mortality rate usually contains an influence of the minimum temperature. For example, in Songkhla province, the minimum-temperature variable indicates that there is a high dengue case occurrence at approximately 24â€“26 degrees Celsius. Previous studies have shown that the minimum temperature has a positive association with dengue incidences. The association of dengue incidences with temperature change has been widely studied across lag times of up to 20 weeks. The minimum temperature has a significant impact on dengue epidemics. Our results show that the current-week minimum temperature is highly significant for the southern, eastern, and central regions.</p>
