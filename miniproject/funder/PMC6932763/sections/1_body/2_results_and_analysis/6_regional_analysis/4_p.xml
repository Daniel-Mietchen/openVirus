<p>In the southern region, the most significant previous case variable is the positive 1-week-lag case variable, except for Krabi and Ranong provinces. In Ranong, the 2-week-lag cases are the most influential variable. Nevertheless, the best-fit model for Krabi province does not include the previous cases. The coefficient of determination is from 0.271 for Satun to 0.884 for Nakhon Si Thammarat, with an average of 0.614857 (95% CI: 0.51033, 0.7194). The most significant weather variable is the negative current-week pressure. As shown in the model of Chumphon province, the pressure factor shows a relationship to dengue cases, in which a low pressure leads to high incidences. Since the topography of the area is a peninsula between the Andaman Sea and the South China Sea, the pressure change has a significant effect on each individual location. The second significant weather variable is the positive current-week maximum temperature. The southern region has a tropical rainforest climate system where the temperature is warm throughout the year. Therefore, the effects of temperature are influential, as shown in Trang province. When the temperature increases, the rate of virus infection also increases. Other significant weather variables are the negative 1-week-lag case and the 3-week-lag vaporization. This can be seen in the model of Trang province where water vapor plays an important role in dengue incidences at moderate vaporization. The most frequent weather variables in the southern region are the negative current week, 1-week-lag case, and 2-week-lag pressure factors which all have the same significance. Other frequent weather variables are the 2-week-lag precipitation and 3-week-lag vaporization. This can be observed from the model of Trang province. In this region, quasi-likelihood regression is the best model method, followed by negative binomial regression, Poisson regression, and time series analysis. The quasi-likelihood regression model can predict the results. The coefficients of determination are from 0.43 for Phang Nga to 0.884 for Nakhon Si Thammarat (average of 0.4630, 95% CI: 0.2196, 0.7064). Negative binomial regression yields a coefficient of determination from 0.271 for Satun to 0.637 for Krabi (average of 0.5527, 95% CI: 0.4079, 0.6975). Also, Poisson regression yields a coefficient of determination from 0.506 for Ranong to 0.618 for Chumphon province. For Krabi province, which is independent of the previous case variables, the best model consists of the negative current-week pressure, positive 1-week-lag pressure, negative 2-week-lag pressure, and the positive 2-week-lag wind direction at high significance. The results show the substantial effects of pressure and wind direction. The wind direction was supported by the topography of the surrounding seas that are parallel to the southern area [
