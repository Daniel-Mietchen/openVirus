<p>In the central and eastern regions, the most significant variable is the positive 1-week-lag cases, except Chachoengsao, Trat, Pathum Thani, Prachin Buri, and Rayong provinces. The coefficient of determination in the central and eastern regions is from 0.138 for Chai Nat to 0.836 for Chanthaburi province, with an average of 0.5440 (95%CI: 0.4417, 0.6464). In the central and eastern regions, the most significant weather variables are the negative current week and 1-week-lag pressure variables. Another frequent variable is the 2-week-lag maximum temperature. In Trat province, the maximum temperature is linearly associated with dengue cases, but the relation to pressure is the reverse. The central and eastern regions are a low-level plain and the Gulf of Thailand (Meteorological Development Bureau, 2015). The temperature in this region favors mosquitoes. Therefore, the temperature factors are important for dengue incidences. The most frequent weather variables in this region are the positive current week, 3-week-lag precipitation, and 2-week-lag maximum temperature. This area is the center point of all rivers in Thailand. When precipitation rises, it can cause an increase in dengue incidences in the area. As shown for Bangkok, the plot shows the relationship of precipitation to dengue cases, with the highest cases at low precipitation. Another frequent weather variable is the 3-week-lag wind power. As shown in Prachuap Khiri Khan, wind power in a certain direction increases dengue incidences. The best selection models in the central and eastern regions are the quasi-likelihood model, negative binomial regression model, and time series analysis. Poisson regression is not used in this region. For the quasi-likelihood regression model, the coefficient of determination is from the lowest (0.138) to the highest (0.836) with an average of 0.5420 (95%CI: 0.4146, 0.6695). The negative binomial regression model has a coefficient of determination from 0.225 for Pra Nakhon Sri Ayutthaya to 0.759 for Prachin Buri province (Average of 0.5496, 95%CI: 0.2877, 0.8115). Time series analysis is used to fit only Bangkok, Chanthaburi, and Ratchaburi province, where the coefficient of determination is from 0.287 to 0.472. From the result of Chanthaburi, the predictions of time series analysis by SARIMA have sufficient dengue incidences.</p>
