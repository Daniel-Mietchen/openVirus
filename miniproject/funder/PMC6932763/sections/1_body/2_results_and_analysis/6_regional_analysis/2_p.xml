<p>In the northeastern region, the most significant previous case variable is the positive 1-week-lag case variable, except for Si Sa Ket province. In Si Sa Ket province, the positive 2-week-lag case variable is the most significant previous case variable. The coefficient of determination in the northeastern region is from 0.026 for Sakon Nakhon to 0.929 for Loei province, with an average of 0.6672 (95%CI: 0.5267, 0.8076). For determining the overall weather effects, the most significant weather variable is the positive 3-week-lag vaporization. The northeastern region is a high-level plain area called the Khorat plateau, in which sunlight can easily penetrate to the land, compared with other regions, leading to higher vaporization. When vaporization rapidly increases, temperature and dengue incidences also proportional increase, as shown in the best-fit model of Chaiyaphum province. Other significant weather variables are the negative 1-week-lag pressure and the 2-week-lag wind direction. The significance of the first-lag pressure to dengue incidences was supported by Wongkoon et al., 2011. Nakhon Ratchasima and Nong Khai provinces have a high dengue incidence at low pressure. The northeastern region depends on the 1-week-lag pressure, supporting the results of Nong Khai province. For the 2-week-lag wind direction, the direction is approximately 180 to 200 degrees (from Nong Khai and Nakhon Phanom provinces), which refer to the southeast wind from the South China Sea in the local monsoon climate system [

 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The wind supports the pathway of dengue transmission of the northeastern area before passing through other regions. The most frequent weather variables are the negative current week and the 3-week-lag precipitation. Our results of Udon Thani show that low precipitation induces a high number of dengue cases. The second weather variable is the 3-week-lag vaporization. The best model in the northeastern region is the quasi-likelihood model, followed by negative binomial regression, Poisson regression model, and time series analysis. Time series analysis cannot be used to predict dengue incidences in this region. The quasi-likelihood regression method (13 provinces out of a total of 16 provinces) has a coefficient of determination from 0.026 to 0.929 with an average of 0.6626 (95%CI: 0.4856, 0.8397). The negative binomial regression method has a coefficient of determination from 0.607 for Nakhon Phanom to 0.708 for Kalasin, and the coefficient of determination of the Poisson regression is 0.746 for Nong Khai province.
