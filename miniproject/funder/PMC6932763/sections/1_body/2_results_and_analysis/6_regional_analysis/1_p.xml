<p>In the northern region, the 1-week-lag case variable is the highest significant factor associated with dengue incidence in most of the provinces, except Phichit and Sukhothai. Phichit province was not included for the previous case variable in the best model. For Sukhothai province, the highest significant variable is 3-week-lag dengue cases. Considering overall regional weather, the highest significant weather variables are ordered as the following: negative current-week pressure, 3-week-lag wind power, 2-week-lag vaporization, and 3-week-lag wind direction. The accuracy by the coefficient of determination in this region is (on average) 0.7208 (95%CI: 0.6067, 0.8349), with a minimum of 0.22 for Phitsanulok to a maximum of 0.954 for Lampang. The northern provinces are mountainous and are higher from sea level than the other provinces. The pressures are lower so that there may be an increase in the mosquito population and the dengue virus. For example, in Lampang province, the results show a high dengue incidence at low pressure. The most frequently used weather variables in the northern region are the 3-week-lag humidity and 3-week-lag wind direction. Humidity, temperature, and dengue cases have a positive correlation. In Tak province, the results show that high humidity and high temperature increase the dengue cases. The results also support the strong positive relation of the wind direction with dengue cases. The second frequent weather variable in the northern region is the 3-week-lag wind power. As seen in Phrae province, the results show that moderate wind power leads to high dengue cases. Other frequent weather variables are the negative current-week pressure, positive 2-week-lag rainfall, and negative 2-week-lag vaporization. These values are also supported by Mae Hong Son province. For general weather effects, the best model for fitting the northern region is the quasi-likelihood model (10 provinces out of 16 provinces), followed by negative binomial regression, Poisson regression model, and time series analysis. The quasi-likelihood regression method yields an average coefficient of determination of 0.7161 (95%CI:0.5374, 0.8947). Negative binomial regression has a coefficient of determination from 0.473 for Phayao to 0.909 for Mae Hong Son province with an average of 0.69825 (95%CI: 0.4029, 0.9935). The Poisson regression coefficient of determination is 0.715 for Phichit and 0.864 for Phrae province with an average of 0.7895 (95%CI: 0.1571, 1.7361). Time series analysis is well-fit only in Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son and Kamphaeng Phet provinces, where the coefficient of determination is from 0.081 in Chiang Mai to 0.724 in Kamphaeng Phet. For Phichit province, the results show that the previous cases have no significance for predicting dengue incidences. The association of the cases is small in the first row and column of the pairwise plot.</p>
