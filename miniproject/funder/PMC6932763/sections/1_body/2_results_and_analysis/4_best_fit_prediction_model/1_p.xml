<p>Our prediction models for all 65 provinces have an average coefficient of determination of 0.6339 (95%CI: 0.57802, 0.6898), with a minimum of 0.026 at Sakon Nakhon and a maximum of 0.954 at Lampang. Our experimental results reveal that the highest-accuracy models for all 65 provinces are one of the GLM models. Moreover, the best models of most provinces (44 out of 65) are based on quasi-likelihood regression. The best models of 15 provinces are based on negative binomial regression and the best model of 6 provinces is based on Poisson regression. This finding suggests that best describe the relationship of weather variables and dengue data should not have distribution assumptions. In most provinces, the data is not normally distributed, since most models are based on quasi-likelihood, not negative binomial or Poisson regression, Both of which assume the normal distribution. In our study, time series analysis is inferior to GLM models in all provinces. This suggests that time series analysis may not be the best type of model to describe the relationships among weather variables and dengue incidences. Evidence for this inferiority can be found in Chiang Rai. From a previous study in Chiang Rai, Thailand [
 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the SARIMA method was used for constructing a prediction model. They did not report the coefficient of determination between the predicted cases and actual cases. From the Chiang Rai analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226945.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>, the Quasi-Likelihood prediction model matches the observed data better than the SARIMA prediction model. In fact, for Chiang Rai data, SARIMA has the least coefficient of determination between the predicted cases and actual cases among all 5 techniques used in this study. Since all the provincial-level best-fit prediction models are GLM, we can indicate how influential an independent variable is to dengue incidences from its statistical
