<p>The one-week-lag time variable in most provinces has a positive association with predicted dengue incidences. In time series analysis, we fitted the Autocorrelation functions (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (PACF). An in-depth PACF analysis of each province can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226945.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. From the results, 1-week-lag cases provide the highest correlation among all provinces. The best model that contains the 1-week-lag case variable reported a coefficient of determination of a minimum of 0.257 and a maximum of 0.954 (average of 0.6383, 95%CI: 0.57313 to 0.70355). However, in some provinces, the highest significant variables are not the 1-week-lag cases but the 2-week-lag cases (such as Ranong, Si Sa Ket, Chachoengsao, Trat, Pathum Thani, and Rayong) or 3-week-lag cases (such as Sukhothai and Prachin Buri). These results show that the effects of previous cases on dengue incidences can be for up to 3 weeks. Our results show that the PACF provide a strong possible number of lag times, from 1–4 weeks of lag time, which presents the highest relationship at a lag of one week. This indicates the significance of past cases associated with current cases as a serial relationship in Thailand. Our results show the strong relationship of the period of a small lag time, from one to three weeks. Our findings for the relationships of small lag time and dengue incidences agrees with the classic SIR model, which considers the small-time delay that causes the threshold for epidemic diseases. Our results also support the fact that mosquitoes, as a dengue disease carrier, could contain the initial dengue viral vector for 1–14 days. This is also known as the extrinsic incubation period. A period of one month presents over-critical dengue incidences by vertical transmission of dengue virus due to the rapid infection from adult to offspring mosquitoes. Dengue cases at the first lag time are a predictive factor for most of the best model predictions. Because the stability of the dengue virus is in endemic equilibrium depending on delay times, a delay time of from 7 to 14 days is taken as the incubation time for the infective virus to transform into an active viral disease. Thus, vector diseases could stay in the carriers through the next 1 or 2 weeks. The importance of previous cases is shown in the literature [
