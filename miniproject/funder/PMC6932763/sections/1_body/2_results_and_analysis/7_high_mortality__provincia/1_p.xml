<p>From the best-fit model of provinces with the highest dengue incidences in 2013, the most significant variable is the 1-week-lag case variable, except for Krabi province. The best predictive model for Krabi province does not include the previous case variables as we explained for the southern region. In provinces that have many patients, the most significant weather variables are the positive current-week minimum temperature and the 3-week-lag vaporization as shown in the model for Mae Hong Son province. There is an increase of dengue incidences when both the minimum temperature and the vaporization increase. In addition, the effects of wind direction are also significant. The model of Nakhon Phanom shows that the direction of the wind which passes through this region has a strong influence on the number of dengue incidences. The most frequent weather variable for the selected provinces is the 3-week-lag vaporization as shown in the model of Mae Hong Son province. Other frequent weather variables are the positive current-week minimum temperature and the 2-week-lag wind direction. The best-fit model in these selected provinces is quasi-likelihood regression which has coefficients of determination from 0.43 to 0.954 for Lampang (0.78625, 95%CI: 0.6747, 0.8978). Negative binomial regression is used in some provinces which yields coefficients determination from 0.51 for Songkhla to 0.909 for Mae Hong Son province (0.7855, 95%CI: 0.4333, 1.13768). Time series analysis is performed only in Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Bangkok. Chiang Rai has coefficients of determination from 0.081 to 0.277. The selected provinces were supported by previous studies [
