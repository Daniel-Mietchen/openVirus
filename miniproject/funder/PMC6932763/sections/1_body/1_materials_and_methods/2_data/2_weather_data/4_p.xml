<p>Our study also includes a one to three-week lag time for each variable. Hence, the total independent weather variables are 32 variables. The effects of a one to three-week lag time on dengue cases are also used to construct the models. Therefore, we use a total of 35 independent variables. Thailand consists of a total of 77 provinces. However, dengue and weather data were recorded for only 65 provinces. Due to this data limitation, our study was conducted on 65 provinces in Thailand.</p>
