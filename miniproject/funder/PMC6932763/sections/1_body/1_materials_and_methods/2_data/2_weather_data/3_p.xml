<p>We show the data used in this study in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226945.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226945.g007">7</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226945.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows the distribution of dengue cases throughout Thailand in February 2013 when the highest number of dengue cases occurred. The dengue cases were plotted on different base maps, i.e. a province boundary map, the geographical map, population density map, and plain map. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226945.g007">Fig 7</xref> shows correlations between dengue cases and weather variables for Bangkok from January 2001 to December 2014. Every variables including dengue cases (patients), time series (weeks), pressure (hPa), maximum temperature (degree Celsius), minimum temperature (degree Celsius), humidity (percent), precipitation (ml), vaporization (ml), wind direction (direction), and wind power (kmph), are plotted horizontally from column one to column ten, and vertically from row one to row ten. The distribution of these variable are shown at the diagonal. Each scatter plot shows the correlation of each local column variable and local row variable.
