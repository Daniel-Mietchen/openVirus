<p>The northern region of Thailand covers an area of 170,000 square kilometers. This region contains high mountains and various types of forests, including flat river basins. This area is separated into 17 provinces: Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Nan, Phrae, Payao, Mae Hong Son, Lampang, Lamphun, Uttaradit, Kamphaeng Phet, Tak, Nakhon Sawan, Phichit, Pitsanulok, Phetchabun, Sukhothai, and Uthai Thani. The general climate of the northern region consists of three seasons: summer season (March–May), rainy season (June–September), and winter season (October–February). Because the northern region is mostly on a plateau of 800–1200 square kilometers, the average temperature is approximately 25°C. Rainfall begins in June because of the southwest monsoons.
