<p>From the combination of the variables from 1–12 variables for each method, 77, 663, 266 models per method of GLM are created. We select from 1 to 9 variables because previous studies show that the best model usually uses 4 to 9 variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We construct a total of 15, 144, 337, 000 models in this study. Each province uses a total of 232, 989, 800 models. We first use a combination of from 1 to 9 variables. Because of a limitation of computer performance, the next 10 to 12 variables continuously use the Forward Selection method to test the next variables, for selecting the best model prediction. Adding the two models from time series analysis (SARIMA and ARIMA), there are 232, 989, 798 + 2 = 232, 989, 800 prediction models constructed per province. Hence, for all 65 provinces, we have constructed 232, 989, 800 × 65, which is 15, 144, 337, 000 models, in total, for Thailand.
