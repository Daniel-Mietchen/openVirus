<p>The computers that were used in this study have 2.2 GHz to 2.5 GHz CPUs. All models are created using R (programming language) version 3.4.3. We use 37 computers for calculating the models at the same time. It takes approximately 232, 989, 800/(120 × 60 × 60 × 24) = 22.472 days of computing time to construct all the models for a province. For all provinces of Thailand, it takes approximately 2 months to complete all experiments.</p>
