<p>The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Autoregressive (AR) includes all selected lag times, as possible. The moving average (MA) refers to the mean of the lag time and its error. Both models (AR and MA) are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future incidences. ARIMA models are properly applied in cases where the data show evidence of non-stationarity.</p>
