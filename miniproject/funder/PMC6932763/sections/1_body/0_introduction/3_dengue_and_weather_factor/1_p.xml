 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reports that temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity have potential effects on the transmission of dengue. In addition, the spatial-temporal patterns and social ecology also have an association with the severity of dengue transmission [
