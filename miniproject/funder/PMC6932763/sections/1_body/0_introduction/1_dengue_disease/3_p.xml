<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that during the last decade, there were approximately 390 million dengue incidences per year (284–528 million, 95% CI). About 25% of those incidences, or about 96 million people, had serious symptoms [

 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0226945.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed the global burden of dengue. The rate of incidences increased during 1990–2013, and most patients are adult. Unfortunately, there are no cures for dengue. Consequently, dengue is regarded as one of the top three deadly infectious diseases. Prevention is one of the best ways to fight the disease. In this work, we believe that understanding the relationships among the disease and other factors such as weather and the prediction of future dengue infections are appropriate methods for the prevention of dengue.
