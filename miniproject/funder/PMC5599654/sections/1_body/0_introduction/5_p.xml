<p id="Par6">The Comunidad Valenciana (CV) is the fourth largest region in Spain (~5 million inhabitants), representing &gt;10% of the total population. Genotypic tests of resistance to antiviral drugs are performed routinely for the design of individualized antiretroviral treatments. Here, we have analysed more than 1,800 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences obtained between 2004 and 2014 from different patients in the CV. We have used molecular phylogenetic analyses to complement HIV surveillance tasks of the Public Health Directorate of the CV Regional Government. Specifically, we have used this information to infer the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes, to analyse the introductions (and further local expansion) of this virus in the CV, to identify the emergence of new viral variants in this region, and also to analyse which risk groups are currently more vulnerable to HIV infection. The results obtained from this work may be useful in establishing and reinforcing preventive measures in specific target groups.
