<p id="Par17">Immigrants were disproportionally represented in the dataset (almost 1/3 of the patients were of non-Spanish origin), reflecting their higher vulnerability to HIV infection. Multinomial analyses evidenced the significant association between all non-B groups analysed and different foreign populations: Eastern Europe (subtypes A1, F1, CRf14_BG and the rare variants), Africa and the Middle East (subtypes F1, G, CRF02_AG and rare variants) and Latin America (rare variants). These associations were in agreement with the geographical distributions of these variants

 </sup>. These results, along with the fact that most non-B patients, either clustering or not, were of non-Spanish origin (CRF14_BG was the only exception) suggest that along the analysed time-span non-B HIV variants were not well established among Spanish locals in this region. This is exemplified by the fact that almost half of the non-B transmission clusters did not include any Spanish patient. Furthermore, non-B patients clustered in a significantly lower proportion than patients infected with subtype B, especially when considering clusters with at least 10 patients, thus displaying significantly lower local transmission efficiency. Previous molecular epidemiology studies of HIV-1 in Western Europe also reported non-B variants to be associated with the migrant population

 </sup>, mainly affecting HTs. In the Spanish region of Madrid, where non-B variants have been found with a prevalence of up to 37%
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>, more than 70% of non-B sequences were found to belong to non-Spanish patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Other works in different Western European countries have reported differences in the prevalence of non-B variants in the migrant population. Similarly to our results, in countries such as Switzerland (estimated prevalence of non-B HIV sequences = 21%
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>) or the Belgian-Luxemburg population (prevalence &gt;45%
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>) nearly 70% of non-B variants have been associated to patients of migrant origin
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. These results contrast with those from Portugal, the Western European country where subtype B displays the lowest prevalence
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. An study in the Portuguese region of Minho (close to the border with Spain) found non-B variants to have a prevalence of 73%, and only 10% of these sequences belonged to non-Portuguese patients
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, thus evidencing that non-B infections are already established among locals.
