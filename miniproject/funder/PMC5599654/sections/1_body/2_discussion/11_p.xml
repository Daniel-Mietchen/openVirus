<p id="Par25">In conclusion, our results provide evidence that the HIV-1 epidemic in the CV is dominated by subtype B, especially among local MSMs. Although there was an important number of non-B cases, they occurred mostly among immigrants. This suggests that non-B infections are not well established in the local population. However, the detection of transmission clusters of non-B variants associated to a higher pathogenicity and affecting Spanish patients, urges to increase efforts on HIV testing and prevention campaigns to prevent their further expansion.</p>
