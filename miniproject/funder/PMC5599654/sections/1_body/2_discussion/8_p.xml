<p id="Par22">We have found a significant, negative correlation between tree height and evolutionary rate estimates obtained when comparing the 12 largest clusters. Several publications have addressed this time-dependency on the evolutionary rate (TDRP), that is, virus lineages estimated to have a recent origin yield higher estimated evolutionary rates than older viruses

 </sup>. In our study the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is the overestimation of evolutionary rates in the most recent clusters, caused by the presence of deleterious mutations over which purifying selection has not had time to act. This phenomenon might be potentiated by the bottlenecks that occur at viral transmission, which might originate a transient accumulation of deleterious mutations. Consequently, these results suggest that TDRP is an important factor to consider in molecular epidemiology, even when datasets are obtained from the same population and at short timescales (in this case 10 years, from 2004 to 2014).
