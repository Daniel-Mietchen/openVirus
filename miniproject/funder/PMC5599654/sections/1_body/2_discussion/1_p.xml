<p id="Par15">We have studied the HIV epidemic in the Comunidad Valenciana by analysing, with molecular and evolutionary tools, 1804 sequences obtained between 2004 and 2014 from different patients. Our results indicate that the HIV epidemic in the CV is dominated by HIV-1 subtype B infections among local MSM.
