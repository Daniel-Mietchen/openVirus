 </sup>. Despite the prevalence of these CRFs remaining low in the CV, the effective expansion of these highly pathogenic HIV variants, evidenced by the detection of transmission clusters, is of especial interest because it may hamper the control of the local HIV epidemic, especially among vulnerable populations such as IDUs or MSMs.
