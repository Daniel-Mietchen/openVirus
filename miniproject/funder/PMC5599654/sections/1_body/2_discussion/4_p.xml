<p id="Par18">Although 11 of the 12 largest transmission clusters were of subtype B, one of the largest clusters found (n = 21, median tMRCA = 1990.6) corresponded to the CRF14_BG, and included a high number of IDUs from Spain. CRF14 has been associated to a predominance of CXCR4 tropism, which usually leads to faster AIDS onset
