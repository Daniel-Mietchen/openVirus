<p id="Par24">Additionally, although the identification or detection of transmission clusters is commonly based only on phylogenetic cluster support, it is also often based on criteria that combine phylogenetic support, usually high bootstrap values, with genetic distance (GD) thresholds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. In this work, we did not consider any GD threshold value as criterion to define transmission clusters. This is because the rationale for genetic distance cut-offs is rarely provided, with very different thresholds being reported in the literature
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>, and larger GD values are expected for older transmission events. In this way, choosing distance-based thresholds can lead to underestimating transmission clusters, especially those that span long time periods
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>, as it is the case of our dataset. Nevertheless, a great majority of GDs estimated from the pairwise comparisons performed here were lower than 0.045â€‰s/s. Thus, almost all the transmission clusters reported here would be characterized by both high phylogenetic support and low GD.
