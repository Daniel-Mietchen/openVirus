 </sup>, as well as the aforementioned examples of emergence of CRFs associated with migratory waves, suggest that high migration and tourism rates in some Spanish regions may contribute to the high genetic diversity of their HIV-1 epidemics. Thus, although our results suggest that non-B HIV groups are not well established in the local population, with only a few of them including patients of both Spanish and non-Spanish origin, this situation could change soon without intensified HIV prevention campaigns focused on vulnerable groups, including migrants, IDUs and MSM.
