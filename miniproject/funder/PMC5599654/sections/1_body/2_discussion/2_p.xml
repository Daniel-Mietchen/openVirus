<p id="Par16">Overall, the detection of transmission clusters demonstrates the importance of the domestic spread of HIV-1 in the CV. Most patients from the whole dataset (&gt;57%) were included in local transmission clusters, of sizes ranging from 2 to 111 individuals. Local transmission was especially important among MSM, who were more likely to be included in a transmission cluster, as well as for Spanish natives, than other risk groups. Considering the 12 largest clusters (size ≥10 patients), this transmission risk was the most frequent in 9 of them. Excluding transmission cluster A (MSM, tMRCA = 1984.7), MSM clusters were of more recent origin as estimated using Bayesian coalescent analyses, especially clusters B (n = 13), E (n = 18), H (n = 19) and L (n = 111), which originated after year 2000.

 </sup> detected lower proportions of clustering patients (18 and 27% of their analysed sequences, respectively). These results suggest that the importance of local transmissions may not be the same in different Spanish regions. In addition, they also found evidences for an increased vulnerability to HIV of the Spanish MSM community in recent years. A more detailed analysis of cluster L is provided elsewhere
