<p id="Par13">Multinomial analyses were performed using a subset of 906 patients for whom there was information for all the variables considered: sex, risk group, country of origin, clustering status and age. We considered as baseline the most frequent category for each variable (subtype B, Spaniard, male, MSM, age between 21 and 29 years and not clustering), and a significant model was obtained (McFadden R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.32, Chi
 <sup>2</sup> = 421.34, p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16)</sup>). We checked that this subset was representative of the global set (n = 1804) by means of FETs. The p-values obtained for all the analysed variants were &gt;0.05, including the distribution of patients from the different cluster-size categories (no cluster, small cluster, medium cluster and large cluster) that would result if only sequences included in the multinomial analysis had been taken into account for cluster detection, (FET: P &gt; 0.10; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). This dataset was also genetically representative of the whole dataset (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S13</xref>). The multivariate model shows that the chances of being infected with all non-B groups increased in foreign patients, coming from Eastern Europe (A1, F1, 14_BG and the pooled, rare, variants), Africa and the Middle East (F1, G, 02_AG and the rare variants) and Latin America (rare variants), with all p-values &lt; 0.01, all ORs &gt;3.0. The likelihood of being infected with CRF14_BG also increased in patients older than 50 years (p-value = 0.029, OR = 36.2, 95% CI = 1.45–904.0), in IDUs (p-value = 9.44 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, OR = 257, 95% CI = 15.8–4160) and in those patients forming large transmission clusters (p-value = 1.6 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, OR = 36.9, 95% CI = 5.67–240) (Table
