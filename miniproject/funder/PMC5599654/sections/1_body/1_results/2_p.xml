<p id="Par8">Phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of 270 transmission clusters, with sizes ranging from 2 to 111 patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). In total, 1039 patients from the dataset were included in a transmission cluster (57.5%), with 302 patients (16.7%) included in large clusters of 10 or more patients (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). Among the 892 patients clustering in transmission groups of subtype B, 407 (45.6%) were MSM, 56 (6.3%) HTs, 38 (4.2%) IDUs and 391 (43.8%) of unknown transmission route. On the other hand, of the 147 patients clustering in non-B clusters 29 (19.7%) were HTs, 29 (19.7%) MSM, 15 (10.2%) IDUs and (50.3%) 74 of unknown transmission route (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Among the transmission clusters that could be classified by the most frequent risk of transmission (≥50%) for the CV patients included in them, the most prevalent transmission clusters of subtype B were those classified as MSM (n = 99/219, 45.2%), followed by IDUs (n = 18/219, 8.2%) and HTs (n = 15/219, 6.8%). However, for non-B transmission clusters, ﻿thos﻿e of HTs were the most frequent ones (n = 16/51, 31.4%), followed by MSM (n = 14/51, 27.5%) and IDUs (n = 1/51, 2.0%). 87 of the 219 (39.7%) subtype B clusters and 20 of 51 (39.2%) non-B clusters could not be classified based on a majority risk of transmission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Subtype B sequences were more likely to be part of a transmission cluster than non-B sequences (FET: p-value = 0.007, OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.09–1.84). Also, MSM were more likely to be part of a transmission cluster than other risk groups (FET: p-value = 1.68 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23–1.99).
