<p id="Par7">Of the 1804 sequences analysed, 1512 (83.8%) belonged to subtype B. Among the 292 non-B sequences, the most prevalent HIV-1 variant was CRF02_AG (n = 66, overall prevalence = 3.7%), followed by subtypes A1, F1 (both n = 34, 1.9%), CRF14_BG (n = 28, 1.6%) and subtype G (n = 20, 1.1%). Other variants (n = 110) were present with a prevalence lower than 1.0%. Considering those patients for whom epidemiological information was available, 83.04% (930/1120) were male vs 16.96% (190/1120) female; 67.12% (637/949) were native from Spain (determined by place of birth) vs 32.87% (312/949) immigrants or of foreign origin; 66.84% (637/953) were MSM, 21.41% (204/953) heterosexual (HT) and 11.54% (110/953) IDUs. One patient was infected vertically and other one was haemophiliac. The mean age was 34.82 years (range 0 to 76) (Table
