<p id="Par11">A total of 88 subtype B, and 9 non-B transmission clusters did not include patients of foreign origin. These subtype B clusters included 178 Spanish patients and 122 of unknown origin, and the non-B clusters included 13 Spanish patients and 14 of unknown origin. A total of 49 subtype B, and 7 non-B transmission clusters were formed by both Spanish and non-Spanish patients. Altogether, these mixed subtype B clusters included 200 Spanish, 87 non-Spanish (mostly from Latin America) and 113 of unknown origin, and the mixed non-B clusters included 18 Spanish, 10 non-Spanish (mostly from Latin America or Eastern Europe) and 13 of unknown origin. All large transmission clusters but one (cluster G, for which there was not information available in 17 of its 19 patients) presented this characteristic. Finally, a total of 16 subtype B and 25 non-B transmission clusters included only patients of foreign origin. These subtype B clusters included 27 foreign patients (mostly from Latin America) and 16 of unknown origin, and the non-B clusters included 37 foreign patients (mostly from Africa/Middle East and Latin America) and 20 of unknown origin (Supplementary TableÂ
