<p id="Par14">Pairwise genetic distances (GD) between individuals from a given transmission cluster ranged between 0.00 substitutions/site (s/s), in clusters of sizes of 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 15, 16, 18 and 111 individuals, and 0.073 s/s, in a cluster of 6 individuals. For most pairwise comparisons, GD was lower than 0.045 s/s, regardless the size of the transmission cluster (Fig.
