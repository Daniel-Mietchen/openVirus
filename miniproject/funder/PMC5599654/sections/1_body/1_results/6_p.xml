<p id="Par12">In addition to the patients’ origin, other variables considered for the multinomial analysis presented differences between subtypes. So, subtype B sequences were disproportionally more present in males compared to females (FET: p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>, OR = 4.75, 95% CI = 3.29–6.86), in MSM with respect to HTs and IDUs (p-value &lt; 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−16</sup>, OR = 7.4, 95% CI = 4.87–11.31 and p-value = 2 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, OR = 3.37, 95% CI = 1.90–5.89, respectively), and in IDUs compared to HTs (p-value = 0.0038, OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.26–3.88). There were also differences between subtypes with respect to age distribution (Kruskal-Wallis test: P = 0.0013, Chi
 <sup>2</sup> = 21.8, df = 6), with CRF02_AG patients being significantly younger than B patients (Games-Howell post-hoc test result for this comparison: p = 0.001, t = 4.37, df = 58). Given that no significant differences were found between subtypes in the distribution of collection dates (P &gt; 0.70), this variable was excluded from the multinomial analysis.
