<p id="Par9">Twelve large transmission clusters, which included at least 10 patients from the CV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), were detected: 11 were from subtype B and included a total of 281 patients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). One cluster of 21 patients corresponded to CRF14_BG (Cluster K, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Patients infected with subtype B were more likely to form large transmission clusters than those infected with non-B variants (FET: p-value = 3.4 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>, OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.84–4.92). Nine of the large clusters were classified as MSM; the other three included mostly IDUs, although in a proportion lower than 50% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Dated phylogenies of these clusters (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> to 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>) revealed that they originated between 1984 (cluster G, unclassified transmission route) and 2005 (cluster B, MSM). Only transmission clusters that included MSM as the main transmission risk were originated since 2000 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> to 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Bagplots (bivariate representations of boxplots

 </sup>) representing tree height (the time elapsed between tMRCA and the sampling date of the last sequence) and evolutionary rate estimates from the posterior distribution of each large cluster are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. A significant, negative correlation between median tree height and substitution rate estimates of these large clusters was obtained (R = −0.70, p-value = 0.013).
