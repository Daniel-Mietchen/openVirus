<p id="Par30">A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify the main predictors of HIV-1 subtype/CRF group distribution, considering relevant epidemiologic variables: country of origin, sex, risk group, collection date, age and clustering status. Due to the lack of epidemiological data for many sequences from the dataset, only 906 of the 1804 sequences were included in this analysis. Seven groups of different HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs were used: A1 (n = 14), B (n = 752), F1 (n = 13), G (n = 11), 02_AG (n = 42) and 14_BG (n = 15). All HIV-1 variants with fewer than 10 patients sampled were pooled as “Other variants” (n = 59). Prior to the multinomial analysis, univariate analyses (Fisher’s Exact Tests) were performed for the aforementioned variables, in order to exclude from the multinomial analysis those with non-significant p-values. Only the variable “collection date” (p-value &gt; 0.70) was excluded. In the multinomial analysis, the most representative category of each variable was used as “baseline category” (Subtype B, Spaniard, male, MSM, age between 21 and 29 years and not clustering; Supplementary Table
