 </sup>. Briefly, in the first step, we obtained independent phylogenetic trees for each HIV-1 subtype and CRF detected, which included reference sequences retrieved from the Los Alamos HIV database spanning the analysed PR/RT region (n = 1787 subtype B, 2097 A1, 720 F1, 854 G + CRF14_BG and 2157 CRF02_AG, as well as 5720 sequences from all the HIV-1 subtypes/CRFs that were rare in the CV dataset). The initial trees were reconstructed with FastTree 2.1 in order to detect potential transmission clusters, defined as clades with SH-like support ≥0.70, and containing ≥90% sequences from the CV dataset
