Human-mosquito transmission cycles maintain DENV during epidemics but questions remain regarding how these viruses survive when human infections and vector abundance are minimal. <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes can transmit DENV within the vector population through two alternate routes: vertical and venereal transmission (VT and VNT, respectively). We tested the efficiency of VT and VNT in a genetically diverse laboratory (GDLS) strain of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> orally infected with DENV2 (Jamaica 1409). We examined F1 larvae from infected females generated during the first and second gonotrophic cycles (E1 and E2) for viral envelope (E) antigen by amplifying virus in C6/36 cells and then performing an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). RT-PCR/nested PCR analyses confirmed DENV2 RNA in samples positive by IFA. We observed VT of virus to larvae and adult male progeny and VNT of virus to uninfected virgin females after mating with males that had acquired virus by the VT route. We detected no DENV2 in 30 pools (20 larvae/pool) of F1 larvae following the first gonotrophic cycle, suggesting limited virus dissemination at 7 days post-infection. DENV2 was detected by IFA in 27 of 49 (55%) and 35 of 51 (68.6%) F1 larval pools (20 larvae/pool) from infected E2 females that received a second blood meal without virus at 10 or 21 days post-infection (E2-10d-F1 and E2-21-F1), respectively. The minimum filial infection rates by IFA for E2-10d-F1 and E2-21d-F1 mosquitoes were 1:36 and 1:29, respectively. The VNT rate from E2-10d-F1 males to virgin (uninfected) GDLS females was 31.6% (118 of 374) at 8 days post mating. Twenty one percent of VNT-infected females receiving a blood meal prior to mating had disseminated virus in their heads, suggesting a potential pathway for virus to re-enter the human-mosquito transmission cycle. This is the first report of VNT of DENV by male <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and the first demonstration of sexual transmission in <italic>Aedes</italic> by naturally infected males. Our results demonstrate the potential for VT and VNT of DENV in nature as mechanisms for virus maintenance during inter-epidemic periods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue viruses (DENV) and other medically important arthropod-borne viruses (yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya). DENVs replicate in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and humans in a transmission cycle that maintains the virus in nature. However, adverse conditions (i.e. dry seasons and low temperatures, vector populations, and host susceptibility) can suppress the transmission cycle. How does the virus survive in nature when the mosquito-human epidemic cycle subsides? Alternative DENV transmission routes can allow the virus to remain in the vector population. DENV can vertically transmit from mother to offspring and venereally transmit from infected male offspring to females during mating. In this report, we show that DENV2 efficiently pass from one generation to the next after the infected female mosquito acquires a second blood meal. Furthermore, infected male progeny arising from vertical transmission can then infect females during mating. Vertical transmission of DENV2, possibly in combination with venereal transmission, can potentially maintain DENV2 for sufficient time for the vector-human transmission cycle to resume.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI095491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2143-2051</contrib-id><name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>Laura C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Regents of the University of California from the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health through the Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative.</institution></funding-source><award-id>Not applicable</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3135-4878</contrib-id><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Ken E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This project was supported by the following grants: NIH/NIAID-R01AI095491 (LCH), Cornell Affinito Stewart Sabbatical Grant (LCH), and the Regents of the University of California through The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and Grand Challenges in Global Health Initiative (KEO, WCB, ISV, JBD).

DENV are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted between susceptible humans by the bite of infected <italic>Aedes spp</italic>. DENV and their mosquito vectors are present throughout the tropics causing an estimated 390 million human infections per year [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DEN disease outbreaks in Florida and Hawaii have heightened awareness and concern of DENV transmission in the USA [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is the most important mosquito vector during large DENV outbreaks in tropical and subtropical urban regions [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DENV epidemics occur when mosquitoes and susceptible humans are sufficiently plentiful to maintain the vector-human transmission cycle. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> take multiple blood-meals during each gonotrophic cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ingestion of multiple uninfected blood feedings boost a previous incipient infection, enhancing virus dissemination to secondary tissues and transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This effect was also observed for Zika virus (ZIKV) in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Vertical transmission (VT) from one generation to the next and venereal transmission (VNT) during mosquito mating are mechanisms of DENV transmission within <italic>Aedes</italic> populations [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The potential impact of VT and VNT in sustaining DENV in the vector population remains unclear. Given the large public health consequences of DENV infections globally, a determination of the role VT and VNT plays in DENV maintenance in mosquito populations could lead to a more complete understanding of DENV persistence in nature and new insights into DENV transmission dynamics.</p><p>VT of arboviruses occurs by either transovarial transmission (TOT), in which the virus infects germinal tissues of the female (including oocytes) [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and by trans-ovum transmission, which occurs at the time of fertilization or by virus contamination of the egg surface during oviposition [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. VT mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In this report, we define VT rate (VTR) as the number of infected females in a population that produce at least one infected offspring. The filial infection rate (FIR) is the proportion of infected progeny produced from infected parents, given that VT has occurred. The minimum filial infection rate (MFIR) is the total number of positive mosquito pools divided by total mosquitoes and the effective VTR (eVTR) is the average number of infected progeny per infected female (VTR multiplied by the FIR) [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p><italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> typically become infected when the female ingests a blood meal from a viremic human. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females lay their eggs within days of acquiring a blood meal. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> embryos can become dormant at the end of embryogenesis and remain viable inside the egg for up to six months [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. When conditions become favorable for larval development, dormancy is interrupted and the eggs hatch to larvae [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Flaviviruses that persist in eggs can be transmitted transstadially from larvae to pupae to adults [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Infected females potentially generate hundreds of eggs in their lifetime providing opportunities for VT and VNT within the vector population.</p><p>In early studies, Rosen detected minimal VT of DENV among <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but more recent reports have provided consistent evidence of VT in field-collected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], although significant variations in the frequency of VT have been noted among strains of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with different DENV serotypes and genotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. DENV have been detected in field-collected larvae [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and field caught adult male mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The detection of DENV infected male mosquitoes suggests that males could play a role in the maintenance of DENV in nature [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Few studies have addressed the role of male mosquitoes in DENV transmission dynamics and only one study focused on VNT of DENV in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] by determining VNT by males that were artificially injected with virus. In this context, we tested VT and VNT of DENV2 in a genetically diverse laboratory strain (GDLS) of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> derived from mosquito populations collected in Chiapas, Mexico [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initially, we investigated whether VT in GDLS was more efficient in the first or second gonotrophic cycle (E1 and E2). We clearly observed that orally infected GDLS mosquitoes vertically transmitted DENV2 to their F1 progeny during the second gonotrophic cycle (E2) and VT increased if a second blood meal was given 10 or 21 days post infection. Significantly, the MFIR determined by either RT-semi-nested-PCR (RT-N-PCR) or IFA was 8&#x02013;10 fold higher than previously reported for flaviviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We detected DENV2 in ovarian tissues and oocytes of infected females suggesting VT can occur by TOT. The present study also demonstrated that males acquiring DENV2 by the VT route were capable of transmitting the virus to un-infected virgin GDLS females during mating. Our results suggest that VT and VNT of DENV in mosquito populations are potential mechanisms for virus maintenance during inter-epidemic periods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Virus and cell cultures</title><p>LLC-MK2 and C6/36 (<italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>) cells were cultured in modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (MEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 28&#x000b0;C, 5%CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.

The infection rates in the reproductive tract of males were determined (RT-N-PCR and IFA) before mating by randomly sampling 20 mosquitoes at 12 dpi. DENV2 E antigen was detected in the testes and peripheral tissue of the accessory glands in 100% of the injected mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These results were similar to those reported in ultrastructural studies of intrathoracically infected male mosquitoes in which DENV2 was detected in the testes, seminal vesicle and accessory glands [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, no virus was found in the germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatid, spermatozoa). The mechanism of sexual transmission of DENV2 from infected male to female mosquitoes remains unclear. Once DENV2 was confirmed within reproductive tract of males, the remaining mosquitoes were allowed to mate following the same protocol previously described. Female reproductive tracts were collected 8 d after mating and infection rates were determined with RT-N-PCR and IFA. Forty three percent (12/28) of females were positive for DENV2 by IFA. VNT rates for females receiving a BMnV prior to mating and those receiving no BMnV were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.20).

We did not test experimental transmission of the virus in saliva, but we did detect the presence of virus in the head of female mosquitoes that had acquired virus by VNT. Twenty one percent (8 of 38) females receiving a BMnV prior to mating had DENV2 in their heads and 18.8% (6 of 32) of the non-BMnV female heads were positive (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test P = 1.00). These data suggest that VNT-infections may disseminate to female salivary glands, but further work is required to show transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Discussion</title><p>Arboviruses are maintained by horizontal transmission (HT) between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts in nature. Arboviruses potentially can be transmitted vertically in the vector population from mother to offspring, which is a possible maintenance mechanism during adverse conditions for HT. Dry seasons in tropical areas, cold seasons in temperate regions, or insecticide spraying campaigns can drastically reduce vector density and thus opportunities for HT [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, arbovirus infections in vertebrates usually result in long-lasting protective immunity so that high levels of herd immunity will minimize HT following epidemics. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the maintenance of arboviruses during inter-epidemic periods and include virus re-introduction and amplification of the virus in unknown host species (i.e., reservoirs) [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. VT and VNT are alternate transmission mechanisms DENVs might use to maintain themselves in a vector population independent of feeding on viremic humans [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although male mosquitoes are not hematophagous, they can acquire virus by VT from an infected female parent. In experimental studies, <italic>Aedes</italic> male mosquitoes infected by virus injection into the hemoceol transmitted virus to non-infected adult females during mating leading to infected F1 progeny [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. VNT of arboviruses by male mosquitoes has been demonstrated in mosquito vectors of bunyaviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], alphaviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], flaviviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and rhabdoviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].<sup>.</sup> VNT has been observed in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> by intrathoracically injecting males with DENV1 prior to mating [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, no previous studies have reported VNT by male progeny of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females that were naturally infected (<italic>per os</italic>) with DENV. A relatively small number of stably infected females could maintain virus prevalence at a constant level if germarium infection occurred, assuming that any detrimental effects of the infection (e.g., longevity, fecundity, and development) are balanced by horizontal transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Stabilized infections with California encephalitis serogroup viruses (<italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>: <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>) have been demonstrated in several <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].</p><p>Our studies show that DENV2 infection of GDLS <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes can persist by VT and VNT. The infection rates obtained with orally infected females indicate that GDLS mosquitoes are highly susceptible to DENV2. GDLS show an increased DENV2 titer when mosquitoes take a second BMnV.</p><p>This study used two techniques to show DENV2 VT in GDLS <italic>Ae</italic>.<italic>aegypti</italic>: 1) RT-N-PCR for amplification of viral RNA and 2) IFA detection of DENV2 antigen. Infectious DENV demonstrated by IFA in mosquito C6/36 cells exposed to mosquito tissue homogenates. The latter assay is considered the gold standard of evidence for VT. Although PCR-based assays are rapid and have higher sensitivity than virus isolation, they are prone to contamination or amplification of virus sequence incorporated into the mosquito genome. Consequently, resulting data should be interpreted cautiously and outcomes confirmed by virus isolation or IFA. In this report, we used RT-N-PCR assays to confirm IFA results for the presence DENV2.</p><p>Most previous studies demonstrated VT after intrathoracic injection of the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The observed VTR in the GDLS strain could be due to a higher efficiency of initially infecting GDLS females with artificial blood meals containing biologically relevant virus titers. In our study, we initially infected mosquitoes via a blood meal and DENV2 VT was analyzed after the second gonotrophic cycle (E2-7d, E2-10d, and E2-21d). E2-F1 mosquitoes were analyzed as a counter-weight to previous studies that showed little to no VT occurring after the first oviposition cycle. Lack of VT from E1 females to F1 progeny could be due to poor virus dissemination to reproductive tissues before the first egg batch is produced and laid, and/or decreased permeability of virus to nulliparous ovaries during oogenesis [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These findings were consistent with earlier reports for other flaviviruses (Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), which showed infected female mosquitoes vertically transmit virus after the second oviposition cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>VTR were higher when infected females received a second BMnV at 10 or 21 dpi. However, a significant difference in VTR was observed even when infected females received a second BMnV at 7 dpi (E2-7d). These observations were similar to reports for La Crosse virus [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and WNV [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] where VT occurred only during the second or later ovarian cycles. Previous VT studies conducted with YFV and DENV1 reported that the VT actually decreased with successive ovarian cycle of infected mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, Diallo et al. reported that females vertically transmitted DENVs during second and third ovarian cycles, with the rates being highest in the third cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As previously stated, VT is probably rare in the first ovarian cycle probably because eggs are oviposited 3&#x02013;8 days post infection before the virus disseminates to the reproductive tract. Delayed oviposition by <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> females of 11&#x02013;14 dpi and 25 dpi resulted in VT of St. Louis encephalitis virus during the first ovarian cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In support, we observed DENV2 in the ovaries, oviducts and oocytes of E1 females only at later times post-infection (17 dpi).</p><p>Rearing temperatures, passage level of virus, viral strain and mosquito strain/species have all been reported to influence the efficiency of VT of flaviviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our study, we used DENV2 JAM1409, a viral strain that is not a natural match to the geographic origin of our mosquitoes and passaged in cell culture multiple times. Future studies of VT and VNT should explore closer geographic matches of low generation mosquito and viral strains.</p><p>Overall, <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes display higher VTR than <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs are generally more resistant to desiccation than <italic>Culex</italic> eggs [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], which may confer a selective advantage to vertically transmitted viruses. In addition, <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes had higher VTRs in arid climatic conditions compared to equatorial or warm temperate climatic conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This supports the hypothesis that VT could be a maintenance mechanism when conditions are adverse for HT, in agreement with earlier observations [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].

Detection of VT in nature is rare, due primarily to the low frequency of adult <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females infected with DENV. However, the occurrence of VT in nature has been documented by detection of DENVs in adult males [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recently others have reported VT of ZIKV in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. They evaluated VT in larval pools of perorally infected <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> adult female mosquitoes or in adults mosquitoes intrathoracically injected with ZIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although VTR in those experimental studies were low, the efficiency may be sufficient to allow ZIKV (and other flaviviruses) to persist within the vector population in eggs during hot dry periods or cold weather, when adult vectors are absent or in low numbers.</p><p>A mathematical model that investigated parameters conditioning natural transmission and persistence of DENVs suggested that observed VTR in field settings are insufficient to maintain the virus in nature [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The modeling further suggested that the eVTR must be at least 20&#x02013;30% to allow virus maintenance in nature in the absence of human-mediated amplification of DENVs. In our studies, MFIR from E2-10d mothers was 1:36 by IFA and RT-N-PCR, values substantially higher than reported for ZIKV (1:290;[<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), and YFV (1:596;[<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). The eVTR for E2-10d-F1 adult, infected mosquitos was 14&#x02013;15% (<xref rid="pntd.0006754.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), reflecting VT efficiencies that approach those suggested in the mathematical modeling study for DENV maintenance in nature [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Experimental studies of flavivirus VT in mosquitoes have variable results and indicate multiple factors can affect the frequency of VT and FIRs. These factors include mosquito species and geographic strain, mosquito age and mortality rate, virus genotype, persistence of virus during transstadial transitions, virus assay method, larval rearing temperature, interval between initial infection and second blood meal, and the ovarian cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. These factors could certainly lower the eVTR of <italic>Ae</italic>.<italic>aegypti</italic> in nature and their contributions to eVTR in a given vector population should be further studied. Nevertheless <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> biology and virus-vector interactions may enhance their eVTR. These positive factors include the mosquito&#x02019;s acquisition of blood meals every few days and their demonstrated ability to go through multiple ovarian cycles. DENV maintenance in the vector population could be enhanced further by virus persistence in diapaused embryoes, DENV infection of oocytes and ovaries after the females acquire additional bloodmeals, and the relative efficiency of VNT. We hypothesize these attributes may counter the negative factors and allow the virus to persist in the vector population from one season to the next.</p><p>Overall, VT of DENVs in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> may be underestimated as a potential force driving the epidemiology of DENV infection. It is possible that infected males could maintain the virus at a low threshold without causing outbreaks in human populations, and initiate new infections by VT and VNT within the vector population [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We did not observe any significant differences in the efficiency of VNT between mosquitos fed (BMnV) and not fed prior to mating as previously reported in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We did not observe any difference in DIR in heads of fed versus non-fed mosquitoes.
