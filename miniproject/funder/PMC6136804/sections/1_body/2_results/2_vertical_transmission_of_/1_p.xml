<p>We tested whether VT in GDLS was more efficient in the first or second gonotrophic cycle and if VT efficiency depended on the interplay between gonotrophic cycle and viral infection dynamics. Following oviposition, we collected eggs from each female. We then determined the infection status of all mothers but used only the eggs of virus positive females. The progeny were designated E1-F1 (

Eggs from the second cycle were collected and designated E2-7d-F1, E2-10d-F1 and E2-21d-F1 depending on the timing of the BMnV (
