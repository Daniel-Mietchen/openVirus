<p>DENV2 was not detected by IFA in 30 pools of larvae analyzed from the E1 progeny (infection rate = 0; 95% CI = 0.0â€“6.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). IFA readily detected VT of DENV2 in GDLS E2 progeny. For E2-7d mosquitoes, 23 of 119 (19.3%) pools were positive for DENV2. VTR increased when infected females received a second BMnV at 10 or 21 dpi with 55% (27 of 49) of larvae pools positive for E2-10d and 68.6% (35 of 51) positive for E2-21d. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in DENV2 positivity between pools of E2-10d and E2-21d (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.22) larvae. A significant difference was observed between VT of E2-7d and E2-10d and between E2-7d and E2-21d (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001). The VTR and MFIR from larvae pools detected by RT-N-PCR were similar to results obtained by IFA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The sequence of the amplicon confirmed that the DENV2 strain detected in E2-F1 larvae was the same as the one used to infect the parental female.
