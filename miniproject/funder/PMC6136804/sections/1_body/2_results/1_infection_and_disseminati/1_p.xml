<p>Since vector competence among 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations varies according to the infecting DENV serotype and genotype and the genotype of mosquitoes, we initially evaluated the competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (GDLS) strain for DENV2-JAM1409. Vector competence was analyzed by offering mosquitoes a blood meal containing 1×10
 <sup>6</sup> to 4 ×10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL DENV2-JAM1409. We selected and assayed engorged mosquitoes for DENV2 at 7, 10, and 17 days post-infection (dpi) by plaque assay. The prevalence of DENV2 in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (GDLS) was calculated as the proportion of mosquitoes infected among total mosquitoes receiving an infectious blood meal. The prevalence of DENV2 in GDLS females was approximately 65% (viral titers: 2 +/- 0.72 ×10
 <sup>3</sup>, 7 +/- 1.3 ×10
 <sup>3</sup> and 1.1 +/- 0.25 ×10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mL (per mosquito) at 7, 10 and 17 dpi, respectively (

Midgut infection rates (MIR) and disseminated infection rates (DIR) were determined by detection of DENV-2 E antigen in midgut and head tissues (sampled pairwise) at 14 and 17 dpi. MIRs were 78.3% (18/23), 76.7% (23/30) and 75.7% (25/33) at 7, 14 and 17 dpi, respectively and DIRs were 63.3% (19/30) at 14 dpi and 81.8% (27/33) at 17dpi. DIRs were not calculated for the 7-day time point due to our previous studies that showed minimal dissemination at that time [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The MIRs and DIRs indicated that GDLS mosquitoes were highly susceptible and competent for DENV2-JAM1409.
