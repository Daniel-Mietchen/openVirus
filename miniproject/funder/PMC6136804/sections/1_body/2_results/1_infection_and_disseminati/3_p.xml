<p>With this in mind, we tested the presence of the virus in the ovaries in DENV2 infected female mosquitoes. After the first oviposition cycle, females were separated into two groups. Group I females did not receive a second BMnV, Group II females were offered a second BMnV at 10 dpi and allowed to oviposit autogenously produced eggs. At 17 dpi, ovaries from both groups were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy, Hatfield, PA) for at least 4 h. DENV2 E antigen was detected using IFA with 3H5 mAb as previously described [
