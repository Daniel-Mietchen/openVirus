The DENV2 titers at 17 dpi were significantly higher in GDLS females receiving a second BMnV at 10 dpi than GDLS females receiving a single, infectious blood meal (T test,

These observations may be linked to increased dissemination to the ovaries over time and it has been postulated that expanded parous ovaries, with stretched and squeezed follicular epithelial cells facilitate higher viral infection rates of oocytes, contributing to increased VT in subsequent cycles [
