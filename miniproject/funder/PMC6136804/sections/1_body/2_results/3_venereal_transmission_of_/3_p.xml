<p>We tested whether enhancement of VNT of DENV2 occurred if an uninfected female had a blood meal prior to mating and used the method outlined in

It also has been reported that uninfected female mosquitoes that were given blood meals 3–4 days prior to mating were more likely to develop systemic infections after mating with infected males than females that had never received a blood meal [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. VT infected male mosquitoes (GDLS) were mated to either unfed, non-infected, virgin GDLS females or GDLS females that had received a BMnV three days prior to mating. After mating, the males were separated and infection rates of their reproductive tracts determined 8 days later by IFA. The infection rate of the males was 28.7% (140/488). We mated all F1 males with females but only the females that mated with DENV2 positive males were used to determine VNT rate. Female reproductive tracts were collected and infection rates determined by IFA and RT-N-PCR. The VNT rate was 31.6% (118 of 374) in blood fed females and 31.7% (102 of 322) in non-blood fed females. Data were analyzed as a single experiment since VNT rates among three replicates were not significantly different (blood fed,

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). VNT to blood fed and non-blood fed GDLS females were not significantly different (χ2&lt; 0.001, df = 1,
