<p>Additional VNT data were obtained using uninfected virgin males that had been intrathoracically inoculated with DENV2-JAM1409 (100 pfu) 14 days prior to mating. The infection rates in the reproductive tract of males were determined (RT-N-PCR and IFA) before mating by randomly sampling 20 mosquitoes at 12 dpi. DENV2 E antigen was detected in the testes and peripheral tissue of the accessory glands in 100% of the injected mosquitoes (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, no virus was found in the germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatid, spermatozoa). The mechanism of sexual transmission of DENV2 from infected male to female mosquitoes remains unclear. Once DENV2 was confirmed within reproductive tract of males, the remaining mosquitoes were allowed to mate following the same protocol previously described. Female reproductive tracts were collected 8 d after mating and infection rates were determined with RT-N-PCR and IFA. Forty three percent (12/28) of females were positive for DENV2 by IFA. VNT rates for females receiving a BMnV prior to mating and those receiving no BMnV were not significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.20). The VNT rate was slightly higher using the inoculated males although not significantly different from VNT rates using males that had acquired their infection by the VT route and regardless of the mates BMnV feeding status (bloodfed, P = 0.216; non-bloodfed P = 0.154). The data demonstrate that DENV2 vertically or artificially infected males were capable of transmitting virus efficiently to females during mating.
