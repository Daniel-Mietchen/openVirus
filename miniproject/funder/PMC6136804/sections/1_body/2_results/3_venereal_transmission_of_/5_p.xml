<p>To determine if virus acquired by VNT could disseminate, we tested heads of BMnV and non-BMnV females by RT-N-PCR. We did not test experimental transmission of the virus in saliva, but we did detect the presence of virus in the head of female mosquitoes that had acquired virus by VNT. Twenty one percent (8 of 38) females receiving a BMnV prior to mating had DENV2 in their heads and 18.8% (6 of 32) of the non-BMnV female heads were positive (Fisherâ€™s exact test P = 1.00). These data suggest that VNT-infections may disseminate to female salivary glands, but further work is required to show transmission.</p>
