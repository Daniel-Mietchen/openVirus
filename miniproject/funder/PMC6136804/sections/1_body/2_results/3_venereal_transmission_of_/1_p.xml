<p>Since we observed that GDLS mosquitoes infected with DENV2 vertically transmitted virus to larvae, we determined if F1 adult males were infected and if infected could, in turn, venereally transmit virus to virgin females. We tested virgin F1 male progeny arising from infected mothers to quantify FIR, VTR and VNT. GDLS females were given a blood meal containing &gt;10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/mL of DENV2 JAM1409 and a 2
 <sup>nd</sup> BMnV at 10 dpi. Mean DENV2 titers for infected mothers were 2.3 ± 6.5 ×10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/ml in replicate1 (R1), 9 ± 4.9 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/ml in replicate 2 (R2) and 8.3 ± 1.3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/ml in replicate 3 (R3). E2 eggs from individual females positive for DENV2 were hatched to rear F1 adults. One 6-day-old male progeny (E2-10d-F1) mated with two uninfected, unfed, virgin females or virgin females that received a BMnV 3 days prior to mating. After mating, the male reproductive tracts (testes, seminal vesicle and accessory glands) from E2-10d-F1 were screened by IFA for DENV2 E antigen. We detected viral antigen in the testes and peripheral tissue of the accessory glands (
