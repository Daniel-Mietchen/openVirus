<p>No significant correlation was detected between DENV2 titer from the female parent and the proportion of progeny that were positive for virus among the replicates (Pearson correlation, r = 0.049,

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.176; r = 0.013,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006754.g005">Fig 5</xref>). DENV2 was not detected in E2-10d progeny from uninfected females. These results confirm VT to male progeny and suggest the potential for VNT of DENV2 from males to females during mating.
