<p>Rearing temperatures, passage level of virus, viral strain and mosquito strain/species have all been reported to influence the efficiency of VT of flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our study, we used DENV2 JAM1409, a viral strain that is not a natural match to the geographic origin of our mosquitoes and passaged in cell culture multiple times. Future studies of VT and VNT should explore closer geographic matches of low generation mosquito and viral strains.
