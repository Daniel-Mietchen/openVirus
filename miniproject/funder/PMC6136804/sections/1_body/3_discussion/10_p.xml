<p>Overall, VT of DENVs in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> may be underestimated as a potential force driving the epidemiology of DENV infection. It is possible that infected males could maintain the virus at a low threshold without causing outbreaks in human populations, and initiate new infections by VT and VNT within the vector population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We did not observe any significant differences in the efficiency of VNT between mosquitos fed (BMnV) and not fed prior to mating as previously reported in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We did not observe any difference in DIR in heads of fed versus non-fed mosquitoes. In our study, evidence for VNT in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was further supported by microscopy studies of DENV2 infected males by detecting viral antigen the testes, seminal vesicle and accessory glands [
