<p>Previous experimental infections under laboratory conditions revealed DENV VTR of 1â€“4% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Detection of VT in nature is rare, due primarily to the low frequency of adult

 <italic>albopictus</italic> adult female mosquitoes or in adults mosquitoes intrathoracically injected with ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although VTR in those experimental studies were low, the efficiency may be sufficient to allow ZIKV (and other flaviviruses) to persist within the vector population in eggs during hot dry periods or cold weather, when adult vectors are absent or in low numbers.
