<p>Overall, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes display higher VTR than 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs are generally more resistant to desiccation than 
 <italic>Culex</italic> eggs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], which may confer a selective advantage to vertically transmitted viruses. In addition, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes had higher VTRs in arid climatic conditions compared to equatorial or warm temperate climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This supports the hypothesis that VT could be a maintenance mechanism when conditions are adverse for HT, in agreement with earlier observations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. It had been reported that eVTR measured in immature developmental stages were higher than in the corresponding adults [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae vertically infected with YFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Kunjin virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] appeared to be slower in their development and vertically infected larvae may also suffer lower survival, hence leading to lower infection prevalence in adults [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
