<p>This study used two techniques to show DENV2 VT in GDLS 
 <italic>Ae</italic>.
 <italic>aegypti</italic>: 1) RT-N-PCR for amplification of viral RNA and 2) IFA detection of DENV2 antigen. Infectious DENV demonstrated by IFA in mosquito C6/36 cells exposed to mosquito tissue homogenates. The latter assay is considered the gold standard of evidence for VT. Although PCR-based assays are rapid and have higher sensitivity than virus isolation, they are prone to contamination or amplification of virus sequence incorporated into the mosquito genome. Consequently, resulting data should be interpreted cautiously and outcomes confirmed by virus isolation or IFA. In this report, we used RT-N-PCR assays to confirm IFA results for the presence DENV2.
