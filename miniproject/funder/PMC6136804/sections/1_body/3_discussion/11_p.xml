<p>Our results clearly demonstrate that infected GDLS female mosquitoes can vertically transmit DENV2 to their progeny and support our hypothesis that DENV VT efficiency largely depends on the interplay between gonotrophic cycle and viral infection dynamics. Offspring produced during the second or later gonotrophic cycles display higher VTR than offspring produced during the first gonotrophic cycle. Vertically infected males that have DENV in their reproductive tracts can sexually transmit DENV to non-infected virgin GDLS females during mating. This study demonstrates the potential for VNT of DENV by male
