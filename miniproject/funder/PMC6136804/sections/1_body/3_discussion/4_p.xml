<p>Most previous studies demonstrated VT after intrathoracic injection of the virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The observed VTR in the GDLS strain could be due to a higher efficiency of initially infecting GDLS females with artificial blood meals containing biologically relevant virus titers. In our study, we initially infected mosquitoes via a blood meal and DENV2 VT was analyzed after the second gonotrophic cycle (E2-7d, E2-10d, and E2-21d). E2-F1 mosquitoes were analyzed as a counter-weight to previous studies that showed little to no VT occurring after the first oviposition cycle. Lack of VT from E1 females to F1 progeny could be due to poor virus dissemination to reproductive tissues before the first egg batch is produced and laid, and/or decreased permeability of virus to nulliparous ovaries during oogenesis [

These findings were consistent with earlier reports for other flaviviruses (Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV), which showed infected female mosquitoes vertically transmit virus after the second oviposition cycle [
