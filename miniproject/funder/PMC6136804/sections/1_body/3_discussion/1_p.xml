<p>Arboviruses are maintained by horizontal transmission (HT) between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts in nature. Arboviruses potentially can be transmitted vertically in the vector population from mother to offspring, which is a possible maintenance mechanism during adverse conditions for HT. Dry seasons in tropical areas, cold seasons in temperate regions, or insecticide spraying campaigns can drastically reduce vector density and thus opportunities for HT [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In addition, arbovirus infections in vertebrates usually result in long-lasting protective immunity so that high levels of herd immunity will minimize HT following epidemics. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the maintenance of arboviruses during inter-epidemic periods and include virus re-introduction and amplification of the virus in unknown host species (i.e., reservoirs) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. VT and VNT are alternate transmission mechanisms DENVs might use to maintain themselves in a vector population independent of feeding on viremic humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although male mosquitoes are not hematophagous, they can acquire virus by VT from an infected female parent. In experimental studies, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> male mosquitoes infected by virus injection into the hemoceol transmitted virus to non-infected adult females during mating leading to infected F1 progeny [

A relatively small number of stably infected females could maintain virus prevalence at a constant level if germarium infection occurred, assuming that any detrimental effects of the infection (e.g., longevity, fecundity, and development) are balanced by horizontal transmission [
