<p>Female GDLS mosquitoes were fed a blood meal containing &gt;10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/mL of DENV2 and held in a cage containing an oviposition cup. We analyzed E1 eggs (E1-F1) for VTR. After the first oviposition cycle, females were offered a second blood meal with no virus (BMnV) at either 7, 10 or 21 days pi (E2-7d, E2-10d and E2-21d respectively) to support E2 egg production (E2-F1). Blood-engorged females were maintained at 28°C and 80%RH in the insectary as previously described. Non-blood fed females were removed after the second blood meal and stored at -80°C. Virus titrations determined DENV2 infection rates from the initial infectious blood meal. Eggs from each gonotrophic cycle were collected for VT analyses.
