<p>To evaluate TOT, E1 and E2 eggs from DENV2-infected females were surface-sterilized by soaking in 0.05% sodium hypochlorite for 5–10 min, then for 1 min (3 times) in 70% ethyl alcohol, and finally washed with distilled water three times [

Each pool of larvae was homogenized and filtered prior to infecting C6/36 cell monolayers grown on coverslips in 12- well plates. Cells were analyzed by IFA for DENV2 E antigen as previously described. Total RNA was extracted from the pellet to conduct RT-N-PCR for confirmatory analysis of viral RNA.
