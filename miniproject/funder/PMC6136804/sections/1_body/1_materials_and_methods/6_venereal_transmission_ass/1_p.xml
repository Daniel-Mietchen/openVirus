<p>GDLS females were offered a blood meal containing ~10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/mL of DENV2 JAM1409 and a second BMnV at 10 dpi. GDLS females engorged with a second BMnV were transferred and held individually in 50-ml centrifuge tubes lined with a dry strip of paper towel. Distilled water was added one day after blood feeding to support egg production. E2 eggs (E2-10d-F1) from each female were stored in individual plastic bags. Each female was stored at -80°C in a numbered vial prior to testing for infection status.

 </bold> Individual E2-10d-F1 male progeny (5–6 days post-eclosion) transferred into small cardboard cartons were separated into two groups (Group I and II). Two sugar-fed uninfected, virgin females were added to Group I cartons prior to mating. Two uninfected, virgin females that had received a BMnV three days previously were added to Group II cartons prior to mating. Following a 48-h mating period, males were removed from the cartons and their reproductive tracts (testes, accessory glands and seminal vesicle) obtained by severing the last two abdominal segments and stored at -80°C prior to determining DENV2 infection status. The mated females were incubated at 28°C in Group I and II cartons until 8 days post mating. Thereafter, female reproductive tracts (ovaries and spermathecae) were dissected for analysis. Additionally, female mosquito carcasses (without reproductive tracts) were stored at -80°C. Male and female reproductive tissues were homogenized, filtered and filtrates used to infect C6/36 cells to detect DENV2 following the same procedures used for virus detection in larvae described above. We then tested by RT-N-PCR the heads of females (already shown to be virus positive by IFA in their reproductive tract) to observe DENV2 dissemination.
