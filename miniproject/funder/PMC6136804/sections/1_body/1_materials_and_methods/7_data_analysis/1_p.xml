<p>The average proportion of infected female reproductive tracts, female carcasses, and male reproductive tracts were calculated by averaging the number infected divided by the total tested. The proportion of infected males that transferred virus to females was determined for each pairing. All data were analyzed with GraphPad prism software (version 5.0, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to test for significant differences (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in TOT and FIR (by Fisherâ€™s exact test) and to analyze the correlation between female parent titer and proportion on infected progeny (Pearson correlation). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the statistical significance of acquiring a second blood meal on virus replication.
