<p>Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) was used for RNA extraction from mosquito homogenates following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Detection of viral RNA was performed using a semi-nested PCR described by Gunther et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] with the following modifications: Primers for the NS3 gene of DENV2 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] were used to generate a 362 bp amplicon. The cDNA was amplified in a second step (nested PCR), using 3 μl of DNA from the RT-PCR reaction in the presence of forward primer (5’AATTGTCGACAGAAAAGGAAA 3’) and reverse primer (5’ GGCTGGGGTTTGGTATC 3’). The reaction contained 2X PCR master mix (Promega M750B), followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, with an additional extension step of 72°C for 10 min and held at 4°C [
