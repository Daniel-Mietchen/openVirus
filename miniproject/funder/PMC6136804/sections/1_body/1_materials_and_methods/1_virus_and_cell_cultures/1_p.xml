<p>LLC-MK2 and C6/36 (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) cells were cultured in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 28°C, 5%CO
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. DENV2-JAM1409 strain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was used to infect fresh cultures of C6/36 cells to prepare infectious blood meals. DENV2-JAM1409 belongs to the American-Asian genotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and was originally obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC- Fort Collins, CO, USA). The virus has been routinely passaged (&gt; 25 times) in C6/36 cell culture. Briefly, monolayers of C6/36 cells were exposed to DENV2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and incubated at 28°C; 6 days later medium was replaced and infected cells and medium were harvested at 12–14 days to prepare the blood meal [
