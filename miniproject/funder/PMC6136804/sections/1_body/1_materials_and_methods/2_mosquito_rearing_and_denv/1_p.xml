 <italic>aegypti</italic> GDLS strain was derived from a mixture of equal numbers of 10 geographically distinct collections made in 2008 from Chiapas, Mexico [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and eggs were hatched and reared to adults (28°C/75-80% relative humidity (RH); photocycle of 16:8 L:D). To infect mosquitoes, groups of 100–150 one-week-old adult females were placed in 2.5 L cartons, deprived of sugar and water overnight and allowed to feed on artificial blood meals consisting of virus-infected C6/36 cell suspension (60% vol/vol), 40% (vol/vol) defibrinated sheep blood (Colorado Serum Co., Boulder, CO) and 1 mM ATP [

 <sup>6</sup> PFU/ml. We selected engorged females, incubated them for up to 17 days (28°C and 75–80% RH) and then analyzed to determine the infection rate. Virus in the blood meal was quantified by plaque titration on LLC-MK2 cells as previously described [
