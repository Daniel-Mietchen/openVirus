 <italic>aegypti</italic> typically become infected when the female ingests a blood meal from a viremic human.

 <italic>aegypti</italic> females lay their eggs within days of acquiring a blood meal. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> embryos can become dormant at the end of embryogenesis and remain viable inside the egg for up to six months [
