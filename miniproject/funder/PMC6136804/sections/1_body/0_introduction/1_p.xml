<p>Dengue viruses (DENV) include four serologically related but genetically distinct viruses, DENV1-4 (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>). DENV are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted between susceptible humans by the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes spp</italic>. DENV and their mosquito vectors are present throughout the tropics causing an estimated 390 million human infections per year [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is the most important mosquito vector during large DENV outbreaks in tropical and subtropical urban regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DENV epidemics occur when mosquitoes and susceptible humans are sufficiently plentiful to maintain the vector-human transmission cycle. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> take multiple blood-meals during each gonotrophic cycle [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ingestion of multiple uninfected blood feedings boost a previous incipient infection, enhancing virus dissemination to secondary tissues and transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This effect was also observed for Zika virus (ZIKV) in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Vertical transmission (VT) from one generation to the next and venereal transmission (VNT) during mosquito mating are mechanisms of DENV transmission within 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The potential impact of VT and VNT in sustaining DENV in the vector population remains unclear. Given the large public health consequences of DENV infections globally, a determination of the role VT and VNT plays in DENV maintenance in mosquito populations could lead to a more complete understanding of DENV persistence in nature and new insights into DENV transmission dynamics.
