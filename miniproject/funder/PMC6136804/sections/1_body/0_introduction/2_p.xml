<p>VT of arboviruses occurs by either transovarial transmission (TOT), in which the virus infects germinal tissues of the female (including oocytes) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and by trans-ovum transmission, which occurs at the time of fertilization or by virus contamination of the egg surface during oviposition [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. VT mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In this report, we define VT rate (VTR) as the number of infected females in a population that produce at least one infected offspring. The filial infection rate (FIR) is the proportion of infected progeny produced from infected parents, given that VT has occurred. The minimum filial infection rate (MFIR) is the total number of positive mosquito pools divided by total mosquitoes and the effective VTR (eVTR) is the average number of infected progeny per infected female (VTR multiplied by the FIR) [
