  <title>FIR in male progeny showing lack of correlation between DENV2 titer in the female parent and proportion of infected male progeny.</title>
  <p>DENV2 titers for each infected parental GDLS female within each replicate were measured separately to determine the MFIR in male progeny. Female mosquitoes were orally infected with DENV2 and received a second BMnV at 10 dpi. E2 eggs were collected from each female placed in numbered vials. Only E2 eggs from females positive for DENV2 were hatched to rear to F1 adults to determine MFIR. No significant correlation between female parent titer and proportion progeny infected was detected (Pearson correlation, r = 0.049, P = 0.804; r = 0.267, P = 0.176; r = 0.013, P = 0.933, respectively). Non-infected female mosquitoes with a non-infected male progeny (negative control) were clustered at the origin (arrow); 1
   <sup>st</sup> replicate (red circle); 2
   <sup>nd</sup> replicate (dark blue triangle); 3
   <sup>rd</sup> replicate (green square).
