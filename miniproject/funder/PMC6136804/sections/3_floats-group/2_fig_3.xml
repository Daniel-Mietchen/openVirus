   <bold>A</bold>. Schematic of steps followed to obtain F1 progeny 4
   <sup>th</sup> instar larvae samples from the first (E1) and second (E2) gonotrophic cycle of GDLS mosquitoes infected orally with DENV2. After exposure to a blood meal containing virus, female mosquitoes were divided into four groups. Each group was offered no further blood meals (E1) a BMnV 7, 10 and 21 days later (E2-7d, E2-10d and E2-21d respectively). Eggs were collected for each group. After hatching, all larva pools were screened for the presence of DENV2. 
   <bold>B</bold>. RT-N-PCR and IFA of infected C6/36 cells determined DENV2 minimum filial infection (MFIR) and vertical transmission rates (VTR).
