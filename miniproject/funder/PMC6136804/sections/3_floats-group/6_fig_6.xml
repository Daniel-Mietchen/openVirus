  <title>Venereal infection rates of GDLS females mated to males vertically infected with DENV2.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A</bold>. Schematic of steps used in VNT assay. Male progeny (E2-10d-F1; designated 1.1,1.2, etc.) of DENV2 orally infected females were allowed to mate either with virgin non-infected females fed with non-infectious blood meal (3 days before) or non-blood fed at a ratio of 1:2. After mating, IFA determined infection status of reproductive tissues of males. Live females were maintained until 8 dpi at 28Â°C. Thereafter, infection rates were determined in female reproductive tracts by IFA following virus amplification in C6/36 cells. AG = male accessory gland; RT = female reproductive tract. 
   <bold>B</bold>. Infection rates of non-infected females (fed with non-infectious blood meal or non-blood fed) mated with males vertically infected with DENV2.
