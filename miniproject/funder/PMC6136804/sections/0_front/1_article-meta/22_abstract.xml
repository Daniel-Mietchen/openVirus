  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue viruses (DENV) and other medically important arthropod-borne viruses (yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya). DENVs replicate in 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and humans in a transmission cycle that maintains the virus in nature. However, adverse conditions (i.e. dry seasons and low temperatures, vector populations, and host susceptibility) can suppress the transmission cycle. How does the virus survive in nature when the mosquito-human epidemic cycle subsides? Alternative DENV transmission routes can allow the virus to remain in the vector population. DENV can vertically transmit from mother to offspring and venereally transmit from infected male offspring to females during mating. In this report, we show that DENV2 efficiently pass from one generation to the next after the infected female mosquito acquires a second blood meal. Furthermore, infected male progeny arising from vertical transmission can then infect females during mating. Vertical transmission of DENV2, possibly in combination with venereal transmission, can potentially maintain DENV2 for sufficient time for the vector-human transmission cycle to resume.
