<p id="Par15">An important factor facilitating the spread of CHIKV is the increase in international travel, which consequently introduces the virus through viremic travelers to new regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If the vectors are present in such regions, they could acquire the virus, while feeding on viremic travelers. This subsequently can result in autochthonous transmission making those areas endemic for the disease. Sistan and Baluchistan Province of Iran shares a border with Pakistan and the residents of the Southern part of this province have significant cultural similarities with those of Pakistan and, hence, constant trade and transport between the two countries is very common. Consequently, virus introduction from Pakistan to Iran due to the large incidence of travel is likely. According to the report on detection of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Sistan and Baluchistan Province [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], virus importation via travelers could be a serious health threat. The current study aimed at investigating the presence of CHIKV in suspected individuals in Sistan and Baluchistan Province during the outbreak in 2017 in Pakistan.
