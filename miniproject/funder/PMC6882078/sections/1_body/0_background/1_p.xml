<p id="Par13">Chikungunya (CHIK) is a worldwide expanding mosquito-borne infection. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped and spherical virus, belongs to 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus of 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family first detected in 1952 among Makonde population in Tanzania [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. CHIKV genome constitutes of a single strand positive RNA with two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, nsP4) and the second one encodes five structural proteins (capsid [C], and envelope [E2, E3, 6 k, E1]) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although the disease is rarely fatal, as its name implies, it can lead to debilitating arthralgia (in the Makonde language, Chikungunya means “that which bends up”) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].CHIKV is transmitted to humans through infected mosquito bites of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., in particular 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Similar to other arboviruses such as Dengue and Zika, CHIKV can be transmitted via the urban transmission cycle between humans and mosquito [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the majority of infected individuals, there is a four-to seven-day incubation period prior to onset of disease. The main symptoms of CHIKV infection are the sudden onset of high fever (102 °F) and severe arthralgia; other symptoms include headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, arthritis, and skin rash. The clinical signs of the acute form can be mild, moderate, and severe, but usually resolve within 3 weeks. About 10–15% of cases develop chronic forms associated with persistent arthralgia [
