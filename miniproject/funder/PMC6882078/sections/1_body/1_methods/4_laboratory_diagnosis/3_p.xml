<p id="Par21">Detection of anti-CHIKV IgM/IgG antibodies was performed using commercial ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit (Euroimmun, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Based on the protocol, results were reported as a ratio of the optical density of each sample to the optical density of the calibrator in which a ratio of ≤0.8 was considered negative, a ratio between ≥0.8 and ≤ 1.1 was considered borderline, and a ratio of &gt; 1.1 was interpreted as positive.</p>
