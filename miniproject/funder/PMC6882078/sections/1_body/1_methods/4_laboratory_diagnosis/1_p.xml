<p id="Par19">Diagnostic algorithm was determined based on the interval between dates of sampling and onset of disease. In CHIKV infection, viremia starts before onset of symptoms and usually lasts up to 8 days after illness. Anti-CHIKV antibodies can usually be identifiable in serum by 5–7 days after onset of symptoms [

 <italic>n</italic> = 8). Samples obtained 5–10 days post onset of disease were tested by serological assays to detect anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG antibodies, as well as molecular assay (
 <italic>n</italic> = 72). Samples collected after the 10th day of disease onset were analyzed by only serological assays (
 <italic>n</italic> = 79). All CHIKV diagnostic assays were performed at the Department of Arboviruses and Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (National Ref. Lab), Pasteur Institute of Iran.
