<p id="Par20">For molecular detection of CHIKV, viral RNA extraction from serum samples was performed using QIAamp viral RNA Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The presence of the CHIKV RNA was evaluated using FTD commercial Dengue/Chik kit (Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) based on qualitative TaqMan real-time PCR. This kit contains an internal control to ensure the avoidance of false negative results. For phylogenetic analysis of positive molecular cases, a 1014-bp region of E1 gene of CHIKV genome was amplified by a conventional RT-PCR using primers Chik-E1-F-10004 (ACAAAACCGTCATCCCGTCTC) and Chik-E1-R-11138 (TGACTATGTGGTCCTTCGGAGG) and Qiagen One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany) [

Each 25 μL of reaction mixture, contained 5 μL 9QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer (5x), 0.4 μM of each primer, 10 μL dNTP Mix (containing 10 mM of each dNTP), 1 μL Enzyme Mix, 0.25 μL(or 1 unit) RNase inhibitor, and 2.5 μL extracted RNA. The PCR conditions were as follows: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, 15 min initial denaturation at 95 °C, 45 cycles including a) denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, b) annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and c) extension at 72 °C for 70 s followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 0.008% SafeStain (Takapouzist, Iran). RNAs extracted from confirmed CHKV-positive sample and sterile distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The amplified products were sequenced using the Sanger method in both directions using primers Chik-E1-F-10004 and Chik-E1-R-11138. The raw data of sequencing was trimmed and assembled using CLC Main Workbench software (CLC bio, Denmark) followed by confirmation by BLAST (

Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA6. For this purpose, the maximum likelihood methodand the kimura 2-parameter model were used with 10,000 bootstraps.
