<p id="Par29">The phylogenetic analysis revealed significant similarity between the identified strains in the current study to those of Pakistan 2017 strains. Consequently, there is little doubt that the virus was imported to Iran from the CHIKV endemic neighboring country of Pakistan. Phylogenetically, CHIKV is categorized into three distinct genotypes e.g., West African, ECSA, and Asian [

 <italic>.</italic> In the current study, a new nonsynonymous mutation in E1 gene (T288I) was observed in the Iran-6062 (MH746785) strain. The E1 protein is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope and cellular membrane, which is part of viral entry stage [
