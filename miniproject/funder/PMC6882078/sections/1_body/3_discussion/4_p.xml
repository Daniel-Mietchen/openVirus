<p id="Par31">The entomological surveillance conducted alongside the current study did not find the CHIKV vectors in the studied areas. However, during a six-year entomological surveillance in Sistan and Baluchistan Province, adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was detected in Nikshahr and Sarbaz cities in 2009 and adult and larvae of the same species were identified in Chabahar in 2013 [

Additionally, modeling studies using geographic, metrologic, satellite imagery, and remote sensing data from 2011 to 2015 demonstrated that this province was vulnerable to entry and establishment of CHIKV vectors, particularly

This can be accomplished by improving the environmental conditions in order to eliminate the mosquito breeding sites, and systematic and comprehensive entomological monitoring. Educating and training people is also a great help to achieve this goal. In addition to the above measures, it is also important to monitor patients and identify infected cases in the acute phase of the disease (when the transmission of the virus from the patient to the vector is possible). In this regard, training clinicians and people is essential for rapid identification of the infected cases [
