<p id="Par34">Unlike other arboviral diseases, most of the patients with CHIK have clinical symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the most common symptoms include severe fever (above 102 °F), arthralgia, headache, and muscle pain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These are predictive symptoms in endemic and epidemic areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The results of the current study also indicated that together with joint involvement, headache, and muscle pain were the most common symptoms. In addition to clinical symptoms, changes in blood factors such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are also helpful for clinical diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, these changes are mild and short compared to other arboviral diseases such as dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In the current study, mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in positive cases; however, there was no significant difference between the two groups.
