<p id="Par28">CHIK is considered as a global health threat due to the factors associated with its geographical expansion including global warming/climate change, globalization with significant increase in international travels, and adaptation of virus to new vectors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Extensive epidemics in Asia and Africa could be a potential risk for its spread to other non-endemic countries in the world, particularly the ones sharing the same climate or bordering other countries that mosquito vectors already colonized or could be colonized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the current study, out of 159 patients with fever and arthralgia/arthritis in Sistan and Baluchistan Province, 25.1% were positive for either viral genome or anti-CHIKV antibodies. Unlike molecular detection of viral genome, due to possible cross-reactivity in serological testing, the positive result in ELISA cannot be concluded as a definitive infection and should be confirmed by the supplementary neutralization test [
