<p id="Par25">Molecular analysis of 80 (category 1, 3) serum samples showed presence of the CHIKV RNA in 11 (13.7%) sera; all of them were negative for dengue virus. Among CHIKV RNA positive samples, five were successfully sequenced. The obtained sequences were submitted to the GenBank as Iran-5947 (gi: MH746782), Iran-6049 (gi: MH746783), Iran-6051 (gi: MH746784), Iran-6062 (gi: MH746785), and Iran-5300 (gi: MK775711). In the phylogenic tree, these sequences clustered with recent isolates of Pakistan outbreak 2016–2017 belonging to Indian Ocean sub-lineage of ECSA (East/Central/South African) genotype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The strains Iran-5947, Iran-6049, and Iran-6051 were identical to strains of the recent outbreak in Pakistan (MF740875- MF740881) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Iran-6062 strain showed one new amino acid substitution of I/T nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid, isoleucine, to polar amino acid, threonine, at position 3593 amino acid residue (10,847 nt, ATT/ACT) compared with Pakistan 206–2017 strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Also, Iran-5300 strain showed a rare non-synonymous substitution T/C at nucleotide 10,560, which was observed in Asian Caribbean strain (KC488650). In addition, four known mutations including K211E, M269 V, D284E, and V322A were observed in all identified strains.
