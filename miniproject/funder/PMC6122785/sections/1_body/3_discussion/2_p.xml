<p>One limitation of conventional regression models for counting data is that both zeros and non-zero (positive) observations are assumed to come from the same data generation process. The application of the two-stage model for infectious disease surveillance data is flexible in this regard, allowing the identification of different risk factors for the occurrence and intensity of disease due to the presence of excess zeros in the data set. The proposed methodology for estimation allowed for rapid and efficient implementation of the spatiotemporal model, which showed different patterns throughout the epidemiological weeks for the occurrence and intensity of influenza transmission.</p>
