<p>In a socioeconomic context, HDI data allows an ordering among municipalities and provides a means of determining the level of development of each region. In this study, the HDI was significant indicator of a greater chance of occurrence and intensity of influenza A (H1N1) transmission in more populous municipalities, that is, those with higher HDIs. Xiao et al. [
