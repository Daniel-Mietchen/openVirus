<p>Despite these limitations, this study provided a comprehensive ecological view of the process of spatiotemporal diffusion of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Paraná in 2009. These results provide important information on the origin and spread of influenza in the state of Paraná, and may help to identify priority areas for surveillance and the establishment of strategic measures for disease prevention and control. The application of the proposed model also allows identification of epidemiological weeks with an excessive chance of influenza occurrence, and can be used as reference criteria for defining immunization campaign schedules.</p>
