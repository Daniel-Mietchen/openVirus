<p>Identifying the starting point of influenza epidemics is fundamental for the development of timely intervention strategies and to predict the spread to other municipalities. The municipalities of Pinhais and Curitiba proved to be strong candidates for the origin of spatial diffusion of influenza. According to the Gazeta do Povo newspaper on July 18, 2009 (page 4), “a 24-year-old man may have been the first victim of influenza A (H1N1), known as swine flu, in the Curitiba region”.
