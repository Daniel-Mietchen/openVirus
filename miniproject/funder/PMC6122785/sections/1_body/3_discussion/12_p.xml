<p>The present study does have a few limitations. First, a common limitation in ecological studies is the inability to control for effects of confounding factors at the individual level. A second limitation is probable sources of information bias, including under-reporting in asymptomatic persons, infected persons that do not seek medical help, or as a result of changes in the reporting system that occurred after July 1, at which point diagnostic efforts were focused on cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, risk groups, and outbreaks. Collected during an emergency scenario and restricted to clinical cases, the data do not provide a full picture of the influenza transmission landscape. It is possible that detection differed between municipalities. On the positive side, previous analysis showed that Paraná had the most sensitive surveillance system among the Brazilian states, with significantly higher reporting rate of mild cases [

Within the state the three metropolitan regions, Curitiba, Foz do Iguaçu and Londrina-Maringá, presented similar mild-to-severe ratios, suggesting a certain level of homogeneity in the notification pattern. Finally, due to lack of available information the temporal data associated with some explanatory variables differs from that of the dependent variable. For example, the reported cases of influenza refer to 2009, while the covariates poverty rate, municipal HDI, and migration data were derived from the 2010 Census. It is, however, reasonable to assume that sociodemographic information did not undergo significant changes over the course of a single year.
