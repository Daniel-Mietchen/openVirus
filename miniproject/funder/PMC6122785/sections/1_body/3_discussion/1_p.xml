<p>This study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the influenza A pandemic in the Brazilian state of Paran√° from the introduction of the H1N1 virus until the end of the epidemic period in 2009, aiming to understand the process of diffusion in the state and to identify risk factors for occurrence and intensity. The results indicated that interventions with a focus on municipalities with greater flow and density of people, especially those with higher HDI and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigating the impact of future influenza pandemics on public health.</p>
