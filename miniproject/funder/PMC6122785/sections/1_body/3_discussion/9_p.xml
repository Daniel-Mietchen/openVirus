<p>In addition to sociodemographic factors that may favor the establishment and maintenance of the virus in individuals, it is also known that influenza virus is better adapted to replicate at temperatures lower than the average for most common infectious agents [

 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results showed that maximum temperature in the week prior to case reports significantly affected the risk of influenza for several weeks. We found evidence early on that an increase in maximum temperature favored increased risk of influenza, possibly reflecting patterns of human aggregation. This counterintuitive result may be partially explained by the fact that with lower temperatures, people leave the home less, which may reduce the intensity of transmission. In Brisbane, Australia, Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] observed significant increases in the incidence of influenza A (H1N1) associated with decreases in maximum temperature with a one-week lag. Lopez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] also found a negative correlation between temperature and the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) in a semi-arid region in India. In this study, a significant increase in the risk of influenza transmission was associated with a drop in temperature from weeks 21 to 28. From an ecological point of view, few authors have verified the impact of climatic factors on influenza in tropical regions, where temperatures and relative humidity are generally higher [

 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, to our knowledge there are no studies that consider that the effect of temperature on the risk of influenza can vary over time, as proposed in this work.
