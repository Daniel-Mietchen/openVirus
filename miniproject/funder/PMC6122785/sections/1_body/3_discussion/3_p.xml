<p>Pendular migration data have been increasingly used to describe population mobility in epidemic models [

 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The present study showed that the pendular migration is significantly associated with the chance of occurrence of influenza, such that municipalities with greater flow of people have a greater chance of occurrence of the disease. Charaudeau et al. [
