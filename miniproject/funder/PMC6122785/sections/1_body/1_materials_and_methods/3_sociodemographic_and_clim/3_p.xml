<p>The unit for spatial analysis was the municipality of residence for cases, thus it was necessary to use meteorological information on the same scale. To this end we calculated mean values for each municipality. We accomplished this by interpolating data from the meteorological stations to a regular grid (1 km) covering the entire state of Paran√°. We then calculated the weekly average of each variable by municipality considering the number of pixels of the regular grid contained in each municipality. The interpolation was carried out through generalized additive models (GAMs) [

We also evaluated effects of the climate variables precipitation, temperature, and humidity on the incidence of H1N1 infection with a one week lag; this time lag is consistent with the incubation period of the virus in humans.
