<p>The sociodemographic variables used in this study were: poverty rate, human development index (HDI), population density (inhabitants per km
 <sup>2</sup>), density of physicians per 1,000 inhabitants, pendular migration, and presence of primary means of transport (intercity and city bus, boat, and plane). The poverty rate was obtained from the Parana Institute of Economic and Social Development (IPARDES), and HDI data through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), a body linked to the United Nations. Both data refer to the year 2010. Influenza notification data were obtained through the Ministry of Health, specifically in the Health Information Booklets of the Department of Informatics of SUS (DATASUS) for the year 2009. Population density, pendular migration, and means of transportation offered by each municipality were obtained through IBGE. Pendular migration, defined in this work as the expected number of individuals commuting between municipalities for work or study, was extracted from the microdata of IBGEâ€™s 2010 census. Information regarding means of transportation were extracted from the 2009 Basic Municipal Information Survey [
