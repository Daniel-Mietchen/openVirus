<p>In order to assess the municipality(ies) that is(are) more likely to be the starting point(s) for Influenza A (H1N1) introduction in the State of Paraná during the 2009 pandemic, we tested the correlation between the shortest path tree of candidate municipalities against the estimated arrival times in the remaining municipalities. In order to do that, we calculated the shortest path tree Ψ

 </sub> for each of the potential sites of origin of the epidemic and the arrival times of the epidemic. The arrival times in each municipality were defined (using results of the spatiotemporal model described above) as the first epidemiological week in which the probability of having an excess chance of influenza was greater than 0.90. For each candidate city, the correlation coefficients between the effective distances and the times of arrival of the epidemic were calculated. This approach should result in greater correlation when a particular municipality
