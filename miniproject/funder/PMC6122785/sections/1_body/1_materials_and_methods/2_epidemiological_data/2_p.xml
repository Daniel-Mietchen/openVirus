<p>Time series of influenza cases were created by summing the number of weekly confirmed and autochthonous cases, from April 5 to September 26, 2009. We used the municipalities of residence as the spatial unit for analysis, and epidemiological week of symptom onset as the temporal unit for analysis. On some occasions, there was no record for initial day of symptoms. In these cases, missing data were estimated using imputation technique, and the corresponding value for first day of symptoms was calculated as 2.76 days prior to the day-of-report (the mean time between onset of symptoms and notification of illness), following the estimation of Code√ßo et al.
