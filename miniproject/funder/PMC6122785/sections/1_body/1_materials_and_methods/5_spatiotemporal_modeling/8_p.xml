<p>Marginal posterior distributions are not available in closed form. From the bayesian point of view, the most common approach is to make inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. However, in complex models, this method can be computationally expensive and difficult to assess the convergence. As an alternative to the MCMC methods, the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] algorithm can be used, which is relatively fast and produces accurate approximations for marginal posterior distributions. In this work, the parametric inference was approximated using INLA. All analyses were performed in R version 3.1.2 [
