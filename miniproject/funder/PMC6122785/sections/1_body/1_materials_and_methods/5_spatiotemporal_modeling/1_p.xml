<p>Despite the epidemic nature of influenza in Paran√°, cases were absent in about 70% of all observations, resulting in an inflation of zeros for the models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202832.g002">Fig 2</xref>). From an epidemiological perspective, the distribution of influenza cases can be seen as a manifestation of two processes: (1) occurrence, represented by a binary variable indicating the presence or absence of cases, and (2) intensity, represented by a count variable. The count variable can only be observed when the binary variable indicates presence. From a statistical perspective, two-stage or two-part models (hurdle models) [
