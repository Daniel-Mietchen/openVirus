The average temperature in the state is 18.5°C, and the climate is divided into two regimes: a tropical regime that predominates in the North, West, and Coastal areas with average temperatures of 22°C, and a subtropical or temperate regime in the mid-southern area with average temperatures between 10°C and 22°C. Tourism is one of the main sectors of the economy, and Paraná has the 5th highest Human Development Index (HDI) in Brazil. The population of Paraná is about four times less than in the state of São Paulo, with 11 million inhabitants; approximately 2 million reside in Curitiba, the state capital and most populous municipality. Iguazu falls, at the border between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, is also an important touristic region attracting people around the world.
