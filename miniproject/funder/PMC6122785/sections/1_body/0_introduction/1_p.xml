<p>Influenza poses a major challenge to world health authorities due to high transmissibility and capacity to generate major epidemics. From an epidemiological point of view, influenza epidemics and pandemics are associated with changes in the structure of society that favor the spread of new strains in specific ecological, social, and spatial contexts [

In border regions, seaports and airports began to utilize sound alerts and distribute information for the purpose of early identification of symptomatic individuals. Despite these efforts, on July 16, 2009, the Ministry of Health officially announced sustained transmission of the H1N1 virus in the Brazilian territory [

 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. According to Ministry of Health data, up to the epidemiological week (EW) 47 (11/22/2009 to 11/28/2009), 30,055 cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) had been registered, with 93% identified as resulting from H1N1 infections. The H1N1 pandemic disproportionately affected the southern and southeast regions of Brazil, with Paran치 being the most affected state, accounting for 52% of the total cases reported in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite low lethality rates, the rapid spread of the disease generated panic in Paran치. As in other parts of the country and the world, preventive measures were taken, such as the closure of schools, restaurants, and public places, in addition to social distancing and changes in hygiene habits [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although the 2009 pandemic provided extensive knowledge and experience for public health professionals, the mechanism responsible for the spread of influenza is not yet fully understood [
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The present study modeled the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in Paran치, using efficient computational methods to identify climatic and sociodemographic factors associated with the chance of H1N1 introduction and, once introduced, the intensity of spread within the city. The model was further used to identify the most-likely starting points of H1N1 diffusion into the state of Paran치. These results will contribute to evaluation of timely control measures and decision making by public health authorities.
