<p>The spatial distribution of influenza A (H1N1) cases per 1,000 people and its relation to sociodemographic covariates is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202832.g004">Fig 4</xref>. During the study period, influenza cases were mainly concentrated in the municipalities within the metropolitan, northern, and western regions of Paran√°, where the highest rates of the disease were observed. In general, the maps suggest that higher altitudes and poverty rates may be related to a lower concentration of cases. Municipal HDI, demographic and medical densities, and pendular migration presented heterogeneous spatial distribution patterns compatible with the most affected regions of the state. Higher rates of influenza were observed in municipalities with primary means of transport with the exception of intercity highways, where this relationship was not confirmed. The was no apparent relationship between the total number of cases reported weekly and climate covariates.
