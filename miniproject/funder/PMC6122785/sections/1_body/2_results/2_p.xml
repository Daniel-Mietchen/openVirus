 <xref rid="pone.0202832.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the effects of covariates that were retained in the final spatiotemporal model, expressed in terms of chance ratio and the relative risk of the disease in Paraná. We found that pendular migration, presence of air transport, and HDI significantly contributed to increase the chance of influenza. Population density, municipal road transport, municipal HDI and maximum temperature represented risk factors for the disease intensity. The effect of the covariate maximum lagged temperature of one week (lag 1) was assumed to vary over time, and therefore is omitted from 
 <xref rid="pone.0202832.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The variables minimum temperature, relative humidity, altitude, poverty rate, and medical density were not included in the spatiotemporal model due to multicollinearity. Presence of boat transportation in the municipality, the existence of intercity road transport, and rainfall did not contribute significantly to either the chance of occurrence or intensity of influenza A (H1N1) in Paraná and were also not included in the final regression model.
