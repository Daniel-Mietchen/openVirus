<p>The Brazilian influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was divided into two phases: the containment phase and the mitigation phase. The containment phase was the period of introduction of the virus, in which cases of the disease were related to international travel or contact with sick persons who had traveled internationally. This phase was from EW 16 (04/19) to EW 28 (07/12) in 2009, a period that preceded the declaration of sustained transmission of the virus. The mitigation phase began in EW 29 (07/19). The actions recommended for this phase were aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality due to the disease through the early diagnosis and treatment of cases that presented greater risk for severe outcomes or death. In EWs 14 through 18, the period of introduction of the virus in Brazil, there was a significant increase in the incidence of influenza A associated with increased temperature. However, from EW 21 (06/24) to EW 28 (07/12), the period that preceded the sustained transmission phase, reduced temperature favored increased risk of influenza. In general, after the start of the mitigation phase (EW 28) there was no substantial impact of temperature on disease risk (
