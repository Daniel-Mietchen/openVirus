<p>The spatial correlation parameter, 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0.965(0.964 − 0.965), suggests a high degree of spatial dependence for dissemination of pandemic influenza in Paraná. Analogously, the value of the temporal correlation coefficient 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.509(0.508 − 0.511) confirms the short-term persistence of the number of confirmed and autochthonous cases of influenza A (H1N1). An effect significantly different from zero was also observed for the parameter that relates the effects of the spatiotemporal interaction of both processes, such that 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> = 0.211(0.208 − 0.216) indicates that the occurrence of cases of the disease also have a heterogeneous spatiotemporal pattern.
