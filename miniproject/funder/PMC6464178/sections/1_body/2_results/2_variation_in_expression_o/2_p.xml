<p>In the midgut 1 d.p.i., of 73 transcripts encoding clip-domain serine protease (CLIP) genes, 24 were differentially expressed, among which, 22 were up-regulated and only 2 down-regulated by viral infection. In the genes encoding CTL family members, 5 transcripts were up-regulated and the 2 other down-regulated. Eight transcripts encoding Serpin were up-regulated. Almost half of the Galectin (GALE), one-third of the peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) and caspase family gene transcripts were down-regulated by viral infection. Compared with data from 7 days post viral infection in the carcass, the difference in gene expression at 1 day and 2 days was less significant. Only 8 and 13 genes showed differential expression at 1 day and 2 d.p.i., respectively, and 24 genes expressing differentially 7 d.p.i. in the carcass.</p>
