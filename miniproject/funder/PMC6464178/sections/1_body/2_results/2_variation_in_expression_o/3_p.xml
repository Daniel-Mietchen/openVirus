<p>In the midgut, 8 of 15 transcripts encoding AMPs decreased at 1 d.p.i., while only defensin E (DEFE) increased in transcript level. Additionally, CLIPB13A, SPZ1A, SPZ1C, GNBPB3, GNBPB4 and PGRPS1 from Toll and IMD pathway were differentially regulated in the midgut upon viral infection, suggesting the involvement of immune signaling pathway in the antiviral response (
