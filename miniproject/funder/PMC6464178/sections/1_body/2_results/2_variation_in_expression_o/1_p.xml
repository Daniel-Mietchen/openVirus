<p>To study the host immune response against viral infection, we focused on the expression profiles of immune pathway genes after DENV infection. Transcriptome-based analysis revealed variations in expression of 103 immunity-related gene transcripts in the midgut 1 d.p.i. (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), 56 of which were up-regulated and 47 down-regulated after viral infection. In contrast, in the carcass, only 45 transcripts exhibited change in expression. In particular, only 1 gene transcript was up-regulated and 7 down-regulated at 1 d.p.i.; 7 were up-regulated and 6 down-regulated at 2 d.p.i.; and 14 were up-regulated and 10 down-regulated at 7 d.p.i. Compared with the carcass, a more pronounced change in immunity-related gene transcripts was observed in the midgut (
