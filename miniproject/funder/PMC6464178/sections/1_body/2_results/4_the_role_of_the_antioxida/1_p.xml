<p>In order to study the role of HPX8C in the immune defense against viral infection, RNA interference (RNAi) method was used to down-regulate HPX8C by injecting dsRNAs into thoraces of female mosquitoes 1 day post eclosion following a micro-injection procedure. Three days later, the mRNA expression level of HPX8C was detected by means of qPCR to be significantly decreased (by 86%), indicating high efficiency of RNAi (
