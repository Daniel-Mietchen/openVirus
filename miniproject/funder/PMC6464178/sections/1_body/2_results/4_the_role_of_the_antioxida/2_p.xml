<p>HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes were homogenized for determination of peroxidase and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> activities. Compared with the control group, peroxidase activity reduced by ~27.28%-30.90% (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> level in HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes increased by ~21.44%-26.60% (

Additionally, the carcass of HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes was dissected for detection of ROS activity under a confocal microscope using a CM-H2DCFDA assay kit. Compared with mosquitoes injected with dsEGFP, HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes showed higher ROS activity (

In the midgut, the virus titer was found to be 66.42% lower in these HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes than in the control group (
