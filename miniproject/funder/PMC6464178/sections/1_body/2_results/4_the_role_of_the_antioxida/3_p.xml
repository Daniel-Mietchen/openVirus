<p>The ROS scavenger APO is a selective NADPH oxidase inhibitor that prevents the production of the ROS. Another ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), contains thiol (-SH), which upon oxidation can reduce the disulfide bond in the biological macromolecules and remove ROS at the same time. In our study, the HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes were treated with APO and NAC followed by infection with DENV. In the APO-treated group, the viral titer in the whole body was 2.12 times higher than in the control group (

In order to investigate whether the impact of HPX8C applies to other viruses, we measured the ZIKV titer in HPX8C RNAi-treated mosquitoes. Interestingly, ZIKV titer in these HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes decreased by 65.85% than in the EGFP-depleted group (
