<p>To establish the relationship between the mRNA level and DENV titer, we detected the induced level of ROS-related genes under different DENV titer infections. We observed that a DENV titer of 10
 <sup>3</sup> Pfu/ml could not induce the up-regulation of any ROS-related genes. However, when the virus titer was increased to 10
 <sup>5</sup> Pfu/ml, there was an increase in HPX8A and DUOX2 expression from 2- to 6-fold. Interestingly, DENV infection leads to a 25-fold increase in CuSOD2 expression, while each of HPX7, HPX8B and HPX8C was increased by more than 200-fold (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at a titer of 10
 <sup>6</sup> Pfu /ml (
