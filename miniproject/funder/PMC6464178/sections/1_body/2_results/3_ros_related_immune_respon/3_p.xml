<p>Next, experiments were designed to assess the temporal relationships between antioxidase immune genes and viral infection in the midgut. The mRNA levels of antioxidant genes were studied 3 hours and at 1, 2, 3, 7, 10 and 15 d.p.i. using a qPCR method. Results showed that ROS-related genes (HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C, CuSOD2 and DUOX) reached their peak levels in the midgut at 1 and 10 d.p.i. (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g005">Fig 5</xref>), and results demonstrate that the level of the virus increased significantly in the DENV-infected mosquito midgut 10 days post blood meal (PBM). Similarly, the protein expression level of HPX8C in DENV infection group was higher than control in the midgut. This result is consistent with the expression of mRNA level of HPX8C above. Therefore, HPX8C may play an important role in the immune response against DENV infection in the mosquito midgut.
