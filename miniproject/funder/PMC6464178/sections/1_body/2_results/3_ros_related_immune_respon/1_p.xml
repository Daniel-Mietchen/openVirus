<p>Transcriptome-based analysis indicates that expression of ROS-related genes was dramatically up-regulated in DENV-infected midguts. Of 27 transcripts of ROS-related genes, 8 were up-regulated in the midgut 1 day post DENV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Expression levels of four members (HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B and HPX8C) of the peroxidase family were up-regulated, while two other transcripts encoding TPX2 and TPX4 were down-regulated (

In the carcass, the fold changes in transcripts of HPX7, HPX8B and HPX8C were not as significant as in the midgut. The up-regulation of transcripts encoding NOX, SOD, DUOX and peroxidases indicates that the ROS pathway is activated by viral infection (
