<p>In order to identify the genes activated in response to viral infection, we performed global transcriptome profiling in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes after blood feeding. DENV-infected blood meal was provided 4 days post eclosion with different titers of virus (10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10
 <sup>7</sup> Pfu/ml). Subsequently, the virus titer was determined in the mosquitoes 10 d.p.i. We observed that the DENV level increased significantly in both the midgut and carcass when fed with a blood meal containing a viral titer of 10
 <sup>6</sup> Pfu/ml (

Interestingly, dynamics of the virus titer were found to be different between the mosquito midgut and carcass during the first week. Then, the virus titer significantly increased at 15 days in the midgut, while it kept increasing from 10 days in the carcass (
