<p>The genes related to replication and repair, amino acid metabolism and transcription occupy the majority of the up-regulated gene transcripts in the midgut. The other functional pathways affected by viral infection include folding, sorting and degradation, signal transduction, lipid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism. The genes related to amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and translation were mostly observed in the carcass 1 d.p.i. However, the gene transcripts that were down-regulated by viral infection 2 d.p.i. in the carcass, were associated with translation, carbohydrate metabolism and replication and repair (
