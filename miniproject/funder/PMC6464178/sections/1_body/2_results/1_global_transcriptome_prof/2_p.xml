<p>The genome-wide transcription profiling approach was applied to investigate the different immune responses generated in the midgut and carcass of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in response to viral infection. The expression profiles of genes in the midgut and carcass were obtained by comparison of the virus challenged transcriptomes at 1, 2 and 7 d.p.i. In total, eight paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed and sequenced. Ultimately, about 92 GB data were obtained, of which each group was represented by at least 20 million reads. All the DEGs were listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007287.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Venn diagram and functional classification analyses were performed to study the commonality and individuality of transcriptome features in the midgut and carcass (

(3053 DEGs and 2528 genes were specifically differentially expressed in midgut) than in the carcass (222 DEGs at 1 d.p.i., 710 DEGs at 2 d.p.i., 191 DEGs at 7 d.p.i.). This result suggests that the genes in midgut are more sensitive to viral infection at the early stage, while the mRNA levels of genes in the carcass are less variable against viral infections (
