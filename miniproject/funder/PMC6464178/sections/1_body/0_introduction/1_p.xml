<p>Hematophagous vectors such as mosquitoes transmit a variety of harmful infections that cause devastating diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika syndrome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Once infected, a mosquito can transmit pathogens to healthy people for the rest of its life [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mosquitoes, like other insects, do not possess adaptive immunity like that of vertebrates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; thus, the innate immune system is essential for controlling parasite and arbovirus infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although interactions between the pathogens and vectors are complex, an in-depth understanding of this could be helpful in developing pathogen control strategies or new ways to control the vector. Much knowledge has already been acquired from research on anti-
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and anti-bacterial defenses of mosquitoes. In the mosquito fat body, Toll and IMD are two major immune signaling pathways. Activation of the Toll and IMD pathways allows NF-κB factors to enter the nucleus and transcriptionally activate the expression of Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and other immunity related genes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. AMPs have broad spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that transgenic mosquitoes co-expressing two or more effector molecules, such as Cecropin A or Defensin A, with synergistic effects on parasites exhibit anti-malarial phenotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The JAK-STAT pathway has also been shown to be involved in anti-
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> defense [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
