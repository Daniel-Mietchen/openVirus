<p>Immune signaling pathways are also universal in antiviral immunity. Toll and the JAK-STAT pathways play essential roles in resistance to ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has also been implicated in the vector immune defense against infecting pathogens, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) [
