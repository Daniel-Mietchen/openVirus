<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxides (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical and superoxide are important immune factors utilized by host insects to kill microbes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The synthesis and degradation of ROS is a multi-step process and involves an array of enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidases. SOD can catalyze the hydrolysis of superoxide into oxygen and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. CAT hydrolyses hydrogen peroxide into H
 <sub>2</sub>O and oxygen, peroxidases, which includes heme peroxidase (HPX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX), can also reduce H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O. An elevated level of ROS has been shown to protect

ROS can kill parasites in the midgut and in the hemocoele of the mosquito and ROS deficiency reduces the mosquito resistance to pathogen infection, increasing the mosquito intestinal epithelial damage, and even leading to mosquito death [
