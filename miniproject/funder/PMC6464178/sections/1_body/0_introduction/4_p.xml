<p>As a model virus, DENV is suitable for the mechanistic study of antiviral immunity in mosquitoes. In this work, the midgut transcriptomes of immunity-related genes were obtained from DENV-challenged mosquitoes. ROS-regulated antioxidant genes were identified as candidate genes related to DENV infection and the role of HPX8C, a ROS-related gene, in antiviral immunity was further studied. Depletion of HPX8C gave rise to ROS enhancement and was shown to play an important role in antiviral immunity against DENV. Therefore, our results provide valuable information for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system in host insects during pathogen transmission, which can aid in the development of novel approaches for more effective control of mosquito borne diseases.</p>
