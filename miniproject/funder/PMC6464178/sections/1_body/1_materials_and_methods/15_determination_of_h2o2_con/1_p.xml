 <sub>2</sub> was determined using the Amplex Red hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Invitrogen, A22188). In detail, dissected tissues were homogenized in 400 μl PBS. Then, samples were centrifuged at 13000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, and 50 μl of the supernatant was transferred into each microplate well of 96-well plates. An equal amount of mixture of the working solution of 100 μM Amplex Red reagent and 0.2 U/ml HRP was added to each well and kept for 30 min in the dark. Fluorescence was monitored using microplate reader Spectramax i3 (Molecular Devices). Excitation and emission wavelength were 530 nm and 590 nm. H
