<p>A 10-ng sample of total RNA was used as the template for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which was performed using a One Step SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real Time, Takara) on a PIKOREAL 96 qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Thermal cycle parameters were 42 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 60 °C for 30 s. Quantitative experiments were performed in biological triplicate, and 40 ribosomal protein 7 (AAEL009496) was used as internal control. Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. One way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test were conducted to test for pairwise differences. Primers are listed in
