<p>Peroxidase assays were performed using Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen, A22188), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissues were dissected in about 200 μl of PBS and were homogenized using a motor-driven pellet pestle mixer (Kontes). The mixture was centrifuged at 13000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 100 μM Amplex Red reagent containing 2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and the mixture was kept in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Fluorescence was then measured at 560 nm (excitation 562 nm) using a microplate reader Spectramax i3 (Molecular Devices). For each data point, the value obtained was deducted from the no-HRP control. Peroxidase content was calculated from the standard curve generated and expressed as U/g of protein.
