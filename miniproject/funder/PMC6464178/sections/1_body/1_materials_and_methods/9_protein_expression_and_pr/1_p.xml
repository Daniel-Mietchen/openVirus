<p>HPX8C was derived from nucleotide position 49â€“2370 bp in the ORF. The cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR following the user manual of the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser kit. The HPX8C was then inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+) using FastCloning method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The recombinant plasmid, confirmed by sequencing, was designated as pET-HPX8C. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against HPX8C was produced at the Beijing Genomics Institute.
