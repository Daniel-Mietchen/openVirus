 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The samples were collected in 0.7 ml RLT buffer (Qiagen) and stored at -80 °C until extraction, at which time they were homogenized using a motor-driven pellet pestle mixer (Kontes). Total RNA was extracted from mosquitoes according to the manufacturer’s instructions using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined on Molecular Devices Spectramax i3 (Molecular Devices).
