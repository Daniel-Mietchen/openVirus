<p>The ROS levels in mosquito tissues were detected using a 10 μM solution of the General Oxidative Stress Indicator, CM-H2DCFDA (5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2’, 7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester, Molecular probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The carcass tissues were incubated with CM-H2DCFDA and were examined under a Zeiss Axioskop 40 with an Axiocam MRC5 using a Zeiss-710 filter set. Identical exposure parameters were used to compare fluorescence levels in different images, which were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope.</p>
