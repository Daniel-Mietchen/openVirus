<p>Mosquito carcasses, 30 each, were homogenized by pellet pestle in 100 μl of lysis buffer [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Aliquots of mosquito protein samples were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore). Then, membranes were blocked with Starting Block T20 (PBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with the primary antibody against HPX8C (1:3000). Following three washes with TBS containing Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Sigma, 1:10000). After washing four times with TBS containing Tween-20, membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate reagent for 5 min (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before visualization. The antibody against α-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as the loading control.
