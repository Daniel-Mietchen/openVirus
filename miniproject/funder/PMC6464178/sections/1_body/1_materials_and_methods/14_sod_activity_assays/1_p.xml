<p>Total SOD activity was determined using the Superoxide Dismutase assay kit (Hydroxylamine method, Nanjing Jian Cheng Bio-engineering Institute, A001–1). First, tissues were dissected in about 200 μl of PBS and samples were homogenized using a motor-driven pellet pestle mixer (Kontes). Then, the mixture samples were subjected to 13000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected following the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (CWbiotech) with BSA as the standard. SOD activity was expressed as U/mg of protein.
