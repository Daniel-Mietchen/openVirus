 <italic>aegypti</italic> HPX8C during DENV infection. The dsRNAs were synthesized using cDNA templates possessing T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequences on both ends (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007287.s003">S3 Table</xref>), according to the protocol of T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi system kit (Promega). Micro-injection of dsRNA was performed as described previously [

A Nanoliter 2000 injector (World Precision Instrument) was used to introduce 0.67 Î¼g per 200 nl dsRNA into the thorax of female mosquitoes 1 day post eclosion [
