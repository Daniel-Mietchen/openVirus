<p>Raw reads obtained from the sequencing were preprocessed using in-house PERL scripts, including adaptor removal and low quality reads filtering. The genome of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (accession ID: AaegL1.4) which was downloaded from VectorBase, was used as the annotation file [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The clean reads were mapped to the genome using Tophat2 to estimate the expression level of all the transcripts with the default parameters [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We used cufflinks to calculate the FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million) of the transcripts, and DEGseq package in R was employed to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To gain insight into the tissue-specific transcriptional changes in response to infection by DENV, we performed pair-wise comparisons between libraries to create a union of the DEGs. The genes with 
 <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 were regarded as differentially expressed. The immune genes were then assigned based on immunodb [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression levels was performed using Pearson distance as the distance measure with average linkage method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Transcriptome data were deposited to NCBI SRA (accession No. SRP110563).
