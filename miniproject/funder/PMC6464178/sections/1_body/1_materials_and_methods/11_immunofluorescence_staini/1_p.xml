<p>Dissected midguts were placed on chamber slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 1 h before antibody incubations. 4G2 (a mouse monoclonal antibody against the E protein of DENV) and the antibody against HPX8C (1: 50) were used as primary antibodies [

The Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen) was added to the last wash for 10 min to stain the nucleus. Subsequently, the chambers were removed from slides, and labeled samples were mounted in Prolong (Invitrogen) for further observations. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope.
