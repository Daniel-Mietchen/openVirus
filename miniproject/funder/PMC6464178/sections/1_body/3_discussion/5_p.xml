<p>Alternatively, reduction in the ROS activity by ROS scavenger or ROS inhibitor resulted in a higher DENV titer than the control group (

Accumulation of ROS induced by dsHPX8C also affects ZIKV levels in mosquitoes. Our previous report indicated that reduction of the ROS level can rescue the defect in infection of E glycosylation site deficient mutant ZIKV in the mosquito midgut [

In the future, we will explore how ROS and HPX8C affect the DENV and the molecular mechanism underlying HPX8C-mediated antiviral responses, thus providing a new theoretical basis for antiviral immunity and virus control.
