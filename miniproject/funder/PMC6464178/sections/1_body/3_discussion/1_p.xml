<p>The expression of genes regulated by viral infection has been shown previously to be tissue-specific [

Thus, the time point of 1 d.p.i. was chosen for future experiments. Additionally, immune responses to DENV in the carcass at early (1 day and 2 days) and late stages (7 days) were also studied. We then conducted RNA sequencing to reveal the gene transcripts of
