<p>In our current study, peroxidases and SODs were found to be induced by viral infection in the early stage, and their expression varied in a dose-dependent manner with increasing DENV titer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These results are similar to previous reports demonstrating up-regulated expression of HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C and CuSOD2 at 1 day after infection with Yellow fever virus, DENV or West Nile virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, we also observed an increase in HPX8A, HPX8B and HPX8C expression after DENV infection in the midgut 1 and 10 d.p.i. (
