   <bold>A</bold>, Heatmap of transcriptional variation in expression of immune-related genes (ROS pathways and AMP genes) in DENV-infected mosquitoes. CC_1d_C, carcass 1 day post normal blood meal; CC_1d_I, carcass 1 day post DENV-infected blood meal; CC_2d_C, carcass 2 days post normal blood meal; CC_2d_I, carcass 2 days post DENV-infected blood meal; CC_7d_C, carcass 7 days post normal blood meal; CC_7d_I, carcass 2 days post DENV-infected blood meal; MG_1d_C, midgut 1 day post normal blood meal; MG_1d_I, midgut 1 day post DENV-infected blood meal. 
   <bold>B</bold>, The regulation of immune pathways in 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> in response to viral infection. The left semicircle represents the midguts of mosquitoes infected by DENV 1 d.p.i., the right semicircle represents the carcasses of mosquitoes infected by DENV 2 d.p.i. The color Red represents gene expression increased by DENV infection. The color Blue represents gene expression decreased by DENV infection. The genes with 
   <italic>p</italic> values less than 0.05 were regarded as differentially expressed.
