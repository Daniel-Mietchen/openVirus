  <title>Temporal variation in mRNA expression of ROS pathway genes in the DENV-infected mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>mRNA levels of HPX8C(A), HPX7(B), HPX8A(C), HPX8B(D), CuSOD2(E), DUOX(F) were detected using qPCR post 10
   <sup>6</sup> Pfu /ml viral infection in 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> midgut. The mRNA levels of HPX8C(G), HPX7(H), HPX8A(I), HPX8B(J), CuSOD2(K), DUOX(L) were detected using qPCR post 10
   <sup>6</sup> Pfu/ml viral infection in 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> carcass. Total RNA was isolated from the midgut or carcass of mosquitoes at seven time points post viral infection. The control is healthy BALB/c mouse blood mixed with RPMI 1640 medium. Identical letters are not significant difference (p &gt; 0.05), while different letters indicate significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) determined by one way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s multiple comparison test. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
