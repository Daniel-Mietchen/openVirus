   <bold>A</bold>, HPX8C mRNA expression at 1 day PBM in the midgut of mosquitoes injected with dsEGFP or dsHPX8C. Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, *** 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. Each treatment group includes 30 mosquitoes. The results were accumulated from three independent experiments. 
   <bold>B</bold>, HPX8C protein expression in mosquitoes injected with dsEGFP or dsHPX8C. 
   <bold>C</bold>, Peroxidase activity measured in the mosquito injected with dsEGFP or dsHPX8C. Peroxidase content was expressed as U/g protein. Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. Data are represented as mean ± SEM, ***

   <sub>2</sub> level in the mosquito injected with dsEGFP or dsHPX8C. H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> content was expressed as μM/g protein. Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, ***

   <bold>E</bold>, Measurement of ROS level in the mosquitoes injected with dsEGFP or dsHPX8C. 
   <bold>F</bold>, Effect of RNAi mediated-HPX8C depletion on DENV viral infection in the mosquito 10 days PBM (13 days post RNAi). Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. Data were produced using qPCR and presented as mean ± SEM, *** 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. Each treatment group comprised 30 mosquitoes. 
   <bold>G</bold>, Immunofluorescent staining of DENV-infected midguts with E protein and HPX8C antibody 10 days PBM. The midgut cell nuclei are stained with Hoechst (blue).
