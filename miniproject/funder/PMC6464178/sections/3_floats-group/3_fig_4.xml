   <bold>A</bold>, SOD activity in the midgut 1 day PBM (normal blood or DENV-infected blood) (mean ± SEM). 
   <bold>B</bold>, Peroxidase activity in the midgut 1 day PBM (normal blood or DENV-infected blood). 
   <bold>C</bold>, Hydrogen peroxide activity in the midgut 1 day PBM (normal blood or DENV-infected blood). All experiments were done in triplicate. Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine the significance of difference in expression between treated and control groups. Data are represented as mean ± SEM; ** 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. The DENV virus was mixed 1:1 with commercial BALB/c mouse blood (the final virus titers are 0 and 10
   <sup>6</sup> Pfu/ml in RPMI 1640 medium).
