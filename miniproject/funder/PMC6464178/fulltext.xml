Dengue virus (DENV) transmitted by mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, is responsible for dengue fever epidemics worldwide with a serious impact on human health. Currently, disease control mainly relies on vector targeted intervention strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the innate immune response of mosquitoes against pathogens. In the present study, the expression profiles of immunity-related genes in the midgut responding to DENV infection by feeding were analyzed by transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR. The level of Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) increased seven days post-infection (d.p.i.), which could be induced by the Toll immune pathway. The expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) genes, including antioxidant genes, such as HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C were induced at one d.p.i. and peaked again at ten d.p.i. in the midgut. Interestingly, down-regulation of the antioxidant gene HPX8C by RNA interference led to reduction in the virus titer in the mosquito, probably due to the elevated levels of ROS. Application of a ROS inhibitor and scavenger molecules further established the role of oxygen free radicals in the modulation of the immune response to DENV infection. Overall, our comparative transcriptome analyses provide valuable information about the regulation of immunity related genes in the transmission vector in response to DENV infection. It further allows us to identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying the host-virus interaction, which might aid in the development of novel strategies to control mosquito-borne diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>HPX8C is a heme-containing peroxidase, which can move reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage to the organism by reducing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. Previously, the peroxidase gene has been shown to modulate midgut immunity and regulate anti-malarial response in mosquitoes. In this study, the classical immune signaling pathways, Toll and IMD genes might be late responses against the viruses. HPX8C was demonstrated here to play a role in antiviral immunity against DENV infection in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>Aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. HPX8C expression was induced by DENV infection and continued to increase with an elevated virus titer. In HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes, the ROS level was found to be increased with a corresponding decrease in the DENV and ZIKV virus titer. Therefore, it was speculated that HPX8C mediated immune responses against the DENV in the mosquito in the late stage of viral infection, which could be controlled by Toll pathway.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>National Key Plan for Scientific Research and Development of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016YFD0500300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ai-Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS</institution></funding-source><award-id>XDB11030600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3550-7656</contrib-id><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS</institution></funding-source><award-id>XDB11030800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Ai-Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>National Basic Research Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>2014CB138405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3550-7656</contrib-id><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the National Key Plan for Scientific Research and Development of China (No. 2016YFD0500300), Strategic Priority Research Program of the CAS (No. XDB11030600, XDB11030800), National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2014CB138405).

Once infected, a mosquito can transmit pathogens to healthy people for the rest of its life [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mosquitoes, like other insects, do not possess adaptive immunity like that of vertebrates [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; thus, the innate immune system is essential for controlling parasite and arbovirus infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although interactions between the pathogens and vectors are complex, an in-depth understanding of this could be helpful in developing pathogen control strategies or new ways to control the vector. Much knowledge has already been acquired from research on anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> and anti-bacterial defenses of mosquitoes. In the mosquito fat body, Toll and IMD are two major immune signaling pathways. Activation of the Toll and IMD pathways allows NF-&#x003ba;B factors to enter the nucleus and transcriptionally activate the expression of Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and other immunity related genes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. AMPs have broad spectrum activity against bacteria, fungi and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has been reported that transgenic mosquitoes co-expressing two or more effector molecules, such as Cecropin A or Defensin A, with synergistic effects on parasites exhibit anti-malarial phenotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The JAK-STAT pathway has also been shown to be involved in anti-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> defense [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Immune signaling pathways are also universal in antiviral immunity. Toll and the JAK-STAT pathways play essential roles in resistance to ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has also been implicated in the vector immune defense against infecting pathogens, such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Reports demonstrated that <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> activated the RNAi, JAK/STAT and Toll pathways 10 days post viral infection, thereby limiting the viral infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. C-type lectins (CTL) in arthropods interact with viruses and facilitate the infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. <italic>Mos</italic>GCTL-3 (mosquito galactose-specific C-type lectin-1) was induced by DENV, interacting with its E protein [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>Mos</italic>PTP-1 can recruit <italic>mos</italic>GCTL-1 to enhance the viral entry [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Microbiota in mosquitoes has been shown to influence DENV infection, and viral infection activates anti-bacterial responses [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. NS1 proteins have been used to enhance flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and a lethal infection with this virus was shown to be prevented by a conserved antiviral mechanism, which may facilitate the transmission of flavivirus in nature [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radical and superoxide are important immune factors utilized by host insects to kill microbes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The synthesis and degradation of ROS is a multi-step process and involves an array of enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidases. SOD can catalyze the hydrolysis of superoxide into oxygen and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. CAT hydrolyses hydrogen peroxide into H<sub>2</sub>O and oxygen, peroxidases, which includes heme peroxidase (HPX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX), can also reduce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. An elevated level of ROS has been shown to protect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> from virus-induced mortality and is associated with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated antiviral immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The regulation of ROS balance in mosquitoes is complex. ROS can kill parasites in the midgut and in the hemocoele of the mosquito and ROS deficiency reduces the mosquito resistance to pathogen infection, increasing the mosquito intestinal epithelial damage, and even leading to mosquito death [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].

In this work, the midgut transcriptomes of immunity-related genes were obtained from DENV-challenged mosquitoes. ROS-regulated antioxidant genes were identified as candidate genes related to DENV infection and the role of HPX8C, a ROS-related gene, in antiviral immunity was further studied. Depletion of HPX8C gave rise to ROS enhancement and was shown to play an important role in antiviral immunity against DENV. Therefore, our results provide valuable information for understanding the evolution of the innate immune system in host insects during pathogen transmission, which can aid in the development of novel approaches for more effective control of mosquito borne diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The mouse studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Chinese Regulations of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology of People&#x02019;s Republic of China) and Laboratory Animal-Requirements of Environment and Housing Facilities (GB 14925&#x02013;2010, National Laboratory Animal Standardization Technical Committee).

Additionally, the carcass of HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes was dissected for detection of ROS activity under a confocal microscope using a CM-H2DCFDA assay kit. Compared with mosquitoes injected with dsEGFP, HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes showed higher ROS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). To study the effect of the decreased ROS level on viral infection, we measured the DENV titer in HPX8C RNAi-treated mosquitoes. In the midgut, the virus titer was found to be 66.42% lower in these HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes than in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). This result was confirmed using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g006">Fig 6G</xref>).</p><p>The ROS scavenger APO is a selective NADPH oxidase inhibitor that prevents the production of the ROS. Another ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), contains thiol (-SH), which upon oxidation can reduce the disulfide bond in the biological macromolecules and remove ROS at the same time. In our study, the HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes were treated with APO and NAC followed by infection with DENV. In the APO-treated group, the viral titer in the whole body was 2.12 times higher than in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), and was 4.07 times higher in the NAC-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). From the above results, it can be speculated that ROS may play an important role in the DENV infection process. In order to investigate whether the impact of HPX8C applies to other viruses, we measured the ZIKV titer in HPX8C RNAi-treated mosquitoes. Interestingly, ZIKV titer in these HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes decreased by 65.85% than in the EGFP-depleted group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0007287.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0007287.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Reduced levels of ROS affect the anti-dengue virus defense.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Effect of treatment with ROS scavenger APO on DENV infection in the mosquito 10 days PBM (13 days post RNAi) (mean &#x000b1; SEM). <bold>B</bold>, Effect of ROS inhibitor NAC treatment on DENV infection in the mosquito 10 days PBM (13 days post RNAi) (mean &#x000b1; SEM).

The midgut is the first line of mosquito defense from invading pathogens. Our study showed that the virus titer in the midgut decreased significantly at 1 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007287.s004">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that host genes may trigger an anti-dengue immune response to reduce the virus titer. Thus, the time point of 1 d.p.i. was chosen for future experiments. Additionally, immune responses to DENV in the carcass at early (1 day and 2 days) and late stages (7 days) were also studied. We then conducted RNA sequencing to reveal the gene transcripts of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> affected by DENV infection.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated the role of the Toll pathway in regulation of DENV infection in <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The JAK-STAT pathway has also been suggested to play a pivotal role in anti-dengue response in mosquitoes, independent of the Toll and RNAi pathways [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. AMPs form a line of immune defense against pathogen invading in the host [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and expression levels of AMP genes were found to be decreased in both midgut (8 of 15 AMP genes) and carcass (5 of 15 AMP genes) at 1 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and then subsequently increased in the carcass (8 of 15 AMP genes) at 7 d.p.i., consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It appears that Toll pathways play a significant role at the late stage of viral infection. This result is consistent with previous findings [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The phenoloxidase (PO) cascade has been shown to play a key role in defense against Semliki Forest virus in mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], although its role in antiviral immunity of mosquitoes is unclear. In our study, prophenoloxidase1 (PPO1), PPO3 and PPO5 were induced by the DENV in the mosquito midgut at 1 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007287.s002">S2 Table</xref>). However, understanding the specific mechanism behind PO-mediated antiviral immunity needs further investigation.</p><p>In our current study, peroxidases and SODs were found to be induced by viral infection in the early stage, and their expression varied in a dose-dependent manner with increasing DENV titer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These results are similar to previous reports demonstrating up-regulated expression of HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C and CuSOD2 at 1 day after infection with Yellow fever virus, DENV or West Nile virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similarly, we also observed an increase in HPX8A, HPX8B and HPX8C expression after DENV infection in the midgut 1 and 10 d.p.i. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007287.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). Previous report indicated that elevated ROS level are controlled by Toll pathway [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It was speculated that peroxidases and SODs were involved in responses against the DENV in the mosquito. In mice, another peroxidase, GPX-1, can reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response caused by influenza A virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In airway epithelial cells, increasing antioxidant can significantly affect respiratory syncytial virus-associated oxidative cellular signaling and cell damage [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast, the expression of ROS-related genes (HPX2, HPX7, HPX8A, HPX8B, HPX8C, MnSOD1 and TPX2) was inhibited in the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> midgut 1 day after infection with <italic>Plasmodium gallinaceum</italic>, whereas DBLOX, DUOX1, TPX3 and TPX2 levels were induced [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it might be suggested that the function of ROS-related genes was different in anti-malarial response and anti-DENV immunity.</p><p>ROS generated in response to viral infection in epithelial cells can lead to lung injury by inducing oxidative stress and inflammation [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

In our study, the DENV and ZIKV viral titer in the HPX8C-depleted mosquitoes decreased significantly (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g006">6F and 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007287.g007">7C</xref>). The level of HPX8c affects both DENV and ZIKV levels, indicating that the role of HPX8C is universal.

These findings imply ROS was related to antivirus immunity. ROS is also a major anti-pathogenic molecule induced by pulmonary influenza viral infections [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this study, the antioxidants and ROS have been found to be associated with the early stage of antiviral immunity. Accumulation of ROS induced by dsHPX8C also affects ZIKV levels in mosquitoes. Our previous report indicated that reduction of the ROS level can rescue the defect in infection of E glycosylation site deficient mutant ZIKV in the mosquito midgut [<xref rid="pntd.0007287.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This result provides new research clues for our research. In the future, we will explore how ROS and HPX8C affect the DENV and the molecular mechanism underlying HPX8C-mediated antiviral responses, thus providing a new theoretical basis for antiviral immunity and virus control.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>RUNX4: EU604102; <italic>Mos</italic>GCTL-3: AAEL000535; <italic>mos</italic>GCTL-1: AAEL000563; <italic>Mos</italic>PTP-1: AAEL013105; NS1 proteins of DENV1 (GZ/XNC strain): FJ176780; NS1 proteins of DENV3 (ThD3 strain): AY676352; NS1 proteins of DENV type 2 strain 43: AF204178.1; NS1 proteins of ZIKV MR766 NIID strain: HQ234498; 40S ribosomal protein 7: AAEL009496.
