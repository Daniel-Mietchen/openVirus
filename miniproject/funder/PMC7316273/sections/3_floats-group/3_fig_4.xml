  <title>Phylogenetic tree of the 
   <italic>VP7</italic> gene.
  </title>
  <p>Evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured by the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 252 nucleotide sequences. All positions with &lt;95% site coverage were eliminated.</p>
