<p>All samples positive for rotavirus 
 <italic>VP6</italic> screening can be sequenced for complete 
 <italic>VP6</italic> genome, whereas 99.1% (224/226) and 89% (201/226) of samples can be sequenced for complete 
 <italic>VP7</italic> and 
 <italic>VP4</italic> gene, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of 
 <italic>VP6</italic> (I type) led to identification that sequences obtained in this study were clustered in 3 groups, Wa-like (I1) (31.9%, 72/226), DS-1-like (I2) (67.7%, 153/226), and AU-1-like (I3) (0.4%, 1/226) (

 <italic>VP7</italic> gene showed the different clustering of between Wa-like 
 <italic>G3</italic> and unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3</italic> which clustered in different lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235280.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The percentage of nucleotide identity between Wa-like and unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3</italic> was 81% while amino acid identity was 91%. Multiple amino acid variations were detected, especially in antigenic regions C (T212A and N213T) and F (N238D and N242A). The 
 <italic>P[8] VP4</italic> gene did not cluster in the different lineages and correlate with the phylogenetic tree of 
 <italic>VP7</italic> (
