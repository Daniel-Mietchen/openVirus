<p>In this study, specimens from patients aged between 15–96 years old were investigated. The mean and median age of patients were 46.7 and 44.0 years, respectively. Among the 2,598 stool samples from adults (≥15 years) with acute gastroenteritis, 8.7% (226/2,598) were positive for RV based on the real-time RT-PCR 
 <italic>VP6</italic> primary screening assay (74 male and 152 female). The prevalence of RV infection was high during the winter season (November–March) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0235280.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Between July 2017 and June 2018, the prevalence of rotavirus infection in adults was highest among the three-year study period and accounted for 17.7% (179/1013). The rate of RV infection was highest in the 30–59 year age group (56.6%, 128/226), followed by 15–29 year age group (28.3%, 64/226), and ≥ 59 year age group (15.1%, 34/226) as shown in
