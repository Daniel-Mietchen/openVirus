<p>In this study, the molecular characteristics of RV in adult patients with gastroenteritis in Bangkok, Thailand were investigated over a 3-year period (July 2016– December 2019) using a large number of stool specimens collected from various age groups. The RV genotype 
 <italic>G3P[8]I2</italic> (unusual DS-1-like 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic>) was the most dominant strain (29.6%), followed by 
 <italic>G9P[8]I1</italic> (Wa-like 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic>; 16.4%) and 
 <italic>G2P[4]I2</italic> (DS-1-like 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic>; 15.0%). The previous report from six provinces in Thailand showed that 
 <italic>G3P[8]I2</italic> has emerged in Thailand since 2015 [

 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but lower than a study in Bangkok which had a relatively small sample size [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, all of the previous studies agreed that the incidence of RV infection in adults increased during the winter season (November–March) indicating a similar seasonality pattern to that reported in children population [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Apart from being seasonal-specific, rotavirus gastroenteritis can be transmitted from children to adults [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, our study did not include the history of contact with sick children, therefore, the burden of RV gastroenteritis from children-to-adult transmission cannot be determined. The results of this study showed that rotavirus was an important agent for acute gastroenteritis in adults, and should not be underestimated.
