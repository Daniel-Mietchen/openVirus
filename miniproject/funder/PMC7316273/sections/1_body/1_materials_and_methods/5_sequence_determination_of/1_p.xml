<p>Samples initially tested positive based on 
 <italic>VP6</italic> screening were further subjected to amplification of genes encoding the structural proteins VP6, VP7, and VP4 using the SensiFAST 1-step RT-PCR kit (Bioline, London, UK). Consensus primer pairs specific for the 
 <italic>VP6</italic> gene from the study of Theamboonlers 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] were used for amplification. The consensus primer pairs of BEG9/END9 and con2/con3 were used for amplification of 
 <italic>VP7</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 
 <italic>VP4</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], respectively. The 25 μL RT-PCR mixture contained 2X buffer, 10μM of consensus forward and reverse primers and 2 μL RNA. Reverse transcription steps included incubation at 45°C for 30 min, followed by 94°C for 5 min. PCR conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 55°C for 45 sec, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. Amplicons were agarose gel-purified and sequenced by FirstBASE Laboratories (SDN BHD, Salangor, Malaysia).
