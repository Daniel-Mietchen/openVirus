<p>At present, two live oral RV vaccines, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A., wavre, Belgium; RV1, 
 <italic>G1P[8]</italic>) and RotaTeq (Merck&amp;Co., Inc., Whitehouse, NJ; RV5, 
 <italic>G1-G4</italic>, and 
 <italic>P[8]</italic>), with high efficacy, are licensed in more than 100 countries. However, vaccine efficacy clearly varies among different populations and drives the evolution of more dynamic and diverse wild-type strain populations in the post-vaccine era [
