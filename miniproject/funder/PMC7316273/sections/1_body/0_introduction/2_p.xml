<p>RV is a double-stranded RNA genome virus. RV belongs to the 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family and is classified into 10 species (A-J) based on antigenic and genetic variants of viral protein 6 (
 <italic>VP6)</italic>. Among the species, Rotavirus group A (RVA) is commonly found in children worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The triple-layered viral particle composed of 11 gene segments encoding six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or six non-structural proteins (NSP1 to NSP5/NSP6) [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Genetic characterization of the 
 <italic>VP6</italic> gene is used to differentiate between RV groups. VP7 and VP4 comprise the outer layer of the virion and thus form the basis of a binary classification system defining G (glycoprotein) and P (protease) genotypes, respectively. In the genotyping system, the genotype constellation is described by the nomenclature 
 <italic>Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx</italic>, which defines the genotypes of 
 <italic>VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5</italic>, respectively, with x indicating the number of corresponding genotypes [

 <italic>H</italic> genotypes among the RVA have been identified in human and animal species worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To date, 
 <italic>6 G</italic> genotypes (
 <italic>G1-G4</italic>, 
 <italic>G9</italic>, and 
 <italic>G12</italic>) and 
 <italic>3 P</italic> genotypes (
 <italic>P[4]</italic>, 
 <italic>P[6]</italic>, and 
 <italic>P[8]</italic>) have been commonly identified within the 
 <italic>G-P</italic> combinations of RVA. In humans, the predominant RV genotypes are 
 <italic>G1P[8]</italic>, 
 <italic>G2P[4]</italic>, 
 <italic>G3P[8]</italic>, 
 <italic>G4P[8]</italic>, 
 <italic>G9P[8]</italic>, and 
 <italic>G12P[8]</italic>, which often vary by region and time and are particularly prevalent in developing countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0235280.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In humans, the major RV strains consist of the Wa-like genogroup (
 <italic>G1</italic>, 
 <italic>G3</italic>, 
 <italic>G4</italic>, 
 <italic>G9</italic>, or 
 <italic>G12-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1</italic>), DS-1-like genogroup (
 <italic>G2-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2</italic>) and the less common AU-1-like genogroup (
 <italic>G3-P[9]-I3-R3-C3-M3-A3-N3-T3-E3-H3</italic>) which have origins in distinct animal species. The segmented nature of the genome enables both intra- and inter-genogroup reassortment between/within animal and human strains, which can lead to the wide spread among humans. Interspecies reassortment derived from zoonotic transmission increase the genetic diversity among circulating RV and the incidence of acute gastroenterisits in human [

 <italic>G1/3/8/9-P[8]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2</italic> have emerged and spread among human populations in at least five continents (Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America) [
