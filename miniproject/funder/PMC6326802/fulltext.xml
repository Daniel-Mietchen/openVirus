<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) constitutes one of the most abundant internal RNA modifications and is critical for RNA metabolism and function. It has been previously reported that viral RNA contains internal m<sup>6</sup>A modifications; however, only recently the function of m<sup>6</sup>A modification in viral RNAs has been elucidated during infections of HIV, hepatitis C virus and Zika virus. In the present study, we found that enterovirus 71 (EV71) RNA undergoes m<sup>6</sup>A modification during viral infection, which alters the expression and localization of the methyltransferase and demethylase of m<sup>6</sup>A, and its binding proteins. Moreover, knockdown of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase resulted in decreased EV71 replication, whereas knockdown of the demethylase had the opposite effect. Further study showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A binding proteins also participate in the regulation of viral replication. In particular, two m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites were identified in the viral genome, of which mutations resulted in decreased virus replication, suggesting that m<sup>6</sup>A modification plays an important role in EV71 replication. Notably, we found that METTL3 interacted with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and induced enhanced sumoylation and ubiquitination of the 3D polymerase that boosted viral replication. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m<sup>6</sup>A modification complex interacts with viral proteins to modulate EV71 replication.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Ministry of Science and Technology of China</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002855</named-content></funding-source><award-id>2016YFC1200400</award-id></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chinese Academy of Sciences</named-content><named-content content-type="funder-identifier">10.13039/501100002367</named-content></funding-source><award-id>ZDRW-ZS-2016-4</award-id><award-id>2015SPCAS002</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="SEC1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chemical modifications of RNA are critical for RNA metabolism, function, and localization. One of the most abundant internal RNA modifications is <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), which is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex consisting of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and other proteins such as KIAA1429, RBM15&#x000a0;and RBM15B (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;11</xref>). In turn, FTO and ALKBH5 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref>) constitute m<sup>6</sup>A demethylases that remove the methyl groups from RNA. YTH proteins bind to m<sup>6</sup>A sites and play critical roles in various biological processes, such as mRNA stability (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>), RNA structure (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), mRNA nuclear export (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), mRNA splicing (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)&#x000a0;and translation (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Overall, the internal m<sup>6</sup>A modification of mRNA is mainly distributed in translation start sites, stop codons, and 3&#x02032; untranslated regions (3&#x02032; UTRs) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>The internal m<sup>6</sup>A modification of viral RNA was identified 40 years ago during infections of viruses that replicate in nucleus, such as influenza virus, simian virus 40 (SV40), and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref>). However, only recently the function of m<sup>6</sup>A began to be unraveled during virus infection. During infections of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SV40, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and influenza virus, it has been shown that these viral RNAs contain m<sup>6</sup>A modifications, which affect viral replication and gene expression (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;34</xref>). Viruses that whose genomes replicate in the cytoplasm, such as VSV, vaccinia virus and reovirus, have also been reported to contain m<sup>6</sup>A-modified 5&#x02032; caps (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;38</xref>). Other cytoplasm replicating viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus, yellow fever virus and West Nile virus, have been shown to contain internal m<sup>6</sup>A modifications that are involved in virus replication (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). All together, these reports indicate that cellular m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases may be active in the cytoplasm and that viral RNA is perhaps m<sup>6</sup>A-methylated during infection.</p><p>As an important human pathogen, enterovirus type 71 (EV71) is a non-enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) that has three genotypes (A, B and C) and several sub-genotypes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In recent years, EV71 has been the major pathogenic enterovirus responsible for hand-foot-and-mouth disease epidemics in Asia. Notably, since 2008, large-scale outbreaks of hand-foot-and-mouth disease have been reported yearly in mainland China, which resulted in hundreds of deaths and were caused mainly by the c4a clade of the C4 EV71 subtype (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 RNA contains m<sup>6</sup>A modification and investigated its function during EV71 C4 subtype infection. We found that the expression and localization of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins were affected upon virus infection. Moreover, perturbation of the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins or mutation of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites altered viral replication, suggesting that the host m<sup>6</sup>A machinery is involved in viral replication. Notably, we showed that the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase METTL3 not only interacted with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 3D, but also induced sumoylation and ubiquitination of the polymerase, which have been reported to facilitate its stability and boost viral replication (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Taken together, our findings implied that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of EV71 RNA constitutes an important process in the regulation of viral replication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="SEC2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="SEC2-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Vero (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA; CCL-81), HEK293T (ATCC, CRL-11268)&#x000a0;and RD (ATCC, CCL-136) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="SEC2-2"><title>Viruses</title><p>EV71 (strain XF; Microorganisms &#x00026; Viruses Culture Collection Center (MVCCC)) was obtained from the MVCCC, Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

HEK293T cells were transfected with pMETTL3, pMETTL14, pHA-WTAP, and pFlag-3D. Co-IP was performed with anti-Flag or IgG (G), or anti-HA or IgG (H), or anti-METTL14 or IgG (I) antibodies. The immunoblots were probed with indicated antibodies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gky1007fig6"/></fig><p>The methyltransferase complex is consisted of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and other component proteins. To investigate whether METTL14 and WTAP interact with 3D, METTL14, HA-WTAP, METTL3 and Flag-3D were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, followed by IP with indicated antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">I</xref>). Notably, METTL14 and WTAP were pulled down by 3D protein or vice versa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">I</xref>), indicating that METTL14 and WTAP interacted with 3D. Though 3D interacts with the main components of methyltransferase, the catalytic active site (DPPW) of METTL3 was not involved in the interaction between METTL3 and 3D (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7C and D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the 3D mutant genomic RNA was pulled down by an anti-m<sup>6</sup>A antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S8D</xref>), suggesting that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of viral RNA was not dependent on the interaction between 3D and METTL3.</p><p>As sumoylation and ubiquitination levels are known to enhance the stability of 3D and facilitate EV71 replication (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and METTL3 expression is also linked to EV71 replication, we next investigated whether METTL3 affected the modification of 3D. To this end, METTL3 or shMETTL3, Flag-3D, HA-SUMO-1, myc-Ubc-9&#x000a0;or HA-Ub were expressed in HEK293T cells by transfection. We found that overexpression of METTL3 induced enhanced sumoylation and ubiquitination of 3D (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>) whereas <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown led to a decrease in 3D sumoylation or ubiquitination (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">D</xref>). Futhermore, restored METTL3 expression in knockdown cells resulted in elevated 3D modification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9A and B</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that the expression of METTL3 is involved in the regulation of viral 3D protein modification, the status of which affects viral replication.</p><fig id="F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>The expression of METTL3 regulates the sumoylation and ubiquitination levels of 3D.

Knockdown of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins in host cells affected viral replication. In addition, mutation of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites in the infectious clone decreased EV71 progeny virus production and protein expression, which is similar to the effect of <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown. Notably, we found that METTL3 interacted with viral RdRp 3D protein and regulated its modification to modulate viral replication. Thus, our findings demonstrated that m<sup>6</sup>A modification represents an important component in the regulation of EV71 replication.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A has been identified in infection of both RNA and DNA viruses. Assessment of the internal m<sup>6</sup>A modification status of EV71 RNA using MeRIP followed by Northern blotting revealed that an m<sup>6</sup>A antibody binds to EV71 RNA. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of viral RNA confirmed that EV71 RNA contains m<sup>6</sup>A with a ratio of m<sup>6</sup>A/A of &#x0223c;0.09%. Moreover, m<sup>6</sup>A peaks spanning the full length of EV71 RNA were identified by MeRIP-Seq. Thus, these results revealed that EV71 RNA was m<sup>6</sup>A-methylated. However, as EV71 does not encode any known methyltransferase, host methyltransferases appear to play a critical role in m<sup>6</sup>A methylation.</p><p>We also found that the expression of m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins was altered by virus infection. METTL3 and METTL14, the key components of methyltransferases, together with YTH proteins, were up-regulated. Among demethylases, however, the expression of FTO was decreased; whereas ALKBH5 was not affected by EV71 infection. These data implied that EV71 infection altered host proteins expression to enhance RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modifications, which may promote viral infection. The expression of ALKBH5 was not affected during EV71 infection. ALKBH5 preferentially binds to the CDS shortly after the start codon and only targets a small subset of m<sup>6</sup>A sites installed by METTL3 (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Our results showed that the expression of FTO was linked to the replication of EV71, indicating that the demethylation of EV71 RNA was mainly catalyzed by FTO. Methyltransferases and demethylases localize in the nucleus of Vero cells while YTH proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, METTL3, METTL14, FTO and YTH proteins were redistributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm upon EV71 infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A previous study showed that during heat shock, YTHDF2 relocalizes to the nucleus in order to prevent FTO-mediated demethylation of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of stress-induced transcripts (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). EV71 infection may induce a cellular stress that is similar to the stress of heat shock, which may be the reason that m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins relocated under EV71 infection. We also found that these m<sup>6</sup>A-related proteins co-localized with the viral capsid protein VP1, supporting that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification machinery can modify cytoplasmic EV71 RNA during EV71 infection.</p><p>m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been linked to viral replication and gene expression. Knockdown of methyltransferases or demethylases decrease or increase HIV replication (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref>). However, silencing of METTL3 or FTO has the opposite effect on the replication of HCV (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Due to the different replication locations of HIV and HCV, we tested the effect of methyltransferases or demethylases on EV71 replication in Vero cells. Our results showed that m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases and demethylases regulate EV71 replication, which is in an agreement with the recent reports that the m<sup>6</sup>A machinery regulates HCV, HIV and influenza virus infection (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In particular, knockdown of <italic>METTL3</italic> down-regulated EV71 replication, which was similar to HIV. Moreover, mutation of the m<sup>6</sup>A modification sites in the infectious clone of EV71 followed by rescuing and titration of the mutant viruses decreased replication of the mutants viruses, compared to the wild-type virus, which was consistent with the result in <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown.</p><p>Knockdown of <italic>YTHDF2</italic> and <italic>YTHDF3</italic> in Vero cells led to significantly decreased viral replication at 12- and 24-hpi(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5E and F</xref>). Considering that the expression of YTHDF1-3 was low in Vero cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), we knocked down YTH proteins in EV71-permissive RD cells. We found that knockdown of <italic>YTHDF1-3</italic> proteins in RD cells led to increased EV71 replication, which was similar to HCV and ZIKV (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Our results showed that YTH proteins have different roles on EV71 replication in different cell lines. However, the mechanism by which YTH proteins affect viral replication remains unknown. As Vero cells do not express interferon (IFN), we are currently studying whether the IFN signaling pathway plays a role in the m<sup>6</sup>A-regulated viral replication. We also tested whether the nuclear m<sup>6</sup>A binding protein YTHDC1 affects EV71 replication. The results showed that YTHDC1 positively regulates EV71 replication in RD cells, which is similar to YTHDF1, 2 and 3. Our data thus showed that both the nuclear and cytoplasmic m<sup>6</sup>A readers regulate viral replication in RD cells.</p><p>To address how EV71 hijacks the m<sup>6</sup>A modification machinery to facilitate virus replication, we performed METTL3 IP to check viral protein interactions. The results showed that METTL3 interacted with 3D. Notably, METTl14 and 3D are the components of 3D-METTL3 complex, indicating that the methyltransferase interact with viral protein. Moreover, in the presence of 3D expression, METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which confirms the interaction between METTL3 and 3D and may explain the presence of METTL3 in the cytoplasm during EV71 infection. However, the catalytic site of METTL3 was not involved in the interaction between METTL3 and 3D protein. Importantly, METTL3 promoted sumoylation and ubiquitination of 3D to facilitate viral replication (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), which indicates that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification machinery plays an important role in EV71 infection.</p><p>Collectively, we present evidence supporting the importance of m<sup>6</sup>A modification for the replication of EV71. The expression and localization of the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation machinery were affected by EV71 virus infection. The expression of proteins in the m<sup>6</sup>A methylation machinery in turn regulated viral replication. Mutation of the m<sup>6</sup>A sites decreased viral replication. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms, such as how the methyltransferases, demethylases and YTH proteins alter their localization and whether viral non-structural proteins play a role in the methylation process. In addition, our study suggests m<sup>6</sup>A modification may be a novel target for antivirals of EV71.</p></sec><sec id="SEC5"><title>DATA AVAILABILITY</title><p>Complete CDS sequence of EV71 (strain XF) used in this work has been deposited with the National Center for Biotechnology Information under accession number JQ804832.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="gky1007_supplemental_files.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Hailin Wang for help with UHPLC-MS/MS, and all of the members of the laboratory of WXG for discussions and critical reading.
