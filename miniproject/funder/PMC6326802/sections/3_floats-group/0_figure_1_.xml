  <p>EV71 genomic RNA contains m
   <sup>6</sup>A modifications. (
   <bold>A</bold>) UHPLC-MS/MS. EV71 RNA was harvested from large-scale culture and subjected to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The percentage of m
   <sup>6</sup>A among A residues is presented on the y axis. (B and C) MeRIP-Northern blotting. RNAs from virus infected Vero cells (
   <bold>B</bold>) or from 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> T7 transcription (
   <bold>C</bold>) were incubated with IgG or m
   <sup>6</sup>A-specific antibody, followed by IP. RNAs were resolved on 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to Hybond-N
   <sup>+</sup> membranes. The RNA signal was detected using an EV71 probe spanning from nt 1to nt 7405. (
   <bold>D</bold>) MeRIP-Seq. Total RNA was extracted from EV71-infected Vero cells and fragmented by ZnCl
   <sub>2</sub>. The fragmented RNA was subjected to IP by using an m
   <sup>6</sup>A-specific antibody followed by next-generation sequencing. Methylation coverage on the full-length input EV71 RNA and MeRIP-Seq are presented in blue and red, respectively. Representative of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 determinations.
