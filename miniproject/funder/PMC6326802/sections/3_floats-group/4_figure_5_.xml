  <p>Mutation of m
   <sup>6</sup>A sites influences the replication of EV71. (
   <bold>A</bold>) AMV reverse transcriptase and Tth DNA polymerase primer extension analysis of m
   <sup>6</sup>A sites in EV71. Total RNA was extracted from EV71-infected Vero cells. Primers were designed to probe for m
   <sup>6</sup>A modification at EV71 A3055 and A4555. AMV and Tth primer extensions for these two sites were performed using 10 μg poly(A)-enriched RNA from EV71-infected Vero cells. Extension of 28S RNA at A4190 served as a positive control. Relative gray intensity of extended bands in extension versus probe was quantified using ImageJ program. Data are presented as the means ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Diagram of EV71 wild-type (WT) and m
   <sup>6</sup>A mutants. Sequences of WT and mutants are presented. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Growth curves of EV71 WT and m
   <sup>6</sup>A mutant in Vero cells. The cultures of Vero cells infected with EV71 WT or m
   <sup>6</sup>A mutants were harvested at the indicated times post infection to plot the growth curves. The data are shown as the means ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Significant differences were determined using Unpaired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (*
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05, **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01). (
   <bold>D</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>) Viral titers (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml) at 12 and 24 hpi. Vero cells in which 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> was knocked down or not were infected by EV71 WT, Mut1 or Mut2. At the indicated times post infection, the supernatants were collected to determine virus titers as TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. The data presented represent the mean viral titers and SDs from three independent experiments. Significant differences were determined using the Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test (**
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01).
