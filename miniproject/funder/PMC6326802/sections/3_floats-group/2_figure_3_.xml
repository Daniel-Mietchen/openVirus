  <p>Expression of methyltransferases and demethylases regulate m
   <sup>6</sup>A and the replication of EV71. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Western blotting. Flag-METTL3 and Flag-FTO were overexpressed in RD cells. The expression of METTL3 and FTO was checked using anti-Flag antibody. Vector-transfected cells were used as a control. (
   <bold>B</bold> &amp; 
   <bold>C</bold>) Formaldehyde-RIP-qPCR. Cell lysates from formaldehyde-crosslinking were subjected to IP with an anti-Flag antibody or IgG and quantified by qRT-PCR. IgG was used as a negative control. Unpaired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test was performed and data are presented as the means ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01. (
   <bold>D</bold> and 
   <bold>E</bold>) Western blotting. 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> and 
   <italic>FTO</italic> were knocked down in Vero cells by shRNA. Western blotting was carried out to check the expression of METTL3 and FTO. shNC was used as a control (
   <bold>F</bold>) MeRIP-qPCR. RNA was extracted from EV71-infected Vero cells in which 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> or 
   <italic>FTO</italic> was knocked down, isolated by Me-RIP, and quantified by qRT-PCR. Total intracellular EV71 RNA was used as a control. Unpaired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test was performed and data are presented as the means ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Viral titers (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml) at 12 and 24 hpi. Vero cells in which 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> was knocked down or not were infected by EV71, and the supernatants were collected at indicated times post infection to measure virus titers as TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. The data presented are the mean viral titers and SDs from three independent experiments. Significant differences were determined using the Student 
   <italic>t</italic> test (**
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01). (
   <bold>H</bold> and 
   <bold>I</bold>) qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted at the indicated times from EV71-infected Vero cells in which 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> or 
   <italic>FTO</italic> was knocked down or not. Quantification of EV71 RNA by qRT-PCR, with 
   <italic>GAPDH</italic> used as a control. Unpaired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test was performed and data are presented as the means ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). *
