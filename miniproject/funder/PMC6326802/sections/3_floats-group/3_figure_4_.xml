  <p>Replication of EV71 is regulated by YTH proteins in RD cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) Western blotting. 
   <italic>YTHDF1-3</italic> and 
   <italic>YTHDC1</italic> were knocked down in RD cells by shRNA. The expression of YTH proteins was detected by western blotting with the respective antibodies. (
   <bold>E</bold>–
   <bold>H</bold>) qRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted at indicated times from EV71-infected RD cells in which 
   <italic>YTHDF1-3</italic> or 
   <italic>YTHDC1</italic> were knocked down or not. Quantification of EV71 RNA by qRT-PCR, with 
   <italic>GAPDH</italic> used as a control. Unpaired Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test was performed. Data are presented as the means ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). *
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05, **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01. (
   <bold>I</bold>) Viral titers (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/ml) at 12 and 24 hpi. RD cells in which 
   <italic>YTHDC1</italic> was knocked down or not were infected by EV71, and the supernatants were collected at indicated times post infection to measure virus titers as TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. The data presented are the mean viral titers and SDs from three independent experiments. Significant differences were determined using the Student's 
   <italic>t</italic> test (**
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01).
