  <p>EV71 infection influences the expression patterns of m
   <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, and YTH proteins. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Western blotting. Vero cells infected with EV71 (MOI = 1) were harvested at 24 and 48 hpi. Western blotting was performed with antibodies as indicated. GAPDH was used as a loading control. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>I</bold>) Confocal microscopy images of EV71- or mock-infected Vero cells. The nucleus (blue) and virus protein (red) were labeled with Hoechst and VP1-specific antibody, respectively. The methyltransferases, demethylases, and YTH proteins (green) were stained with antibodies as indicated. Scale bars, 5 μm.
