  <p>The expression of METTL3 regulates the sumoylation and ubiquitination levels of 3D. (
   <bold>A</bold> &amp;and 
   <bold>B</bold>) Sumoylation assay. 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> was overexpressed or knocked down in HEK293T cells by transfection with pMETTL3 or shRNA, and then the cells were transfected with pFlag-3D, pHA-SUMO-1, and pMyc-Ubc9. IP and immunoblot analysis were performed using the indicated antibodies for the sumoylation assay. (
   <bold>C</bold>â€“
   <bold>F</bold>) Ubiquitination assay. HEK293T cells were transfected by pFlag-3D and pHA-Ub or pHA-K63 after 
   <italic>METTL3</italic> overexpression or knockdown. IP and immunoblot analyses were performed using the indicated antibodies.
