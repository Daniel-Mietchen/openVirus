  <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m
  <sup>6</sup>A) constitutes one of the most abundant internal RNA modifications and is critical for RNA metabolism and function. It has been previously reported that viral RNA contains internal m
  <sup>6</sup>A modifications; however, only recently the function of m
  <sup>6</sup>A modification in viral RNAs has been elucidated during infections of HIV, hepatitis C virus and Zika virus. In the present study, we found that enterovirus 71 (EV71) RNA undergoes m
  <sup>6</sup>A modification during viral infection, which alters the expression and localization of the methyltransferase and demethylase of m
  <sup>6</sup>A, and its binding proteins. Moreover, knockdown of m
  <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase resulted in decreased EV71 replication, whereas knockdown of the demethylase had the opposite effect. Further study showed that the m
  <sup>6</sup>A binding proteins also participate in the regulation of viral replication. In particular, two m
  <sup>6</sup>A modification sites were identified in the viral genome, of which mutations resulted in decreased virus replication, suggesting that m
  <sup>6</sup>A modification plays an important role in EV71 replication. Notably, we found that METTL3 interacted with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D and induced enhanced sumoylation and ubiquitination of the 3D polymerase that boosted viral replication. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m
  <sup>6</sup>A modification complex interacts with viral proteins to modulate EV71 replication.
