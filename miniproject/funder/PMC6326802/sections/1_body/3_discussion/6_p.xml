<p>To address how EV71 hijacks the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification machinery to facilitate virus replication, we performed METTL3 IP to check viral protein interactions. The results showed that METTL3 interacted with 3D. Notably, METTl14 and 3D are the components of 3D-METTL3 complex, indicating that the methyltransferase interact with viral protein. Moreover, in the presence of 3D expression, METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which confirms the interaction between METTL3 and 3D and may explain the presence of METTL3 in the cytoplasm during EV71 infection. However, the catalytic site of METTL3 was not involved in the interaction between METTL3 and 3D protein. Importantly, METTL3 promoted sumoylation and ubiquitination of 3D to facilitate viral replication (

 <sup>6</sup>A modification machinery plays an important role in EV71 infection.
