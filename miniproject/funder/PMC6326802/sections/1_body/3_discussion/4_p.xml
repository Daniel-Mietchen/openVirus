<p>m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification has been linked to viral replication and gene expression. Knockdown of methyltransferases or demethylases decrease or increase HIV replication (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref>). However, silencing of METTL3 or FTO has the opposite effect on the replication of HCV (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Due to the different replication locations of HIV and HCV, we tested the effect of methyltransferases or demethylases on EV71 replication in Vero cells. Our results showed that m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases and demethylases regulate EV71 replication, which is in an agreement with the recent reports that the m
 <sup>6</sup>A machinery regulates HCV, HIV and influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27–30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In particular, knockdown of 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> down-regulated EV71 replication, which was similar to HIV. Moreover, mutation of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification sites in the infectious clone of EV71 followed by rescuing and titration of the mutant viruses decreased replication of the mutants viruses, compared to the wild-type virus, which was consistent with the result in
