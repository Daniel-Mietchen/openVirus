<p>In this study, we showed that EV71 RNA contains m
 <sup>6</sup>A modifications that play a critical role in viral replication. Knockdown of m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins in host cells affected viral replication. In addition, mutation of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification sites in the infectious clone decreased EV71 progeny virus production and protein expression, which is similar to the effect of 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown. Notably, we found that METTL3 interacted with viral RdRp 3D protein and regulated its modification to modulate viral replication. Thus, our findings demonstrated that m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification represents an important component in the regulation of EV71 replication.
