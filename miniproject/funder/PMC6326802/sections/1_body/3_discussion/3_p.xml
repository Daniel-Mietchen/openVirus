<p>We also found that the expression of m
 <sup>6</sup>A-related proteins was altered by virus infection. METTL3 and METTL14, the key components of methyltransferases, together with YTH proteins, were up-regulated. Among demethylases, however, the expression of FTO was decreased; whereas ALKBH5 was not affected by EV71 infection. These data implied that EV71 infection altered host proteins expression to enhance RNA m
 <sup>6</sup>A modifications, which may promote viral infection. The expression of ALKBH5 was not affected during EV71 infection. ALKBH5 preferentially binds to the CDS shortly after the start codon and only targets a small subset of m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites installed by METTL3 (

Our results showed that the expression of FTO was linked to the replication of EV71, indicating that the demethylation of EV71 RNA was mainly catalyzed by FTO. Methyltransferases and demethylases localize in the nucleus of Vero cells while YTH proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). However, METTL3, METTL14, FTO and YTH proteins were redistributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm upon EV71 infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A previous study showed that during heat shock, YTHDF2 relocalizes to the nucleus in order to prevent FTO-mediated demethylation of the 5â€²-UTR of stress-induced transcripts (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). EV71 infection may induce a cellular stress that is similar to the stress of heat shock, which may be the reason that m
 <sup>6</sup>A-related proteins relocated under EV71 infection. We also found that these m
 <sup>6</sup>A-related proteins co-localized with the viral capsid protein VP1, supporting that the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification machinery can modify cytoplasmic EV71 RNA during EV71 infection.
