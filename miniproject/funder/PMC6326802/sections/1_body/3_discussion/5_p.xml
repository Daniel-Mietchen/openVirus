<p>Knockdown of

 <italic>YTHDF1-3</italic> proteins in RD cells led to increased EV71 replication, which was similar to HCV and ZIKV (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Our results showed that YTH proteins have different roles on EV71 replication in different cell lines. However, the mechanism by which YTH proteins affect viral replication remains unknown. As Vero cells do not express interferon (IFN), we are currently studying whether the IFN signaling pathway plays a role in the m
 <sup>6</sup>A-regulated viral replication. We also tested whether the nuclear m
 <sup>6</sup>A binding protein YTHDC1 affects EV71 replication. The results showed that YTHDC1 positively regulates EV71 replication in RD cells, which is similar to YTHDF1, 2 and 3. Our data thus showed that both the nuclear and cytoplasmic m
 <sup>6</sup>A readers regulate viral replication in RD cells.
