 <sup>6</sup>A has been identified in infection of both RNA and DNA viruses. Assessment of the internal m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification status of EV71 RNA using MeRIP followed by Northern blotting revealed that an m
 <sup>6</sup>A antibody binds to EV71 RNA. UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of viral RNA confirmed that EV71 RNA contains m
 <sup>6</sup>A with a ratio of m
 <sup>6</sup>A/A of âˆ¼0.09%. Moreover, m
 <sup>6</sup>A peaks spanning the full length of EV71 RNA were identified by MeRIP-Seq. Thus, these results revealed that EV71 RNA was m
 <sup>6</sup>A-methylated. However, as EV71 does not encode any known methyltransferase, host methyltransferases appear to play a critical role in m
 <sup>6</sup>A methylation.
