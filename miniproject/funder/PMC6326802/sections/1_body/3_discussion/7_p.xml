<p>Collectively, we present evidence supporting the importance of m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification for the replication of EV71. The expression and localization of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A methylation machinery were affected by EV71 virus infection. The expression of proteins in the m
 <sup>6</sup>A methylation machinery in turn regulated viral replication. Mutation of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites decreased viral replication. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanisms, such as how the methyltransferases, demethylases and YTH proteins alter their localization and whether viral non-structural proteins play a role in the methylation process. In addition, our study suggests m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification may be a novel target for antivirals of EV71.
