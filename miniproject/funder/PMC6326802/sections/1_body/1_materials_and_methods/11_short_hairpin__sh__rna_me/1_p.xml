<p>shRNAs specific to each gene used in the study are as follows: METTL3 (shMETTL3-1: 5′-GCC AAG GAA CAA TCC ATT GTT-3′, shMETTL3-2: 5′-CGT CAG TAT ATT GGG CAA GTT-3′), FTO (shFTO-1: 5′-TCA CCA AGG AGA CTG CTA TTT-3′, shFTO-2: 5′-GAT CCA AGG CAA AGA TTT ACT-3′), YTHDF1 (shYTHDF1-1: 5′-CCC GAA AGA GTT TGA GTG GAA-3′, shYTHDF1-2: 5′-CCC TAC CTG TCC AGC TAT TAC-3′), YTHDF2 (shYTHDF2-1: 5′-CCA CAG GCA AGG CCC AAT AAT-3′, shYTHDF2-2: 5′-AAG GAC GTT CCC AAT AGC CAA-3′) and YTHDF3 (shYTHDF3-1: 5′-GAT AAG TGG AAG GGC AAA TTT-3′, shYTHDF3-2: 5′-TAA GTC AAA GAA GAC GTA TTA-3′), and YTHDC1 (shYTHDC1-1: 5′-TGG ATT TGC AGG CGT GAA TTA-3′, shYTHDC1-2: 5′-CAC CAG AGA CCA GGG TAT TTA-3′). They were cloned into the pLKO.1-TRC vector (Addgene plasmid 10878, Cambridge, MA, USA) and packaged into lentiviruses according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable knockdown cell lines were generated by lentiviral infection followed with puromycin selection. Vero cells were selected under puromycin at 10 μg/ml, while HEK293T and RD cells were at 2 μg/ml.</p>
