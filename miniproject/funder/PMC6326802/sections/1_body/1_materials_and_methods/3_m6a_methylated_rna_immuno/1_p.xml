<p>Total RNA was extracted from Vero cells infected with strain EV71-XF at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> EV71 RNA was transcribed from a cDNA plasmid (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) linearized by HindIII using the MEGAscript
 <sup>®</sup> T7 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For MeRIP, 300 μg of total RNA or 10 μg 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed EV71 RNA were incubated with an anti-m
 <sup>6</sup>A antibody (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany) or a IgG antibody in 300 μl of immunoprecipitation (IP) Buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4) for 2 h at 4°C. The mixture was then incubated with 20 μl of anti-rabbit antibody conjugated magnetic beads (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA; S1432S), which were then washed three times with 500 μl of IP buffer, followed by rotating for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were washed six times with 500 μl of IP buffer and then incubated with 300 μl of elution buffer (5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 4.2 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K) for 1.5 h at 50°C. The eluted RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol.
