<p>All the RNAs collected from MeRIP were separated on 1% agarose/2.2 M formaldehyde gels in running buffer (20 mM MOPS, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.0) for 13 h at 28 V. The RNAs were transferred to Hybond-N
 <sup>+</sup> membranes in 20× SSC buffer (3.0 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate) overnight. UV-crosslinked to a membrane, and hybridized with a DIG-labelled EV71 probe (nt 1–7405). Probe detection was performed using the DIG Luminescent Detection Kit II (Roche, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals were developed on a ChemiDoc™ MP imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA).
