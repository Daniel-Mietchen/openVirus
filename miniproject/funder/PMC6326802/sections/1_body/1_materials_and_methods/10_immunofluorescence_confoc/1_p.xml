<p>Vero cells were seeded in six-well plates 1 day before infection at ∼50% confluence, then the cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 1) and incubated for the indicated times. Indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In brief, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at a dilution as manufactures suggested overnight at 4°C, then washed three times with PBS and stained with a respective secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. The slides were observed under a PerkinElmer VoX confocal microscope.
