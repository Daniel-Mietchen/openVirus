<p>MeRIP-Seq of the EV71 methylome was carried out according to a previously published protocol (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In brief, total cellular RNA extracted from EV71-infected Vero cells was fragmented by ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> followed by ethanol precipitation. Fragmented RNA was incubated with an anti-m
 <sup>6</sup>A antibody (Synaptic Systems, 1:300). MeRIP was conducted as previously described (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). The eluted RNA and input were subjected to high-throughput sequencing using standard protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The MeRIP-Seq data were analyzed as described previously (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).
