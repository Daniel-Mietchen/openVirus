<p>Sumoylation and ubiquitination assays were performed as described (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) using calcium phosphate reagent. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C for 30 h and then lysed for western blotting and IP. The lysates were centrifuged at 16 000 ×
