<p>A primer extension analysis using Tth DNA polymerase and AMV reverse transcriptase was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Briefly, DNA primers for 28S RNA (A4190: 5′-GAG CTC GCC TTA GGA CAC CTG CG-3′) or EV71 RNA (A3055: 5′–TTG TGT TCC CCG AAT GTG GGA TAT CCG-3′, A4555: 5′-TGT TGC TTA TAA CCG TCA AAA TGA TCC GGG-3′) were 5′ end-labeled with 
 <sup>32</sup>P using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P] ATP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) according to a standard method. Radiolabeled primer (2 μl) and 10 μg of total RNA extracted from normal HEK293T cells or 20 μg poly(A) RNA from EV71-infected Vero cells were mixed in annealing solution followed by denaturation at 95°C for 10 min. After addition of the enzymes (2 μl; final enzyme concentration of 0.05 U/μl for Tth pol and 0.3 U/μl for AMV RT), the mixtures were heated at 55°C (Tth) or 37°C (AMV) for 2 min. A dTTP solution was then added to a final concentration of 100 μM, and the mixtures were incubated at 55°C (Tth) or 37°C (AMV) for 30 min. The final products were resolved on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The signal was developed on a ChemiDoc™ MP imaging system (Bio-Rad).
