<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed with 3 μg of total RNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) on a CFX Connect Real-Time system (Bio-Rad). Relative gene expression levels were obtained by normalizing the quantification Cycle (Cq) values to those of 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> to yield 2
 <sup>−△△Cq</sup>. For Formaldehyde RIP-qPCR and MeRIP-qPCR, relative enrichment was normalized to inputs. The primers used for gene expression are as follows: EV71 (forward: 5′-CGA ATG CTA GTG ATG AGA GTA T-3′, reverse: 5′-GAG GAA GAT CTA TCT CCC CAA CT-3′) and 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> (forward: 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′, reverse: 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′).
