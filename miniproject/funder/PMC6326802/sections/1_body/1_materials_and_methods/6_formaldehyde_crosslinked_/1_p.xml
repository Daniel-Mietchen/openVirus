<p>Two 10-cm plates of 95% confluent RD cells were used for each sample. Cells were crosslinked by adding phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% methanol-free formaldehyde and incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 2.5 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped off the plates, followed by centrifugation at 800 ×

Cell pellets were resuspended in 400 μl of RIP buffer (150 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% NP40, 100 U/ml RNase inhibitor, 100 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 μg/ml proteinase Inhibitors). The lysates were centrifugated at 16 000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the protein-RNA complexes was subjected to IP overnight with an anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or mouse IgG (control) antibody. On the following day, pre-blocked protein-G agarose beads (30 μl) were added to each sample for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were then washed three times each with the washing buffer (300 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5% NP40, 100 U/ml RNase inhibitor, 100 μM PMSF and 1 μg/ml proteinase Inhibitors), followed by three washes with the RIP buffer. After proteinase K digestion, the RNA samples were extracted using TRIzol.
