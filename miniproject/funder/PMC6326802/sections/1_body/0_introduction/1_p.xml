<p>Chemical modifications of RNA are critical for RNA metabolism, function, and localization. One of the most abundant internal RNA modifications is

 <sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m
 <sup>6</sup>A), which is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex consisting of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and other proteins such as KIAA1429, RBM15 and RBM15B (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10–13</xref>) constitute m
 <sup>6</sup>A demethylases that remove the methyl groups from RNA. YTH proteins bind to m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites and play critical roles in various biological processes, such as mRNA stability (

 <sup>6</sup>A modification of mRNA is mainly distributed in translation start sites, stop codons, and 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) (
