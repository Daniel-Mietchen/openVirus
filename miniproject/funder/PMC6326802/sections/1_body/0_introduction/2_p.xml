<p>The internal m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification of viral RNA was identified 40 years ago during infections of viruses that replicate in nucleus, such as influenza virus, simian virus 40 (SV40), and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21–26</xref>). However, only recently the function of m
 <sup>6</sup>A began to be unraveled during virus infection. During infections of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SV40, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and influenza virus, it has been shown that these viral RNAs contain m
 <sup>6</sup>A modifications, which affect viral replication and gene expression (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27–34</xref>). Viruses that whose genomes replicate in the cytoplasm, such as VSV, vaccinia virus and reovirus, have also been reported to contain m
 <sup>6</sup>A-modified 5′ caps (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35–38</xref>). Other cytoplasm replicating viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus, yellow fever virus and West Nile virus, have been shown to contain internal m
 <sup>6</sup>A modifications that are involved in virus replication (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). All together, these reports indicate that cellular m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases may be active in the cytoplasm and that viral RNA is perhaps m
 <sup>6</sup>A-methylated during infection.
