<p>In this study, we demonstrated that EV71 RNA contains m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification and investigated its function during EV71 C4 subtype infection. We found that the expression and localization of m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins were affected upon virus infection. Moreover, perturbation of the expression of m
 <sup>6</sup>A-related proteins or mutation of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification sites altered viral replication, suggesting that the host m
 <sup>6</sup>A machinery is involved in viral replication. Notably, we showed that the m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase METTL3 not only interacted with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 3D, but also induced sumoylation and ubiquitination of the polymerase, which have been reported to facilitate its stability and boost viral replication (

 <sup>6</sup>A modification of EV71 RNA constitutes an important process in the regulation of viral replication.
