<p>To investigate whether EV71 RNA was m
 <sup>6</sup>A-modified, RNAs of EV71 and Influenza A virus H1N1 were purified from large-scale infected culture. The presence of m
 <sup>6</sup>A residues was quantified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Notably, m
 <sup>6</sup>A in EV71 RNA accounted for 0.089% of adenosines, higher than that in Influenza A virus H1N1 RNA (0.066%), which had been reported to contain m
 <sup>6</sup>A (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) and served as a positive control (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To confirm our results, we isolated total RNA from EV71-infected Vero cells or from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> T7 transcribed EV71 genome. IP using an m
 <sup>6</sup>A-specific antibody was performed, followed by northern blot analysis. The results showed that 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> EV71 RNA was pulled down by the anti-m
 <sup>6</sup>A antibody (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lane 3) whereas the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed EV71 RNA was not (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lane 3), suggesting that EV71 RNA contains m
 <sup>6</sup>A residues.
