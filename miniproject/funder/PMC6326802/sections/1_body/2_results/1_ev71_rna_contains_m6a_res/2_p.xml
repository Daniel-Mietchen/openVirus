<p>To map the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification status in the EV71 RNA genome, MeRIP-Seq was performed (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Several m
 <sup>6</sup>A peaks were identified across the EV71 RNA genome (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>), which were located in the VP, 3D and 2C coding region, suggesting that EV71 RNA is marked by m
 <sup>6</sup>A during infection. Collectively, our results demonstrated that EV71 RNA is modified at m
 <sup>6</sup>A during infection.
