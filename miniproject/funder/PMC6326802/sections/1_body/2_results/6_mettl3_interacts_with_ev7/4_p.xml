<p>Finally, because K63-linked ubiquitination is a docking site for mediating protein-protein interactions or conformational changes (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), we examined whether METTL3 could regulate this ubiquitin-linked chain of 3D. HEK293T cells, in which 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> was overexpressed or knocked down, were expressed with Flag-3D and HA-K63, followed by IP and immunobloting. The result showed that K63-linked ubiquitination was increased or decreased significantly by 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> overexpression or knockdown (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref> andÂ 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">F</xref>). This result was confirmed by the increase in K63-linked ubiquitination when METTL3 restored in knockdown cells (
