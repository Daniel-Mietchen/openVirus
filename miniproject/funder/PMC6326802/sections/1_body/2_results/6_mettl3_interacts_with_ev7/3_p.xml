<p>As sumoylation and ubiquitination levels are known to enhance the stability of 3D and facilitate EV71 replication (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), and METTL3 expression is also linked to EV71 replication, we next investigated whether METTL3 affected the modification of 3D. To this end, METTL3 or shMETTL3, Flag-3D, HA-SUMO-1, myc-Ubc-9 or HA-Ub were expressed in HEK293T cells by transfection. We found that overexpression of METTL3 induced enhanced sumoylation and ubiquitination of 3D (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">C</xref>) whereas 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown led to a decrease in 3D sumoylation or ubiquitination (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">D</xref>). Futhermore, restored METTL3 expression in knockdown cells resulted in elevated 3D modification (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S9A and B</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that the expression of METTL3 is involved in the regulation of viral 3D protein modification, the status of which affects viral replication.
