<p>The methyltransferase complex is consisted of METTL3, METTL14, WTAP and other component proteins. To investigate whether METTL14 and WTAP interact with 3D, METTL14, HA-WTAP, METTL3 and Flag-3D were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, followed by IP with indicated antibodies (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">I</xref>). Notably, METTL14 and WTAP were pulled down by 3D protein or vice versa (Figure

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">I</xref>), indicating that METTL14 and WTAP interacted with 3D. Though 3D interacts with the main components of methyltransferase, the catalytic active site (DPPW) of METTL3 was not involved in the interaction between METTL3 and 3D (
