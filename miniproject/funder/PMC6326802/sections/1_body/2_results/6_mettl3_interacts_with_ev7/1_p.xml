<p>To investigate how the host m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification machinery affects EV71 replication, a Flag-tagged METTL3 cDNA was expressed in RD cells followed by EV71 infection. The cell lysate was subjected to IP with an anti-Flag antibody and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). In addition to the host proteins interacting with METTL3, the EV71 RdRp 3D protein was detected. To further confirm our results, pMETTL3 and pFLAG-3D were co-transfected into HEK293T cells. The IP experiment with an anti-METTL3 antibody followed by staining with anti-Flag or vice versa showed that METTL3 indeed interacted with 3D protein (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>) in the absence or presence of RNase A (

Although METTL3 was distributed in the nucleus without Flag-3D expression, it was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm when Flag-tagged 3D was expressed (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">E</xref>). Such co-localization of METTL3 and 3D supported the interaction between METTL3 and 3D. In addition, 3D expression was increased as more METTL3 was expressed by transfection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>), suggesting that 3D expression was affected by the abundance of METTL3.
