<p>YTH proteins bind to m
 <sup>6</sup>A modifications on single-stranded RNA via a conserved domain located at the C terminus (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In particular, YTH proteins bind to HIV and HCV viral RNA and play important roles in viral protein expression and virus release (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Moreover, the cytoplasmic distribution and co-localization with EV71 VP1 protein (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, G-I &amp; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>) indicated that YTH proteins may also contribute to EV71 infection. To test this hypothesis, we separately knocked down YTH proteins in RD cells by using shRNA prior to EV71 infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, A-D). The viral genomic copies were quantified by qRT-PCR. Notably, knockdown of YTH proteins resulted in a significant increase in viral genomic copies at both 12 and 24 hpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">H</xref>). Viral replication was decreased when the expression of YTH proteins was restored by shRNA-resistant cDNAs in knockdown cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S4, A-H</xref>). We also checked virus titer when 
 <italic>YTHDC1</italic> was knocked down. Interestingly, knockdown of 
 <italic>YTHDC1</italic> in RD cells led to an increased viral titer (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I</xref>). However, knockdown and overexpression of 
 <italic>YTHDF2</italic> and 
 <italic>YTHDF3</italic> in Vero cells resulted in a decrease and an increase of viral replication, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S5A–H</xref>). All together, these results suggested that the YTH proteins regulate EV71 infection.
