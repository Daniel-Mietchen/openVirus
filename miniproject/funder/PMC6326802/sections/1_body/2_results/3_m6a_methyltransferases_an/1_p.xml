<p>We next investigated the possibility that EV71 RNA m
 <sup>6</sup>A residues are modified by host methyltransferases and demethylases as EV71 itself does not encode any enzymes with internal m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity. Flag tagged METTL3 or FTO gene was expressed in RD cells by transfection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and then qRT-PCR was performed following formaldehyde-crosslinked RIP using an anti-flag antibody to pull down 
 <italic>METTL3</italic>- or 
 <italic>FTO</italic>-bound RNA. Notably, EV71 RNA was pulled down by METTL3 and FTO (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">C</xref>), which indicated that EV71 RNA could interact with METTL3 and FTO. We next knocked down endogenous 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> and 
 <italic>FTO</italic> in Vero cells using shRNA (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">E</xref>). m
 <sup>6</sup>A abundance in EV71 RNA was detected using qRT-PCR after MeRIP. In particular, the abundance of m
 <sup>6</sup>A in EV71 RNA was decreased by silencing METTL3 gene and increased by FTO depletion (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). To further confirm this result, the expressions of METTL3 and FTO were restored by transfecting an shRNA-resistant cDNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, the level of m
 <sup>6</sup>A in EV71 RNA increased when METTL3 expression was restored and decreased when FTO expression was complemented (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). Taken together, our results indicated that m
 <sup>6</sup>A in EV71 RNA was regulated by METTL3 and FTO.
