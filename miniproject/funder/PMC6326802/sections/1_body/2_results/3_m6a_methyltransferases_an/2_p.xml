<p>Because the expression of endogenous methyltransferases or demethylases is known to affect HIV and HCV protein expression and virus production (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27–29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>), we knocked down endogenous 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>) or 
 <italic>FTO</italic> (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) in Vero cells, followed by EV71 infection to check whether methyltransferases or demethylases affect EV71 replication. Viral titer was measured as TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, and viral RNA copy numbers were quantified by qRT-PCR. Efficient knockdown of 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> resulted in significantly decrease in virus titer (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>) and copy numbers of EV71 RNA at both 12 and 24 hpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). However, the genomic copy numbers of EV71 RNA were significantly increased when 
 <italic>FTO</italic> was knocked down (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). The expression of VP1 was significantly decreased when 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> was knocked down (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Complementation of the expression of METTL3 or FTO by shRNA-resistant cDNAs increased and decreased EV71 replication (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S2D–F</xref>), respectively. Collectively, these results suggested that the m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase METTL3 and demethylase FTO have impacts on efficient EV71 replication.
