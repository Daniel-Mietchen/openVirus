<p>Previous studies have indicated that METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP as well as the m
 <sup>6</sup>A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 co-localize with nuclear speckle markers (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Thus, we next determined whether EV71 infection affected the subcellular localization of these m
 <sup>6</sup>A methyltransferases, demethylases, along with YTH domain-containing proteins by staining Vero cells with the respective antibodies at 12 and 24 hpi. Methyltransferases, demethylases, and YTHDC1 were detected mostly in the nucleus under normal conditions. YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 were located in the cytoplasm without virus infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">I</xref>). However, these proteins were all present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm after EV71 infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">I</xref>). Accordingly, the ratio of methyltransferases, demethylases, and YTHDC1 in the cytoplasm versus nucleus was increased (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, D-I); whereas that of YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 was decreased (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1J and K</xref>). Notably, we found that the localization of YTHDF3 was not affected by EV71 infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1A and L</xref>), which is similar to the nuclear protein histone 3 and cytoplasmic protein GAPDH (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1B, C, M and N</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that the methyltransferases were localized to the cytoplasm during virus infection. The co-localization of methyltransferases and demethylases with viral protein VP1 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">F</xref>) implied that these proteins might interact with EV71 RNA in the cytoplasm.
