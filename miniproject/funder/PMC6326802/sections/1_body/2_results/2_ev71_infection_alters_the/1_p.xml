<p>As EV71 replicates in the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and undergoes m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification, we next checked whether EV71 infection affected the expression of the host proteins related to m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification. Toward this end, EV71-infected Vero cells were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against m
 <sup>6</sup>A-related proteins. Virus infection was monitored by VP1 expression. We found that whereas expression of the methyltransferases, METTL3 and METTL14, was low under normal conditions, their expression increased at 24 and 48 h post-infection (hpi). In comparison, the expression of the demethylase ALKBH5 was not changed after infection; whereas that of FTO decreased at 48 hpi. Expression of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A binding proteins YTHDF1â€“3 and YTHDC1 increased at 48 hpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). All these results suggested that the expression pattern of m
 <sup>6</sup>A proteins was altered during EV71 infection.
