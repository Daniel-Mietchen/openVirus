<p>To determine the role of the m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites on EV71 replication, C residues at nt 3056 and 4556 were mutated to inactivate the m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification in the EV71 infectious clone (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), then Vero cells were infected by wild-type (EV71 WT) and mutant viruses (Mut1 and Mut2, respectively). Notably, virus titer was significantly decreased when m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites were mutated (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">D</xref>), suggesting that m
 <sup>6</sup>A regulates viral replication, which is similar to the result in METTL3 depletion. The virus titer was not significantly altered when WT or mutant virus was infected in 
 <italic>METTL3</italic> knockdown Vero cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">F</xref>), However, restored METTL3 expression resulted in a titer of WT virus higher than that of mutant viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S6B and C</xref>). Thus, these results supported that m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites in the EV71 genome play a role in viral replication.
