<p>To test the function of specific m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites in the EV71 genome, we first identified potential m
 <sup>6</sup>A modification sites by primer extension analysis. The Tth polymerase enzyme discriminates m
 <sup>6</sup>A from A by significantly reducing the extension ability of DNA oligos, whereas AMV reverse transcriptase extends both m
 <sup>6</sup>A and A efficiently (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). To identify the m
 <sup>6</sup>A residues, we designed primers to test the m
 <sup>6</sup>A peaks identified by MeRIP-Seq. Tth polymerase failed to extend m
 <sup>6</sup>A sites at nt 3055 and nt 4555; whereas AMV polymerase extended these sites efficiently (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), indicating that these A residues are methylated in the EV71 genome.
