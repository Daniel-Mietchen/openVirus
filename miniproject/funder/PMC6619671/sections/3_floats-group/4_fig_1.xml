  <title>Workflow of the semi-automatic and full-automatic PCR systems.</title>
  <p>In the semi-automatic system, users add sample (serum, homogenized mosquitos) into the preloaded extraction plate (A) and place the plate into the nucleic acid extraction device for automatic nucleic acid extraction (B). The resulted nucleic acid extracts are added manually to the lyophilized reagent reconstituted first with provided buffer; the final PCR mixture is transferred manually to the reaction vessel (C). The reaction vessels are placed into the PCD device, which performs PCR amplification, detection and data interpretation automatically to provide qualitative results on the monitor (D). In the fully automatic system, users add serum sample to the preloaded extraction cartridge, place the extraction and reagent/consumable cartridges into the device, key in reagent and sample information, and start the assay (E). The device automates nucleic acid extraction, PCR reagent preparation, and PCR amplification, detection, and data interpretation to provide qualitative results on the monitor (F).</p>
