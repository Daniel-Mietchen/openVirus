<p>For POC/PON dengue diagnosis, several isothermal amplification methods such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), thermophilic helicase-dependent amplification (tHDA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) have been developed and reported previously as potential field-deployable tools for the detection of different microorganisms [

Based on these technologies, various all-in-one molecular diagnostics have been made available to help minimizing risks of human errors and allowing easy molecular bio-detection at or near POC/PON in the last few years, but, to our knowledge, no reagents are available for DENV testing on these platforms.
