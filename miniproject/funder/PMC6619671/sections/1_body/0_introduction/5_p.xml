<p>The pan-DENV reverse transcription-iiPCR (RT-iiPCR), previously validated to work with the filed-deployable semi-automated PCR system, POCKIT combo (GeneReach Biotech, Taichung, Taiwan), is a potential POC/PON tool for the detection of DENV. It offered great analytical and clinical performances for rapid detection of DENV in human serum; its clinical performance was comparable to that of the reference multiplex RT-PCR assay in studies testing samples collected in Sri Lanka and Taiwan [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The field-deployable system includes one automated NA extraction device (taco mini Automatic Nucleic Acid Extraction System, taco mini; GeneReach) and one compact PCR device (POCKIT Nucleic Acid Analyzer, POCKIT; GeneReach) in a durable suitcase for easy field deployment. The iiPCR system is unique in its employment of a single heating source in a thermally baffled device to drive Rayleigh-Bernard convection in a capillary tube, allowing the three steps of PCR (denaturation, annealing, and extension) to occur sequentially and continuously [
