<p>DENV causes different clinical signs in humans, from mild febrile illness (dengue fever, DF) to life-threatening condition such as hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Early, accurate and rapid diagnosis of dengue is critical for confirmation of clinically suspected cases to ensure timely management of severe dengue disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A number of NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are commercially available to easily detect NS1 antigen, but they are not sensitive or specific enough [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During the acute phase of the illness when viremia levels are high, the viral RNA or soluble antigens can be easily detected [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For rapid and accurate diagnosis of dengue virus in early phases of acute infections, detection of DENV RNA is recommended as the most sensitive and specific method to diagnose dengue in the acute phase of the illness by WHO [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. After the first developed nucleic acid detection test for dengue diagnosis over 20 years ago [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], there have been a number of RT-PCR assays for DENV detection and serotype identification with high sensitivity and specificity [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Combined with automated RNA extraction protocols, RT-PCR can potentially facilitate fast and accurate diagnosis of dengue suspected cases with a single sample obtained during the patient’s first visit to the clinician. However, the requirement of a pre-PCR nucleic acids extraction step, an expensive and not easy to use thermal cycler, and a highly trained technician make PCR technology not accessible in resource-limited regions where dengue is endemic [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Molecular diagnosis tools for dengue is still much needed at or near POC/PON, particularly for developing countries with limited public health resources.
