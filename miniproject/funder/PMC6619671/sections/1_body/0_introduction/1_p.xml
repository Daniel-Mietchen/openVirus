<p>Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae, causes dengue in humans. Dengue virus infection, one of the most important and mosquito-borne viral diseases, is considered a major public health problem in developing tropical and sub-tropical countries mainly in Asia, South America, and the Caribbean with major disease outbreaks and endemic every year [

Its single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA contains 5'- and 3'- untranslated regions (UTR) and a single open reading frame encoding for a single polyprotein that could be cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane/membrane [prM/M], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).
