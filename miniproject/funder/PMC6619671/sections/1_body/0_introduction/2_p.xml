<p>DENV is primarily transmitted by the mosquito species

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], particularly during the viremic phase of the disease in which high levels of DENV viremia are present in the blood stream. Positive association between DENV infection in mosquitoes and human has been found; human cases were reported at about one week after appearance of DENV-positive

 <italic>aegypti</italic> can also pick up DENV from people showing no symptoms or oligo symptom, resulting in silent transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, for dengue disease control, it is important to extend DENV surveillance in the human and mosquito populations to near points of care (POC)/point of needs (PON), generating early alert signals to prevent and/or control DENV epidemics and reducing the spread of DENV infection [
