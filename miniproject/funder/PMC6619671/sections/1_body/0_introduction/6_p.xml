<p>Requiring several manual liquid transfer steps to assemble the PCR tests, the complexity of the semi-automated PCR system is still relatively high. A compact fully automated sample-to-answer system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser, POCKIT Central) is commercially available recently, in which modules in the existing semi-automated system (automated NA extraction and compact POCKIT PCR modules) were integrated with a liquid handling module. This device can be set up and run with minimal set-up time and steps to allow quick and easy detection of DENV in human at settings such as a local hospital laboratory or airport and in mosquitos for surveillance and monitoring of DENV. Therefore, the new assay has potential to enable timely early diagnosis of DENV infection, facilitating effective disease management and control particularly in regions of low medical resources. In addition, the system can facilitate monitoring of the mosquitos carrying DENV in the field to provide timely information for local government to take immediate measures to facilitate effective local management and control of dengue.</p>
