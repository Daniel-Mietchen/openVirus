<p>Moreover, the fully automated and semi-automated PCR systems allows applications of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR to detect DENV in the local mosquito populations even at remote regions; the combined results can help decision making to effectively allocate control and prevention efforts into areas most in need of dengue control. Therefore, the fully automated POCKIT Central device and field-deployable semi-automated POCKIT combo system has potential to serve as a flexible mobile PON tool for rapid DENV detection in both human and mosquito. Studies to verify and validate further the performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagents on both PCR systems for DENV detection in mosquitos are underway.</p>
