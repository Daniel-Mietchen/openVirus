<p>One major advantages of the fully automated PCR system is its simple protocol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218139.g001">Fig 1</xref>); users simply have to put 200 uL serum into a preloaded extraction cartridge, place both the extraction and reagent cartridges into the device, and start the reaction through the user interface on the screen; the results are ready in 85 min. Compared to conventional PCR methods and to the semi-automated PCR system (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218139.g001">Fig 1</xref> for procedures involved), the fully automated PCR system offers much shorter set up time; its capacity to process 8 reactions in one test run makes it suitable for applications at near-patient settings where the sample numbers are relatively small and a sophisticated testing procedure is not possible. Moreover, the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent is available in a lyophilized format to facilitate shipment at ambient temperatures and storage at 2–8°C for at least 2 years, greatly reducing shipping and storage costs. Hence, this system can facilitate relatively inexpensive, rapid, and simple POC/PON detection of DENV in routine dengue diagnosis.
