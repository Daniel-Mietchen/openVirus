<p>PCR testing after an NS1 positive results has been recommended for confirmation of DENV infection, but the samples have to be shipped to a central laboratory currently. There are needs for sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic tests for dengue at POC/PON to allow early intervention for clinical management, surveillance, and outbreak investigations [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The previously available pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/semi-automated PCR system enabled sensitive and specific molecular testing near POC/PON. In this study, we showed that the reagent also worked well on the fully automated PCR system, which can serve as an advanced simple tool at settings with limited human resources and infrastructure to set up a PCR laboratory.
