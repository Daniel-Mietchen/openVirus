<p>Testing with the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR, the analytical and clinical performance of the fully automatic POCKIT Central system was comparable to those of the semi-automatic POCKI combo system, which was validated previously to offer performances equivalent to the CDC DENV1-4 real-time RT-PCR for the detection of DENV in human serum [
