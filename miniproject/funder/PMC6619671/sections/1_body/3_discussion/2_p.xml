<p>Timely on-site detection of DENV in human and mosquito can potentially alert front-line health professionals to allow timely implementation of intervention strategies and help focusing efforts in targeted areas to help mitigate disease outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Performance of such tests near POC/PON could help shift health service more to local levels, achieve disease diagnosis at early stages, and reduce costs and turn-around time, improving health management quality in under-reached communities. Currently, commercially available NS1 immunological test products are rapid and do not require trained personnel to detect DENV in both human and mosquitos [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, they are reported as less sensitive than ELISA and may cross react with other flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, their sensitivities were relatively low on days 1 and 2 and after day 5 post-symptomatic onset in human, compared to that seen with the RT-PCR methods [
