<p>A total of 60 archived serum specimens (30 DENV positive, 10 of DENV-1, -2 and -3 each; 30 DENV negative) were collected from clinically suspected dengue patients with informed consents at the Tropical Medicine Center, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for routine diagnosis in 2012. All samples were stored at -80Â°C until nucleic acid extraction. Due to the lack of DENV-4 271 positive clinical samples in the region, DENV-4 samples were prepared by spiking 10 of the DENV-negative human serum specimens with different concentrations of the DENV-4 DN9000475A stock (1.9 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL).
