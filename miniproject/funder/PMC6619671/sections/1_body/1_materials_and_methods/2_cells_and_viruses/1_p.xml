<p>Stocks of four DENV isolates, DENV-1 (Hawaii Strain; 1.8 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mL), DENV-2 (NGC Strain; 2.075 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL), DENV-3 (DN8700829A Strain; 1 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL), and DENV-4 (DN9000475A Strain; 1.9 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL), were prepared in the mosquito C6/36 cell line (

 <italic>albopictus</italic>). The virus was diluted in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco-Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 1% FCS (Gibco-Life Technologies) and added to the cell at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01. After incubation at 28°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4–7 days. Viruses were harvested when cytopathic effect was observed. Titers of DENV stocks and human serum of dengue confirmed cases were determined by plaque assay. Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of the DENV stock were made in MEM medium (Gibco-Life Technologies) and added in duplicate to BHK-21 cells in 6-well plates (about 1× 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well). MEM medium was used in mock infection. Adhesion was allowed at 37°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h before addition of 3 mL overlay medium containing 1.2% methylcellulose. Cells were incubated further for 5–10 days until plaques became visually apparent by microscopy, fixed, and stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted manually and plaque forming units (PFU) per mL were determined with the plaque quantification program [
