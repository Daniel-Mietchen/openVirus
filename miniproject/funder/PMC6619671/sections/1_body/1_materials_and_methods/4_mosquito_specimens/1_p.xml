<p>Adult female mosquitoes, aged 7–8 days, were cold anesthetized and inoculated using a microcapillary needle that had been pulled to a point with needle puller. The 4 serotype of dengue virus stocks were standardized to 2 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL, and 0.2 μL was injected into each mosquito (approximately 400 PFU/mosquito). Infected mosquitoes were maintained in cages at 28 ± 1°C and 70% ± 5% relative humidity with a 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle and fed with 10% sucrose solution.

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (UGAL strain) were injected individually with DENV-1 (Hawaii Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-2 (NGC Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-3 (DN8700829A Strain, 400 PFU), or DENV-4 (DN9000475A Strain, 400 PFU) by micro-injection (nanoinjector) into the thoracic cavity. Whole mosquitoes were homogenized for plaque forming assay after 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post-infection [

 <sup>4</sup> PFU/ml) in mosquitoes, and viral titers (infectivity) were maintained in the mosquitoes that had been cultured for 2 weeks without significant attenuation. Three infected mosquitoes were collected on day 7 post infection, and frozen at −80°C until further use. For nucleic acid extraction before PCR analysis, each mosquito was homogenized in 250 μl PBS with a disposable grinder and centrifuged briefly. Subsequently, 200 μl of the upper aqueous sample were transferred into the first well of the preloaded extraction plate or cartridge.
