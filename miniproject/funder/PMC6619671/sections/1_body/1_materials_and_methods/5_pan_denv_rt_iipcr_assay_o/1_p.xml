<p>The pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent, targeting the 5’ UTR sequence, was performed as described in the user manual (POCKIT Dengue Virus Reagent Set, GeneReach Biotech). The semi-automated POCKIT combo system includes an automated taco mini for nucleic acid extraction and a POCKIT device for PCR detection. Nucleic acid extraction on the taco mini was done using the taco Preloaded DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (GeneReach Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 200 μL of the sample were added into the first well of the extraction plate before the automatic extraction steps. All nucleic acids were collected individually and placed at -80°C until further use. Subsequent PCR detection was done manually on a POCKIT device. First, 50 μL of Premix Buffer was added to reconstitute each lyophilized Dengue Virus Premix, followed by the addition of 5 μL of test nucleic acid extract. A 50 μL volume of the premix/sample mixture was transferred into an R-tube, which was sealed subsequently with a cap, spun briefly in a microcentrifuge (cubee, GeneReach Biotech), and placed into a POCKIT device. The default program, including an RT step at 50°C for 10 min and an iiPCR step at 95°C for about 30 min; qualitative results were shown on the display screen in less than one hour.</p>
