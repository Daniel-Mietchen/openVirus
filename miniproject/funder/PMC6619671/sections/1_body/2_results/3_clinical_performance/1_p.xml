<p>Performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Materials and Methods</xref> for detail) was previously validated to be equivalent to that of the CDC DENV-1-4 real-time RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="pone.0218139.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent on the fully automated POCKIT Central system was evaluated by comparison with the performance on the semi-automated PCR system. For this purpose, clinical serum samples were tested from sample to results using the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent on the fully automated and semi-automated PCR systems in parallel. A total of 60 archived serum specimens (30 DENV positive, 10 of DENV-1, -2 and -3 each; 30 DENV negative) collected from clinically suspected dengue patients were tested. There were no severe dengue patients in the 30 DENV-positive group. The 30 control cases were selected from age- and sex-matched dengue-suspected cases; dengue virus infections were later ruled out clinically and by laboratory tests. All clinical samples were collected within 6 days from the day of illness onset. Based on analysis from a previous study, the median age was 45 years old (range 20–65) in the case group and 46 years old (range 21–67) in the control group. The percentage of male subjects was 53.3% in the case group and 50% in the control group. The median viral titers in different serotypes were 8.2 x 10
 <sup>2</sup> PFU/mL (DENV-1), 3.5 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU/mL (DENV-2) and 2.7 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL (DENV-3) (

 <sup>5</sup> PFU/mL). The results showed that the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR detected 40 positive samples and 20 negative samples by both PCR systems (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218139.s002">S2 Table</xref>). The overall agreement between the two systems was 100% (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>, 95.7–100%; κ = 1.0), indicating the reagent can work with the fully automated PCR system to provide performance equivalent to that with the semi-automated PCR system for the detection of DENV RNA in human serum.
