Preliminary evaluation of the performance of the fully automated and semi-automated PCR systems was done using mosquitos collected on day 7 post intra-thoracic infection with one of the four serotypes. The results shows that both PCR systems could detect DENV serotype 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4 RNA in DENV-infected mosquitos (
