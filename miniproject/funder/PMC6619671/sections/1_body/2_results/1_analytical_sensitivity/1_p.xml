<p>To test analytical sensitivity, 10-fold serial dilutions (1,000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 PFU/mL) of the DENV-1, 2, 3, or 4 isolates were made separately in pooled DENV-negative human serum and subjected in triplicate to the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR test with the semi-automated POCKIT combo and automated POCKIT Central systems in parallel. The 100% detection end points were at 1, 10, 1, and 10 PFU/mL for DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 with the fully automated PCR system, respectively; while the end points were at 10, 1, 10, and 10 PFU/mL for DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4 with the semi-automated PCR system, respectively (
