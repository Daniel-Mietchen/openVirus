<p>Males and females were divided into three aged-matched groups of three same-sex animals, and each group was placed inside a separate unit of the ferret isolator (Allentown Inc., PA, USA). Each unit was divided in half by two metal meshes 2.5 cm apart, which possess 36-mm
 <sup>2</sup> holes, preventing direct contact between animals on the two sides of the unit. The airflow in this type of isolator is directed from the outside to the inside and was set at approximately 35 cubic feet per min. The challenged animal (C) and its direct-contact cage mate (D) were placed in the outside half of the cage, while the animal that was in the indirect-contact group (I) was placed in the inside half of the cage. Immediately following challenge, the six infected animals were given time to partially recover from anesthesia, the outer side of each animal’s nose was wiped, and the animals were placed back into the cage with the corresponding contact animal. All animals were monitored for survival, weight loss, temperature, and clinical symptoms (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Animals were sampled for blood, and oral and rectal swabs as well as nasal washes were collected on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 19, and 26 (end of experiment) to assess levels of viremia and virus shedding and to perform blood biochemistry and complete blood count characterization. Environmental sampling was also conducted over a 10-cm
 <sup>2</sup> surface on the front and back of the metal mesh on the side closest to the indirect-contact animal, as well as on the air exhaust located on the side facing the indirect-contact animal.
