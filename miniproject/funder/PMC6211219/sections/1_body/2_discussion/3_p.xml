<p>This is the first reported small-animal model evaluating transmission of a wild-type EBOV-Makona isolate. Understanding the role of infectivity factors such as exposure dose and route of infection involved in EBOV transmission is relevant to public health and outbreak control efforts. These factors also remain a priority in order to update guidelines following an evidence-based process aimed at protecting health care workers, researchers, and the general public from occupational and accidental exposure. It can be seen from this study that both direct contact and indirect contact with severely ill animals can result in EBOV transmission. Moreover, even with indirect exposure being a less likely event, it is an occurrence that can result in fatal EVD under these conditions. The ferret animal model will be valuable in contributing to our understanding of the many parameters that are associated with the transmission of EBOV. They may also help better define conditions that are specific to subclinical disease, which could lead to important findings and influence the development of more-efficient protective, preventive, and curative measures.</p>
