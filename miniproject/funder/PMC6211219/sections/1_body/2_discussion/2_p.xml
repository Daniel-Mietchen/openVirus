<p>The lack of overt morbidity and mortality in the female direct-contact animals was surprising, especially considering the outcome seen with their male counterparts. Further investigations performed with larger groups of ferrets, beyond the scope of this current work, are needed to fully understand whether gender plays a role in susceptibility to EBOV in this model. No evidence currently exists in humans to support a biological difference in the levels of male and female susceptibility to EBOV. The fact that women were found to be infected by the virus more often at several outbreaks is more likely linked to an occupational hazard, as, culturally, sub-Saharan Africa women carry a larger share of the responsibility for caring for the ill (

In the current study, the similarities in shedding between the two sexes and the differences in mortality observed between male and female contact ferrets could have been due to behavioral factors. For example, it is possible that males engaged more in fighting and/or scratching, which would lead to an increased exposure to infected body fluids, such as blood resulting from injuries, hence leading to higher transmission rates.
