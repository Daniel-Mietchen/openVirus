<p>Multiple serosurveys conducted in countries where outbreaks have previously occurred have resulted in reports of higher seroprevalence for EBOV-specific antibodies in human populations residing in forested areas (

A meta-analysis of 51 published seroprevalence studies compared the levels of specific antibodies between asymptomatic participants living with a household or known case contact in an area of EBOV endemicity, living in areas of endemicity but without case contact, or living in areas without known cases of EVD. The analysis showed an estimated seroprevalence of 3.3% in asymptomatic individuals with a household or known case contact. For the other two groups, measured seroprevalence levels were between 0.9% and 17% and between 0% and 24%, respectively, representing a wide range due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the populations, which prevents making an accurate summary estimate (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and a critical factor determining whether disease is symptomatic or asymptomatic may be the exposure dose or the route of infection. Observations in this study are consistent with the presence of specific antibodies to EBOV under conditions of subclinical disease, a phenomenon first reported from serosurveys in humans. Furthermore, recent data in NHPs showed that challenge with a very low dose of EBOV (10 PFU) via the oral route could lead to viral shedding from the nasal route in the absence of clinical pathology (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, the experimental group examined in that study was composed of only two animals and the data should thus be interpreted accordingly, but the issue warrants further investigation. In contrast, a recent study of EBOV infection in ferrets has shown that animals challenged with 0.1 or 1 PFU succumbed to the disease at day 6 or 7 postinfection, indicating that a lower challenge dose does not result in an increased time to death. In the same study, an experimental group of 3 animals was also challenged with 0.01 PFU. While 1 animal succumbed to infection on day 7, the other 2 did not develop any symptoms during the course of the experiment (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This would suggest that IM3, which succumbed to infection 9 days following its cage mate, most likely became infected by fomites after DM3 was removed from the environment. Finally, viral kinetics in guinea pigs have shown that live virus could not be detected in the blood or in oral, nasal, and rectal swabs 1 day postinfection and that virus detection was possible only at day 3 postinfection in nasal and rectal swabs (
