<p>In March 2014, an Ebola virus (EBOV) disease (EVD) outbreak was declared in Guéckédou, Guinea, and rapidly spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As of 27 March 2016, 28,646 cases of EVD were reported, with 11,323 deaths in 10 countries, making it the biggest and most widespread EVD epidemic to date. According to the World Health Organization, many factors played substantial roles in virus propagation, one of which was that West African EBOV isolates may possess clinical and epidemiological features that differ from those of previous strains (

Extensive pathogenicity studies have been conducted with Central African isolates of EBOV, while West African EBOV isolates (EBOV-Makona) were also investigated in nonhuman primates (NHPs). A previous pathogenicity study found that EBOV-Makona, isolate C07, caused delayed disease progression in cynomolgus macaques compared to the reference EBOV-Mayinga isolate (collected from the 1976 outbreak in Central Africa), suggesting decreased virulence of this isolate (

In contrast, another study in rhesus macaques showed that EBOV-Makona, isolate C05, could replicate to higher titers than C07 and the reference EBOV-Kikwit strain (isolated from the 1995 outbreak in Central Africa). Monkeys infected by EBOV-Makona-C05 or EBOV-Makona-C07 also experienced more-severe organ damage and shed on average 2-fold to 16-fold more virus via the oral, nasal, and rectal routes, suggesting that animals infected with these West African isolates were more infectious (
