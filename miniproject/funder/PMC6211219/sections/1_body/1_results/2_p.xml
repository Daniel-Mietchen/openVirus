<p>All challenged animals succumbed to infection within a time period consistent with past reports of EVD in ferrets, which has been described to be 5 to 6 days (

Among the direct-contact and indirect-contact animals, DM1, DM2, and DM3 succumbed to infection 4 to 6 days after CM1, CM2, and CM3 died, suggesting that transmission likely occurred when the challenged ferrets had advanced or terminal EVD. This is consistent with current knowledge, as viral loads are usually highest at the time of death, suggesting that severely ill animals are the most infectious (

Ferret IM3 died 9 days after DM3 succumbed to infection, suggesting that IM3 might have acquired the infection during DM3’s late stage of disease but might also have been infected by infectious fomites from CM3 or DM3. While direct physical contact was not possible between animals separated by the mesh, small particles might have passed through the holes to infect indirect-contact animals. This is consistent with findings from a previous study using a similar experimental setup showing that fomites, such as soiled bedding, were important for promoting EBOV transmission in guinea pigs (
