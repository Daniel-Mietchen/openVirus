<p>Recent pathogenesis studies in domestic ferrets with EBOV, as well as other filoviruses, showed that ill animals shed high amounts of live virus (

In this study, animals were caged such that transmission via direct and indirect contact could be investigated simultaneously. The direct-contact animal was placed on one side of the cage along with the challenged animal, while the indirect-contact animal was placed downstream (of the airflow) of the first two animals, separated from them by a mesh preventing physical contact between the animals on the two sides of the mesh (

 <sub>50</sub>) of EBOV-Makona to mimic mucosal exposure. All challenged males and females succumbed to infection, with mean times to death of 5.7 (standard deviation [SD], 0.6 days; range, 5.0 to 6.0 days) and 6.0 days, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant (two-tailed 
 <italic>t</italic> test with Welch’s correction; 
 <italic>t</italic> = 1, df = 2). All direct-contact males (DM1 to DM3) showed disease symptoms and died with a mean time to death of 10.3 days (SD, 0.6; range, 10 to 11 days), whereas all direct-contact females (DF1 to DF3) survived. One indirect-contact male animal (IM3) was found dead on day 19, whereas the other indirect-contact animals (IM1 and IM2) survived. All females in the indirect-contact group (IF1 to IF3) survived (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>). The animals in the latter category typically had a spike in body temperature the day before death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>) and experienced mild to moderate weight loss (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). While all challenged animals died, male ferrets exhibited more-severe EVD symptoms, such as a petechial rash and fever (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">S3</xref> in the supplemental material). Of note, rectal temperatures were taken solely on sampling days in order to minimize stress to the animals; therefore, days with fever could have been missed. Changes in blood biochemistry and complete blood counts after infection in male and female animals were comparable (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> and
