  <title>AAV bolus injection saturates injection site at high doses.</title>
  <p>(A) Absolute and (B) fractional serum antibody levels of ITS01, ITS06.02 or both for NHP that received 2 injections into the quadriceps with AAV8-ITS01 and/or AAV8-ITS06.02 at low, medium, high or zero doses (2 x 10
   <sup>11</sup> (n = 2), 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> (n = 24), 2 x 10
   <sup>13</sup> (n = 6) gc/animal, respectively), compared with controls (n = 16) receiving no injections. (C) Absolute and (D) fractional serum antibody levels of ITS01, ITS06.02 or both for NHP injected with 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> gc/animal in 1, 2, 4, 8 shots: into the right quadriceps (n = 2), both quadriceps (n = 24), both quadriceps and gastrocnemii (n = 2) or both quadriceps, gastrocnemii, deltoids and biceps (n = 2). Serum transgene mAb concentrations are plotted at peak (left) and set point (right), stratified by dose (E) (all animals receive 2 shots; Low = 2 x 10
   <sup>11</sup> gc/animal, Med = 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> gc/animal, High = 2 x 10
   <sup>13</sup> gc/animal) or number of shots (f) (all animals receive 2 x 10
   <sup>12</sup> gc total). Animal ZG57 (Low dose) has been excluded due to lack of transduction. Asterisks indicate statistical significance (p â‰¤ 0.05).
