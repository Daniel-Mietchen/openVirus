<p>This platform has the potential for long term delivery of anti-viral immunity against SIV, an established model of natural infection for HIV.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Here we used AAV8 to deliver antibodies directed towards the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and variable loop 1 (V1) region of its envelope. We established and optimized a platform of passive immunization to deliver species matched antibodies where transgene expression is durably sustained, anti-drug antibody generation is infrequent, and transgene mAbs translocate to mucosal compartments where they may act prophylactically. We describe the unique glycan profiles and maintenance of neutralization function of transgene mAbs. Lastly, we performed challenge studies to demonstrate the protective capacity of vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP). Together, our data inform clinical trials testing the AAV platform to deliver HIV broadly-neutralizing antibodies to prevent infection.
