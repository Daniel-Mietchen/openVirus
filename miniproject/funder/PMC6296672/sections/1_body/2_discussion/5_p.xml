<p>It is noteworthy that in our study, there was universal concordance between the loss of expression in the plasma and the generation of ADA—a strikingly contemporaneous effect. This suggests that the mechanism of loss of transgene expression in AAV-directed expression of autologous mAbs is likely because of antibody-based mechanisms, and not cellular (cytotoxic). This observation further reinforces the importance of circumventing ADA responses, as previously suggested.[
