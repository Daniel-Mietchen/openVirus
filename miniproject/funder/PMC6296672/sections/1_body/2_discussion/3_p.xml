<p>We achieved long term anti-SIV Env mAb expression in NHP following AAV injection. Importantly, the consistency with which these mAbs are expressed over the long term is encouraging, with expression observed for up to 1 year. Initial studies delivering immunoadhesins, antibody-like molecules derived from SIV infected rhesus macaques, demonstrated stable expression beyond one year post AAV in all animals injected.[

 <xref rid="ppat.1007395.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Transgene expression in these later studies suffered from anti-drug antibody generation elicited against non-rhesus epitopes (human or artificial constructs), with one group requiring immunosuppression to maintain expression beyond eight weeks. These NHP studies reveal the importance of immunological tolerance to transgene products. Rejection by anti-drug antibody has not been reported in other gene therapy clinical trials correcting hemophilia or enzyme deficiencies but remains a major hurdle for antibody delivery.[
