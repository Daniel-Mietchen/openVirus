<p>In conclusion, this study revealed that there were few differences in the epidemiologic characteristics among the five waves of the H7N9 infection epidemics. The epidemic was relatively dispersed, but areas with a possible circulating epidemic were larger than what has been reported, especially in the fifth wave. The epidemic mostly occurred in rural areas, and cross-regional expansion continued since the fourth wave. Based on the findings, we suggest continuous closure of the LPM in both rural and urban areas. Illegal and scattered live poultry trading, especially in rural areas, must be forbidden. In addition, we should strengthen health education about self-protection from feeding backyard poultry and slaughtering poultry by hand. Moreover, the management of the live poultry trade and wholesale border crossing should be more rigorous to prevent the spread of the virus across the area. The surveillance of the cases, especially the mild ones, should be more heightened. Lastly, ongoing research of the pathogenicity in the internal genes is needed.</p>
