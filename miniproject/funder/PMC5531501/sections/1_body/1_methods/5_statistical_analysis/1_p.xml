<p>The 
 <italic>F</italic> test was employed to compare the mean age of H7N9 cases between the five waves. Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were used to compare the occupational and sex distribution of the cases between the five waves. Pearson’s chi-square test and the chi-square test for trend were used to compare the death rate and the proportion of rural cases between the five waves. The Bonferroni 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was employed to further compare the two indexes between each wave. The methods above were computed by SAS9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). ArcGIS software (version 10.1, SERI Inc.; Redlands, CA, USA) was used for the spatial autocorrelation analysis and the Ordinary kriging interpolation. The county was adopted as the geographic unit to calculate the spatial autocorrelation. A 
 <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.005 was considered to be statistically significant for the Bonferroni 
 <italic>t</italic>-test and a 
 <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 for the other tests.
