<p>A global and local autocorrelation analysis using the Moran’s I was carried out to identify spatial autocorrelations. According to the theory, the closer two locations were to each other, the more likely for the incidence rates have an impact on each other [

 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Local Moran’s Index was used to classify the autocorrelations into positive and negative values. When there were similar high values or low values of the incidence rates, they were defined as having a positive autocorrelation (represented as High-High or Low-Low autocorrelation). If the attributes held opposing high and low values, they were considered to have a negative autocorrelation (represent as High-Low or Low-High autocorrelation) [
