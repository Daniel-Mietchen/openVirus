<p>An obvious seasonality was present for the occurrence of H7N9 human infection across the five waves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Cases emerged in March 2013 and grew rapidly, with a peak in April 2013, and then declined. No case was reported from May to September until a new case remerged in October 2013. It should be noted that most cases occurred in January in the following three waves, accounting for an average of 58.4% of the total cases in each wave. The peak incidence of the fifth wave occurred in December 2016, which was earlier than the other waves, and continued to January, 2017, followed by a sharp decline in February and March (7 and 3 cases, respectively). A few cases (9 cases, 4.13% of total) were identified during May and September in the previous four waves. Of the total cases, male cases predominated, accounting for an average of 63.1% in the five waves. Gender distribution did not differ significantly among the five waves (
