<p>Second, the epidemics continuously circulated in the northern areas, including Hangzhou City, Jiaxing City, Huzhou City and Shaoxing City in Zhejiang Province throughout the five waves (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g007">7</xref>). The estimated number of cases in the northern areas were obviously more than those in the other areas, especially in the second wave, where the cases in Xiaoshan county, Yuhang county, Deqing county, Anji county and Yinzhou county were all above 7 (

Ningbo City, Taizhou City and Wenzhou City in the southeast areas were affected in the second wave, and Jinhua City, Quzhou City and Lishui City located in the south-central areas were also affected in the waves that followed. The affected areas in the fifth wave were larger than those in previous waves. It was found that most cities in Zhejiang Province were affected by the epidemics throughout all five waves, but only Zhoushan City, located on the east island, remained virus free (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g006">6</xref>), and there were perhaps no more than two cases in Zhoushan City, according to the upper-bound of the estimation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g007">Fig 7</xref>). It should also be noted that one highly-infected region in the east area of Ningbo City and one highly infected region in the south were identified in the second and the fifth wave, respectively.
