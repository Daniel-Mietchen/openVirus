<p>The result of the ordinary kriging interpolation showed that there were many unidentified infections in the areas with no reported cases, indicating that the total number of cases infected with the H7N9 virus were far more than what has been reported to date (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In most of the areas, there were no more than two cases within one epidemic period, and based on the estimation of the confidence interval, the number of cases were between 0–2 in the first, the third and the fourth wave. In contrast, the cases in the second and fifth wave were more than those in the aforementioned three waves and fluctuated between 0–6 in the second wave and between 0–4 in the fifth wave in most of the areas (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180763.g006">6</xref> and
