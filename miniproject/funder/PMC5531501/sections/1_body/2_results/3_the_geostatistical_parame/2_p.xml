<p>The partial sill (C
 <sub>1</sub>) was 0.2582, 7.7863, 0.6320, 0.9723, and 1.9801 in each wave, respectively. The nugget (C
 <sub>0</sub>) was 0.4789, 0.1642, 0.0982, 0.1416 and 0.2161 in each corresponding wave, respectively. The C
 <sub>1</sub>/ C
 <sub>0</sub>+ C
 <sub>1</sub> ratios among the last four waves were all above 85%, and were even above 90% in the second and fifth waves, but was relatively low (35%) in the first wave, which suggested that the spatial autocorrelation was generally relatively strong. All the results are shown in
