 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], most of the cases infected with H7N9 virus were males and people over 50 years old, and there was a higher proportion of farmers. The epidemic characteristics, including gender, age and occupational distribution, were similar across the five waves in the Zhejiang Province in China. Although there were significant differences in death rate, the fatality rate was similar among the last four waves and there was no significant trend in death rate across the five waves. The reason for these similarities in the epidemic characteristics among the five waves may be because the circulating H7N9 virus genotypes were similar to those in previous waves, although there were a few point mutations discovered in the amino acids in some samples, which might increase the virus’ adaptation to gain person-to-person transmission ability and infect humans more efficiently [

Its peak incidence continued in January 2017 and then fell rapidly. Meanwhile, the incidence peak may move up. The reasons for the advance of the peak could be that the temperature in December 2016 was suitable for the virus and the advance of the Chinese New Year in 2017, which increased live poultry consumption and exposure[
