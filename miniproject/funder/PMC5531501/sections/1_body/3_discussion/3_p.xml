<p>Additionally, we used some parameter to evaluate the assumption of the model. The semivariance parameter is usually used to evaluate the strength of the correlation, except for Moran's I Index. According to the semivariogram figure, the semivariance was relatively low in the short range and gradually grew to the extremum among the five waves. This means that the more close sample points, the characteristics of the sampleswere more similar. The ratio of the partial sill to the sill was the key indicator, which represents the extent of variation due to spatial autocorrelation. In the study, these ratios among the last four waves were all above 85%, which suggested that the spatial autocorrelation was relatively strong in general and the variation due to the spatial autocorrelation was the main contribution to the observed difference. The ratio in the first wave was relatively low(35%), the reason of which maybe the cases in the first wave almost clustered in the northern areas and the different epidemics in the northern areas relative to other areas, however the local spatial autocorrelation in the northern areas was still strong. Therefore, the interpolation analysis was suitable for the incidence of H7N9 infection among the five waves.</p>
