In our study from the estimation maps, it was found that the epidemics tended to disappear in urban areas and presented relatively sporadic characteristics, especially since the fourth wave after the closure of the LPM in the urban areas in 2014. Meanwhile, according to the total proportion of rural cases, it increased obviously in the fourth and the fifth waves. However, different from urban areas in Zhejiang Province, live poultry transactions in rural areas were mainly scattered among the whole area and not centralized in markets. For example, many farmers sell poultry at the roadside instead of in the market. This may be one reason for the increasing proportion of rural cases. According to the latest research [
 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], raising backyard poultry at home and having direct contact with backyard poultry have been identified as two new risk factors associated with increased risk of infection with H7N9 virus, which may be another reason that the epidemic currently circulated primarily in the rural areas in the Zhejiang Province instead of in urban areas.
