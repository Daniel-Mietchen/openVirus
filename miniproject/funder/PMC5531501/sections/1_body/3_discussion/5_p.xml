<p>The epidemic is continuously circulating in the northern areas in Zhejiang Province, China throughout the five waves. Most of the long-term high-high clusters were identified in the northern areas, which meant the incidences of h7n9 infection were similarly high among these areas, and more attention is needed to prevent epidemics in the areas. The possible reason for the continuous epidemic and clusters in the northern area is that these areas are in the Yangtze River Delta region along the Taihu Lake, which is recognized as the origin of virus recombination that lead to the outbreaks [

Therefore, the circulation of the virus in the domestic poultry transmitted by the local wildfowl and contaminated environment sustained, which contributes to the enzootic H7N9 virus infection in such areas. Although permanent closure of the live poultry markets was implemented in the main urban areas of Zhejiang Province, live poultry trade in rural areas and in privacy or wholesale crossing the border still existed. This contributed to the spread of the virus from the northern contaminated region to other counties and the expansion of the affected areas, especially the southern and central areas of Zhejiang Province [

One high-high cluster was found in the Wencheng county in the fifth wave, which meant similar epidemics in this county and its neighboring areas. Additionally, 3 high-low clusters were found in the southeast areas. Although incidences in their surrounding areas were lower, the epidemic may expand to the neighboring areas where it may become a source of H7N9 outbreak in the future. One important thing that should be noted is that the continuous trans-regional expansion of the H7N9 viruses has accelerated the reassortment among H7N9 and other subtypes of viruses [
