<p>Several limitations should be noted with our study. First, data, including the clinic information, environmental specimens and serological surveillance, were not collected, and thus detailed clinical characteristics, positive rates of H7N9 virus in the environment and seropositive rates could not be compared. Second, only those cases confirmed to be infected with the H7N9 virus were analyzed by the ordinary kriging interpolation methods. If the seropositive rate of the population and the positive rate of H7N9 in the environment were added into the analysis, the estimation would have been more accurate. Finally, the extent of infection was estimated only in the spatial as opposed to the temporal dimension. Therefore, the temporal trend of the epidemic in each area could not be identified. Further research should be carried out to obtain a more comprehensive conclusion.</p>
