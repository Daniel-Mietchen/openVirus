According to the inference of some previous research, there were mild and subclinical infections occurring at the same time as the epidemic.

 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Consistent with the previous research, it was found that areas with possible unidentified cases were larger. The number of cases could be more than those reported to date and most of them may be the mild or subclinical ones.
