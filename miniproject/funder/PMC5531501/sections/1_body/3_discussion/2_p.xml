<p>The key assumption of the interpolation analysis was that the distribution of the value was a spatial correlative[

As we know, most of the infectious diseases were spatially correlative depending on the geographical environment, meteorological factors, economic levels, local custom and other factors. The H7N9 epidemic emerged in the Northern areas of the Zhejiang Province, then the spread of the virus and the expansion of the contaminated region contributed to the dispersion of the epidemic. The similarity of the contaminated environment and the exposure to the virus make the case spatially correlative and the interpolation analysis feasible.
