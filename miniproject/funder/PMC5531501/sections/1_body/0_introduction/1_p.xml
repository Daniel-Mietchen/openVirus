 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The epidemic caused great concern due to the increasing number of cases, the expansion of the affected areas, the high fatality rate, mutation of the virus and the stigma attached to the virus [

 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. To date, five waves of H7N9 epidemics have emerged in mainland China. There were 775 laboratory-confirmed infections of A(H7N9) virus across 16 provinces and 3 municipalities as of August 31, 2016[

It should be noted that Zhejiang is a province located in the Yangtze River Delta region of southeastern China that is well recognized as the original source of the H7N9 outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This province was the most seriously affected area, accounting for nearly 30% of total cases reported and 25% of the total fatal cases during the last four waves in mainland China[
