 <xref rid="pone.0180763.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The objectives of this study are to identify the epidemiological characteristics and the distribution of H7N9 virus in human infection from 2013 to 2017. The Kriging spatial interpolation methods will be applied to estimate the number of human infections with H7N9 virus and to infer the extent of infections in areas that currently have no reported cases.
