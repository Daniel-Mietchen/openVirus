 <xref rid="pone.0211401.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) which address the main points that characterize a health cost analysis. The initial objective of this checklist was to provide guidelines for the evaluation of articles submitted to the BMJ, enabling easier understanding of experts and non-specialist. This checklist is divided into three blocks of questions: i) drawing the study with 11 items; ii) data collection holding 9 items; And iii) analysis and interpretation of the results holding 9 items. The application of this quality instrument in this work was performed independently between the two reviewers. The discrepancies were solved by consensus and, in the absence of consensus, a third reviewer was consulted.
