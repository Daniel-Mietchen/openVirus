<p>Data on dengue cases in Guangzhou and Zhongshan for the period 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 2005 to 31
 <sup>st</sup> December 2014 were collected from the Chinese National Disease Surveillance Reporting System (NDSRS). The NDSRS is a web-based system set up in 2004 by the Chinese CDC. The system covers the entire population (1.3 billion people) living in all provinces, prefectures, and counties that make up mainland China. Thirty-nine reportable infectious diseases are currently included in this system. Individual cases, including clinically diagnosed and laboratory confirmed cases, are required to be reported by doctors within specified hours after diagnosis to the online system. Dengue has been included in the system as one of the surveilled diseases since 2005 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and dengue cases are required to be reported within 24 hours of diagnosis. Since dengue fever is a legally national notifiable infectious disease in China, case data was collected systematically and continuously. Dengue fever cases were diagnosed based on standardized laboratory tests and clinical/epidemiological investigations according to the Dengue Diagnostic Criteria enacted by the China Health Committee in 2001 and 2008. The data we collected from the NDSRS was anonymized. Overseas imported dengue cases were excluded in this study, as they did not represent the native transmission situation.
