<p>In order to calculate the prevalence of dengue infections in the study areas, the time series of weekly case counts were plotted. In order to obtain a robust and smooth model, meteorological data was transformed into new variables using prior moving average of 5 weeks. Cross-correlations were also conducted between natural logarithm transformed weekly dengue case counts in Zhongshan (natural logarithm transformed case counts = 
 <italic>Ln</italic> (case counts + 1)) and each new variable (the treated meteorological variable) to determine the best lag of meteorological parameter that leads to Zhongshanâ€™s epidemics.
