<p>In order to validate the robustness of the model and avoid overfitting, k-fold cross-validation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was also applied. The original dataset was partitioned randomly into k subsets using random numbers generating from SPSS. For each cross-validation step, a single subset was retained as the test set, and the remaining k-1 subsets were used as the training set. The cross-validation process was then repeated k times with each of the k subsets used exactly once as the test set. The k results from the folds were then averaged to produce a single estimation. In this study, the k value is set to 10.
