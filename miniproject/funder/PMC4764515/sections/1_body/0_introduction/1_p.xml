<p>Currently, dengue is considered the most prevalent and rapidly growing mosquito-borne viral disease of humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], with 50% of the worldâ€™s population at risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In recent decades, it has spread from endemic areas, mainly tropical and subtropical regions, to dengue-free regions where social and environmental conditions were suitable [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recent estimates of dengue include 390 million infections per year worldwide, including 96 million symptomatic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are currently no licensed vaccines or specific therapeutics, and the only way of controlling dengue is vector control, though with limited success [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, interventions are still believed to be effective with increased resources [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In order to trigger timely interventions, alerts for potential outbreaks are of particular importance to mobilize vector control and to prime or reorganize healthcare services in preparation for a surge in dengue infections.
