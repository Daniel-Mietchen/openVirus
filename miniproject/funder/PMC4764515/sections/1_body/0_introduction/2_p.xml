<p>Determining the factors influencing the transmission of dengue is also important for helping to choose appropriate interventions. Dengue is usually transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes. There are many factors involved in the transmission of dengue, including social, demographic, entomological, and environmental factors [
