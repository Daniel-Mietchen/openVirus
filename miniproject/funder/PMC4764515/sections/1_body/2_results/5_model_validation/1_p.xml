<p>When validated via ROC analysis using entire data, the forecasting model performed well in generating early warnings of dengue epidemics in Zhongshan at a reporting threshold of 3 cases in a single week, which means that the model can successfully estimate and announce epidemic risks of an outbreak involving â‰¥3 cases per week, with 0.969 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 92.6% (

Similarly, at a threshold of 2 cases per week, the forecasting model showed robust results, with 0.957 AUC, 88.9% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity; and at a threshold of 1 case per week, it had 0.938 AUC, 83.0% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity (
