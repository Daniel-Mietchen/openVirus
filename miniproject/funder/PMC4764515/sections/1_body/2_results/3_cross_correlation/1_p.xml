 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004473.g003">Fig 3</xref>) showed that the previous dengue epidemics in Guangzhou may have a great impact on the current week in Zhongshan, especially the last 5 weeks (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.5). Taking this into consideration, an index was created based on the last 5 weekly Guangzhou case numbers via prior moving average, to be a predictor for forecasting epidemics in Zhongshan.
