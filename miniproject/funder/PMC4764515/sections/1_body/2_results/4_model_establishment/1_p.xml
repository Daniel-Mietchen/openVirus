 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> showed the results on log-linked negative binomial regression models. The model including dengue cases in Guangzhou, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall was considered as the best-fit model (AIC = 841.442). In this model, the treated Guangzhou dengue cases had a possitive correlation with Zhangshan’s weekly dengue cases (Relative Risk (RR) = 2.016, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.845–2.203). Similarly, treated minimum temperature (RR = 1.335, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.125–1.583), treated relative humidity (1.207, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.151–1.265), and treated rainfall (RR = 1.031, 95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.026–1.037) also had possitive correlation with dengue case counts in Zhongshan.
