<p>These findings indicated that the dengue epidemics in Guangzhou may be a potential predictor of dengue epidemics in Zhongshan, and demonstrated the effectiveness of evaluating the risk of suffering from emerging infectious diseases in one city on the basis of the situation in its neighboring cities, controlling other major risk factors such as local weather. The correlation between dengue epidemics in Guangzhou and Zhongshan also suggested the potential role that human movement has played in dengue transmission between cities, though this still needs further confirmation. Recently, Wesolowski, A. et al. have estimated flows of humans using cellular data in order to model and predict dengue epidemics in Pakistan [
