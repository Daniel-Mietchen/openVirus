<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that climatic factors such as temperature, relative humidity and rainfall directly and/or indirectly influence dengue transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Temperature impacts vector population development, reproductive rates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and extrinsic incubation period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Additionally, temperature may also affect human behavior. For example, people will wear very light clothing when the temperature is high, which may increase the contact opportunities between the vector and human beings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Rainfall provides mosquito breeding sites and stimulates egg hatching, thereby increasing mosquito population, while at the same time eliminating breeding sites through floods [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Humidity is another key factor that influences mosquitoes at different stages, especially during mating and egg laying. Studies have demonstrated that the combined effect of temperature and humidity significantly influences the number of blood meals and increases the survival rate of the vector [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Many studies have provided evidence to show the relationship between climatic factors and dengue transmission, but the intensity of the association varied with time and location in the Asia-Pacific region [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall were major determinants of dengue transmission as meta analyses showed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Many studies have also highlighted the importance of lag time of the climate variables [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For example, in Taiwan, there was a significant positive correlation with maximum temperature at lag 1–4 months, minimum temperature at lag 1–3 months, relative humidity at lag 1–3 months, and daily rainfall at lag 10 weeks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In our study, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall led to an increase in dengue incidence in Zhongshan after about 6 weeks, 15 weeks, and 7 weeks, respectively, which is also consistent with the study in Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The 6–7 weeks lag effect of minimum temperature and rainfall we observed is not unexpected. It accounts for the influence of climatic variables on the development, maturation, and survival of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (about 7–9 days from egg to adult) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], as well as the extrinsic incubation period of DENV in the vector (10 days) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the intrinsic incubation period in the human host (4–8 days) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, the considerable life span of adult mosquitoes (around 3 weeks) provides multiple chances for the vectors to bite the humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, relative humidity seems to have a positive impact on the epidemics at an earlier time in our research. The reason may lie in the fact that humidity influences mosquitoes especially at the early stage during mating and egg laying as mentioned above. The eggs can resist desiccation and withstand months of dormancy, and the duration and environmental humidity of the dormancy can affect larval survival, developmental rates and produces smaller adults [
