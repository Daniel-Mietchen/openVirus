<p>Our research showed that weekly dengue cases in Zhongshan were significantly associated with dengue cases in Guangzhou after the treatment of 5 weeks prior moving average on natural logarithm transformation. Minimum temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall all had positive correlation with weekly dengue cases with different lags. This means that if the minimum temperature around 6 weeks before and the relative humidity around 15 weeks before was higher, and rainfall around 7 weeks before was heavier in Zhongshan, and if Guangzhou suffered from a bigger dengue epidemic in the last 5 weeks, the risk of a dengue epidemic in Zhongshan would be higherâ€“and vice versa. ROC curve analysis and k-fold cross-validation suggested that our model performed well in generating early warnings of dengue epidemics in Zhongshan.</p>
