<p>The association of dengue epidemics between Guangzhou and Zhongshan is obvious–dengue epidemics in Guangzhou can predict following epidemics in Zhongshan when suitable climate is available, but the underlying reason may be more complicated than we thought. First, as indigenous dengue epidemics in South China are still regarded as a consequence of imported cases from overseas countries [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and as Guangzhou is the “south gate of China” with significant international trade, Guangzhou may therefore have a higher risk of importing overseas cases at an earlier time than other cities, which makes Guangzhou serve as a sentinel for South China. For example, in 2014, the indigenous epidemic in Guangzhou was about 1.5 months earlier than that in Zhongshan. Second, Zhongshan has convenient transportation and close communication traditions with Guangzhou which allows easy transmission of cases between the two cities. As far as we know, lots of workers and businessmen are frequently traveling between these two cities, and some of them go to work in Guangzhou in day time but go back home in Zhongshan after work. In this way, dengue cases can easily be imported from Guangzhou to Zhongshan when the environment is appropriate, which suggested the role of human movement in dengue transmission. It has been showed that, among the first 40 imported dengue cases in Zhongshan in 2014, 31 of them were originally infected in Guangzhou. Certainly, the transmission of dengue may happen in both directions, but as we mentioned above, Guangzhou tends to suffer from dengue outbreaks more constantly and earlier, and there are more cases imported from Guangzhou to Zhongshan than that from Zhongshan to Guangzhou in the field. Zhongshan epidemic appeared to pre-date Guangzhou epidemic in 2013. One of the reasons might be that the weather and/or the mosquito density happened to be much more suitable for dengue transmission in Zhongshan in 2013 than that in Guangzhou. Therefore, further investigation is needed to identify the potential confounders in future research. Nevertheless, in general, epidemics were likely to occur earlier in Guangzhou, under most circumstances, than in Zhongshan.
