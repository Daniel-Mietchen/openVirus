<p>The limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, reporting bias might be present as some of the health service centers or hospitals fail to report every case precisely due to political pressure or their lack of responsibility. However, as this study only included case data of 2005 to 2014, bias could be less or negligible. This is because the Chinese CDC has organised a surveillance diseases reporting system since 2005, with necessary measures implemented to improve reporting quality. Second, we have only included climatic variables but not mosquito density in this study. However, traditional indices of mosquito density such as House Index (HI), Container Index (CI), and Breteau Index (BI) require freguency surveillance, are not precise, and are highly dependent on both agent’s effort and householder availability [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004473.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Finally, social-economic factors like environmental sanitation, average family income, education and human movement were not assessed in our study, as we believed that such factors would not have changed too much in Zhongshan during the study period, and data of human movement was not available temporarily.
