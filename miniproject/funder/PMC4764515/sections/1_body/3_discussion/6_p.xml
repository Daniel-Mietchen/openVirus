<p>We have applied treated data in our models as it is essential for a robust model. As dengue case counts is not normally distributed, we applied a natural logarithmic (ln) transformation for dengue cases to reduce the impact of dengue extreme values. For the modeling selection, due to the over-dispersion of the dengue cases relative to the Poisson distribution, we chose a generalized linear model with negative binomial-distributed and a log link. Morevoer, we tested and validated the model using different assumed distribution (eg., Poisson and negative binomial). Nagative binomial model gave a better fit in terms of a lower AIC value (AIC: range from 653.142 to 804.912), compared with the Possion model (AIC: range from 2348.906 to 2783.250). The use of prior moving average on weather variables can smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends which also benefit our model because the impact of weather variables is usually mild and long-term. We performed cross-correlation analysis to assess the lagged correlations between climatic variables and dengue cases in Zhongshan, as literature suggests that the cross-correlation function can provide a statistical comparison of two sequences as a function of the time-shift between them [

And the results of the regression model confirmed these correlations furhter. We used ROC curve analysis to evaluate our predictive model as it took both sensitivity and specificity into account, and the area under the curve was considered as an effective measure of accuracy [
