  <title>Locations of Guangzhou, Zhongshan and the neighboring cities.</title>
  <p>Nowadays, Guangzhou is considered a prominent commercial and business center in the PRD region. To maintain its role, major infrastructural projects were undertaken, including the construction of ring roads, highways, and railway tracks. This in turn provided easily accessible transportation between Guangzhou and other cities for the public. As Zhongshan is 86 kilometers from Guangzhou (a distance interconnected by Guangzhou-Zhuhai local train and several highways), workers and businessmen frequently travel between these two cities, and some go to work in Guangzhou during the day and return home to Zhongshan after work.</p>
