  <title>Cross correlations for natural logarithm transformed weekly dengue case counts of Zhongshan and Guangzhou.</title>
  <p>After making a prior moving average at a span of 5 weeks for each meteorological factor, cross-correlations were also used to find the best lags at which meteorological factors led to Zhongshan epidemics. 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004473.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that each treated variable was positively correlated with natural logarithm transformed weekly dengue cases in Zhongshan at different lags (Details in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004473.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Therefore, we selected the nearest peak as the best lag for each variable. Treated weekly average minimum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall have triggered epidemics in Zhongshan by 6 weeks (correlation coefficient = 0.304), 15 weeks (correlation coefficient = 0.274) and 7 weeks (correlation coefficient = 0.299), respectively.
