The additional pathways are: (A) Influenza Infection; (B) 3â€²-UTR-mediated translational regulation; (C) Metabolism of proteins; and (D) Ribosome. (E) Interaction network of all 183 proteins. Note that NUMA1 (indicated with red arrow) does not interact with any of the other 182 proteins identified in our assay. Figure S2: (A) A549 cell viability after each of 107 genes was knocked down for 91 h. Values normalized to non-silencing (N-Si). (B) Ratio of viral titer to cell viability for the indicated 11 KD A549 cells. Error bar represents S.E.M. from 2 independent experiments. *:
