  <p>Ultrastructural examination of Mock-infected, and of PR8-infected N-Si and 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells at 20 hpi after MOI = 3 infection. Mock-infected, and N-Si and 
   <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD PR8-infected, A549 cells were harvested, processed with EM Grade Karnovsky fixative and stained with uranyl acetate. All processed samples were analyzed with a Philips CM-10 electron microscope by the histology lab, Department of Human Anatomy. Numerous ~100 nm particles appear to be budding from infected N-Si KD cells (black arrows, center panel) whereas virus production was significantly reduced in PR8-infected 
   <italic>NUMA</italic> KD A549 cells (right panel). Boxed regions are enlarged in the lower left insets and scale bars for the micrographs, and for the insets, are indicated.
