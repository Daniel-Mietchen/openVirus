<p>IAV is a very well-studied virus. However, little is known about mechanisms of virus–host interactions during infection and disease progression. Different host proteins and different viral proteins play important roles in individual steps during the viral life cycle [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A better understanding of virus–host interactions will provide greater mechanistic elucidation of influenza virus replication, which may identify additional strategies to prevent or ameliorate infections. In the last two decades, many host proteins were found to interact with Influenza NP and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (PA, PB1 and PB2) and some of these regulated the viral replication process [
