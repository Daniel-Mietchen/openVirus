<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a significant pathogen that causes substantial amounts of contagious respiratory disease in humans. Recent human infections with avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes emphasize the ongoing threat of this virus to cause future epidemics and pandemics. Two classes of anti-influenza drugs, viral M2 and NA inhibitors, are available; however, emergence of drug-resistant IAVs is becoming a serious concern [

In the future, influenza virus may lose sensitivity to all available drugs due to its genetic plasticity caused by the segmented nature of genomes and high mutation rate. Thus, there is a continued need to develop new concepts and drugs to overcome the problem of virus-targeted antiviral resistance.
