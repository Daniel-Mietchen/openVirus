<p>The IAV M1 protein plays important roles in assembly of progeny virions. It helps in transporting vRNPs from the nucleus to the budding sites [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, we determined whether virus production was reduced due to the relocation of viral M1 in infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells. To investigate this, 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si KD A549 cells were infected with PR8 at MOI 3, fixed at 20 hpi, treated with anti-M1 Ab and analyzed by super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). M1 proteins accumulated and formed clusters adjacent to the nucleus in infected-
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD A549 cells (

 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells and NUMA1 may be involved in M1 trafficking. M2 is another IAV protein that plays important roles in viral assembly and budding steps near the cytoplasmic membrane [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. SIM was also conducted with PR8-infected 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si cells. In NUMA1 depleted cells, most of the M2 proteins accumulated near the plasma membrane (
