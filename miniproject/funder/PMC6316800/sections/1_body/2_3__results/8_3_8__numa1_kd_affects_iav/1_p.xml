<p>Although viral proteins were synthesized efficiently in 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD A549 cells, infectious virus production was significantly reduced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). To determine the generality of this observation, we then knocked down 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC-3KT; ATCC cat # CRL-4051; “HBEC”), and in additional A549 cells, and determined the capacity of additional H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains to replicate in these KD cells. All tested IAV clones were reduced 55–99% in the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells compared to non-silencing control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). These data suggest that NUMA1 depletion might affect infectious virus production. To examine this possibility, 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD and N-Si cells were infected with PR8 at MOI 0.05 and supernatants were harvested at 43 hpi. Viruses were pelleted from the N-Si and 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD supernatants by ultracentrifugation and resuspended in small equal volumes of PBS. Titration of the pre- and post-concentrated viruses confirmed that viral titers from the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells were significantly reduced to ~20% of titers from N-Si cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>H). To differentiate between the possibilities that equal numbers of particles were released from the 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells but they were less infectious than particles released from N-Si-treated cells, or that fewer particles were matured from 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells, equal volumes of purified and resuspended viruses generated from the N-Si and 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells were analyzed by Western blot to detect viral structural proteins NP, M1 and M2. The amounts of all tested proteins from 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells were reduced to 40%, 26% and 16%, respectively compared to viral proteins produced from the N-Si (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>I,J). Therefore, the average structural protein reduction was similar to the infectivity reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>D,E,I,J), suggesting no significant difference in particle-to-PFU ratios, but that NUMA1 is involved in viral maturation.
