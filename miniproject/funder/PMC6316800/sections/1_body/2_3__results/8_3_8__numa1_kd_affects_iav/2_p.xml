<p>As an alternate method to assess differences in virus maturation, we infected non-silencing and 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells with PR8 at MOI = 3 and examined infected cells at 20 hpi by electron microscopy. Numerous small spherical structures, consistent with the ~100 nm IAV virion size, were clearly visible outside but near the cell membrane, presumably after budding (

 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD cells (
