<p>A549 cells were infected with PR8 at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Mock-infected controls were treated similarly but without virus. Cells were harvested and processed as described [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, infected and mock-infected cells were scraped from plates at 6 and 24 h post infection (hpi), washed 3× with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), cellular pellets resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.4% NP40 and 1× Roche complete™-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor, Mississauga, ON, Canada) on ice for 15 mins and vortexed every 5 min. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by centrifuging for 5 min at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic>, nuclear pellets were re-extracted in lysis buffer supplemented with 8% sucrose, and supernatants combined for cytoplasmic fractions. The remaining pellets were washed 4× with PBS supplemented with 8% sucrose and 0.25× protease inhibitor. The 4×-washed pellets were resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer, sonicated 10 s, and nuclear extracts collected by centrifuging at 10,000×
