<p>Cell lysates obtained as described above were mixed with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer containing 90 mM DDT, boiled and subjected to electrophoresis in 4–12% gradient Novex NuPAGE SDS-PAGE Gels (Invitrogen). Resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Etobicoke, ON, Canada), and membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and probed with various antibodies. Primary antibodies were monoclonal α-NS1 [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (gift from Dr. Mingyi Li, National Microbiology Labs), monoclonal α-M1 (Thermo Fisher, MA1-80736), polyclonal α-M2 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-32233), monoclonal α-beta-actin (Cell Signalling, 3700S, Danvers, MA, USA), α-NUMA1 (Bethyl Laboratory, A301-510A, Montgomery, TX, USA), α-PRPF19 (Bethyl Laboratory, A300-101A) and/or α-UTP6 (Thermo Fisher, PA5-21716). Primary antibodies were detected with HRP-linked polyclonal α-mouse (Cell Signalling, 7076S), polyclonal α-rabbit (Cell Signalling, 7074S) or monoclonal VeriBlot™ (Abcam, Ab131366, Toronto, ON, Canada) secondary antibodies and HRP signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (prepared in house). Images were taken with an Alpha Innotech Fluor Chem
