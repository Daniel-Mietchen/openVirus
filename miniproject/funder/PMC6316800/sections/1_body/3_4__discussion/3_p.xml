<p>Many of our NS1-interacting host proteins interact with each other according to STRING analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f002">Figure 2</xref>Fâ€“H). Thus, some of the newly identified proteins may not directly interact with NS1 but may have been pulled down in the IPs by secondary interactions. However, we validated the interactions of NUMA1 with IAV-NS1 by reciprocal co-IP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), identifying NUMA1 as one of several proteins not currently known to interact with other identified proteins (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, red circle) according to STRING, suggesting that the NUMA1-NS1 interaction is a direct one.
