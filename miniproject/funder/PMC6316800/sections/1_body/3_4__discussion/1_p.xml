<p>The goal of this study was to detect novel host factors that interact with native IAV NS1 during natural infection and viral replication. To target a wide range of NS1-interacting host factors during viral replication, we selected early and late time points. We had previously detected NS1 as early as 5â€“6 hpi [

Therefore, we selected 6 and 24 hpi as early and late time points for our co-IP experiments. 183 NS1-interacting host proteins were detected in at least two different biological replicates and most of these are involved in different cellular biological processes, molecular functions and pathways.
