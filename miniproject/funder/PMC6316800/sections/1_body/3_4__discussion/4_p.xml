<p>We knocked down 107 of the most promising NS1-interacting host proteins to evaluate their impact on IAV replication. Several groups have used viral gene luciferase assays or viral protein immunostaining in 96 well formats to detect viral replication, but these are surrogates for RNA production or protein, respectively, and do not address progeny viral infectivity directly. We measured viral titers to assess virus replication and infectious virus production directly from infected-KD cells. Knocking down 11 NS1-interacting host proteins significantly reduced IAV replication at least 3-fold compared to the control cells in three different experimental replicates. Although some genes’ KD, such as

 <italic>DDX54</italic>, 
 <italic>ELAVL1</italic>, 
 <italic>FXR1</italic>, 
 <italic>H2AFJ</italic>, 
 <italic>NOP56</italic> and 
 <italic>RRS1</italic> increased viral titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00731-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), we focused this study on the 11 gene candidates that significantly reduced virus titer. Most cells were ≥80% viable after 48 h KD; however, many infected-KD cells were less viable 43 h later (

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. To differentiate between virus-mediated versus prolonged KD-mediated cell death, we examined cell viabilities of non-infected cells at 91 h post KD (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Viability of these cells was uniformly higher than for the KD-infected cells, indicating loss of cell viability at prolonged time was primarily caused by viral-induced cell death. Lower viral titer in many of the KD cells also corresponded with lower cell viability post-infection. For example, 
 <italic>ILF2</italic> KD resulted in ~50% cell viability at the end of infection. Therefore, we compared viral yields to post-infection cell viabilities for the N-Si and all 11 KD A549 cells. Even when accounting for reduced cell viability, viral yields were substantially lower in many of the KD cells (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00731">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), including 
 <italic>NUMA1</italic> KD, suggesting the lower titers were caused by the KD, not by the lower cell viability. Among these 11 candidates, ILF2, HNRNPUL2, and PRPF19 were previously identified as NS1 interacting proteins in the VirHostNet 2.0 database. The PRPF19 deficient cells were demonstrated to reduce influenza virus production in a recent study [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-10-00731" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] while our study was ongoing. NUMA1, RAI14, RBM28, RBM34, RPF1, SF3B3, SNRNP200, and UTP6 proteins represent newly discovered potential NS1 interacting proteins, knocking down of which significantly reduces infectious IAV production. These novel NS1-interacting host factors may have roles in controlling viral/host mRNA maturation, splicing and gene expression to favour viral replication.
