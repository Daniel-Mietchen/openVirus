<p>The arboviruses transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, like chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) have reached threatening numbers in the last years, with a huge impact on public health systems in several countries throughout the world [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the detection and identification of circulating arboviruses are most often taken from human cases, mainly when an outbreak is already in place. With the fast-worldwide expansion of new emerging or reemerging arboviruses such as CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV, the need to establish the role of each mosquito species in the spread of these pathogens is clear. This knowledge is fundamental to the implementation of effective surveillance and control measures against these vectors in order to avoid the early establishment of an arboviral epidemic [
