<p>We report the first detection of Zika virus vertical transmission in an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> larvae under the natural conditions found in the field. Therefore, we evaluated if there was a productive infection in the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> larvae by strand-specific amplification of viral RNA. ZIKV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. During flaviviruses replication, a complementary negative-strand RNA is produced, which is used as a template for synthesizing new positive-strand RNA copies. Viral replication progresses asymmetrically, producing more positive-strand than negative-strand RNA. The positive-strand RNA molecules are packaged into the virions, acts as templates for viral protein production and promotes evasion of innate cell response [
