<p>The primary aim of our study was to evaluate natural arboviruses vertical transmission in the field. Since this study was conducted under circumstances where the cold-chain could not be guaranteed, we decided to use a study design that favored the molecular detection, protecting viral RNA as soon as possible. Therefore, we decided to disrupt the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae directly in Trizol reagent, which consists of a solution of phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate that concurrently solubilizes biological material and immediately inactivates RNases [
