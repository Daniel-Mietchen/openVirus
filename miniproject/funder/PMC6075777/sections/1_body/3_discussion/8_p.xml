<p>To the best of our knowledge, there is only one plausible explanation that could explain the detection of ZIKV RNA in the larvae, besides a canonical viral infection. Recently, different studies showed that naked viral RNA from hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as from human pegivirus, two members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (genus 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic>, respectively), may spread infection in exosomes vesicles [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Importantly, these studies showed the phenomenon 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and further investigations are required to prove if similar events occur during ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the same studies also showed that, regardless of the way of viral RNA release in the cytoplasm of newly “infected” cells, productive viral RNA replication was observed, leading to the release of infectious particles. Given this, although our study design does not allow us to assert if ZIKV RNA reaches larvae cells by a classic route of viral infection, the specific detection of the negative strand RNA provides substantial evidence that active viral replication has occurred in
