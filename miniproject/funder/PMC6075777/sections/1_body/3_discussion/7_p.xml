<p>In this study, ZIKV cDNA was produced with the reverse primer, which hybridizes with the positive-strand RNA, e.g., the genomic RNA found into the virion particle and also detected during viral replication, or with the forward primer, which hybridizes with the negative-strand RNA, only found during replication. The qPCR results clearly showed that both cDNAs were amplified in a positive-to-negative strand RNA ratio of approximately 2:1.</p>
