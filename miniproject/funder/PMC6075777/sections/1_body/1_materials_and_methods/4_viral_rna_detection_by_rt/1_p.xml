<p>All samples were evaluated for the detection of three arboviral RNAs by RT-qPCR in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA, #4376598) located at the Real-Time PCR Platform of ILMD. The protocols used for the detection of each virus were previously published: DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; and ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but we conducted the assays with some modifications. All probes were used at a final concentration of 0.1μM, whereas all primers were used at a final concentration of 0.3μM. All reactions were performed with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA, #4444432), following manufacturer’s recommendations, except for the number of cycles that was increased to 45. For each lot of analyzed samples, three blank reactions (nuclease-free water as the template) and external positive controls (RNA extracted from viral culture) were included. The number of viral copies in each positive sample was estimated by RT-qPCR using absolute quantification by the standard curve method and reported as viral RNA copies/μL (of the eluted RNA).
