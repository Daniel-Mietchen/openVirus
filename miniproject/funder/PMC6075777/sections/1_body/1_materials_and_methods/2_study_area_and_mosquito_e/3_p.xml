<p>All of the properties where the ovitraps were installed were georeferenced with the use of a GPS device (Garmin Ltd, USA#MP62SC) with UTMâ€”SIRGAS 2000 projection. The coordinates were inserted into a geographic information system (GIS) in the software QGIS 2.16.2, where each property had its spatial location identified as a point (attribute) in a layer (shape) of the city.</p>
