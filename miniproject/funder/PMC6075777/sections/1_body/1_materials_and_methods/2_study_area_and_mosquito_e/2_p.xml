<p>Our group has been using ovitraps to monitor 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. infestation. The ovitraps consist of a dark plastic container with a capacity of 700 mL containing 300 mL of a 0.04% brewer's yeast solution as an attractant for mosquito females, and an oviposition substrate on which the eggs are laid (Eucatex, Brazil) with the rough part facing the inner area of the trap for oviposition. On each monitoring cycle, a total of 100 ovitraps were installed around selected houses in the city, with a weekly exchange of the pallets. Ovitraps distribution was equidistant on every 200 meters, covering the entire inhabited area of the city.
