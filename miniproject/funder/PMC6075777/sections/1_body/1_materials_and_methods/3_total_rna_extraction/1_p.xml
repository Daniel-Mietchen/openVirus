<p>Firstly, each larvae pool was spiked with the 
 <italic>Escherichia coli bacteriophage MS2</italic> (ATCC 15597-B1) to be used as an internal positive control (IPC) using the same conditions previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006594.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. All pools were individually disrupted in 2 mL microtubes containing a 5 mm stainless-steel bead and 250 μL of TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA, #15596026) with the aid of the TissueLyser LT bead mill (Qiagen, Germany, #85600), 50Hz for 5 minutes. The reservoir containing the microtubes was frozen and kept in an ice bath during the process. Posteriorly, the homogenized pools were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was added with 750 μL of Trizol. Therefore, RNA extraction followed the manufacturer’s recommendations. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 40 μL of nuclease-free water and evaluated for quantity and quality with the BioDrop DUO UV spectrophotometer (BioDrop Ltd, United Kingdom, #80-3006-61). A total of 2.5 μL microliters of the extracted RNA was used for the RT-qPCR assays. The remaining volume was stored at -80°C for further analyses.
