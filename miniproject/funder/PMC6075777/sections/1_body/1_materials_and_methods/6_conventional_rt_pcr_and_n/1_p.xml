<p>The positive pools were submitted to a conventional RT-PCR amplification protocol using the primers ZIKA_ASIAN_FNF1 (5’–CCGCGCCATCTGGTATATGT– 3’) and ZIKA_ASIAN_FNR (5’–CTCCACTGACTGCCATTCGT– 3’) designed to target the NS5 coding region of Asian ZIKV lineages. For the CHIKV sample, we used a protocol already described for alphaviruses amplification [
