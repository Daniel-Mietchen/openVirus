<p>The virus IR per 1,000 mosquitoes tested was calculated for CHIKV and ZIKV based in the total of pools and individuals tested. The CHIKV IR was 0.45 for both MIR and MLE methods (MIR: lower Limit = 0.00; upper limit = 1.32 and MLE: lower Limit = 0.03; upper limit = 2.15). The ZIKV IR was 0.45 for MIR (MIR: lower Limit = 0.00; upper limit = 1.32) and 0.44 for MLE (MLE: lower Limit = 0.03; upper limit = 2.15).</p>
