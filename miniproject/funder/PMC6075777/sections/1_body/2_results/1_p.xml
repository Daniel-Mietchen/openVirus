 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 264 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) were analyzed for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA. By using the RNA extraction method described under Material and Methods we were able to obtain high quality RNA for most samples (260/280 median value: 1.96; IQR: 1.87–2.01) and all IPC reactions were positive (Ct median value: 30.9; IQR: 30.0–31.4).
