<p>The World Mosquito Program aims to promote research in arbovirus control by releasing

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.eliminatedengue.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.eliminatedengue.com</ext-link>). The first release occurred in Australia in 2011. Two natural populations were successfully invaded after 10 weekly releases, nearly reaching fixation five weeks after releases stopped [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> population by a w
 <italic>Mel</italic>-infected 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> one prompted a scale up to other countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Colombia.
