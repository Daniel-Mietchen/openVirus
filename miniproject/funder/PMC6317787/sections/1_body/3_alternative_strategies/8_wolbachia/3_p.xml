<p>The population replacement strategy is based on the capacity of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to invade and persist in wild mosquito populations, decreasing their vector competence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Advantages of a replacement strategy, at its full potential, is the lack of requirement for consistent and continuing releases or reliance on community engagement to achieve near universal coverage. In the case of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> evaluation of a population replacement strategy has achieved important goals, such as a fruit fly 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains can invade and sustain themselves in mosquito populations, reduce adult lifespan, affect mosquito reproduction, and interfere with pathogen replication [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. So far three

 <italic>aegypti</italic>: w
 <italic>AlbB</italic> [
