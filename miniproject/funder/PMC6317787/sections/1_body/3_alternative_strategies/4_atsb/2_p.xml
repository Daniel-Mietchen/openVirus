<p>ATSBs for both indoor and outdoor control of mosquito vectors may impact populations by direct mortality induced by feeding on an insecticide bait, and/or, dissemination through a bait of mosquito pathogens or nonchemical toxins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Because both female and male mosquitoes require sugar throughout the adult lifespan, the potential effects of this intervention on a vector population may be dramatic but will depend on feeding behavior (e.g., readiness to sugar feed indoors). Bait solutions are composed of sugar, an attractant, and an oral toxin. Toxins tested include boric acid [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], spinosad, neonicotinoids, and fipronil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], as well as several other classes of insecticide [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Some attractants are focused on locally acquired sugars, juices, and fruit as mosquitoes may be selective toward carbohydrates originating from their geographic range, although more “general” attractants have been developed more recently [
