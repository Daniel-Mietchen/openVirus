<p>Studies have demonstrated that chemicals currently recommended for vector control can elicit varied responses dependent on concentration [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For example, pyrethroids used in space spraying are applied at predominantly toxic levels to kill mosquitoes that land on treated surfaces or through contact with forced dispersal of formulated droplets. Other pyrethroids—labeled spatial repellents—such as transfluthrin and metofluthrin, are highly volatile at ambient temperature and disperse passively to repel, inhibit host-seeking, or kill mosquitoes depending on the chemical concentration gradient in the air space [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Historically, the mode of action (MoA) of spatial repellent products has been focused on “movement away from the chemical source without the mosquito making physical contact with the treated surface” (deterrency), an expanded concept that reflects the complexity in defining spatial repellents, includes chemical actions that interfere with host detection and/or disrupt blood-feeding, and was established by WHO in 2013” [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the hereditary basis by which spatial repellent traits are maintained in populations, and the relationship of response intensity with IR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006822.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. All are vital characterizations required in discovery and optimization of spatial repellent compounds and formulated products.
