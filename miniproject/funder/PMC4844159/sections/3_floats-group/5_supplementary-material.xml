  <title>Neighbor joining tree of ZIKV complete genome sequences.</title>
  <p>The tree was obtained using the best fitting nucleotide substitution model (TN93+G) selected by a hierarchical likelihood ratio test. Branches are drawn to scale in nucleotide substitutions per site according to the bar at the bottom of the tree. Significant posterior probability support (pâ‰¥ 0.9) is indicated by the number along the branch. The Haiti sequence is in bold.</p>
