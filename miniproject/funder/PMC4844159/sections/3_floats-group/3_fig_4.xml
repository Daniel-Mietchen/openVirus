  <title>Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree with Bayesian phylogeography reconstruction of ZIKV NS5 gene region.</title>
  <p>Branches are scaled in time and colored according to the legend to the left where each color represents the geographic location of the sampled sequence (tip branches), as well as of the ancestral lineage (internal branches) inferred by Bayesian phylogeography. The molecular clock was calibrated by using ZIKV strains known sampling times and enforcing a relaxed molecular clock with a Bayesian skyline plot demographic prior (see Supplementary Methods). For further clarity, the country of origin of the main strains in the MCC tree is also indicated to the right of each major clade (the MCC tree with full names of each isolate is provided in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Significant posterior probability support (pâ‰¥ 0.9) is indicated by the number along the branch. The Haitian sequences are in bold.
