<p>Officially, no cases of ZIKV infection were reported by the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) until January 6, 2016, when 5 cases were confirmed in patients in the metropolitan Port-au-Prince area, based on RT-PCR assays performed at the Caribbean Public Health Agency “CARPHA” Laboratory at Trinidad and Tobago. While it is difficult to assemble an accurate timeline for Zika in Haiti, given the close similarity in symptoms with DENV and CHIKV cases and their apparent co-circulation, we would hypothesize that there was an initial “wave” of ZIKV cases in the late fall of 2014 in the Leogane/Gressier region, possibly emanating from near-by Port-au-Prince. Case numbers may have been reduced by relatively low rainfall amounts at that time, with persistence in the population and, in the setting of heavy rains in the fall of 2015, occurrence of a larger epidemic in the fall of 2015/spring of 2016. Alternatively, there may have been a reintroduction of the virus in late 2015; analysis of additional sequence data, from Haiti as well as from other countries, will be necessary to reconstruct the geographic progression of strains.</p>
