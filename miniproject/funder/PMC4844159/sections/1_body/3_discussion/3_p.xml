<p>Our phylogenetic analysis highlights the relative indolence of the global Zika epidemic prior to its introduction into Asia and the south Pacific in 2007. In agreement with previous reports, the virus probably emerged in Africa at the beginning of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], where it diversified in several regional sub epidemics that, according to our analysis, span the entire equatorial Africa from Uganda, to Central Africa to Senegal. ZIKV Asian lineages, on the other hand, are of more recent origin, dating back 50–60 years ago, and the recent epidemic outbreaks in South America are probably the result of a limited introduction from French Polynesia via Easter Island no more than 3–4 year ago. The factors responsible for the rapid spread of the virus, and it’s apparent trophism for neural tissue and ability to cause severe birth defects [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], remain to be determined. The close association of ZIKV with the regional CHIKV epidemic, and epidemics of DENV, as we observed in Haiti, raises questions about immunologic interactions among these viruses, and/or the possibility that co-infection facilitates viral transmission or severity. Our observations highlight the critical ongoing need for careful epidemiologic and basic science research to guide public health interventions in Haiti and elsewhere where ZIKV is now epidemic.
