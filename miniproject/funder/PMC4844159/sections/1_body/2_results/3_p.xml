<p>In tissue culture, viral agents from all three patients induced subtle CPE within 4–8 days post-inoculation of human (A549, HeLa, and MRC-5) and more pronounced CPE in simian (LLC-MK2 and Vero E6) cells incubated at either 33° and 37°C. Prior to cell death, the CPE consisted of perinuclear vacuoles (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), multi-membraned “whorls” (autophagosomes), individual 55–59 nm vesicles containing 40 nm virus particles, and virus particles in packets. As mentioned (Materials and Methods), direct tests of the plasma sample using RT-PCR system Flav100F-200R yielded negative results. However, specific amplicons were obtained when vRNA from cyanase-treated spent media from LLC-MK2 or Vero cells were tested with the same primers. On sequence analysis, viral agents from all three patients were identified as ZIKV.
