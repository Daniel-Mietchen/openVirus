<p>On phylogenetic analysis, likelihood mapping showed that all data sets (full genome alignment and gene-specific alignments) displayed relatively low phylogenetic noise (&lt;20%, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s005">S2 Table</xref>) and no recombination signal was detected. The full genome alignment was, as expected, the one with the lowest phylogenetic noise (0.3%), while the NS5 alignment contained the highest number of informative sites, as well as the largest number of available sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Therefore, these two data sets were used to investigate further the phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns of ZIKV. Maximum likelihood (ML) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and Neighbor-joining (NJ) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s002">S1 Fig</xref>) trees inferred from full genome sequences consistently show two major ZIKV clades: one including African, the other one including Asian, South American and the Haitian strains. In the ML tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g003">Fig 3</xref>), the earliest lineage in the African clade leads to a Ugandan strain, in agreement with the scenario of ZIKV emergence in the Eastern African country [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, both ML and NJ trees show three highly supported monophyletic clades within the African lineage, indicating a somewhat more complex pattern than a split between West African and Nigerian strains, as recently described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Indeed, one clade includes Nigeria/Senegal sequences; a second one includes only Central Africa strains, while a third one includes two well-supported sub-clades, one with Ugandan and the other with Senegalese strains. South American/Haitian sequences cluster within the Asian clade and clearly branch out from a sequence circulating in Easter Island, which originated in turn from French Polynesia. The Haitian sequence clusters with a Brazilian sequence in a monophyletic clade related, in turn, to sequences from Suriname and the recently isolated strains from Guatemala and Puerto Rico [
