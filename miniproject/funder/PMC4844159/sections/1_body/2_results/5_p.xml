<p>The pattern is confirmed by the Bayesian phylogeographic analysis showing the Asian origin of the South American sequences (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s003">S2</xref>), as well as the close phylogenetic relationship between Haitian, Brazilian, Suriname and Puerto Rican strains, clustering within a larger clade of isolates from Easter Island. While not statistically significant, this latter analysis, based on the NS5 region, does show slight separation of Haitian strains and the strains from Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The molecular clock calibration indeed shows that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Haitian clade existed at least one year earlier (mid-2013, 95% high posterior density interval December 2012, June 2013) than the other South American lineages with the exception of the Easter Island (Chile) strains, which appear to be the oldest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The MRCA of the Asian lineage dates back to 1956 (95% high posterior density interval 1954–1958), while ZIKV MRCA in Africa circulated, consistently with previous estimates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], since at least the early 1900s (95% high posterior density interval 1890–1925).
