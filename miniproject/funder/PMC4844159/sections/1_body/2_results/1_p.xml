<p>Zika virus was identified in plasma from three students seen in the Christianville Foundation Schools clinic. Patient #1 (described below) appears to have been infected simultaneously with DENV-1. The three case patients were from two different schools within the four-school Christianville school system; all lived in different towns/neighborhoods, within a radius of approximately 20 miles. All case patients presented within a one-week period in December, 2014. Cases of DENV-1 had been identified among children in the school clinics in the weeks before occurrence of the ZIKV cases, which, in turn, were followed by a small cluster of DENV-4 cases.</p>
