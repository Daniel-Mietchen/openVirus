<p>As virus-specific CPE were observed in LLC-MK2 and Vero E6 cells inoculated with plasma, but the identity of the agent unknown, spent cell growth media was treated with cyanase nuclease to degrade nucleic acids external to that packaged (and thus protected) in virions using a Nucleic Acid Removal Kit (RiboSolutions, Inc., Cedar Creek, Texas), and vRNA once again extracted from the treated material using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. A panel of PCR and RT-PCR tests were performed; for RT-PCR, first-strand synthesis was performed using random 9-mers and Accuscript High Fidelity 1st strand cDNA kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The presence of flavivirus RNA was detected using the Flav100F-200R, and
