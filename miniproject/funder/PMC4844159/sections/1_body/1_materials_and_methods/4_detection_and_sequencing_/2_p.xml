<p>Sequencing of the complete 
 <italic>Zika virus</italic> genome of one isolate (from the first patient), designated Haiti/1225/2014, was accomplished using a genome walking strategy with the PCR primers described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s004">S1 Table</xref>. Briefly, targeted overlapping sequences (approximately 800 bp amplicons) were amplified using Accuscript High Fidelity reverse transcriptase in the presence of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX), followed by PCR with Phusion Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with denaturation steps performed at 98°C. To obtain the 5′ and 3′ ends of the viral genome, a 5′ and 3′ system for the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) was used per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR amplicons were purified, sequenced bidirectionally using Sanger Sequencing, and the sequences assembled with the aid of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The GenBank accession number is KU509998.
