<p>Blood samples were obtained from a total of one hundred seventy-seven (n = 177) Haitian children presenting with a history of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses between May, 2014, and February, 2015. Blood smears were prepared for microscopic analyses for malaria parasites. To obtain plasma for virologic analysis, whole blood (5 mL) was collected into purple top (K
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA) tubes (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), the collected blood centrifuged to pellet red and white blood cells, and the resulting plasma transferred to sterile screw-top vials and stored at -70Â°C pending tests.
