<p>For the initial CHIKV and DENV screens, vRNA was extracted from virions in the plasma using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The extracted vRNAs were tested using primers described by Lanciotti

 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for CHIKV and Santiago 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] for DENV types 1–4. Many specimens were positive for CHIKV and DENV1 or DENV4 vRNA (data to be presented elsewhere). Those negative for CHIKV and DENV 1–4 vRNA were also tested with a universal primer system for flavivirus: RT-PCR system Flav100F-200R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. No virus-specific amplicons were generated by the latter approach. Samples negative or borderline in the above assays were screened in a variety of mammalian cell lines inoculated with aliquots of plasma; detailed methods are provided in supplemental material, as are methods for transmission microscopy.
