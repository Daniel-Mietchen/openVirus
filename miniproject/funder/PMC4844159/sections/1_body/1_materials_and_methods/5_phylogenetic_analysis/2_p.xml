<p>Detailed phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods are included in the supplemental material. In brief, the phylogenetic signal in each data set of aligned nucleotide sequences was investigated by likelihood mapping, which evaluates the tree-like signal in all possible groups of four sequences (quartets) [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s004">S1 Table</xref>), was used to investigate ZIKV phylogeographic patterns with the Bayesian coalescent framework implemented in Beast v 1.8 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The maximum likelihood credibility (MCC) tree was chosen from the posterior distribution of trees with the TreeAnnotator program in the BEAST package. Statistical support for branching patterns in the MCC tree was obtained by calculating the posterior probability along each internal branch. The MCC tree with reconstructed ancestral states (ancestral locations inferred by Bayesian phylogeography) was manually edited in FigTree for display purposes.
