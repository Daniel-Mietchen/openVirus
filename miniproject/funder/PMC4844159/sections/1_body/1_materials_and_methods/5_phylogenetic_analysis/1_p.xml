<p>All available ZIKV nucleotide sequences were downloaded from NCBI (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) and four data sets were assembled (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s004">S1 Table</xref>) using the following inclusion criteria: (1) sequences were published in peer-review journals; (2) known sampling time; (3) city/state was known and clearly established in the original publication. The first data set included all ZIKV complete genome sequences available in NCBI (23 sequences) and the Haiti complete genome sequence obtained in the present study. The second data set included 109 NS5 gene region reference sequences as well as NS5 sequences of the three Haitian isolates obtained in the present study. The third data set included 58 ENV gene region reference sequences as well as ENV sequences of the three Haitian isolates obtained in the present study. The fourth data set included 21 NS3 gene region reference sequences as well as the NS3 sequence of the Haitian isolate fully sequenced in the present study. Sequences in each dataset were aligned using ClustalW [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] followed by manual optimization using Bioedit [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The best fitting nucleotide substitution model for each data set was chosen in accordance with the results of the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (HLRT) implemented with the Modeltest software version 3.7 [
