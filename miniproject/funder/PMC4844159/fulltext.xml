In Brazil, infection has been linked with microcephaly and other serious complications, leading to declaration of a public health emergency of international concern; however, there currently are only limited data on the virus (and its possible sources and manifestations) in the Caribbean.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>From May, 2014-February, 2015, in conjunction with studies of chikungunya (CHIKV) and dengue (DENV) virus infections, blood samples were collected from children in the Gressier/Leogane region of Haiti who presented to a school clinic with undifferentiated febrile illness. Samples were initially screened by RT-PCR for CHIKV and DENV, with samples negative in these assays further screened by viral culture.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>Of 177 samples screened, three were positive for ZIKV, confirmed by viral sequencing; DENV-1 was also identified in culture from one of the three positive case patients. Patients were from two different schools and 3 different towns, with all three cases occurring within a single week, consistent with the occurrence of an outbreak in the region. Phylogenetic analysis of known full genome viral sequences demonstrated a close relationship with ZIKV from Brazil; additional analysis of the NS5 gene, for which more sequences are currently available, showed the Haitian strains clustering within a monophyletic clade distinct from Brazilian, Puerto Rican and Guatemalan sequences, with all part of a larger clade including isolates from Easter Island. Phylogeography also clarified that at least three major African sub-lineages exist, and confirmed that the South American epidemic is most likely to have originated from an initial ZIKV introduction from French Polynesia into Easter Island, and then to the remainder of the Americas.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ZIKV epidemics in South America, as well as in Africa, show complex dissemination patterns. The virus appears to have been circulating in Haiti prior to the first reported cases in Brazil. Factors contributing to transmission and the possible linkage of this early Haitian outbreak with microcephaly remain to be determined.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Zika virus is currently spreading rapidly through the Americas, including the Caribbean, where it has emerged as a major public health problem due to the linkage with birth defects, including microcephaly. We report the isolation of Zika virus from 3 children in rural Haiti in December, 2014, as part of a study of acute undifferentiated febrile illness that was being conducted by our research group; from one of these children, we also isolated dengue virus serotype 1. On analysis of nucleotide sequence data from these and Zika strains from other locales, the South American/Haitian sequences cluster within the Asian clade and clearly branch out from a sequence circulating in Easter Island, which originated, in turn, from French Polynesia. On further analysis of one specific gene sequence for which more data were available, there appeared to be slight separation of Haitian strains and the strains from Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala, with molecular clock analysis suggesting that Zika virus was present in Haiti as early as mid-2013. These findings raise questions about the origin of Zika virus in the Caribbean, and subsequent patterns of circulation of the virus within the Americas.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no funding outside of the University of Florida for the work described.

There were periodic human cases reported from Africa and Asia in the intervening decades, but it was not until 2007 that a major epidemic was reported, on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Zika infections were subsequently identified in other parts of Asia, with a shift toward the Americas presaged by an outbreak on Easter Island in May, 2014 [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In March, 2015, cases were identified in Bahia, Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], with subsequent rapid spread through multiple Brazilian states [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and other countries in South America and the Caribbean [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: as of January, 2016, locally-transmitted cases had been reported by the Pan American Health Organization in Puerto Rico and 19 countries/territories in the Americas.</p><p>Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) has traditionally been associated with asymptomatic or mild illness.

In an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013&#x02013;14, there were, for the first time, reports of neurological and auto-immune complications, such as Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, in the setting of co-circulating dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With the progression of the Brazilian outbreak in 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health noted a striking concurrent increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly in areas with ZIKV transmission. Multiple subsequent studies have provided further documentation of the link between ZIKV and microcephaly and other birth defects, as well as with Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Work was done in collaboration with the Christianville Foundation, which operates 4 schools in the Gressier/Leogane region of Haiti (some 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince) with a total of approximately 1,250 students from pre-kindergarten to grade 12; students attending the school receive care at no cost in an outpatient school clinic staffed by a physician and two nurses [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As part of these studies, UF has protocols for collection of diagnostic blood samples from children presenting to the school clinic with acute undifferentiated febrile illness (i.e., febrile illness with no localizing signs, such as would be expected with pneumonia, urinary tract infections, etc.).</p><p>Blood samples were obtained from a total of one hundred seventy-seven (n = 177) Haitian children presenting with a history of acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses between May, 2014, and February, 2015. Blood smears were prepared for microscopic analyses for malaria parasites. To obtain plasma for virologic analysis, whole blood (5 mL) was collected into purple top (K<sub>2</sub>EDTA) tubes (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), the collected blood centrifuged to pellet red and white blood cells, and the resulting plasma transferred to sterile screw-top vials and stored at -70&#x000b0;C pending tests.</p><p>For the initial CHIKV and DENV screens, vRNA was extracted from virions in the plasma using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA).

Briefly, targeted overlapping sequences (approximately 800 bp amplicons) were amplified using Accuscript High Fidelity reverse transcriptase in the presence of SUPERase-In RNase inhibitor (Ambion, Austin, TX), followed by PCR with Phusion Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with denaturation steps performed at 98&#x000b0;C. To obtain the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of the viral genome, a 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; system for the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) was used per the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR amplicons were purified, sequenced bidirectionally using Sanger Sequencing, and the sequences assembled with the aid of Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software v2.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

Patient #1 (described below) appears to have been infected simultaneously with DENV-1. The three case patients were from two different schools within the four-school Christianville school system; all lived in different towns/neighborhoods, within a radius of approximately 20 miles. All case patients presented within a one-week period in December, 2014. Cases of DENV-1 had been identified among children in the school clinics in the weeks before occurrence of the ZIKV cases, which, in turn, were followed by a small cluster of DENV-4 cases.</p><p>The first patient was a 15 year-old boy who presented to the clinic on December 12, 2014, with a history of subjective fever, headache, and generalized arthralgias, myalgias and asthenia. When seen, temperature was 37 degrees C, with a pulse of 92 and respiratory rate of 24, weight 51.5 Kg. He had no rash, and physical exam was unremarkable. The second patient was a 7 year-old girl who was seen on December 15, 2014 at the clinic for subjective nocturnal fever, abdominal pain, anorexia, and cough. Temperature was 37 degrees C, pulse 116, RR 28, and weight 22.8 Kg. There was no rash, and physical exam was again unremarkable. The third patient was an asymptomatic 4 year-old boy who came in December 17, 2014 for follow up after being treated for tonsillitis on November 25, when he had presented with a fever of 39 degrees C. In none of the cases would it have been possible to have identified the illness as a ZIKV infection based on clinical presentation, rather than DENV or CHIKV (and, as indicated, one child was simultaneously infected with DENV). All patients received supportive care for reported symptoms, in keeping with standard practices within the clinic.</p><p>In tissue culture, viral agents from all three patients induced subtle CPE within 4&#x02013;8 days post-inoculation of human (A549, HeLa, and MRC-5) and more pronounced CPE in simian (LLC-MK2 and Vero E6) cells incubated at either 33&#x000b0; and 37&#x000b0;C. Prior to cell death, the CPE consisted of perinuclear vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed features typical of flavivirus-infected cells, such as the formation of paracrystalline arrays/convoluted membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), crystalline arrays of nascent virus cores in association with double-membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), multi-membraned &#x0201c;whorls&#x0201d; (autophagosomes), individual 55&#x02013;59 nm vesicles containing 40 nm virus particles, and virus particles in packets. As mentioned (Materials and Methods), direct tests of the plasma sample using RT-PCR system Flav100F-200R yielded negative results. However, specific amplicons were obtained when vRNA from cyanase-treated spent media from LLC-MK2 or Vero cells were tested with the same primers.

The full genome alignment was, as expected, the one with the lowest phylogenetic noise (0.3%), while the NS5 alignment contained the highest number of informative sites, as well as the largest number of available sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004687.s005">S2 Table</xref>). Therefore, these two data sets were used to investigate further the phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns of ZIKV.

In the ML tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g003">Fig 3</xref>), the earliest lineage in the African clade leads to a Ugandan strain, in agreement with the scenario of ZIKV emergence in the Eastern African country [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, both ML and NJ trees show three highly supported monophyletic clades within the African lineage, indicating a somewhat more complex pattern than a split between West African and Nigerian strains, as recently described [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Indeed, one clade includes Nigeria/Senegal sequences; a second one includes only Central Africa strains, while a third one includes two well-supported sub-clades, one with Ugandan and the other with Senegalese strains. South American/Haitian sequences cluster within the Asian clade and clearly branch out from a sequence circulating in Easter Island, which originated in turn from French Polynesia. The Haitian sequence clusters with a Brazilian sequence in a monophyletic clade related, in turn, to sequences from Suriname and the recently isolated strains from Guatemala and Puerto Rico [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pntd.0004687.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004687.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Maximum-Likelihood tree of ZIKV complete genome sequences.</title><p>The tree was obtained using the best fitting nucleotide substitution model (TN93+G) selected by a hierarchical likelihood ratio test.

While not statistically significant, this latter analysis, based on the NS5 region, does show slight separation of Haitian strains and the strains from Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala. The molecular clock calibration indeed shows that the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Haitian clade existed at least one year earlier (mid-2013, 95% high posterior density interval December 2012, June 2013) than the other South American lineages with the exception of the Easter Island (Chile) strains, which appear to be the oldest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004687.g004">Fig 4</xref>).

Virus was isolated from three students, coming from two different schools and different towns, suggesting that the infection was relatively widespread in the community. In keeping with prior descriptions of ZIKV infection [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], illness was mild. Two patients reported subjective fevers prior to presentation at the clinic, but were afebrile on exam (possibly due to use of local herbal antipyretics); the third patient had had a temperature of 39 degrees three weeks before (diagnosed as tonsillitis), but was asymptomatic at the time of blood collection. However, the outbreak was tightly bounded in time, with all cases occurring within a single week; we maintained similar surveillance methods across a 10 month period, and this one week was the only time that ZIKV was isolated. In keeping with reports from French Polynesia, cases occurred at a time when there was co-circulation of CHIKV and DENV, with cases immediately preceded by a cluster of DENV-1 cases (with both DENV-1 and ZIKV isolated from the first patient identified), and followed by DENV-4.</p><p>Officially, no cases of ZIKV infection were reported by the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) until January 6, 2016, when 5 cases were confirmed in patients in the metropolitan Port-au-Prince area, based on RT-PCR assays performed at the Caribbean Public Health Agency &#x0201c;CARPHA&#x0201d; Laboratory at Trinidad and Tobago. While it is difficult to assemble an accurate timeline for Zika in Haiti, given the close similarity in symptoms with DENV and CHIKV cases and their apparent co-circulation, we would hypothesize that there was an initial &#x0201c;wave&#x0201d; of ZIKV cases in the late fall of 2014 in the Leogane/Gressier region, possibly emanating from near-by Port-au-Prince. Case numbers may have been reduced by relatively low rainfall amounts at that time, with persistence in the population and, in the setting of heavy rains in the fall of 2015, occurrence of a larger epidemic in the fall of 2015/spring of 2016. Alternatively, there may have been a reintroduction of the virus in late 2015; analysis of additional sequence data, from Haiti as well as from other countries, will be necessary to reconstruct the geographic progression of strains.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis highlights the relative indolence of the global Zika epidemic prior to its introduction into Asia and the south Pacific in 2007. In agreement with previous reports, the virus probably emerged in Africa at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], where it diversified in several regional sub epidemics that, according to our analysis, span the entire equatorial Africa from Uganda, to Central Africa to Senegal. ZIKV Asian lineages, on the other hand, are of more recent origin, dating back 50&#x02013;60 years ago, and the recent epidemic outbreaks in South America are probably the result of a limited introduction from French Polynesia via Easter Island no more than 3&#x02013;4 year ago. The factors responsible for the rapid spread of the virus, and it&#x02019;s apparent trophism for neural tissue and ability to cause severe birth defects [<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004687.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], remain to be determined. The close association of ZIKV with the regional CHIKV epidemic, and epidemics of DENV, as we observed in Haiti, raises questions about immunologic interactions among these viruses, and/or the possibility that co-infection facilitates viral transmission or severity. Our observations highlight the critical ongoing need for careful epidemiologic and basic science research to guide public health interventions in Haiti and elsewhere where ZIKV is now epidemic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004687.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Supplemental Material.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004687.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004687.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Neighbor joining tree of ZIKV complete genome sequences.</title><p>The tree was obtained using the best fitting nucleotide substitution model (TN93+G) selected by a hierarchical likelihood ratio test.
