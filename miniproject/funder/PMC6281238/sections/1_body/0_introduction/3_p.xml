<p>A large body of work has focused on improving this understanding, and in doing so has mainly highlighted the network structure and topology as the primary driver of propagation dynamics. Similarly, embracing the path dependance that is inherent to many social phenomena, a large body of work has focused on the effects of local structures, in particularly surrounding the seed of the propagation process (the location where in the propagation process originates from). Many network intervention strategies are now aimed at finding the best positioned individuals to increase the momentum and reach of spreading phenomena [

While this body of work has made a strong case for network structure as a critical factor determining propagation dynamics, in identifying such effects it has largely ignored the impact that different mechanisms of propagation—the way in which propagation process takes place—can have, as propagation processes are generally treated as a class of uniform processes. While recognizing the importance of the network structure for understanding propagation dynamics, we argue that it is not network structure alone that drives propagation dynamics, and that fully understanding these dynamics requires one to consider the propagation mechanism.
