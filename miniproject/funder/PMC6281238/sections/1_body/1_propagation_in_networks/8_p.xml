 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] has started to make a case for stepping away from a monolithic view of the propagation mechanism to better understand propagation dynamics. Centola &amp; Macy [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in their study on complex contagion, a spreading mechanism which assumes an agent requires stimuli from multiple sources to change state, has shown that both the speed and pervasiveness of propagation are strongly influenced by such a variation in propagation mechanism. Similarly, [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] highlight that agents can send out very different strengths of signals and/or can be susceptible to different magnitudes of signals [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and that such heterogeneity in the mechanism has a strong influence on the dynamics of propagation. By incorporating variations in the propagation mechanism, these studies highlight the marked effect the mechanism can have on the dynamics of the propagation process.
