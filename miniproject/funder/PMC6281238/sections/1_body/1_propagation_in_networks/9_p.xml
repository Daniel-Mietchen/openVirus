<p>Although these examples have adopted more complex models to be able to capture nuances in the propagation mechanism, there is still limited effort in making sure these more complex models can be related to each other. Therefore, propagation literature runs the risk of entering an era in which highly specific mechanisms are being used with limited contributions to generalizable knowledge. The RTR-framework addresses this tension and allows us to build a model which can be used to unify the various propagation models (including more complex ones), and make explicit how mechanisms differ (or align). This model thus facilitates the propagation field to move to a place in which the impact of the propagation mechanism can be structurally studied and better understood.</p>
