<p>Second, we step away from the purely dyadic notion of propagation, and consider it to be an (agent-based) network process. Each of the sub-processes can be observed to adopt a different logic: Radiation is sender-based, and a process from one actor to its outgoing ties, making it potentially a one-to-many process. Transmission is medium-based, and occurs within a single tie and hence is a dyadic process. Reception is receiver-based, and is a process potentially from many incoming ties to one single actor, making it effectively a many-to-one process. These differences highlight that while all sub-processes are part the composite propagation process, each of them is conceptually different from one another. Furthermore, it shows that while each dyad with propagation will require all three sub-processes to occur, the propagation process itself is fundamentally a network process.</p>
