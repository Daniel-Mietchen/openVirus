<p>From a practical point of view, the observed potential impact of mis-specification is undesirable. In practical settings such variance in the effectiveness is even more worrisome as designing and implementing network intervention is too costly an endeavor to follow a shotgun approach. The RTR model allows for a more targeted approach where the intervention can be fine-tuned to the details of how the underlying propagation mechanism works in that particular context. What is more, the RTR model helps researchers make these mechanisms explicit, which will enable improved targeting of intervention, and facilitates communication of results across the wide variety of scientific disciplines that deal with propagation. This in turn will translate into a more generalizable understanding of propagation dynamics and interventions, which can consequently be used by practitioners in different fields that aim to design and implement effective interventions.</p>
