<p>Even within a specific context, competing conceptual interpretations of the same phenomenon exist. For instance, the propagation of information on social media has been modeled using an emphasis on radiation [

 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], an emphasis on transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and an emphasis on reception [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, the propagation of epidemics has been modeled using an emphasis on radiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], an emphasis on reception [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and an emphasis on transmission and reception [
 <xref rid="pone.0207865.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Only by adopting a framework that encompasses all these models we can start translating their outcomes and move the field of propagation forward.
