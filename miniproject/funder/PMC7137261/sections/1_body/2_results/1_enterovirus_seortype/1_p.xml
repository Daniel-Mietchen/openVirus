<p id="Par31">In 2018, 1220 children with laboratory-confirmed HFMD were enrolled in this study, and the three dominant serotypes were CVA-6 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 364, 29.8%), CVA-10 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 305, 25.0%), and CVA-16 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 397, 32.5%), accounting for 87.3% of all EV-positive cases. For the remaining serotypes, the predominant serotypes were CVA-4 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 39, 3.2%), EV-A71 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26, 2.1%), E-11 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18, 1.5%), CVB-5 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12, 1.0%), and CVA-9 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11, 0.9%); some sporadic cases were closely related to CVA-5, CVA-2, PV-3, E-16, E-18, CVA-12, E-30, CVA-14, CVB-4, E-3, PV-1, CVA-21, and E-7. The detailed serotypes of EV are shown in Fig.
