<p id="Par37">The CVA-6  2018 Guangzhou sequences shared 94.4–99.9% and 98.4–100% of nucleotide and amino acid identity level respectively as well as 82.4–84.3% and 95.4–96.4% nucleotide and amino acid identity respect to the CVA-6 prototype (CVA-6/Gdula, GenBank accession no. AY421764) respectively. The phylogenetic tree indicated that all 24 CVA-6 belonged to sub-genogroup E2, and are closely related to strains found in Hong Kong, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi during 2015–2018 (Fig.
