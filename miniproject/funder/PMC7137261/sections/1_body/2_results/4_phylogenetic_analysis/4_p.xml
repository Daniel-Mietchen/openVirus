<p id="Par39">The CVA-16 2018 Guangzhou sequences shared 87.3 to 99.9% and 98.0 to 100% of nucleotide and amino acid identity level respectively as well as 74.8 to 76.2% and 91.3 to 92.3% nucleotide and amino acid identity respect to the CVA-16 prototype (CVA-16/G10, GenBank accession no. U05876) respectively. The CVA-16 phylogenetic dendrogram revealed that all Guangzhou CVA-16 were grouped into genogroup B. Twenty-three sequences belonged to sub-genogroup B1a and B1b, which share a close genetic evolutionary relationship with subtypes that circulated in Yunnan, Thailand, Shenzhen, Shandong, and Shanghai from 2014 to 2017. The remaining one CVA-16 sequence belonged to sub-genogroup B1c and clustered with isolates from India identified in 2017 (GenBank accession no. KY792581). It was also the first case to be reported in China (Fig.Â
