<p id="Par38">The CVA-10 2018 Guangzhou sequences shared 92.2–99.9% and 97.3–100% of nucleotide and amino acid identity level respectively as well as 75.6–77.1% and 92.0–93.6% nucleotide and amino acid identity respect to the CVA-10 prototype (CVA-10/Kowalik, GenBank accession no. AF081300) respectively. All CVA-10 in our study belonged to the genogroup E. CVA-10 Guangzhou showed high homology with strains previously isolated from the Yunnan, Guangdong, Henan, and Sichuan provinces (Fig.
