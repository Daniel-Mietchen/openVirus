<p id="Par36">In order to better understand the molecular epidemiology of HFMD in Guangzhou, the predominant serotypes, CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16, were selected to phylogenetic analysis. To analyse the CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 genotypes in the specimens, we amplified the VP1 gene of the viruses. In total, 72 complete VP1 genes from CVA-6 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), CVA-10 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), and CVA-16 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24) were amplified and sequenced. Then, the complete VP1 nucleotide sequences of CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 were determined (915 bp, 894 bp, and 891 bp, respectively), and reference sequences from elsewhere in China (
 <italic>n</italic> = 150, 111, and 130, respectively) and other countries (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8, 8, and 33, respectively) elected from the GenBank were used for phylogenetic analyses.
