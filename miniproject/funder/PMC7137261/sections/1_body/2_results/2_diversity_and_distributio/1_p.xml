<p id="Par32">There was a significant seasonal change in the occurrences of HFMD. The majority of the patients presented from May to December in 2018. A peak in the number of cases was observed in May and June, which coincided with the co-circulation of CVA-10 and CVA-16. At the same time, there was a slight increase in the number of cases in September and October, and CVA-10 and CVA-16 were replaced by CVA-6 as the dominant EV. Thus, our data revealed a sudden increase in CVA-10- and CVA-16-positive cases in May, followed by a gradual decrease in the subsequent months. Nevertheless, the monthly prevalent pattern of CVA-6, which appeared from May and peaked in October, was considerably different from that of CVA-10 and CVA-16 (Fig.Â
