 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The data suggested that the clinical features of HFMD infected by different EV serotypes were similar. The HFMD patients commonly showed skin lesion in hands, feet, extremities and fever spike over 39 °C. The laboratory results indicated that the rising of hsCRP and WBC were commonly observed in HFMD patients. The ratio of hsCRP rising in the CVA-6 group was significantly higher than those in the other groups (
