 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, there was a total of 80 (6.6%) severe cases and 1140 (93.4%) mild HFMD cases were diagnosed in our study. In severe HFMD cases, the CVA-6 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) and CVA-10 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18) were more frequently detected in this study, and the ratios of severe cases were 5.8 and 5.9%. The group of CVA-16 had a low ratio in severe cases compared with other four groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the ratio of severe cases caused by EV-A71 was 34.6%, which was significantly higher than the other four groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In the others group, 26 (20.3%) cases were identified as severe HFMD, and E-11(38.9%, 7/18), CVA-4(15.4%, 6/39), and CVB-4(33.3%, 4/12) were the three main serotypes.
