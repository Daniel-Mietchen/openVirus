 <italic>n</italic> = 85), vesicular fluid (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21), and cerebrospinal fluid (

Firstly, samples were identified by the commercial pan-enterovirus q-PCR kit (DAAN Gene Co., Ltd., China) and further serotype classification was performed using commercial EV-A71, CVA-16, CVA-10, and CVA-6 q-PCR test kits with the 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Secondly, the EV-positive samples that were not classified successfully in the previous process were amplified on the basis of the partial VP1 sequences as described earlier for further serotype identification [
