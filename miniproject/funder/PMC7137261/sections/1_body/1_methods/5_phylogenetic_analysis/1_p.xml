<p id="Par29">The entire VP1 genes of CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 were amplified using specific primers: CVA-6 VP1-F: 5′- AACTTYGTRGTGCCACCAGA-3′(nucleotides 2317–2336) and CVA-6: VP1-R 5′-GTGGCGAGATGTCGGTTTA-3′ (nucleotides 3408–3426) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The PCR products were bidirectionally sequenced by Sangon Biotech, and the sequences were submitted to Genbank under accession numbers MT119379-MT119450 and shown in Additional file. The complete sequences of the VP1 genes and those obtained from the GenBank database were aligned using the ClustalX program [
