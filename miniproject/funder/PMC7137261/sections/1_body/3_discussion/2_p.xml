<p id="Par41">In this study, our results showed that the co-circulation of three main EV serotypes (CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16) caused the HFMD outbreak in Guangzhou, which was clearly different with the epidemic characteristics described before. In previous study, EV-A71 and CVA-16 had been reported to the predominant pathogens of HFMD in Guangzhou between 2008 and 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the number of CVA-6 has been increased dramatically since 2010, and CVA-6 has become the major pathogen in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In 2018, CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 had been co-circulating in the HFMD outbreak in Guangzhou. Based on the limited co-circulating information, we suspected it was associated with genetic variation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and further studies were needed to verified it. According to previous studies, EV-A71 was frequently detected in China and considered to be closely associated with fatal case due to HFMD outbreak worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our results indicated that 26 EV-A71-positive HFMD cases were identified, and the ratio of HFMD severe was significantly higher in the group of EV-A71. The relatively lower viral diversity of EV-A71 and successful application of EV-A71 vaccine may be responsible for the reduced incidence of EV-A71 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Moreover, we still need to keep our eyes on the HFMD caused by EV-A71 even the number of it was low. Up to date, only CVA-16 and EV-A71 were identified as the main pathogens in the Chinese nationwide surveillance of HFMD. The molecular epidemiological data of this study demonstrated that multi-serotypes circulated concomitantly, which might become a HFMD epidemic trend in the future. Notably, several polioviruses (PV) were detected in this study. PV type 1–3, belonging to EV-C, is notable as the pathogen of poliomyelitis (polio) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We observed that all the patients associated with PV presented typical clinical manifestation of HFMD, such as skin rashes on hands and feet, and the age with serotypes of the affected associated with the PV inoculation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. However, the vaccination records of eight patients were unclear and further studies are needed. In addition, our data indicated that apart from CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16, a total of 18 enterovirus serotypes were associated with HFMD cases, which had been described in previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. However, most of these serotypes have been rarely detected in clinical laboratories. Therefore, the development of a detection kit which is capable of detecting more enterovirus serotypes is crucial for clinical diagnosis of HFMD. Further, it is vital for researchers and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to pay attention to other EVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This is especially important as only the commercial EV-A71 vaccine, which lacks cross immunity protection for patients infected with other EVs, has been successfully applied to children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Our result implicated that the development of multi-serotype vaccines will be helpful for decreasing the morbidity associated with HFMD.
