<p id="Par40">Currently, EV-A71 and CVA-16 are still the main known causative agents of HFMD. However, CVA-6 and CVA-10 were frequently detected in HFMD outbreaks in recent years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which implied that the epidemiological features of HFMD are changing. In our study, we reported for the first time a new HFMD epidemic pattern in Guangzhou in 2018 characterised by co-circulation of CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16. Additionally, seasonally circulating diversity in serotypes was observed in this study, which provided a scientific basis for prevention and control of HFMD in the future.
