Compared to the group of CVA-10 and CVA-16, patients infected with CVA-6 were likely to have the rising hsCRP. Moreover, the group of CVA-10 had an obvious increase in WBC, which was caused by the rising of neutrophils. However, further studies regarding this are required as the existing information is limited.
