<p id="Par44">Based on the entire VP1 sequence, low intra-typic divergence was observed among CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 detected from Guangzhou. The first reported Chinese CVA-6 strain was grouped to genogroup B. Subsequently, the sub-genogroup E2, which replaced genogroups B, C, D, and E1, has gradually become the predominant strain circulating worldwide since 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The CVA-6 Guangzhou were further segregated into two groups within sub-genotype E2. One cluster was close to the subtypes detected in Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, while the other was closely related to strains from Hong Kong and Fujian. Both CVA-6 clusters were similar to the strains in adjacent provinces of Guangzhou, which indicated that the subtypes of CVA-6 identified in Guangzhou had a common ancestor in nearby regions and are prevalent in the south of China. Of the CVA-10, Guangzhou sequences were identified to genogroup E, which was prevalent not only in Guangzhou, but also in Xiamen, Yunnan, and Jiangxi. The evolutionary characteristics of sub-genotype E are still not known and further studies are required to elucidate the increase in CVA-10 prevalence in Guangzhou during 2018. The CVA-16 phylogenetic dendrogram showed that genogroup B, consisting of the majority of CVA-16, was classified into B1a, B1b, and B1c. Furthermore, sub-genogroups B1a and B1b associated with outbreaks of HFMD in Nanjing, Fujian, and Yantai, were recognised as the predominant subtypes circulating around the mainland [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which was consistent with the results of the present study in Guangzhou. The CVA-16 phylogenetic dendrogram indicated that sub-genogroup B1b, including 19 Guangzhou CVA-16, was dominant in our study, similar to the results of previous reports on other regions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The Guangzhou CVA-16 located in the B1b group showed high similarity to the strain isolated in Shenzhen, a city adjacent to the Guangdong province. Additionally, four CVA-16 sequences belonging to the B1a sub-genogroup were closely related to strains circulating in Shenzhen and Yunnan. Therefore, we hypothesised that compared to B1a, the sub-genogroup B1b shares a common ancestor with strains circulating in Shenzhen, which might become endemic strains of CVA-16 in the future. Intriguingly, one sequence was located in the sub-genogroup B1c, which has been reported only in Malaysia, France, and India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Hence, we believed that one located in B1c was obtained from other countries via import transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Comprehensive and long-term surveillance of HFMD is critical for understanding the trend of the epidemic and emergence of new genotypes, and for controlling EV infection in the future.
