<p id="Par42">A seasonal pattern of HFMD was observed in this study. There were two peaks when the majority of cases were admitted to the hospital, and one major peak in May and a small peak in October. This phenomenon was consistent with some earlier studies reported in Guangzhou and other southern regions, including Thailand and Taiwan [

High temperature and high humidity had increased the incidence of HFMD, and it had also been found that atmospheric pressure and wind speed were associated with HFMD occurrence [

Significantly, CVA-6 was the predominant pathogen of the small HFMD peak in autumn, and CVA-10 and CVA-16 were prevalent in the beginning of summer (the peak in May), which was similar to that observed in Shanghai and southern Vietnam to a certain extent [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The discrepancy in the monthly distribution of CVA-6 and CVA-10 in different regions may be attributed to the adaptive changes in the pathogens. Hence, it is crucial to develop reasonable preventive measures to combat the HFMD outbreak caused by various serotypes in different seasons.
