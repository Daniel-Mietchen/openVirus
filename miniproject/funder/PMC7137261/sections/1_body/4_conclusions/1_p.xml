<p id="Par46">We found that a total of 21 EV serotypes were identified in 1220 HFMD patients, and CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16 were the most commonly detected during 2018. Co-circulation of three serotypes, CVA-6, CVA-10, and CVA-16, was the dominant reason for the outbreak of HFMD in Guangzhou in 2018. In this study, we presented a comprehensive and detailed investigation regarding the outbreak of HFMD in Guangzhou based on clinical manifestations and phylogenetic analysis, which we believe will be beneficial for understanding and controlling the disease in the near future.</p>
