<p id="Par21">Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a common contagious disorder in children under 5 years of age, is characterised by a brief, generally mild, febrile illness with multiple oral ulcers, and eruption of vesiculo-papular rashes over the hands, feet, mouth, and buttocks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Some cases can develop severe neurological and systemic complications, such as aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, encephalitis, cardiorespiratory failure, and severe pulmonary oedema, and can even lead to death [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. HFMD is mainly caused by human enteroviruses (EVs) of the family

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Their genome comprises one open reading frame, which encodes four structural viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A-2C and 3A-3D) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. VP1, the main region encoding neutralising epitopes, contains virulence determinants and also provides conclusive evidence regarding the phylogeny and genotype of these viruses [
