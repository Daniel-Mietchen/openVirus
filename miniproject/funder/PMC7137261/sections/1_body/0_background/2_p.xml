<p id="Par22">Since the first HFMD case was described in 1959 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], outbreaks or sporadic cases have frequently occurred globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In the recent decades, more and more outbreaks of HFMD had reported from Asia-Pacific region, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, India, and China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In China, HFMD was recognised as a C-class notifiable disease after an outbreak occurred in Fuyang in early 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. According to the Chinese national enhanced surveillance system, HFMD rates ranked first among all notifiable diseases and over 1.2/1000 in children are affected annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA-16), belonging to EV-A, have been identified as the predominant causative pathogens in the nationwide surveillance. However, other serotypes had gradually played an important role in the HFMD outbreaks. Since a Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA-6) associated HFMD outbroke in Finland in 2008, several outbreaks caused by CVA-6 were reported in Europe, North America, and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, Coxsackievirus A10 (CVA-10) had also been identified as the responsible pathogen for a series of HFMD outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Guangzhou city is one of the most serious cities in HFMD with high incidence, and the HFMD pathogen spectrum are changing according to previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, the change of HFMD pathogen spectrum has become a big challenge for prevention and control of HFMD.
