 <caption>
  <p>Neighbour-joining tree of the complete VP1 gene (894 nucleotides) of the CVA-10. The CVA-10 sequences (CVA-10/01/GZ/CHN/2018- CVA-10/24/GZ/CHN/2018) obtained from patients with HFMD in this study are marked by a diamond, and 119 reference sequences from elsewhere elected from the GenBank are used for phylogenetic analyses. The reference sequences are presented as GenBank accession number/province/country/year of isolation. The genogroup of CVA-10 has been divided into A, B, C, D, and E. The scale bars indicate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Bootstrap values were calculated on 1000 replicates. Phylogenetic nodes with bootstrap values over 80% are marked with purple lines</p>
