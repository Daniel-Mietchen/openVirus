 <caption>
  <p>Neighbour-joining tree of the complete VP1 gene (915 nucleotides) of the CVA-6. The CVA-6 sequences (CVA-6/01/GZ/CHN/2018- CVA-6/24/GZ/CHN/2018) obtained from patients with HFMD in this study are marked by a triangle, and 158 reference sequences from elsewhere elected from the GenBank were used for phylogenetic analyses. The reference sequences were presented as GenBank accession number/province/country/year of isolation. The genogroup of CVA-6 has been divided into A, B, C, D, E1, and E2. The scale bars indicate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Bootstrap values were calculated on 1000 replicates. Phylogenetic nodes with bootstrap values over 80% are marked with purple lines</p>
