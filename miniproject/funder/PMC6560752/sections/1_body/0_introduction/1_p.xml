The most common clinical features of infection are fever, headache, and malaise, but encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever may also occur [

The virus is the most rapidly spreading and frequently encountered mosquito-borne viral infection with increased incidence of 30-fold and explosive outbreaks over the last decade [

A global annual estimate of 50 to 100 million cases of Dengue fever in endemic areas have been documented to account for 250,000 to 500,000 cases of Dengue hemorrhagic fever with 20,000 deaths and 264 disability adjusted life years per million population per year are lost [
