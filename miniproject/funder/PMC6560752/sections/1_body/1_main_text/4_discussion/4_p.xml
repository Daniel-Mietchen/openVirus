<p id="Par38">The study recorded no positive signal for RNA detection by real time RT-PCR for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses by the Trioplex real time RT-PCR assay. This contrasts with literature which suggest that the viral RNA to these viruses can be detected from day 0 to day 7 following infection and symptomatology. This could partly be attributed to samples that were collected after the acute phase or onset of illness and therefore chances to detect RNA were limited [
