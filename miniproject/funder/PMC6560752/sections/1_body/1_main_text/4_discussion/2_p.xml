<p id="Par36">Dengue specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) was 69.23%. IgM was found positive in 15% (n = 39) and IgG in 66.15% (n = 172). These findings suggest an appreciable level of Dengue fever transmission in urban center of Accra. This observed level of Dengue virus exposure was comparable to that seen in endemic countries in Central America and South-East Asia [
