<p id="Par24">Nucleic acid was extracted and purified from the serum with QIAamp Viral Mini Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); and a total of 60 μl purified RNA was labelled and cryopreserved. The pre-PCR reaction mixture was prepared with AgPath-ID™ One Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, California USA) and Trioplex Real-time RT-PCR kit (CDC; catalog #KT0166) by the US CDC and designed to qualitatively detect and differentiate RNA from Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya virus. To test the purified extracts by RT-PCR, instructions from the kit’s manufacturers were followed and after-run analysis were performed separately for each target.</p>
