<p id="Par18">Dengue and Chikungunya viruses share a common vector for transmission, mostly co-infect and their infections are characterized by overlapping clinical signs. In most affected areas where the DENV is now found, it has been established that all the four virus serotypes are circulating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The CHIKV with three different genotypes: the western African, the east-central-south African (ECSA), and the Asian genotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], initially restricted to Central Africa and Asia, has recently invaded new territories. Although 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the main vector of both viruses, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has been documented lately to be playing an important role in contributing to the spread in temperate climate areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Here we sought to detect and characterize DENV and CHIKV from patients to establish the circulating viruses which hitherto have had little diagnostic attention.
