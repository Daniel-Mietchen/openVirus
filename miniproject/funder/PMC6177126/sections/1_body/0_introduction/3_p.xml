<p>While several recent studies have elucidated challenges with linkage to community care post-release [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the longitudinal impact of incarceration on continuity of HIV care remains poorly understood. Prior studies of RIC that have included criminal justice (CJ)–involved PLWH have been limited by short follow-up [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], exclusion of PLWH re-incarcerated during follow-up [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], recall biases in self-reported incarceration and ART use [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], reliance on ART prescription refill data [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and inability to comprehensively link community and CJ data [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because RIC is currently defined as having a clinic visit with viral load (VL) assessment at least every 6 months, a window of observation beyond 1 year is needed to better understand RIC [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, a more nuanced understanding of longitudinal RIC among incarcerated PLWH is important for the development of future policies and interventions to address deficiencies within both CJ and community systems of care.
