<p>Continuous post-release RIC (i.e., having ≥1 VL measured during every 6-month period, with ≥60 days between VLs in adjacent periods) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and VS significantly declined with each additional year of follow-up (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002667.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002667.g003">3</xref>, respectively). Excluding deaths (
 <italic>n =</italic> 35 in year 1, 
 <italic>n =</italic> 30 in year 2, and 
 <italic>n =</italic> 28 in year 3), RIC rates were significantly higher among individuals who were re-incarcerated compared with those who were not within each time frame (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002667.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Among those retained, however, re-incarcerated individuals were less likely to be virally suppressed than individuals who were not re-incarcerated; this pattern was consistent across all 3 years but statistically significant in year 1 and years 1–3 only.
