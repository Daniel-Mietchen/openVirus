<p>Overall, 54.4% of individuals demonstrated terminal VS after 3 years of follow-up (
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which was independently associated with age &gt; 45 years, having health insurance, and receiving increased numbers of case management visits. Unlike RIC, VS was not independently associated with the percentage of overall follow-up time spent re-incarcerated. In addition, although VS before release and early linkage to care were not significantly correlated with terminal VS, ART prescribed during incarceration was positively associated with terminal VS.
