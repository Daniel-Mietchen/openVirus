<p>The 1,001 PLWH who were alive 3 years after release (
 <italic>n =</italic> 93 died) were demographically similar to the overall sample, and 41.5% of PLWH met criteria for sustained RIC (
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the final model, sustained RIC was independently associated with older age (&gt;45 years), having health insurance, being re-incarcerated for &gt;90 days during follow-up, receiving &gt;30 case management visits, and being linked to care or re-incarcerated within 14 days after initial release. VS prior to release was not independently associated with RIC, although not having a VL measured prior to release was negatively associated with RIC.
