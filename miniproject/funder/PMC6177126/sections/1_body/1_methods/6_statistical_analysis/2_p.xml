<p>For model building, relevant variables within the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations with clinical significance or bivariate associations significant at 
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.20 were included in full multivariable models. To minimize the Akaike information criterion and maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, backward selection was used to generate final parsimonious models, including variables with 
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05. Sex, race/ethnicity, and recidivism were assessed for significance in parsimonious models a priori. Final logistic regression models were also assessed for fit using Hosmerâ€“Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Based on tolerance, variance inflation factor, and eigenvalue diagnostics, final models did not have significant multicollinearity. Interactions between race/ethnicity, sex, and recidivism were not found to be statistically significant. Due to small numbers of individuals treated for opioid withdrawal, this variable was only assessed in GEE models. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
