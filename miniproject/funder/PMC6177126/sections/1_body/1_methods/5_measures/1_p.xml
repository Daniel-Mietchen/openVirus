<p>Recorded HIV-1 RNA VLs served as the proxy for routine HIV care clinic visits (both in prison/jail and in the community), which has demonstrated validity in multiple other settings and is consistent with core indicators for national HIV surveillance [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Using national RIC guidelines, we defined “sustained 3-year RIC” as having ≥1 VL measured during every 6-month period during the 3-year follow-up period, with ≥60 days between VLs in adjacent periods [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Because RIC does not necessarily predict VS and because VL was measured at different frequencies during follow-up, we created a “terminal VS” outcome, defined as having VL &lt; 400 copies/ml measured within the last 6-month period of the 3-year follow-up [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using time period as the unit of analysis, additional major outcomes were (1) “RIC over time” (defined as having ≥1 VL measured during a 6-month period) and (2) “VS over time” (defined as having ≥1 VL measured during a 6-month period with the last measured VL being &lt;400 copies/ml). We concluded that the use of a binary outcome in accordance with the standard definitions of RIC would be more appropriate than a survival analysis strategy (which examines time to an event) and would thus provide more clinically meaningful results. PLWH without VL assessments at least every 6 months were defined as being out of care; missing VLs were conservatively assigned VL ≥ 400 copies/ml (non-suppression) by convention [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which applied to 24.5% (245/1,001) of the individuals and 23.0% (1,432/6,227) of the analyzed 6-month periods in the final multivariable models [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. VLs were not missing at random, and therefore multiple imputation was not performed. For example, compared to the 756 people with VLs recorded during the last 6-month period of observation, the 245 people with missing VLs were significantly more likely to be uninsured, to have been recently diagnosed with HIV, to have been diagnosed with HIV during index incarceration, to have had fewer re-incarcerations or less time spent re-incarcerated, and to have had fewer case management visits. There were no significant differences between individuals missing and not missing VLs in terms of age, race/ethnicity, or sex. Using the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations framework [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], adapted for CJ populations [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002667.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we examined a broad range of predisposing, enabling/disabling, and need severity factors as potential predictors of RIC and VS over time. Continuous variables that were not normally distributed were categorized or calculated as described below.
