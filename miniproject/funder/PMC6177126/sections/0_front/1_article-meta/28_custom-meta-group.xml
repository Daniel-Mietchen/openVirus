  <meta-value>Because of the highly confidential nature of the data (related to people's HIV status and incarcerations), access to data is highly regulated by the Connecticut Departments of Correction and Public Health. Data are available to researchers who receive permission from these organizations and meet criteria for access to confidential data. Interested researchers should contact Suzanne Speers (
   <email>suzanne.speers@ct.gov</email>) or Kirsten Shea (
