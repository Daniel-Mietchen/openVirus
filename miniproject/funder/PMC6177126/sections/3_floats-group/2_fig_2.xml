  <title>Longitudinal sustained retention in HIV care (RIC), based on frequency of HIV-1 RNA viral testing, and percentage with viral suppression (VS) at 1, 2, and 3 years post-release, stratified by whether individuals were re-incarcerated (recidivist) at some point during the follow-up period.</title>
  <p>There was a statistically significant difference in RIC rates between individuals were re-incarcerated and individuals who were not re-incarcerated across all time points (χ
