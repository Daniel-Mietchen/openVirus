<p>Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by influenza virus infection. It can cause a wide spectrum of disease from mild to severe. Influenza is associated with high morbidity and mortality especially in high-risk segments of the population. It is thought that around 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children are infected with influenza viruses each year. As a result, annual influenza epidemics result in about 3–5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000–500,000 deaths in the world [
