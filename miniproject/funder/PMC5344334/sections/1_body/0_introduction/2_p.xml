<p>Epidemics of influenza occur in a different pattern depending on the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the burden of influenza also varies by region [
 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Korea is located in East Asian Monsoon region and has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The disease burden of influenza in Korea has been evaluated a few times, based on indirect analysis of National Health Insurance Claims databases or mortality time series [
 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Assessing disease burden of a particular disease, especially cost-based assessment, can help to understand a more realistic impact of the specific disease, and provide basic data for additional research such as cost-effectiveness analysis and related policy decisions. Previous studies on disease burden of influenza in Korea were based on health insurance data and death data. However, these data has significant limitation that the diagnostic code of influenza is inaccurate and care must be taken to interpret the results. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the burden of disease using actual data based on surveillance system for influenza in an institution that has experts who can diagnose influenza more sensitively and accurately. This study was performed to investigate the disease burden of 2013–2014 seasonal influenza in Korean adult population, aged 20 or more, by using surveillance data from the Hospital-based Influenza Morbidity &amp; Mortality Surveillance (HIMM) network.
