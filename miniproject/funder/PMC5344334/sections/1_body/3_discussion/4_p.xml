<p>In the previous study performed in Korea, the burden of seasonal influenza was estimated as USD $44.7 million in 2007–2008 season and USD $42.3 million in 2008–2009 season [

Indirect costs accounted for about two third of total cost and the largest portion of total burden was productivity losses due to morbidity of outpatient. In this study, however, the total socioeconomic cost was estimated as USD $124.9 million, even though the analysis was confined to the adult populations. The majority of the cost was direct medical cost. The difference may be caused by low rate of laboratory-confirmation of influenza and giving the precise diagnostic codes for influenza. In particular, most of the severe patients might be diagnosed as other diseases such as sepsis, pneumonia or chronic medical diseases. It means that the national insurance data would have significant limitation to estimate the actual influenza disease burden. Another cause of the difference might be the characteristics of the HIMM surveillance system. The participating hospitals of HIMM surveillance system were university hospitals. As a result, the severity and the direct medical cost might be overestimated. This is the inevitable limitation of this study. However, the overestimation of direct medical costs was considerably controlled by excluding the cost generated by problems other than influenza. The difference in the severity caused by circulation virus strains and vaccine mismatch may have also affected the difference in disease burden.
