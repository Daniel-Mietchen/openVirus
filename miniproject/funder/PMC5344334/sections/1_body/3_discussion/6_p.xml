<p>This study included only laboratory-confirmed influenza. Considering that the many patients are not confirmed by laboratory, real burden will be higher than this. In addition, the burden in child population was not included in this study. Considering that the incidence of influenza is usually higher in children than adult, it will be measured more higher if the burden of child population is included.</p>
