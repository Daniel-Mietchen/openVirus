<p>The study on the influenza-associated excess mortality in Korea found that influenza was associated with an average of 2,900 excess deaths per year during 2003–2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The overall all-cause excess annual mortality rate per 100,000 people was 5.97 (2.04–18.76). The study was performed using the multiple linear regression models. In this study, the mortality of laboratory-confirmed influenza was assessed as 3.1 per 100,000 adult population. Although these results may not be directly comparable, the influenza-related death in this study was estimated as almost half of the previous assessment. Besides some reasons, which is the difference in the research methods, study population, seasonal patterns of influenza epidemics and whether the 2009 pandemic influenza included, mortality in patients with undiagnosed influenza may explain the difference.
