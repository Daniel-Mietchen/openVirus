<p>The disease burden of seasonal influenza in Korean adult population was estimated to be very high, compared with other countries. In a study performed in the United States, the annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost, 3.1 million hospitalized days, 31.4 million outpatient visits, and USD $87.1 billion of total economic burden [
