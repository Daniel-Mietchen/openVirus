<p>This study has some limitation. First, all the participating hospitals were university hospitals, and patients presenting to the study hospitals might differ somewhat from patients presenting to other hospitals. Second, the burden of seasonal influenza will vary depending on the influenza season, and the winter 2013â€“14 was dominated by influenza A which tends to have greater impact on adults than influenza B.</p>
