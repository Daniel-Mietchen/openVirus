<p>The HIMM network is composed of two surveillance systems: emergency room (ER)-based and inpatient-based surveillance [
 <xref rid="pone.0172012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A total of ten university hospitals all over the country are included in the surveillance network. With representativeness in mind, the hospitals of the HIMM network were selected on the basis of geographic location, population served, and emergency department capacity. Surveillance began on October 1, 2011. According to the protocol of surveillance network, ER-based surveillance was conducted using the clinical influenza-like illness criteria that is defined as sudden onset of a fever of &gt;38’C accompanied by ≥1 respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, or rhinorrhea). Nasal/throat swabs were taken from compatible patients after obtaining informed consent. With the specimens, a rapid antigen test (RAT) and multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test were performed. Inpatient-based surveillance included monitoring for influenza-associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality, and any cases of recent (within 4 weeks) laboratory-confirmed influenza were included. Owing to the surveillance system, the participating hospitals were very sensitive to the suspicion of influenza patients.
