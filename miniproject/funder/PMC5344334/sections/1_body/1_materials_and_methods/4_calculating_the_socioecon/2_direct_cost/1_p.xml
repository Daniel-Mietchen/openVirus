<p>Direct cost, which is a cost for hospitalization or visiting outpatient clinics, was subdivided into direct medical cost and direct nonmedical cost. Direct medical cost was defined as the cost for treatment of diseases. It was calculated using the database of each hospital. Cost for purchasing medicine from pharmacy was calculated based on prescription histories and the standard price of each medicine. In terms of calculating the cost for hospitalization, if the hospital stay was extended due to problems other than influenza, the cost generated from that point to discharge was excluded from the analysis to prevent overestimation. In terms of calculating the cost for visiting clinics, if the patient received a diagnosis or treatment for problems other than influenza, the cost was excluded from the calculation.</p>
