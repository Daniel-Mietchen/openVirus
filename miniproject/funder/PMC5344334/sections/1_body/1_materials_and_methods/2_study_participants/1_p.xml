<p>The study participants were adult patients 20 years of age or older, with laboratory-confirmed influenza, who visited the hospitals participating in the HIMM network during the 2013–2014 influenza season. The 2013–2014 influenza season was defined as the period from September 2013 to May 2014. Laboratory-confirmed influenza was defined as a positive result from a rapid antigen test (RAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or influenza virus culture. Patients younger than 20 years of age were excluded. We excluded cases with hospital-acquired influenza, defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza where symptom onset was more than 2 days after admission.</p>
