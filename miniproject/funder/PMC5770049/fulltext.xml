The nucleoprotein (NP) is the structural component of the vRNP providing a scaffold for the viral RNA. In the vRNP as well as during transcription and replication the viral polymerase interacts with NP but it is unclear which parts of the polymerase and NP mediate these interactions. Previously the C-terminal &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain (amino acids 538&#x02013;693) of PB2 was shown to interact with NP. Here we report that a fragment encompassing amino acids 146&#x02013;185 of NP is sufficient to mediate this interaction. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation assays we show that amino acid region 601 to 607 of the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain interacts with this fragment of NP. Substitutions of these PB2 amino acids resulted in diminished RNP activity and surface plasmon resonance assays showed that amino acids D605 was essential for the interaction with NP and V606 may also play a partial role in the interaction. Collectively these results reveal a possible interaction surface between NP and the PB2 subunit of the RNA polymerase complex.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>473111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-5073</contrib-id><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Pang-Chui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001839</institution-id><institution>University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant AoE/M-12/06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-5073</contrib-id><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Pang-Chui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T11-705/14N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-5073</contrib-id><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Pang-Chui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K000241/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fodor</surname><given-names>Ervin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102053/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>Benjamin E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant (Project number: 473111) from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR, in part from the Area of Excellent Scheme of the University Grants Committee of HKSAR (Grant AoE/M-12/06) on the Control of Pandemic and Inter-Pandemic Influenza and Theme-based Research from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR (T11-705/14N) to PC.

According to the World Health Organization, influenza epidemics claim the life of 250,000 to 500,000 people every year. Influenza A virus genome comprises of eight segments of viral RNA (vRNA) encoding 10 major proteins and several auxiliary polypeptides [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each of the eight RNA segments of the virus is packaged into a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex consisting of multiple nucleoproteins (NPs) and one heterotrimeric RNA polymerase, which binds the partially complementary 5&#x02019; and 3&#x02019; termini of the vRNA. Transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome is carried out by the viral polymerase in the context of the vRNP complex [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The RNA polymerase of influenza A virus consists of three subunits: PA, PB1 and PB2. The PB1 subunit is at the centre of the polymerase complex and contains the motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The PA subunit contains an N-terminal endonuclease and a large C-terminal domain, connected through a 70 amino acid long linker. The PB2 subunit consists of multiple domains, including the cap-binding, mid-link, &#x02018;627&#x02019; and nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains in the C-terminal two thirds of the molecule. The PA endonuclease and PB2 cap-binding domains are involved in the cap-snatching process by binding to and cleaving, respectively, host 5&#x02019; capped RNAs, producing capped RNA fragments used as primers by the polymerase for the initiation of transcription of viral genes. The PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain (amino acids 538&#x02013;693) is named after the host range determinant amino acid 627, which is almost invariably a glutamate in avian but a lysine in mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The function of the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain in the context of the polymerase complex is still unclear, although it was shown recently that a polymerase mutant lacking the &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain can mediate core polymerase functions in vitro but cannot replicate viral RNA in cells [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>NP is the most abundant protein in the RNP complex. Its primary function is to provide a scaffold for vRNA and the complementary RNA (cRNA) replicative intermediate to facilitate the formation of the double helical RNPs [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. NP has been reported to interact with all three polymerase subunits [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and has been suggested to act as a switching factor from transcription early in infection to genome replication late in infection [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, more recent research suggested that NP is an elongation factor rather than a regulator of transcription or replication [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The sites of interaction between NP and PB2 are poorly mapped. Three independent regions of NP (amino acids 1&#x02013;161, 255&#x02013;340, 340&#x02013;465) were found to bind PB2, while the C-terminus of NP (amino acids 465&#x02013;498) inhibits the interaction [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. On the other hand, two fragments of PB2 (amino acids 1&#x02013;269 and 580&#x02013;683) were shown to interact with NP [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, these sites of interaction were mapped by deletion mutagenesis and cover a significant portion of both proteins (75% of NP and 50% of PB2). Several studies reported reduced interaction between NP and PB2 of avian influenza viruses in mammalian cells that can be restored by the E627K adaptive mutation [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This led to the hypothesis that PB2 amino acid 627 is involved in NP-PB2 interactions. However, another report suggested that the apparent stronger binding of NP with PB2 observed in co-immunoprecipitation with a PB2 E627K mutant is a consequence of increased polymerase activity instead of higher binding affinity between NP and PB2 [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, PB2 627E was found to restrict polymerase activity in mammalian cells in an NP-independent manner suggesting that reduced binding between avian PB2 and NP in mammalian cells is not the primary reason for the low activity of avian influenza virus polymerase in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To gain a better insight into the interplay between NP and PB2 here we investigate the interaction between NP and the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain further and identify amino acids 605 and 606 of PB2 that is involved in an interaction with amino acid region of 146&#x02013;185 of NP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Amino acids 601&#x02013;607 of the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain are involved in interaction with NP</title><p>Previously, our group reported that NP interacts with the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain and identified NP R150 to be involved in the interaction, mutation of this results in an abolished interaction [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To address the question whether a fragment of NP containing R150 is sufficient for the interaction, we expressed and purified NP fragment 146&#x02013;185 with a His-SUMO tag and PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain with His tag in a bacterial expression system using established protocols [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We tested the binding of these two proteins in SPR experiments with BIAcore 3000.

We show that the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain interacts with full-length NP as well as an NP fragment encompassing amino acids 146&#x02013;185. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments we found that PB2 amino acids 601 to 607 were particularly affected by the interaction suggesting the involvement of this region of the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain in direct interaction with NP. RNP activity assays confirmed the importance of this polymerase region for activity. While substitutions of amino acids 602 to 604 affected activity on both full-length and truncated vRNA templates, substitutions at amino acids 605 and 606 specifically affected activity on the full-length but not the truncated vRNA template that can be transcribed and replicated in the absence of NP. These results suggested that PB2 amino acids 605 and 606 are involved in polymerase function primarily by mediating interaction with NP. Indeed, SPR data support the involvement of these amino acids in interaction with NP.</p><p>We have surveyed 19159 influenza A virus PB2 sequences available in the Influenza Research Database. Amino acids 601 to 607 were found to be almost absolutely conserved (identical in more than 19100 sequences analysed), regardless of the host species. This indicates that this region of PB2 is involved in an essential polymerase function which is crucial to the virus. Based on our data we propose that amino acids 605 and 606 of PB2 contribute to polymerase function through mediating interaction with NP. From our previous study, basic amino acid at position 627 or 630 is necessary for the interaction [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The low CSP signal of E627 agreed with the previous study, interestingly, we found that PB2 R630 was barely perturbed in NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments by either the full-length NP or the NP 146&#x02013;185 fragment. Since amino acid R630 is located at a flexible loop in PB2, which may undergo conformational movements in the intermediate exchange regime causing extensive broadening of the NMR signals, we may not observe the HN-N cross peaks of these amino acids in HSQC spectra. As a result, we have not observed the CSP reading of R630 when using full-length NP as ligand. On the other hand, there is a small CSP reading when using an NP 146&#x02013;185 fragment as ligand, reflecting the change of binding affinity has shifted the interaction to fast exchange regime. The small reading suggested R630 is not involved in binding the proposed region of NP (aa 146&#x02013;185). These findings are in agreement with the proposal that adaptive mutations at these amino acids affect polymerase-NP interactions indirectly by primarily affecting polymerase activity [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The possibility of the involvement of R630 of PB2 in NP-PB2 interaction cannot be excluded but it is possible that aa 601&#x02013;607 nearby, which showed a much higher CSP signal, may interact with NP and that interaction was proved by SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191226.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p><p>Although this study did not identify the interacting amino acids on NP, it provides some clues about how the interaction takes place in NP. A fragment of NP comprising amino acids 146&#x02013;185 exhibited an affinity of 927nM for the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain where the full-length NP showed an affinity of 252nM for the domain [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The affinity of NP fragment for PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain is considerably significant since the fragment only comprises less than 1/10 of the amino acids of NP. These results indicate that NP 146&#x02013;185 plays an important role in the interaction but other regions also contribute. Previously, we have shown that substitution of R150 in NP to A abolished the RNP activity in an H5 polymerase background, but not an H1 background [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggested the possible interaction of NP R150 and PB2 D605. Whether two amino acids interact directly and the importance of such interaction requires further study. NP 146&#x02013;185 is located at the interface of the head and body domains and some of the basic amino acids within this fragment were shown to be important for RNA-binding [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, in previous studies amino acid S165 was found to be phosphorylated during infection and phosphomimetic mutations were shown to inhibit oligomerisation suggesting that this region of NP is also involved in the regulation of oligomerisation [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further studies are required to understand how this region in NP takes part in RNA binding, oligomerisation and interaction with the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain.</p><p>In our study, both the luciferase reporter assay and RNP reconstitution assay have indicated that substitutions of amino acids D605 and V606 in PB2 resulted in the partial to complete loss of RNP activity. Combining the results from SPR study, the loss of RNP activity is most likely caused by disruption of interaction between NP and PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain. This suggested the interaction is essential for the functioning of the RNP. The recently published atomic structures of the viral RNA polymerase may shed some light on this question [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was postulated that the nascent RNA exits the polymerase from a basic channel near the &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is possible that the &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain interacts with NP to bring NP into close proximity with nascent cRNA and vRNA for encapsidation and vRNP template formation. Therefore, disruption of the interaction between NP and the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain may thus stop the replication process. The finding that substitutions at PB2 amino acids 605 and 606 specifically interfere with polymerase activity on a full-length vRNA template requiring NP for replication but not on a short template that can be replicated in the absence of NP is consistent with the proposed hypothesis. The next question is how these mutations would affect the interaction between NP and polymerase complex within the host cells. To answer this question, an integrated study of other PB2 regions is required since PB2-NP interaction occurs in multiple sites [<xref rid="pone.0191226.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, this work delineates the molecular details of the interaction between NP and the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain. Amino acids 146&#x02013;185 of NP were found to interact with the PB2 &#x02018;627&#x02019; domain, and this interaction primarily involves amino acids 605 and 606 of PB2 with D605 having more importance in this interaction. The loss of this interaction disrupts RNP activity. Overall our study provides new insights into the association of NP and PB2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Biological materials</title><p>HEK 293 and 293T were obtained from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA.
