<p>Purified wild-type and PB2 ‘627’ domain mutants were diluted to 0.3 mg/mL. Spectra were recorded at 25 
 <sup>o</sup>C from 260 to 190 nm using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter in a 0.1 cm path length cuvette. Data were collected every 0.2 nm, averaged over three scans and corrected for the baseline. Spectra were converted to molar ellipticity and plotted for comparison.
