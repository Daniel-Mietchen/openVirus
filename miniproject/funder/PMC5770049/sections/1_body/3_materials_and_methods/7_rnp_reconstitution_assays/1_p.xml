<p>RNP reconstitution assays were carried out as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HEK 293T cells (~10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were transfected with 1 μg each of plasmids encoding RNP subunits, including wild-type or mutant PB2s and full-length segment 6 (NA) vRNA templates or its truncated version (NA 47). Total RNA was extracted and analysed using 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labelled primers in reverse transcription [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Products were analysed by denaturing PAGE containing 7 M urea in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. Expression levels of PB2 and its mutants were checked by Western blotting with karyopherin ß3 as loading control.
