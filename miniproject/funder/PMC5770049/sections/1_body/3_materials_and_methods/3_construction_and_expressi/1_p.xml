<p>NP fragment 146–185 was generated by PCR and cloned into pHis-SUMO vector for protein expression. The expression vector is a modified SUMO plasmid with a SUMO protease-recognition site inserted between the SUMO-tag and the protein of interest. The clones were sequenced to ensure that it encodes a His-affinity purification tag, followed by the sequence representing SUMO and NP 146–185. NP fragment 146–185 was expressed in the

 <italic>coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3 soluble) (Novagen). The recombinant protein was purified with a Ni–NTA affinity column (GE Healthcare) in 20mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 200mM NaCl. The SUMO-fusion protein was eluted with increasing concentration of imidazole and the SUMO-tag was removed by SUMO protease digestion overnight at 4°C. Then NP fragment 146–185 was recovered and further purified by a Ni–NTA affinity column and Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column on the AKTA Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (GE Healthcare) in 20mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 200mM NaCl. Protein purity was checked by 15% SDS-PAGE.
