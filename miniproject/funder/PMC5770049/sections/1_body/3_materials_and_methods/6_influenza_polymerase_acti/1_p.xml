<p>For transfection 0.125 μg each of pcDNA-PA, pcDNA-PB1, pcDNA-PB2 wild-type or mutant, pcDNA-NP, pPOLI-Luc-RT and pEGFP plasmids were diluted to 12.5 μl in OptiMEM (Life Technologies) and added to 1.05 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) in 12.5 μl OptiMEM. The transfection mixture was incubated for 20 min in a 96-well plate before 1x10
 <sup>5</sup> 293T in 75 μl DMEM was added to the well. At 48 h post-transfection, GFP fluorescent signal was measured. Subsequently, cells were lysed by Steady-Glo assay reagent (Promega) for 5 min before luminescence signal was measured. The polymerase activity was expressed as a ratio of luminescence to GFP signal.
