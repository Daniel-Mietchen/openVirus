<p>The sequences encoding ‘627’ domain of PB2 (amino acids 538–693) from A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) was cloned into pET28a expression vector. The plasmids were transformed into 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG at 25 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 5 h when OD
 <sub>600</sub> reached 0.6–0.8. Unlabeled proteins were expressed in LB medium while the 
 <sup>15</sup>N labeled protein in M9 minimal medium, with the supplement of 
 <sup>15</sup>NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl. The protein was purified by Ni-affinity and gel filtration column chromatography, according to established protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Full-length NP of A/Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) was expressed and purified as described previously [
