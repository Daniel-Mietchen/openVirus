<p>Purified wild-type or mutant PB2 ‘627’ domain was individually immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare) until the response unit (RU) had increased to about 615 from baseline. NP mutant R416A or NP fragment including amino acids 146–185 was injected into the sensor chip at increasing concentrations in 20mM Tris-HCl pH8, 300mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.005% Tween-20. The experiments were performed at 25 
 <sup>o</sup>C with BIAcore 3000. Data were analysed with BIAevaluation v 4.1. SPR measurements were fitted with 1:1 Langmuir model to obtain association constants, dissociation constants and affinity of the interaction.
