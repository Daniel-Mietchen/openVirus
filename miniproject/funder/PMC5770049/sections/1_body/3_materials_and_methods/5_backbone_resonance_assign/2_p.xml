<p>The interaction between the PB2 ‘627’ domain and NP was studied using the NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) method, in which the interaction was monitored through chemical shift changes in 
 <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra of 
 <sup>15</sup>N labeled PB2 ‘627’ domain upon the addition of unlabeled full-length NP or NP fragment 146–185. The full-length NP and NP fragment 146–185 to PB2 ‘627’ domain molar ratios used were 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3. A number of peaks shifted significantly, whereas the positions of the majority of the cross-peaks remained unchanged, indicating that there was a specific interaction between the PB2 ‘627’ domain and NP. The measured chemical shift changes for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>15</sup>N were combined into a composite CSP vector ΔCS [
