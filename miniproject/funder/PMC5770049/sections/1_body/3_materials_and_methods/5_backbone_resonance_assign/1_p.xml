<p>To identify amino acids with large chemical shift perturbation (CSP), backbone resonance assignment of the PB2 ‘627’ domain in the presence or absence of NP was carried out using a series of triple resonance NMR experiments including the HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HN(CO)CACB, HNCACB, HNCA, HN(CO)CA. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 700 MHz NMR spectrometer with cryoprobe at 298 K. NMR data processing was accomplished using NMRPipe software (version linux9) [
