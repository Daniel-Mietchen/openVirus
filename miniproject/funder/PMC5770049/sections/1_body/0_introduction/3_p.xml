<p>NP is the most abundant protein in the RNP complex. Its primary function is to provide a scaffold for vRNA and the complementary RNA (cRNA) replicative intermediate to facilitate the formation of the double helical RNPs [

 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, more recent research suggested that NP is an elongation factor rather than a regulator of transcription or replication [
