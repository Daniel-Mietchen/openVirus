<p>Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that causes recurring annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. According to the World Health Organization, influenza epidemics claim the life of 250,000 to 500,000 people every year. Influenza A virus genome comprises of eight segments of viral RNA (vRNA) encoding 10 major proteins and several auxiliary polypeptides [

 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each of the eight RNA segments of the virus is packaged into a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex consisting of multiple nucleoproteins (NPs) and one heterotrimeric RNA polymerase, which binds the partially complementary 5’ and 3’ termini of the vRNA. Transcription and replication of the viral RNA genome is carried out by the viral polymerase in the context of the vRNP complex [
