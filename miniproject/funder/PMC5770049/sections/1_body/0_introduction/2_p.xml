<p>The RNA polymerase of influenza A virus consists of three subunits: PA, PB1 and PB2. The PB1 subunit is at the centre of the polymerase complex and contains the motifs characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. The PA subunit contains an N-terminal endonuclease and a large C-terminal domain, connected through a 70 amino acid long linker. The PB2 subunit consists of multiple domains, including the cap-binding, mid-link, ‘627’ and nuclear localization signal (NLS) domains in the C-terminal two thirds of the molecule. The PA endonuclease and PB2 cap-binding domains are involved in the cap-snatching process by binding to and cleaving, respectively, host 5’ capped RNAs, producing capped RNA fragments used as primers by the polymerase for the initiation of transcription of viral genes. The PB2 ‘627’ domain (amino acids 538–693) is named after the host range determinant amino acid 627, which is almost invariably a glutamate in avian but a lysine in mammalian-adapted influenza A viruses [

The function of the PB2 ‘627’ domain in the context of the polymerase complex is still unclear, although it was shown recently that a polymerase mutant lacking the ‘627’ domain can mediate core polymerase functions in vitro but cannot replicate viral RNA in cells [
