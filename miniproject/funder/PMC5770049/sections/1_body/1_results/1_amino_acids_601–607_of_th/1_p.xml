<p>Previously, our group reported that NP interacts with the PB2 ‘627’ domain and identified NP R150 to be involved in the interaction, mutation of this results in an abolished interaction [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To address the question whether a fragment of NP containing R150 is sufficient for the interaction, we expressed and purified NP fragment 146–185 with a His-SUMO tag and PB2 ‘627’ domain with His tag in a bacterial expression system using established protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We tested the binding of these two proteins in SPR experiments with BIAcore 3000. The purified PB2 ‘627’ domain was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and purified NP fragment 146–185 was injected into the system at increasing concentrations. The kinetic parameters were measured, the binding curves were fitted and the affinity constant was calculated. The curves fitted best with 1:1 Langmuir model. The NP peptide bound to the PB2 ‘627’ domain with an affinity of 927 nM (k

 <sup>15</sup>N-lablled PB2 ‘627’ domain in bacterial expression system and performed a chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiment, using either full-length NP or NP fragment 146–185 as ligand. The resultant perturbation patterns by both the peptide and full-length NP were comparable, amino acids 532–537 shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191226.g001">Fig 1B</xref> were the remain of the His-tag after cleavage. In particular, PB2 amino acids 601–607 were highly perturbed in both cases. Therefore, these seven amino acids were selected for further experiments. These amino acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191226.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, highlighted in red) were located on an alpha helix adjacent to the characteristic phi-loop of the PB2 ‘627’ domain. Perturbed amino acids downstream of 607 were excluded from further experiments because they are buried in the crystal structure of RNA polymerase (PDB ID: 4WSB) while amino acids 601–607 are exposed and readily accessible.
