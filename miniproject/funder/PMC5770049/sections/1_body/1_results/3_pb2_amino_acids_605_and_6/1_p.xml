<p>As reported by a previous study, influenza virus polymerase can replicate and transcribe templates with length shorter than 76 nt in the absence of NP [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, substitutions of polymerase amino acid solely involved in binding NP but otherwise not contributing to transcription and replication should have no effect on short vRNA templates. To test whether PB2 amino acids 601â€“607 were solely involved in NP-binding, we co-expressed a full-length segment 6 vRNA or its internally truncated 47 nt-long version with wild-type or mutant polymerases. There were three observations for the PB2 variants. First, Q601A and L607A did not show a decrease in RNP activity as in luciferase reporter assay, the reason of such difference shall be investigated in follow-up study. Second, variants Q602A, M603A and R604A showed a significant drop in the short template analysis, this indicated that the RNP activity loss was due to disrupted polymerase rather than NP-PB2 interaction disruption. Third, variants D605A and V606A showed similar vRNA and mRNA levels as the wild-type in primer extension analysis on the short vRNA template (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191226.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The activity was significantly reduced for variant D605A on both templates. Variant V606A also showed a 50% reduction in the transcription of the full-length template. This suggested that PB2 amino acid 605 and to some extend 606 are involved in the polymerase function through the binding to NP.
