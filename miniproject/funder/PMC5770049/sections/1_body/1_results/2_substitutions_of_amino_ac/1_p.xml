<p>Next, we addressed the role of amino acids 601â€“607 in PB2 by measuring the RNP activity with PB2 mutants in a luciferase assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The RNP activity was represented as a ratio of luminescence to GFP level, and the activity of RNP with wild-type PB2 was set as 1. Transfection of wild-type PB2 resulted in detectable luminescence, indicating that the RNP was functional (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191226.g002">Fig 2</xref>). All the alanine mutants had dramatically reduced RNP activity. We conclude that amino acids 601 to 607 of PB2 are important for RNP activity.
