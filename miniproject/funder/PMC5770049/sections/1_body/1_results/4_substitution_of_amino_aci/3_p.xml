<p>To address the possibility that the observed disruption of interaction was due to structural disruption of the domain by the amino acids substitutions, circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed to examine the secondary structures of the mutants. It was found that these two mutants produced similar spectra compared with the wild-type (
