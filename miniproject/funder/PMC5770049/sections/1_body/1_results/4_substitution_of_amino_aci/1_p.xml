<p>D605A and V606A variants of the PB2 ‘627’ domain were expressed in a bacterial expression system and purified to homogeneity using established protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The purified PB2 ‘627’ mutants were then immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling. Purified monomeric NP R416A was applied at increasing concentrations, produced by 2-fold serial dilutions, to determine the kinetic parameters of the interaction. The resultant curves were fitted by 1:1 Langmuir model. NP R416A interacted with the wild-type PB2 ‘627’ domain with an affinity of 274 ± 91 nM (

 <sub>D</sub> of the interaction between wild-type NP and wild-type PB2 ‘627’ domain (252 nM) [
