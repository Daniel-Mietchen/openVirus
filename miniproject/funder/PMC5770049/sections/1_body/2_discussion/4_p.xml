<p>In our study, both the luciferase reporter assay and RNP reconstitution assay have indicated that substitutions of amino acids D605 and V606 in PB2 resulted in the partial to complete loss of RNP activity. Combining the results from SPR study, the loss of RNP activity is most likely caused by disruption of interaction between NP and PB2 ‘627’ domain. This suggested the interaction is essential for the functioning of the RNP. The recently published atomic structures of the viral RNA polymerase may shed some light on this question [

 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It was postulated that the nascent RNA exits the polymerase from a basic channel near the ‘627’ domain [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is possible that the ‘627’ domain interacts with NP to bring NP into close proximity with nascent cRNA and vRNA for encapsidation and vRNP template formation. Therefore, disruption of the interaction between NP and the PB2 ‘627’ domain may thus stop the replication process. The finding that substitutions at PB2 amino acids 605 and 606 specifically interfere with polymerase activity on a full-length vRNA template requiring NP for replication but not on a short template that can be replicated in the absence of NP is consistent with the proposed hypothesis. The next question is how these mutations would affect the interaction between NP and polymerase complex within the host cells. To answer this question, an integrated study of other PB2 regions is required since PB2-NP interaction occurs in multiple sites [
