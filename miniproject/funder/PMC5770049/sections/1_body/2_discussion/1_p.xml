<p>In this study we aimed to gain further insight into the interaction of the PB2 polymerase subunit with NP. We show that the PB2 ‘627’ domain interacts with full-length NP as well as an NP fragment encompassing amino acids 146–185. Using NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments we found that PB2 amino acids 601 to 607 were particularly affected by the interaction suggesting the involvement of this region of the PB2 ‘627’ domain in direct interaction with NP. RNP activity assays confirmed the importance of this polymerase region for activity. While substitutions of amino acids 602 to 604 affected activity on both full-length and truncated vRNA templates, substitutions at amino acids 605 and 606 specifically affected activity on the full-length but not the truncated vRNA template that can be transcribed and replicated in the absence of NP. These results suggested that PB2 amino acids 605 and 606 are involved in polymerase function primarily by mediating interaction with NP. Indeed, SPR data support the involvement of these amino acids in interaction with NP.</p>
