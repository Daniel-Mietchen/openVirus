<p>Although this study did not identify the interacting amino acids on NP, it provides some clues about how the interaction takes place in NP. A fragment of NP comprising amino acids 146–185 exhibited an affinity of 927nM for the PB2 ‘627’ domain where the full-length NP showed an affinity of 252nM for the domain [

The affinity of NP fragment for PB2 ‘627’ domain is considerably significant since the fragment only comprises less than 1/10 of the amino acids of NP. These results indicate that NP 146–185 plays an important role in the interaction but other regions also contribute. Previously, we have shown that substitution of R150 in NP to A abolished the RNP activity in an H5 polymerase background, but not an H1 background [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggested the possible interaction of NP R150 and PB2 D605. Whether two amino acids interact directly and the importance of such interaction requires further study. NP 146–185 is located at the interface of the head and body domains and some of the basic amino acids within this fragment were shown to be important for RNA-binding [

Furthermore, in previous studies amino acid S165 was found to be phosphorylated during infection and phosphomimetic mutations were shown to inhibit oligomerisation suggesting that this region of NP is also involved in the regulation of oligomerisation [
 <xref rid="pone.0191226.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further studies are required to understand how this region in NP takes part in RNA binding, oligomerisation and interaction with the PB2 ‘627’ domain.
