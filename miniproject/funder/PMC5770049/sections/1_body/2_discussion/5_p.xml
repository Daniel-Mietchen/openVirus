<p>To conclude, this work delineates the molecular details of the interaction between NP and the PB2 ‘627’ domain. Amino acids 146–185 of NP were found to interact with the PB2 ‘627’ domain, and this interaction primarily involves amino acids 605 and 606 of PB2 with D605 having more importance in this interaction. The loss of this interaction disrupts RNP activity. Overall our study provides new insights into the association of NP and PB2.</p>
