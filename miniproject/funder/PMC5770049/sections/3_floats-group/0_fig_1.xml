  <title>Interaction between NP fragment 146–185 and PB2 involves PB2 amino acids 601 to 607.</title>
  <p>(A) SPR sensorgrams of interaction between NP fragment 146–185 and PB2 ‘627’ domain. ‘627’ domain was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip and NP 146–185 of 0, 312.5, 625, 1250, 2500, 10000 nM was injected. (B) 
   <sup>15</sup>N-labelled PB2 ‘627’ domain was perturbed by either full-length NP (blue, colour code: #0000FF) or NP fragment 146–185 (red, colour code: #FF0000), and the chemical shift of each amino acid was recorded. For some amino acids on the PB2 ‘627’ domain the perturbation data were unavailable and the values were assigned as zero. (C) Amino acids 601 to 607 (highlighted in red, colour code: #FF0000) of the PB2 ‘627’ domain are located on an alpha-helix adjacent to the characteristic phi-loop of the domain (PDB ID: 2VY7).
