  <title>Substitutions of amino acids 605 and 606 in PB2 affect RNP activity in an NP-dependent manner.</title>
  <p>(A) Primer extension analysis of vRNA and mRNA form vRNP reconstitution assays using a full-length segment 6 vRNA template. PB2 was omitted as negative control and the levels of 5S rRNA acted as internal control. Level of PB2 expression of each mutant was detected by anti-PB2 polyclonal antibodies in Western blotting with karyopherin ß3 as loading control. Quantification was performed by phosphoimage analysis of data from three independent experiments. The mRNA and vRNA levels of WT were set to 1. (B) Similar to (A) but without NP and using a truncated 47 nt-long vRNA-like template. *The p-values are smaller or equal to 0.05 in two-tailed Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
