  <title>Amino acids 605 and 606 of the PB2 ‘627’ domain are involved in interaction with NP.</title>
  <p>SPR was performed with wild-type PB2 (A), PB2 variant D605A (B) or PB2 variant V606A (C) using increasing concentrations of NP mutant R416A produced by 2-fold serial dilutions. The NP concentration series covers a range from 7 nM to 8000 nM. Curves produced by 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.63 and 7.82 nM NP are shown in the sensorgrams.</p>
