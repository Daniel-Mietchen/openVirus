  <title>PB2 variants D605A and V606A do not affect the secondary structures of the PB2 ‘627’ domain.</title>
  <p>Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed using purified PB2 ‘627’ domain. Spectra were recorded from 260 to 200 nm and were averaged over three measurements. The spectrum obtained for wild-type PB2 is compared with that of PB2 mutant D605A (A) and V606A (B).</p>
