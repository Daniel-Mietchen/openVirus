<p>Interestingly, both of quantitatively and qualitatively inhibiting effects of ivermectin on DENV-2 have been detected in this study. Generally speaking, without ivermectin intervention, DENV-2 was well developed in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, whose virus loads were significantly higher when the fully engorged mosquitoes were held from 4 to 10 days post infectious blood feeding (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, with the treatment of ivermectin, the infection rate and the median of DENV-2 RNA concentrations (copies/ml) were reduced by up to 49.63% and 99.99% (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006934.g001">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006934.g003">3</xref>). The linear correlation regression was established between concentration of ivermectin and infection rate of mosquitoes, and we found that 88.5% reduction of infection rate was attributed to the antivirus effectiveness of ivermectin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006934.g002">Fig 2</xref>). But the inhibiting effort of ivermectin on the virus in mosquitoes depended on the ivermectin dose, only when the ivermectin concentration was high enough (e.g. over 16ng/ml) can effectively inhibit DENV-2 inside 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Thus, it is a new need to find out the exactly effective concentration of ivermectin per bite by mosquito as well as action mechanism of ivermectin in the future research, so as to guide its actual application in zooprophylaxis [
