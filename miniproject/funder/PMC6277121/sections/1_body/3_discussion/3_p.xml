<p>This study does not attempt to explore the action mechanism of ivermectin towards DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. In our opinion, several potential reasons are leading to the inhibiting effect on any of the three aspects, namely virus, vector and natural microbiome of mosquitoes. Ivermectin is of a wide range of bioactivity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It has been initially used in livestock or pets to kill parasites (e.g. gastrointestinal and mite) since 1981. Subsequently, it was proved to be very effective in humankind for a variety of internal nematode infections (e.g. Onchocerciasis) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The action mechanism is that ivermectin targets glutamate-gated chloride channels, which plays fundamental roles in nematodes and insects while not accessible in vertebrates, leading to flaccid paralysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Ivermectin may also interact with γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Both of the two channels are absent in virus. The antiviral activity of ivermectin towards dengue virus had been reported repeatedly since 2012 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and then was confirmed in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but all of the researches were carried out in vitro. Considering the existed evidences, the antiviral mechanisms of ivermectin inhibiting DENV-2 in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> can be assumed from the following six aspects: (i) by targeting virus NS3 helicase activity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; (ii) by inhibiting nuclear import with respect to virus NS5 polymerase proteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; (iii) by altering some aspects of the mosquito physiology, e.g. reducing the thickness of the peritrophic matrix in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], delaying blood ingesting in 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; (iv) by stimulating enhanced anti-pathogen innate immunity, e.g. helping the host’s own immune response being able to overcome the immature worms and so kill them [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; (v) by interacting with glutamate-gated chloride channels or γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channels in the mosquito, and then reducing the adaptability between mosquito and pathogen; (vi) by influencing the natural microbiome of mosquitoes, since the natural microbiome, like 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, is related with the DENV 2 infection in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After all, these complex interactions between the pathogen and vector make it possible for ivermectin to have the function of antivirus inside 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. All of these potential reasons are worth more deep and overall follow-up study. Moreover, there are still some other effects remain poorly understood. It is unclear that how ivermectin exerts its effect on microfilariae infection in human [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> in 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (Giles, 1902) [
