<p>Ivermectin can block the DENV 2 at any anatomical barrier, like midgut or salivary gland. It was a great pity that we did not study where virus was blocked, so we did not test the viral infection, dissemination and transmission rates, all of which are always different in the same group of mosquitoes. Infection of mosquitoes requires the navigation of several anatomical barriers (e.g. the midgut and salivary glands barriers), and last is excreted into saliva for transmission to a new host. Escape from the midgut or colonization of the hemolymph does not necessarily guarantee the infection of the salivary glands. All of these barriers to productive infection of mosquitoes affect the transmission of viruses. Thus, transmission rate is always lower than viral infection rate. In this study, we just chose viral infection rates as an outcome measure. Maybe transmission rate is a more direct indicator to reflect the significance of ivermectin for the dengue control program in terms of blocking the dengue transmission. Anyway, the results showed that virus infection rates were significantly decreased by ivermectin (

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes fed with 0ng/ml ivermectin was 84.62% (55/65), which was only 42.62% (26/61) in the mosquitoes fed with 64ng/ml ivermectin. The reduction degree of virus infection rate in the treated mosquitoes was up to 49.63%, which meant that there were more negative mosquitoes without virus disseminating from midgut to salivary gland, or that there were less positive mosquitoes with virus transmitting from mosquitoes to a new host. In this sense, we concluded that ivermectin can be used as alternative tool for controlling dengue vectors.
