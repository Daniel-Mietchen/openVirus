<p>The infection rate in the mosquitoes fed with 0 ng/ml ivermectin (parallel control group) was 84.62%, which was not significantly higher than the infection rate (81.67%) in the historical control group (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). And the mosquitoes fed with 0 ng/ml ivermectin were of higher DENV-2 RNA concentrations than mosquitoes in historical control group (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006934.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), verifying the multiplication of DENV-2 inside 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> when they were raised from 4 days to 10 days post infectious blood feeding without ivermectin intervention.
