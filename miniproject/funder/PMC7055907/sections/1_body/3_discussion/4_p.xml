<p>The human RVFV seroprevalence was similar for all counties investigated. Isiolo County is regarded as a RVF medium risk County [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our finding that RVFV infection, as measured by IgG, had similar prevalences in the neighboring counties could be attributed to the fact that the three counties share boundaries. Livestock movement across the counties usually occur hence the possibility of transmission of infection at convergence zones (watering and pasture points) like the Mboni Forest and Tana River delta, among others, as the animals are moved to pasture and water [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, the presence of both primary and secondary vectors of RVFV (i.e., 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi</italic> and some 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species) could play an important role in the high prevalence observed in the study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Similarly, in Garissa County, which borders Isiolo County, studies have shown an abundance of RVFV primary vectors (i.e. 
 <italic>Aedes mcintoshi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>ochraceus</italic>) as well as the secondary vectors (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., 
 <italic>Culex spp</italic>) known to transmit RVFV during floods [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another factor is the human behavior such as handling of sick animals, sheltering of animals, slaughtering practices, and birthing, that could differ across the counties and could influence the risk of infection [
