<p>Although Isiolo is classified as being at medium risk of RVF outbreaks, and Garissa and Tana River as being at high risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], our study revealed no significant difference in seroprevalence among the three counties. This is contrary to the expectation based on the risk level on the proportion of the national RVF epizootic years that the counties were involved in, since the first report of the virus in the district [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The risk of transmission through exposure to infected animals and animal products could be low in Isiolo County, because the IgG seroprevalence among livestock in the same area during the 2006/2007 outbreak was much lower in Isiolo (9.5%) compared to Garissa (20.9%) county[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We however cannot rule out that differences in human behavior such as use of personal protective equipment during birthing, slaughtering, handling of sick animals, among others, that could expose the population in Isiolo county to a higher risk of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Interestingly, reports from the last outbreaks did not document any human deaths in Isiolo County [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Human cases or deaths are known to occur after exposure to infected animals or animal products or fluids. In our case, we can speculate that although there were no severe human cases reported during the outbreak in 2006 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], human exposure might have occurred through bites from infectious mosquito that resulted in mild to subclinical infection responsible for the observed increased seroconversion. The vector species composition observed in Isiolo by previous studies showed high densities of secondary vectors which could be associated with human transmission and the complete absence of a key primary vector 
 <italic>Aedes ochraceous</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] may have a bearing on the livestock transmission.
