<p>Data analyzed in the presented study were collected during 2014–2015, which was an inter-epidemic period, just before the 2015–2016 heavy El Niño rainfall alert that has previously been associated with RVF outbreaks. There was no large outbreak reported in 2016, and the high RVFV seroprevalence seen in the present study could potentially be a factor that reduced transmission and disease cases. Goats from two herds sampled during an RVF surveillance in Kenya in 2015/2016 in response to the El Niño rainfall alert showed RVF IgG antibodies confirming RVFV exposure [

This is in the higher range compared to previous studies from Northeastern Kenya where the human RVFV seroprevalence was, for example, 15% in 1998 (Woods et al., 2002), 12.5–32% in 2006–2007 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and 15–25% in 2009–2012 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our findings showed males were at a significantly higher risk of infection by RVFV than females, and increased age was associated with higher RVF IgG prevalence. Furthermore, individuals who had regular contact with livestock had a greater risk of RVFV infection. Majority of the participants were females. Most males work away from home taking care of the livestock or on employment and hence were not available during sampling. Tana River had the least number of study participants due to inaccessibility during sampling arising from the insecure situation at the time of sampling. In terms of occupation, the majority were pastoralists and herdsmen which was expected as pastoralism is a major source of livelihood for populations living in Garissa, Isiolo, and Tana River counties.
