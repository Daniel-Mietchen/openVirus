<p>This study established that a large proportion of populations living in the three Counties of Garissa, Isiolo, and Tana River have been exposed to RVFV infection. The significant risk factors associated with RVFV infection include age, being male, contact with cattle and donkeys, and contact with animals through birthing. Infection control measures should target these significant risk factors to reduce disease transmission in the area. The data generated by this study will be useful to public health officials in determining the disease risk levels of individuals living along the animal movement routes and in designing appropriate targeted infection control measures to prevent epidemics.</p>
