The average annual rainfall is between 400mm and 750mm with a mean annual temperature ranging between 30°C and 33°C.

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The County is generally dry and prone to prolonged severe drought causing migration of nomadic livestock farmers to the Tana River delta where there are several areas of forest, woodland, and grassland where water and pasture is abundant. There are several wild ungulates that graze in the area (e.g., 
 <italic>Damaliscus lunatus topi</italic>) as well as bird species. The major ethnic groups in this County are the

Tana River is an RVF hotspot affected by the 2006/7 RVF outbreak with 7 deaths and 16 reported probable cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The delta serves as a convergence zone for livestock, humans, and wildlife and a diversity of mosquito species including known vectors of RVFV that could facilitate transmission and exposure to RVFV infection. Flooding occurs, associated with occasional heavy rainfall in upstream areas of the Tana River.
