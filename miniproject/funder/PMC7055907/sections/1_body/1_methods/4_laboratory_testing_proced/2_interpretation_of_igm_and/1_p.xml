<p>Interpretations of results were done per the manufacturer instructions. The intensity of colors produced in the RVFV ELISAs were proportional to the amount of anti-RVFV IgG or IgM. The positive control optical density (OD) values ranged 0.81â€“1.7 for the test to be valid. Two intermediate OD values of the positive control were used for the calculation of the net mean OD value of the positive control (C++). The value was then used in the calculation of percentage positivity for the negative control (C-) and test serum using the formula as follows:</p>
