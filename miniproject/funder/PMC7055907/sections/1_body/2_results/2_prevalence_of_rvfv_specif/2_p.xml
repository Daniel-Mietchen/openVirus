<p>Of 1,210 participants, 36.4% (95% CI 33.8â€“39.2%) were RVFV IgG seropositive by ELISA and neutralization assay. RVFV (IgG) prevalence was 35.7% in Garissa, 38.8% in Isiolo, and 31% in Tana River. These prevalences were not statistically different (Chi square = 2.5, df = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.287). There was a non-significant variation in RVFV exposure as measured by IgG, across occupation (Wald Chi = 0.98, df = 4, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.913). Isiolo North, Ijara, and Fafi sub-counties (49%, 42% and 33%, respectively) had the highest prevalence of RVF compared to other sub-counties (Chi square = 8, df = 32,
