<p>Overall, 17 individuals (1.4%, 95%CI 0.8â€“2.3%) were IgM positive indicating an acute or recent RVFV infection. This proportion varied across the sub-counties, although not significantly (p = 0.830; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). None was IgM positive in Isiolo South and Lamu west. We also observed that this proportion was similar in females (1.2%) and males (1.8%). The incidence was 1.6% among those who had contact with cattle and 0.8% among those who did not have contact with cattle. Among those who made contact with donkeys the incidence was 2.5%, and was below 1% among those who did not make contact with donkeys.
