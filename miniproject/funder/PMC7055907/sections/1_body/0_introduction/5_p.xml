<p>The aims of this study were (i) to determine the extent of human exposure to RVFV infection in these zones with diverse ecologies, or communities, and (ii) to identify other contributing or confounding factors of infection. This is expected to provide an understanding of how the pastoral practices may cause human exposure to RVFV infection and influence disease circulation along animal movement and pastoral zones.</p>
