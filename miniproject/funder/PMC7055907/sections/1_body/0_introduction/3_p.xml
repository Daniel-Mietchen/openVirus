<p>Circulation of RVFV may expand worldwide due to demographic changes in the environment and climate variability in areas with close interaction between wildlife, livestock, vectors and human population [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Intense livestock production activities in close proximity to human populations and increased nomadic movement of livestock through areas with potential vector breeding sites during search of pasture and water, poses a threat of RVFV outbreaks to many countries [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In previous outbreaks, late warnings, especially after rains and flooding, did not help to prevent massive economic losses [
