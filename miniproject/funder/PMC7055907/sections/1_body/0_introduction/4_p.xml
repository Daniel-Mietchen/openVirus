<p>Periodic outbreaks of RVF have occurred in Kenya, but limited information is available on the actual spatial distribution of infection among humans during the inter-epidemic period in areas associated with nomadic livestock movements. RVFV seroprevalence studies in humans have been performed in Kenya since 1987. The general RVFV seroprevalences have varied from 0% to 32%, depending on year of sampling and/or geographical location [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In North-eastern Kenya there are many nomadic pastoral communities, and it has been shown that individuals with this lifestyle are at higher risk of infection with RVFV due to frequent contact with sick animals and animal products including blood, meat, and milk [

All counties in Kenya were recently classified into low, medium, or high risk for RVFV transmission based on the proportion of the national RVF epizootic years that the county has been involved in outbreaks since the first report of the virus in the district [
