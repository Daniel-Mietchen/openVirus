 <p>Timely forecasts of infectious disease transmission can help public health officials, health care providers, and individuals better prepare for and respond to disease outbreaks. Work in recent years has led to the development of a number of forecast systems. These systems provide important information on future disease incidence; however, all forecasting systems contain inaccuracies, or error. This error can be reduced by combining information from multiple forecasting systems into a superensemble using Bayesian averaging methods. Here we compare 21 forecasting systems for seasonal influenza outbreaks and use them together to create superensemble forecasts. The superensemble produces more accurate forecasts than the individual systems, improving our ability to predict the timing and severity of seasonal influenza outbreaks.</p>
