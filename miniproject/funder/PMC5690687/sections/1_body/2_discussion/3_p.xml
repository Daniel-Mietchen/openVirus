<p>We found that the timing of the forecast with respect to the outbreak peak was an important factor in determining relative forecast accuracy; consequently, stratifying superensemble weights by the actual lead time of the forecasts led to improvements in superensemble forecast accuracy. This improvement outweighed the gains made by simply eliminating the two most inconsistent forecast methods (pMCMC-SEIR and pMCMC-SEIRS). While the idealized process of weighting individual forecasts by actual forecast lead is not possible in real time, stratifying weights by forecast-predicted lead or simply calendar week, which can serve as real-time proxies for actual forecast lead, proved beneficial in improving forecast accuracy.</p>
