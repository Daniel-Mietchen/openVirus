<p>The 21 individual forecast methods compared in this study varied in their performance, as well as their reliability. The SEIRS dynamical model coupled with the EKF, EAKF and RHF ensemble filter methods were consistently among the better individual forecasts. Other forecast methods, namely pMCMC-SEIRS and pMCMC-SEIR, and to a lesser extent, BWO, performed inconsistently in that predictions were either among the best or the worst of the competing forecasts. This type of inconsistent performance presents a challenge to the superensemble approach, as the good forecasts can cause the forecast to receive a relatively high weighting in the superensemble; however, by identifying the circumstances that lead to differences in relative forecast performance, adaptive weighting can then be employed to variably weight an individual forecast method highly when it is prone to perform well and discount it in other circumstances. Here we found that the performance of individual forecast methods varied according to geographic location, influenza season, and the timing of the forecast.</p>
