<p>The MAEs of superensemble forecasts are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005801.t001">Table 1</xref>. On average, the baseline superensemble forecasts were more accurate at predicting the timing of the outbreak peak than any of the individual forecasts, with the exception of the EKF-SEIRS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005801.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Baseline superensemble forecasts of peak and total incidence had smaller MAE than all individual forecasts.
