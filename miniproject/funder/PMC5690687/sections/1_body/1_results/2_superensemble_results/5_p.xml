<p>Stratifying superensemble weights by forecast week or lead time relative to predicted peak, which can serve as real-time proxies for actual lead time, led to decreases in MAE for peak timing, but had only a small effect on forecasts of peak and total incidence. Meanwhile, stratifying by geographical region and population density led to small decreases in MAE for peak incidence, but degraded forecast accuracy for peak timing (
