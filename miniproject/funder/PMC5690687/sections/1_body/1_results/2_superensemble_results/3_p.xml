<p>We then stratified the weights by geographical region, forecast week, lead time relative to predicted peak, lead time relative to observed outbreak peak, population size and population density. These variables were pre-specified on the basis of previous work indicating that they may influence the accuracy of individual forecast methods (for example [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). The MAEs of the stratified superensemble forecasts are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005801.t001">Table 1</xref>. For both peak timing and peak incidence, stratifying by lead time relative to observed peak led to the greatest improvements in forecast performance, decreasing MAE by 0.4 weeks for peak timing and 0.06 ILI+ for peak incidence compared to the baseline superensemble forecast. On average, this forecast outperformed individual forecasts of peak timing and peak incidence at all times during the course of the outbreak (
