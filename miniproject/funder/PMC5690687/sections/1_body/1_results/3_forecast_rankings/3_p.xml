<p>In forecasts of peak incidence, the baseline superensemble forecast gave the best prediction 10.8% of the time, which was more frequent than all individual forecasts except BWO, which was the highest ranked method for 17.1% of predictions. The superensemble was among the 4 worst forecasts less than 0.5% of the time, compared to 17.7% of BWO forecasts (
