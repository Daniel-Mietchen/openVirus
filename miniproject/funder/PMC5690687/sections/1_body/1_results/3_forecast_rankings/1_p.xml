<p>In addition to comparing forecast errors averaged over many forecasts, we also compiled a ranking of individual forecast outcomes. For each forecast, we ranked the 21 point-estimates from the individual forecasts and the resulting baseline superensemble forecast from 1 (lowest absolute error) through 22 (highest absolute error) and summed the frequency of each ranking (
