<p>For the ensemble and particle filter systems, observations of influenza incidence from the beginning of the season to the week of forecast initiation are used to optimize each of the 4 mathematical models. The optimized model is then run to the end of the season to generate a weekly forecast of influenza incidence, as measured by ILI+, an estimate of influenza positive patients per 100 patient visits to outpatient health care providers (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>). For the BWO, only the most recent 8 weeks are used for training. A forecast is then generated as a weighted average of historical ILI+ epidemic trajectories (see
