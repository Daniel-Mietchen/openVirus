<p>Here, we compare the accuracy of a suite of 21 competing forecast methods, as well as a superensemble forecast, in retrospective forecasts of influenza epidemics (See 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005801.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). We group the 21 individual forecasts into three categories: ensemble filter systems; particle filter systems; and a statistical model. The ensemble-based filter systems include three types of filters: Ensemble Kalman Filter (EKF), Ensemble adjustment Kalman Filter, (EAKF) and Rank Histogram Filter (RHF). Two particle filters are used: a basic particle filter (PF) and a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (pMCMC). The five filter methods are each coupled with four standard compartmental models of disease transmission: SIR, SEIR, SIRS and SEIRS (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Methods</xref>). For the final individual forecast method, we use a statistical model called Bayesian Weighted Outbreaks (BWO).
