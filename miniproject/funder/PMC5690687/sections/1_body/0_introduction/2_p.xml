<p>While some forecast methods may be consistently superior to others, the relative performance of individual forecast methods can also vary according to the specifics of the population, location, or outbreak of interest. For example, a forecast method developed for a densely populated urban area may be less accurate in a sparse rural setting. Alternatively, some forecast methods may be better suited for prediction of outbreaks that are smaller or larger than typically observed. The optimal forecast method may also depend on when in the season the forecast is being generated.</p>
