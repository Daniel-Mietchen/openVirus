<p>We produced weekly forecasts of three target metrics for each influenza outbreak: the highest observed weekly ILI+ (peak incidence); the week during which peak ILI+ occurred (peak week); and the total ILI+ over the influenza season, which we define as a 20-week period beginning on the 45
 <sup>th</sup> calendar week of the year (total incidence).
