<p>The baseline superensemble forecasts were made by applying a single set of superensemble weights across all locations and times within an influenza season. However, based on previous analyses of individual forecast system performance (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), we hypothesized that superensemble performance would improve if superensemble weights were stratified by the following variables: calendar week of forecast, lead time relative to forecast peak (weeks between the week of forecast initiation and the predicted peak), geographic region, population size, and population density.
