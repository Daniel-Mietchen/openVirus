<p>Superensemble weights for season 
 <italic>N</italic> are trained using individual forecasts from 2003–2004 through season 
 <italic>N-1</italic>. The set of BWO training forecasts, 
 <italic>f’</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>BWO</italic>,
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>, are produced using a leave-one-out approach for training seasons 1 through N-1. That is, training forecasts for each season from 1 through N-1 were constructed using trajectories using all other seasons between 1 and N-1. The number and diversity of candidate trajectories increases over time, as each subsequent year adds 145 additional ILI+ trajectories to the pool. The model-filter forecasts do not use historical observations, and thus do not require a leave-one-out approach for training forecasts.
