<p>The combined model-filter system recursively updates the model state variable and parameter estimates with each new weekly ILI+ observation. Through this process, these estimates of the observed and unobserved variables and parameters values are nudged closer to their true values. Following the assimilation of the most recent weekly ILI+ observation, the optimized set of model simulations is propagated forward in free simulation through the remainder of the season, producing a forecast of future ILI+ observations, from which we calculate the predicted timing and magnitude of peak influenza incidence, and total incidence.</p>
