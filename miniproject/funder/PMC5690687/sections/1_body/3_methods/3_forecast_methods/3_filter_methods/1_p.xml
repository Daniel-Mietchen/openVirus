<p>The mathematical models described above are coupled with filter methods for the weekly assimilation of ILI+ observations and optimization of the model state variables and parameters. These filters use Bayesian inference to calculate the posterior conditional distribution of parameters and state variables given observed ILI+, based on the prior distribution of the model ensemble and the conditional distribution of observed ILI+ given model parameters and state variables.</p>
