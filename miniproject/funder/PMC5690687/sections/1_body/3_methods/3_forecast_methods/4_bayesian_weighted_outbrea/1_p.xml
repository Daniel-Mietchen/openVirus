<p>The final forecast method, which we call Bayesian weighted outbreaks (BWO), is a statistical method that uses Bayesian model averaging to describe the trajectory of ILI+ for the outbreak of interest as a weighted average of outbreak trajectories from prior seasons. This method has been used in weather forecasting[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and has previously been adapted to forecast dengue outbreaks[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The weights assigned to candidate trajectories are determined based on the likelihood of the ILI+ values observed for the outbreak in progress given ILI+ during the same time period (weeks 
 <italic>t</italic>-7 through 
 <italic>t</italic>) in the candidate trajectories (see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005801.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for further details). The forecast trajectory of ILI+ obtained by taking the weighted average is used to predict peak timing, peak incidence and total incidence in the outbreak of interest.
