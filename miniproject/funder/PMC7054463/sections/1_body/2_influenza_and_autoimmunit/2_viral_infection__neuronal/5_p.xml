<p>This interpretation is supported by findings that anti-NMDAR encephalitis may be seasonal, with a peak in incidence during winter (
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>), potentially converging with seasonality of influenza. Recent research found that MƒÅori and Pacific Island populations have higher incidence and potentially more severe outcomes of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, a finding of significance given that population's apparent increased susceptibility to severe influenza infection (
