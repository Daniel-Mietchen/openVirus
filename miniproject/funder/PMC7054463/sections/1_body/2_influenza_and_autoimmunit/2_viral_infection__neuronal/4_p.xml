<p>Anti-NMDAR encephalitis shares clinical features with EL in children, and indeed NMDAR antibodies have been reported in children with contemporary EL (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), this suggests a potential relationship between influenza infection, NSAbs and psychosis in anti-NMDAR encephalitis. [The association between influenza and EL is, however, highly controversial, not least because of temporal and geographical discrepancies between the start of the pandemic and the first recorded EL cases, as well as studies on post-mortem tissue which have frequently failed to find evidence of influenza virus; but given historical issues with case ascertainment and storage of biological samples potentially undermining efforts at viral detection, the association remains a plausible hypothesis for some authors (
