<p>Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) frequently presents with acute psychosis in adults (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). Autoantibodies to a variety of CNS cell surface antigens (neuronal surface autoantibodies; NSAbs) have been implicated in AE, including the NMDAR and more rarely LGI1, CASPR2, AMPAR, GABA
 <sub>A</sub>R, GABA
 <sub>B</sub>R, D2R, DPPX, mGluR5, and GlyR (

 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>). Of the autoimmune encephalitides associated with the above antigens, NMDAR encephalitis presents most frequently with psychosis. The typical pattern includes prodromal malaise, or influenza-like symptoms, before the emergence of psychiatric symptoms. 4% of patients show isolated psychotic episodes at presentation or relapse (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>) and behavioral and cognitive impairments including psychosis are predominant early symptoms (

 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>). Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is caused by IgG antibodies directed against an epitope on the N-terminal domain of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA glutamate receptor (
