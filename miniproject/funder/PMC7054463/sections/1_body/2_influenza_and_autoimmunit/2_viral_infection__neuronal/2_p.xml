<p>Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is associated with ovarian teratoma in under a third of cases. An intriguing association between infection and the development of the disorder became apparent when it was observed that a number of patients experiencing “relapses” following herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NMDAR antibodies, suggesting that these “relapses” were in fact a postinfectious AE, rather than the result of reinfection or viral reactivation (

 <sub>A</sub> and GABA
 <sub>B</sub> receptors, the AMPA receptor and the dopamine D2 receptor; reviewed in (
