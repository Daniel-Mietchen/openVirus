    <p>- Do influenza MIA models, or models of adulthood influenza infection, demonstrate an antibody response to brain antigens including, for example, the NMDAR?</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>- Is there an epidemiological association between influenza vaccination (maternal, childhood or adulthood; seasonal or pandemic) with differential risk of subsequent development of psychotic disorder?</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>- Is antiviral use in pregnancy associated with a reduced risk of psychotic disorders in offspring?</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>- Is the acute response to influenza infection or vaccination in healthy individuals instructive for understanding the development of psychosis? Relevant approaches could include neuroimaging and behavioral testing following vaccination, similar to paradigms using LPS or typhoid vaccine administration (

    <p>- Can an 
     <italic>in silico</italic> approach be used to assess the plausibility of the molecular mimicry hypothesis, potentially assessing linear or structural overlap between viral proteome and schizophrenia-relevant proteins?

 </boxed-text> Future immunity-focused research on schizophrenia and influenza should further explore the relationship between infection and the innate and adaptive immune response in schizophrenia using animal models and large-scale serological studies in patients at different stages of disease. To date, MIA models typically include very little deep immunophenotyping, and discussion of the adaptive immune response in these models has been almost entirely lacking. Standardised and more sensitive testing technologies are required, including improved noninvasive methods to assess central neuroinflammation in humans and nonhuman animals (
