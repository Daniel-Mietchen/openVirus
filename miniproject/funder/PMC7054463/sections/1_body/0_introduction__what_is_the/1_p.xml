<p>Schizophrenia risk is associated with a variety of environmental and genetic factors (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), including those associated with immunity and inflammation (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicate loci at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which encodes multiple genes involved in immunity such as the 
 <italic>human leukocyte antigen</italic> (
 <italic>HLA</italic>) genes (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and complement component 4 (C4) (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), among others, and enhancers related to B-lymphocyte lineages (CD19 and CD20 lines) involved in acquired/adaptive immunity (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Overall there is strong evidence supporting the involvement of specific immune variants in schizophrenia risk (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), some evidence of convergence across genomics, transcriptomic, and methylomic processes (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but conflicting evidence for both (i) enrichment of specific immune cell types or pathways (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) and (ii) for genetic overlap between SZ and specific immune diseases (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
