<p>Other animal studies have demonstrated associations between maternal influenza infection and schizophrenia-related neurotransmitter dysfunction including elevated serotonin 5-HT2A receptor expression in the frontal cortex (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>), reductions of cerebellar serotonin levels at postpartum days (P) 14 and P35 (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>), downregulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 in the frontal cortex (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>), and decrease in dopamine levels at P14 and P56 (

 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>), and dynamic changes in volumes of multiple brain structures (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>), including adult changes which can be prevented by periadolescent administration of antipsychotic medication (at nonantipsychotic dose equivalents) (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). Supporting the translational relevance of these studies, there is an emerging parallel literature in humans suggesting that early immune activation affects subsequent brain development and behavior: for example, maternal IL-6 levels during pregnancy predicted greater neonatal amygdala volumes and connectivity, which in turn predicted poorer impulse control at two years of age (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>); complementary results for amygdala connectivity and internalizing behaviors have been reported for maternal cortisol levels (
