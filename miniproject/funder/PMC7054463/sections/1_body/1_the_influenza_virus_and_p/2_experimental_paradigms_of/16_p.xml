<p>In terms of potential downstream consequences of such foetal microglial activation, there is an emerging literature implicating the role of microglia in shaping brain development, including the potential for synaptic pruning 
 <italic>via</italic> the full or partial engulfment [phago- or trogocytosis (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>)] and putative degradation of synaptic inputs, a process mediated at least in the rodent visual thalamus in a complement and activity-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>), which may also involve other molecular mediators such as TREM2 for example or the fractalkine receptor [CX3CR1; (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>)] [potential mechanisms are reviewed in (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>)]. Given the well-replicated finding of reduced dendritic spine number in schizophrenia (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>), and evidence that patient-derived microglia-like cells are capable of synapse elimination at least 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>), it is plausible also that maternal infection-induced foetal microglial activation could lead to later psychopathology through upregulation of synaptic pruning mechanisms (or conversely, loss of them: for example, early in development, microglia contact of neurons actually stimulates dendritic spine formation (
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>) suggesting the underexplored possibility that different pathologies play out in a potentially time- and region-specific manner).
