 <italic>Gene Expression</italic>: the breadth of gene expression changes was greater the later in embryonic development infection occurred; for example embryonic day 16 or 18 (E16 or E18) infection disrupted more genes, across more brain regions, than did E7 infection. Furthermore, infection at later embryonic stages disrupted expression of genes involved in myelination and implicated in schizophrenia risk.
