<p>MIA may lead straightforwardly to damage to the foetal brain during the early stages of neurodevelopment (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), but may also provide entry into a deviant trajectory of neural development which predisposes offspring to behavioral deficits depending on the intensity of the infection and when in gestation it occurs [early vs. lateâ€”and potentially as late as the lactation stage (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>)]. MIA-associated abnormalities have been described, sometimes inconsistently, for multiple brain cell types, all of which are implicated across psychiatric disorders from postmortem data and genetic studies to a greater or lesser extent: Schwann cells (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), astrocytes and microglia (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), hippocampal GABAergic cells (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>), dopaminergic neurons (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>), and parvalbumin interneurons (
