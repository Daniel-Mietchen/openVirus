<p>For infection to be successful, hemagglutinin binds the influenza virus to its receptors, sialyloligosaccharides, on the host cell surface. The viral envelope and the host cell membrane fuse giving the viral RNA access to the host cell (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Neuraminidase facilitates virus release (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Following the production of viral particles in the nucleus of the host cell, the host cell lyses and dies (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Protective immune responses from the cell occur; the viral hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix 2 (M2) proteins are targeted by antibodies; matrix 1 (M1) proteins are targeted by T cells (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>); and nucleoproteins are targeted by T cells (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>) and nonneutralizing antibodies (
