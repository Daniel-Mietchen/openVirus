<p>ART for mothers was the biggest cost driver, consistent with findings in CÃ´te d'Ivoire where ART cost for Option B+ contributed 68% of the annual treatment cost [

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and a systematic review conducted by Galarraga [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The percent contribution in these studies are comparable to those of the current study although there are slight differences in the cost ranges due to possible variations in ART producers and suppliers. The cost of ART is met by the provider and given free to the mothers and their infants. The cost of ART has been significantly reduced over the past decades, but there is still a need for further reduction to prevent ARV shortages [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which could interrupt provision of Option B+ services. Interruption in the provision of services discourages mothers, which would subsequently result in mother-baby pairs lost to follow-up [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. ART remains a cornerstone in PMTCT of HIV, and the government should therefore ensure availability of funds to procure sufficient ARVs.
