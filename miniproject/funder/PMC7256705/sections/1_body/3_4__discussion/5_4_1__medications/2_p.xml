<p>Cotrimoxazole, which plays a key role in preventing opportunistic infections and malaria [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], had a percent contribution of 5.5% to the total mean cost. It is prescribed to HIV-positive mothers and their infants as a prophylaxis. Cotrimoxazole is cost effective in averting opportunistic infections [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Consequently, higher costs of treating opportunistic infections are averted. The cost found by this study is affordable though slightly higher compared to other literature. A study conducted in Ethiopia with findings closely comparable to the current results combined the cost of all drugs used in Option B+ [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other literature only considered costs of Cotrimoxazole use by HIV-exposed infants, whereas the current study evaluated costs incurred on both mothers and their infants [
