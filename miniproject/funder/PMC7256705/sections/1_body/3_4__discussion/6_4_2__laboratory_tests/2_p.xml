<p>Monitoring the mothers' CD4 cell counts was a big cost driver. It is important to note that it is not a requirement for a mother to start on Option B+; however, CD4 cell count was the cornerstone in assessing HIV disease progression, making clinical decisions, and monitoring the response to ART [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, since WHO recommended the use of viral load testing as the preferred monitoring tool for people on ART in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], many countries have adopted it [

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Viral load testing is more costly than CD4 cell count, and this is anticipated to increase the cost of monitoring mothers on Option B+. Similar to this study, laboratory testing was the second largest cost component of direct costs for providing key services at the facility level to prevent MTCT of HIV in Ghana [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and in a systematic review by Galarraga et al. [
