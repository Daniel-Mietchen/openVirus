<p>Significant costs (12.4%) were incurred on laboratory tests. Infant HIV testing (HIV DNA PCR) was the biggest cost driver among the laboratory tests. The cost incurred on the initial HIV DNA PCR was higher than that of the follow-up PCR. This might be attributed to the fact that more mothers bring their infants for the initial PCR as opposed to the follow-up one [

This could be because the initial HIV molecular test is performed when the exposed infant is six weeks old or the earliest opportunity thereafter and coincides with the second immunization visit for the baby and the mother's postnatal care visit [

The mothers are therefore motivated to do the initial HIV DNA PCR. Studies have reported that some mothers do not return or do not bring their babies with them for subsequent HIV tests if the initial HIV DNA PCR is negative [
