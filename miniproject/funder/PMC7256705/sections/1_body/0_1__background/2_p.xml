<p>In 2013, the WHO revised the 2012 guidelines and made new recommendations on the use of ARVs for PMTCT of HIV [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The revised guidelines included a new, third option (Option B+) which recommended lifelong ART for all HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women irrespective of CD4 cell count or clinical stage. This recommendation was identified as high priority for countries with high HIV prevalence and fertility rates like Uganda [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 2012, Uganda had a total fertility rate of 6.2 (6.2 children per woman aged 15-49 years) and HIV prevalence of 7.3% [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Much of this progress is attributed to the adoption of Option B+ in 2012, which was initiated in the central districts of Uganda and was extended to the entire country by 2013. This led to a dramatic increase in the number of HIV-positive pregnant and breastfeeding women able to access ART. For example, the number of HIV-positive mothers who received ART for PMTCT increased from 112,909 in 2014 to 117,854 in June 2016 [
