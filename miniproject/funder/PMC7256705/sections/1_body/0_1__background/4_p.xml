<p>As advances in HIV treatment are embraced by national healthcare systems globally, it is essential for program managers and policy makers to know the long-term trade-offs between their costs and benefits. To this end, cost analysis of retention in Option B+ programs has been conducted for generalized epidemics in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa, cost studies highlighted the importance of HIV prevalence and existing resources as an important determinant in resource use in relation to PMTCT [

They concluded that Option B+ interventions are inexpensive and compared favourably to other interventions with respect to efficacy [

To the researchers' knowledge, as implementation and scale up of Option B+ continues in Uganda, no studies have been conducted to assess costs and cost drivers associated with the provision of Option B+ to mother-baby pairs in Uganda. Therefore, this study set out to determine costs and cost drivers of providing Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs over a two-year period (2014-2015) in selected health facilities in Jinja district, Uganda.
