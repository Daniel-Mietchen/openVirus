<p>The mean cost for providing Option B+ services per mother-baby pair per health facility was USD 441.9. The three major cost drivers of providing Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs were ART for the mothers, facility personnel, and facility-level monitoring and quality improvement. We recommend that sufficient funds should always be in place to ensure that ARVs are continually in stock, laboratory tests are performed, health facility personnel are remunerated, and quality improvement activities are conducted. In addition, efforts to lower cost of ART for PMTCT would make delivery of Option B+ affordable and sustainable.</p>
