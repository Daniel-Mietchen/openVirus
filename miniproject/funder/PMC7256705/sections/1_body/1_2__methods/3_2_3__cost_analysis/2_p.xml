<p>Costing was done using the ingredient-based approach, i.e., costing each component of an activity, including capital and recurrent costs [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This approach identifies each resource input required and values its market or economic costs [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Main ingredients and costs in providing Option B+ services to mother-baby pairs were identified, and a unit cost was calculated. We obtained the mean facility total cost of Option B+ and mean facility cost per cost category by averaging the respective cost over the four health facilities. Overall and cost category mean unit costs per mother-baby pair were calculated as a ratio of respective mean facility costs and average mother-baby pairs per facility. The study estimated program financial costs, reflecting actual costs derived from market prices. All analyses were done using Microsoft Excel.
