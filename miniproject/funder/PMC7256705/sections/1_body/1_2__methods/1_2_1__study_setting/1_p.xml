 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The study was conducted in four HC IVs: Bugembe, Mpumudde, Budondo, and Walukuba. These sites were chosen as they had the required data, were among the first facilities to implement Option B+ in the district, and were using the innovative approach detailed below. The HCs were also chosen due to their geographic diversityâ€”they are located in urban (Walukuba and Mpumudde), periurban (Bugembe), and rural (Budondo) areas of the district. All these sites provide PMTCT services. In Jinja district, implementation of Option B+ services started in April 2013. The district uses an innovative interdisciplinary approach engaging healthcare workers (HCWs), village health team members, mentor mothers, and linkage facilitators in the provision of Option B+ services. Mentor mothers are volunteers living with HIV who are trained to provide psychosocial support and health education and to empower pregnant and breastfeeding mothers to improve the health of their families and themselves. Linkage facilitators are campaigners living with HIV who are trained to create awareness and increase uptake of HIV/AIDS services.
