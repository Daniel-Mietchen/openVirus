<p>The study team used program data which gave the real context of providing Option B+ to mother-baby pairs by program implementers. Jinja district has five HC IVs, but the study team failed to access cost data for one of these HC IVs. Nevertheless, the four HCs that were studied gave a representative evaluation. Therefore, this information may be applicable to other HC IVs in the region. However, findings from this study may not be applicable to health facilities that are at a lower or higher level than HC IVs.</p>
