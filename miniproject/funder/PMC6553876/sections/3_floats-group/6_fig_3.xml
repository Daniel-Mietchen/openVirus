  <title>Critical residues for binding of dengue serotype-specific macaque antibodies.</title>
  <p>(A) Critical resides (green spheres) are mapped on the mature E protein dimer structure (PDB, 1UZG). Domain I is red, domain II yellow, domain III blue, and fusion loop cyan. The asymmetric monomer rotated 180 degrees is shown in gray. (B) The key residues of the d511/d628 epitope (shown on PDB, 1OK8). D329 (BC loop) and K361 (DE loop) are on the lateral ridge of DENV2 domain III, which is a reported epitope region of mouse anti-dengue neutralizing antibodies. Bottom panel: side view of the mature virus capsid indicates that the residues D329 and K361 display the side chains on the external surface of domain III (PDB, 3J27). (C) The key residues of the d182 epitope (PDB, 3G7T). T329 is in the BC loop of DENV1 domain III. V300 is in the DI-III hinge. (D) The key residues of the d559 epitope (PDB, 1OK8, modified). Y81 and K83 are in the bc loop of DENV4 domain II. Atoms colored red for O, blue for N. Molecular graphic images were produced using UCSF Chimera (

(E-H) Neutralization percentage of the indicated wild type (WT) DENV reporter virus particles, and its critical amino acid residue substitution mutants. Antibodies d182 (E), d511 (F), d628 (G), and d559 (H) were tested at the concentration of 3 Î¼g/ml. The assays were performed in triplicates and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism.
