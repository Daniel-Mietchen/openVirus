  <title>Flowchart of the antibody isolation and cloning process.</title>
  <p>Single antibody-secreting B cells were isolated from rhesus macaque immunized with the dengue vaccine as reported previously. Two vaccine candidates, tetravalent dengue live attenuated virus vaccine, and tetravalent recombinant dengue subunit vaccine (DEN-80E) was administered using different regimens. All animals received the live attenuated vaccine subcutaneously (SC) at 0 weeks and then received subunit DEN-80E vaccine intramuscularly (IM) at 16 weeks. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated after 7 days of boost. Antibody-secreting cells were sorted as single cells into individual wells of a 96-well plate. Antibody variable region genes were amplified and cloned into the antibody expression vector of human IgH, Igκ, and Igλ respectively. The heavy-chain and light-chain expression vectors were co-transfected into HEK293-F cells for transient expression in 12-well plate (1.5 ml). The binding ELISA was performed with the supernatant antibodies for the initial binding screen. The positive binding antibodies were then expressed in large-scale volume (20 ml), and purified by protein A chromatography. The characterization of the antibodies was confirmed by binding titration to the antigen and neutralizing assay to the dengue virus (DENV).</p>
