  <title>Characterization of dengue targeting monoclonal antibodies from antibody-secreting B cells of the rhesus macaque.</title>
  <p>(A) The longitudinal geometric mean neutralization titers of the rhesus sera for DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4, respectively. The LiCor
   <sub>50</sub> Titers indicate the dilution rate of the sera maintains 50% of the neutralizing activity. (B) The pie chart shows the distribution of antibodies that bound DEN-80E strongly, weakly, or not at all, as determined by ELISA screening. The antibodies were considered to be strong binders when OD
   <sub>450</sub> was above or equal to 0.5 (3%), weak binders when OD
   <sub>450</sub> was between 0.1 and 0.5 (14%), and non-binders when OD
   <sub>450</sub> was below 0.1 (83%). (C) Percentage of binders specific for single and multiple dengue serotypes among antibodies binding DEN-80E. (D-I) Reactivity for DEN-80E binding in ELISA screening for antibodies binding DEN-80E of DENV1 (D), DENV2 (E), DENV3 (F), DENV4 (G), 2 or 3 dengue serotypes (H), all four dengue serotypes (I). The X-axis indicates individual antibodies, the black dotted lines indicate the cut-off OD
   <sub>450</sub> of 0.1, and NC means negative control.
