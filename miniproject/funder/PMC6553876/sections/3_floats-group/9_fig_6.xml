  <title>The cross-reactivity of antibody d448 to flaviviruses.</title>
  <p>(A) Binding of d448 to the E proteins of flaviviruses was analyzed by ELISA. E proteins (100 ng/well) were coated on 96-well plate. Serial dilution of the d448 antibody was added in the coated plate for the detection of the binding, and measurement of the EC
   <sub>50</sub>. (B) The neutralization activity of d448 was determined by assaying Vero cell infectivity in the presence of serial dilutions of purified antibody. DENV2 (16681 strain) was used as a positive control. Zika virus (SMGC-1 strain), yellow Fever virus (17D strain), and West Nile virus (Kunjin, MRM61C strain) were used in the study.
