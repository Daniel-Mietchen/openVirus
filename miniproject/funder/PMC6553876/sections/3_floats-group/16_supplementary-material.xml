  <title>The macaque mAb d462 and chimpanzee mAb 5H2 bind to overlapped epitope on DEN4-80E.</title>
  <p>The real-time competitive binding of d462 and 5H2 was determined using an epitope binning format on Octet RED96 biosensor. The mAb d462 (A) or 5H2 (B) was first captured using protein A biosensor (step 1), followed by a blocking antibody to saturate the unoccupied sensors (step 2). The DEN4-80E was incubated to bind to the captured antibody (step 3). Finally, a secondary antibody was allowed to bind to the DEN4-80 on the sensors (step4). The binding of the secondary antibody will be blocked if it binds to the overlapped epitope with the captured antibody. An isotype control monoclonal antibody d182 was used as negative control (green line). The DENV4 specific mAb d559 was used as positive control (brown line). The d462 (blue line), 5H2 (red line) bind to DEN4-80E competitively.</p>
