  <title>SPR Sensorgrams used to determine kinetic constants of neutralizing mAbs.</title>
  <p>Surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams show the antibody binding to the immobilized DEN-80E (DEN1-80E, DEN2-80E, DEN3-80E, and DEN4-80E). The y-axis shows the binding of resonance units (RU), and the x-axis shows the elapsed time (second, s). The antibodies were serially diluted 2-fold down with concentrations of 200â€“6.25 nM. The kinetic analysis was performed at a panel of different concentration of the antibodies with a contact time of 300s followed by 300s dissociation. All measurements were performed at least three times. Data were analyzed by using BIA evaluation software 4.1, and fitted to 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The antibodies are d182, d448, d462, d511, d559, d622, and d628 as indicated.</p>
