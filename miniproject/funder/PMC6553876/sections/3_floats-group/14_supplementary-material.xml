  <title>Epitope mapping of the potent neutralizing antibodies.</title>
  <p>The ‘Shotgun Mutagenesis’ epitope mapping was performed by subjecting expression constructs for prM/E from all four DENV serotypes to high-throughput mutagenesis to generate comprehensive mutation libraries. The library consists of random mutations (to alanine, and analnie to serine) introduced at each residue of the prM/E polyprotein, while for DENV1 (strain WestPac), DENV2 (strain 16681), DENV3 (strain CH53489), and DENV4 (strain 341750). For screening, the DENV prM/E library was expressed in HEK-293T cells and assayed by immunofluorescence for the testing mAb binding to each clone. The antibody reactivity against each mutant protein clone was calculated relative to wild-type protein reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls (% Wildtype Reactivity). The mAb d182 (A) was mapped on the DENV1 library, d511 (D), d559 (E) and d628 (F) on the DENV2 library, and d462 (C), d448 (B), on the DENV4 library. The positive binding antibodies are D004, D449, D168, D413, D341, and D195 as indicated. Error bars represent the average of three measurements ± SD.</p>
