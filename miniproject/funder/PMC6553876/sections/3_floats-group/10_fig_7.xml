  <title>Germline usage and the mutation analysis of the antibodies.</title>
  <p>General repertoire properties of the rhesus macaque antibodies, including germline gene usage, germline gene divergence and the length of heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3). The analysis was performed using IgBLAST with IMGT V domain delineation (

The entire panel contains all isolated mAbs and neutralizing mAbs. (A) Heavy chain V-gene germline usage of total mAbs. (B) Kappa chain V-gene germline usage of total mAbs. (C) Lambda chain V-gene germline usage of total mAbs. (D) The natively paired V-gene germline usage of total mAbs. All the heavy chains are associated with their natively paired light chain (kappa or lambda). (E) The germline mutation rate of the native antibodies. Each dot represents one unique sequence. The mean value and the standard deviation are indicated with the black bar, no significant difference regarding the germline gene divergence of the total mAbs and the neutralizing mAbs. The labels are VH-Total: the heavy chain of the total mAbs; VH-Neu: the heavy chain of the neutralizing mAbs; VL-Total: the light chain of the total mAbs; VL-Neu: the light chain of the neutralizing mAbs. (F) The heavy chain CDR3 length of the cloned mAbs (blue), and the neutralizing mAbs (red). (G) The heavy chain V germline distribution of the cloned antibodies (blue), and the neutralizing antibodies (red). The percentage of antibodies with the VH4 germline is shown.
