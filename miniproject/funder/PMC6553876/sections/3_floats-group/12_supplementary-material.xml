  <title>Analysis of binding properties of purified antibodies.</title>
  <p>The DEN-80E is coated on the plate for ELISA binding titration. The purified antibodies were diluted, and incubated with the coated antigen. The binding of the antibodies were detected by OD
   <sub>450</sub> with duplication. The curves were fitted by the one-site specific binding model.
