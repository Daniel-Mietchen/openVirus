  <title>Neutralization activity and kinetic analysis of the potent neutralizing antibodies.</title>
  <p>(A) Neutralization activity of the indicated antibodies to DENV. The virus was mixed with 5-fold serial dilutions of antibodies. Then neutralization activity was evaluated by micro-neutralization assay in duplicates. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. The curves are fitted by the Response—Variable slope (four parameters) model. (B) Binding kinetics of selected antibodies on immobilized DEN-80E. The graphs show kinetic binding of six potent neutralizing antibodies at the concentration of 25 nM to immobilized antigens DEN1-80E, DEN2-80E, DEN3-80E, and DEN4-80E as indicated.</p>
