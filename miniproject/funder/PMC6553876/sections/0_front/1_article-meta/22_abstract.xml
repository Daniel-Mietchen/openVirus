 <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a leading cause of human illness in the tropics and subtropics, with about 40% of the world’s population living in areas at risk for infection. There are four DENV serotypes. Patients who have previously been infected by one dengue serotype may develop more severe symptoms such as bleeding and endothelial leakage upon secondary infection with another dengue serotype. This study reports the extensive cloning and analysis of 780 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from single B cells of rhesus macaques after immunization with an experimental dengue vaccine. We identified a panel of potent neutralizing mAbs with diverse epitopes on the DENV envelope protein. Antibodies in this panel were found to bind to the lateral ridge of DIII, the I-III hinge, the bc loop adjacent to the fusion loop of DII, and the β-strands and the loops of DI. We also isolated one mAb (d448) that can neutralize all four dengue serotypes and binds to a novel epitope at the interface of the DENV envelope and membrane proteins. Further investigation of these neutralizing monoclonal antibodies is warranted for better vaccine efficacy evaluation and vaccine design.</p>
