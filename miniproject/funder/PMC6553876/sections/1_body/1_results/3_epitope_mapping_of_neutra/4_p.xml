<p>Strikingly, antibody d448 showed cross-reactivity to all four serotypes and has an epitope composed of five key amino acids—D215, P219, M237, Q256, and G266 (Green spheres, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5A</xref> in DENV4). Those key amino acids are located at the buried interface between the M protein and the ectodomain of the E protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5A, 5B and 5C</xref>). Four out of the five key amino acids of the antibody d448 epitope are conserved among the four dengue serotypes. DENV4 has a methionine (M) at position 237. The other three serotypes have leucine (L) at position 237 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). A direct interaction occurs between the two charged amino acids, residue D215 on E protein and R38 in the amphipathic perimembrane helix of one M protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). It has been reported that the M and E proteins contact mainly through three distinct hydrophobic interaction pockets on the E protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition to the key amino acid D215, all the key amino acid residues for mAb d448 binding are in contact with the three hydrophobic pockets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Hydrophobic pocket 2 is composed of H209 and T212 on E protein. Hydrophobic pocket 3 is composed of T206 and H261 on E protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). The key amino acid residue of the d448 binding epitope, G266, is located between hydrophobic pocket 2 and pocket 3. G266 creates a barrier for the two hydrophobic pockets, contacting with H7 and T19 on M protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Binding of antibody d488 to the epitope directly blocks both pocket 2 and pocket 3 on the E protein. Residues P219, M237, and Q256 in the antibody d488 epitope are adjacent to the hydrophobic pocket 1. This pocket is composed of L216, L218, and M260 on E protein and the V2 on M protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Based on the location of those key residues, we propose that antibody d448 interaction with the key structural components in dengue viral coat proteins disturbs the M-E interaction and inhibits virus ‘breathing’ or maturation. To confirm the epitope of d448, we generated the DENV2-RVPs and DENV4-RVPs with Alanine substitutions (D215A, P219A, L/M237A, Q256A, and G266A). However, two DENV2-RVP constructs (Q256A, G266A) and one DENV4-RVP construct (D215A) cannot produce infectious particles with detectable reporter signal, and these were excluded in the neutralization assay (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>, mutations of the residues in the epitope dramatically abolished the neutralizing activity of d448, when compared to the wild type RVP. These results validate the epitope of d448.
