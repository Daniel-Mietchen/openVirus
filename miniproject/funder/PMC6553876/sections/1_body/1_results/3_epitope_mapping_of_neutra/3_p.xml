<p>Antibody d462, a cross-reactive antibody, recognized the F

 <sub>0</sub> Î²-sheets and the G

 <sub>0</sub> loop in DI of DENV4 (V160, V173, D177) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). It has been reported that binding of chimpanzee antibody 5H2 inhibits the fusogenic conformational change in the adjacent monomer on the virus surface [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Antibody d462 has epitopes overlapping those of antibody 5H2 on DENV4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). We measured the ability of each of the two mAbs to inhibit binding of the other to DEN4-80E using bio-layer interferometry. While d462 completely inhibited binding of 5H2 to DEN4-80E (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s006">S6A Fig</xref>), 5H2 also inhibited binding of d462 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), confirming that the two antibodies share overlapped epitopes on DEN4-80E. Antibody d462 may neutralize DENV4 by preventing fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, as does the chimpanzee antibody 5H2. Although the key amino acids identified for the epitope of d462 on DENV4 are not identical among the four DENV serotypes, DENV3 and DENV4 share the same amino acid at position 160 (V), and very similar types of amino acids in two other locations (V vs. A at 173 and D vs. E in 177) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The similarity in the amino acids at key positions may provide a structural basis for the cross-reactivity of d462 with DENV3 and DENV4 serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To validate the epitope in a functional assay, we measured the neutralizing activity of d462 to DENV4-RVPs with residue substitutions (V160A/G, V173A/G, D177G) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s009">S1 Table</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, V160 is the critical residue in the epitope, substitution of V160 to either alanine or glycine abolished the neutralizing activity of d462. In contrast, V173 and D177 are non-essential residues for the neutralizing activity of d462.
