<p>Identification of binding epitopes is crucial for understanding the mechanism of antibody function. We conducted epitope mapping for antibodies with strong neutralizing activities (d182, d511, d628, d559, d462, and d448) by screening a shotgun alanine scan mutagenesis library of dengue E proteins [
