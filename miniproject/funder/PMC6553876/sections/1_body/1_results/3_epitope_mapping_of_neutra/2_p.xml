<p>Amino acid residues key for binding of antibodies that have cross-reactive neutralizing activity fall into regions that are more conserved among the four DENV serotypes than regions containing residues key for binding of antibodies specific to a single serotype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Antibodies d511 and d628 bind to the BC loop (D329) and DE loop (K361) in the lateral ridge of DENV2 DIII. Residues D329 and K361 are located at the tip of the loop turn, displaying their side chains on the external surface of the mature virus capsid (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The key residues D329 and K361 have been previously reported in mouse anti-DENV2 and DENV1 antibody studies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Antibody d182 binds in the BC loop (T329) and I-III hinge region (V300) of DENV1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). It has been demonstrated that mutations in the DI-III hinge impair dengue virus particle assembly in the cell [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is worth noting that the epitopes of d182/d511/d628 are in the same BC loop of the lateral ridge (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This result suggests that the lateral ridge region is essential in dengue virus infection, as antibodies targeting the region possess potent DENV-neutralizing activities. Antibody d559 binds to the bc loop (Y81, K83) of DII on DENV4. This epitope adjacent to the fusion loop may contribute to blocking virus fusion with the endosomal membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). It has been reported that some highly potent cross-reactive human antibodies have epitopes in the bc loop [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, antibody d559, with an epitope (Y81, K83) in the bc loop, showed binding only to DENV4. Notably, the two amino acids bound by d559 are not conserved among the DENV serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To confirm the epitopes, we generated DENV reporter virus particles (RVP), in which amino acid residues in the epitope were substituted with relative amino acids for their impact on neutralizing activity of the antibodies. The RVPs with a detectable titer were chosen for neutralization assay (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s009">S1 Table</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, residue substitutions of V310, T329 abolished the neutralizing activity of d182, suggesting that these are key residues for interaction of the DENV1 E protein with the antibody. The mutations in DENV2-RVP (D329G/E, K361G), and DENV4-RVP (Y81G, K83G) inhibited neutralizing activity of the indicated antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g003">Fig 3F, 3G and 3H</xref>). These results validated the epitopes mapped by screening the shotgun alanine scan mutagenesis library of dengue E proteins. In addition, it is worthy to note that the Lysine substitution to Arginine in the DENV2 (K361R) and DENV4 (K83R) retain the neutralizing activity of the antibodies due to the similarity of the residues (
