<p>To assess the antibody maturation in DENV neutralizing antibodies in comparison to the entire panel of cloned antibody sequences, we analyzed the rate of antibody V-gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) and the CDR3 length. There were no significant differences in the average mutation rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). The heavy chain CDR3 length of the neutralizing antibodies is similar to that of the other mAbs, ranking from 5 to 25 amino acids. The majority of mAbs (87%) have a CDR3 length of 9â€“18 amino acids in both groups (

However, it is worth noting that the cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, d462 and d448, each have a long heavy chain CDR3 (19 amino acids). The whole panel of 780 antibodies has an average of 14 amino acids in the heavy chain CDR3. We further analyzed the VH germline of the neutralizing antibodies in comparison with the usage of total cloned antibodies. Distribution of the VH4 germline of neutralizing antibodies was 81%, while the antibodies overall showed 52% usage of VH4 (
