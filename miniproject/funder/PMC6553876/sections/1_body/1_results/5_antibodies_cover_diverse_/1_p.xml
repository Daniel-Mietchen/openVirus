<p>To determine sequence diversity of those antibodies with potent neutralization function, we used NCBI/IgBLAST to analyze the V(D)J-gene family assignment. The V-gene usage for heavy chains of the IgGs shows a high percentage of IgHV3 (36%) and IgHV4 (52%) among the mAbs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). The remaining gene families—IgHV1, 2, 5, 6, and 7—combined to make up only ~9% of the expressed antibody gene repertoires. For the light chain, the Ig-kappa (κ) repertoires predominantly expressed Igκ-V1 (64%), with the remaining gene families accounting for the other 36% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). The profile of V-gene usage for the cloned DENV antibodies is very similar to the distribution of the V-gene families in circulating IgG repertoires of rhesus macaques [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. To determine the association among heavy chain and light chain gene families, we analyzed gene families for each paired heavy chain and light chain sequence isolated from single antibody-secreting B cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, the VH4-VK1 (22%) and the VH3-VK1 (13%) pairs are the top two types of pairing and represent the dominant germline of VH4, VH3, and VK1.
