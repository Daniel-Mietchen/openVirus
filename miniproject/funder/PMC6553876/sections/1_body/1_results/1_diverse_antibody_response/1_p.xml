<p>The experimental vaccine of this study uses live attenuated viruses (LAV) for priming and tetravalent recombinant E proteins (DEN-80E) for boosting [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. Briefly, a total of 12 Rhesus macaques received a primer injection of the LAV subcutaneously (S.C.) at week 0, followed by a boost of tetravalent DEN-80E intramuscularly (I.M.) at week 16 (month 4). This vaccine has shown to elicit robust DENV neutralizing antibody titers in rhesus macaques (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To analyze the antibody response to the vaccine, seven days after the booster dose, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from single ASCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 12 vaccinated rhesus macaques. We pooled the PBMCs together for the ASCs sorting, and cloned a total of 780 antibodies from more than a thousand ASCs collected using a method that we reported previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The single ASCs were isolated by FACS from PBMCs into 96-well plates (one cell/well). The natively paired heavy and light variable regions from single B cells were cloned using a direct cDNA synthesis and nested-PCR amplification strategy. All paired antibodies were cloned into a framework of human IgG1 and expressed as macaque-human chimeric antibodies in HEK293-F cells for purification and downstream analysis. The initial screening of E protein binders was performed with supernatants of antibody expression cultures to eliminate non-binding antibodies. Positive binding antibodies (mAbs) were defined as those with an OD
 <sub>450</sub> ≥ 0.1 as assessed by ELISA in the primary screen. Among the cloned 780 mAbs, 130 (17%) of the supernatant antibodies were DEN-80E binders: 106 (14%) mAbs with OD450 in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 were defined as weak binders; 22 (3%) antibodies with OD450 ≥ 0.5 were considered to be strong binders (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Among the 130 binding mAbs, there were different types of cross-recognition of the four serotypes of DEN-80E: single serotype, two or three serotypes, and all four serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). About 50% of the DENV binding mAbs were specific to only one serotype of dengue: 30 mAbs were specific to DEN1-80E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1D</xref>); 18 mAbs to DEN2-80E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1E</xref>); 8 mAbs to DEN3-80E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1F</xref>); and 9 mAbs to DEN4-80E (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). A total of 33 mAbs showed binding to DEN-80E proteins from two or three dengue serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). More significantly, 32 cloned mAbs had cross-reactivity to all four dengue serotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). In summary, diverse antibodies recognizing complex epitopes formed the macaque antibody response to the vaccination.
