<p>Interestingly, the interface epitope of d488 is conserved in the flavivirus family (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007716.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). We hypothesized that d448 might also neutralize other flaviviruses. We first assessed the cross-reactivity of d448 to the purified E proteins of Zika virus, yellow fever virus (YFV), and West Nile virus (WNV). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, d448 binds to YFV E protein with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.028 and WNV E protein with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.032 μg/ml. In contrast, d448 show the weaker binding to Zika E protein with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.5 μg/ml. Next, we evaluated the neutralizing potency of d448 to the four flaviviruses. Antibody d488 exhibited weak neutralizing activity (around 30%) to Zika and WNV at concentrations above 1 μg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007716.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Antibody d488 exhibited minimal neutralizing activity of WNV (about 30% at a concentration of above 30 μg/ml).
