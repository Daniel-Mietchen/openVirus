<p>Antibodies specific to only one DENV serotype demonstrated higher potency and binding affinity. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, d182 neutralized only DENV1 with an NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.05 μg/ml. Antibodies d511 and d628 neutralized only DENV2. Antibody d511 neutralized DENV2 with an NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0047. Antibody d628 neutralized DENV2 with an NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0046 μg/ml. Two other mAbs, d50 and d145, inhibit DENV2 infection at higher concentrations, with NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.02 μg/ml and 0.59 μg/ml, respectively. Notably, the DENV3 specific antibody d622 demonstrated no inhibition of DENV infection, despite its high binding affinity to DEN3-80E (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Antibody d559 neutralized only DENV4 with an NT
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.0226 μg/ml. The cross-reactive antibodies had lower binding affinities and neutralizing potency than did single-serotype specific mAbs. One antibody, d462, showed neutralizing activity against both DENV3 and 4 with DENV3 at NT
 <sub>50</sub> 0.9476 μg/ml and DENV4 at NT
 <sub>50</sub> 0.0029 μg/ml. The antibody d448 showed cross-neutralizing potency against all four serotypes with NT50 for DENV1 at 0.13 μg/ml, NT50 for DENV2 at 0.33 μg/ml, NT50 for DENV3 at 1.25 μg/ml, and NT50 for DENV4 at 3.33 μg/ml (
