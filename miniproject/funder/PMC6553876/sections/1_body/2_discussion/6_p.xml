<p>The dengue E protein bears greater than 50% homology to the Zika virus E protein [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, the broadly dengue neutralizing antibody d448 identified in this stuy showed weak neutralizing activity to Zika and other flaviviruses. It has been reported that “group B” antibodies isolated from infected human patients also interact with the D215 and A267 residues in the DII domain in DENV4, which partially overlaps with the epitope of d448 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The “group B” antibodies are relatively weaker neutralizers 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, which may explain the fact that antibody d448 is not a particularly strong neutralizer when compared with other neutralizing antibodies isolated in this study. Significance of the d448 epitope in dengue neutralization in the clinical setting warrant further study.
