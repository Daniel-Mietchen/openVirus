<p>In summary, this study profiled antibody responses to an experimental vaccine in NHP and laid a foundation for further evaluation of the vaccine in the preclinical trial. The novel neutralizing antibodies can be evaluated for therapeutic potential for the treatment of dengue infection. Epitopes of the very potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies offer insights for better dengue vaccine design.</p>
