<p>DIII was identified as the dominant epitope for the mouse antibodies but not for human antibodies [

Epitope mapping of these antibodies, with random recombinant DIII mutants, identified the lateral ridge in DIII as the target of strongly neutralizing antibodies. Similarly, we identified three potent neutralizing antibodies recognizing critical residues T/D329 (d182, d511, d628) and K361 (d511, d628) in the lateral ridge of DIII. We propose that the lateral ridge epitope represents an important neutralizing site on DENV for rhesus macaque. In this study, we also isolated neutralizing antibodies recognizing the DI-DIII hinge (d182), DI (d462), and DII (d559, d448). Prior to our study, little was known as to how rhesus macaque neutralizing antibodies recognized DENV. A non-DIII antibody response has been shown to be induced by live DENV infection in rhesus macaque. However, in the same study, the alphavirus vector-based dengue E dimer vaccine-induced predominantly DIII neutralizing antibodies in rhesus macaques [

The deviations of the epitopes from those reported in different studies may be due to various factors that cause differences in the B cell repertoire. Namely, variations in the immunization strategy, primary screening, and genetic profiles of the rhesus macaques could be reflected in the antibody response.
