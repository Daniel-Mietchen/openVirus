<p>In this study, we cloned and analyzed a large panel of DENV reactive antibodies from single ASCs including both serotype specific and broadly neutralizing mAbs. Among the 780 antibodies cloned, 130 showed binding to the DENV-80E protein, with a positive rate of 17% in ELISA. We used LAV displaying dimeric E protein as a priming vaccine and monomer subunit E proteins to boost the immune response. With the booster dose, only about half of the E-antibodies binding to monomeric E protein could be enriched, according to the previous human study [

These included antibodies binding to the lateral ridge of DIII (d182, d511, d628), the I-III hinge (d182), the bc loop adjacent with the fusion loop (d559) of DII, the Î²-strands and the loops of DI (d462), and the interface of E protein with the M protein in DII (d448). Epitopes within some of those motifs or domains have been reported for dengue neutralizing antibodies from different species including mouse, chimpanzee, and humans [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. As expected, the vaccination using monomeric E protein in our study did not yield any neutralizing antibodies targeting E dimer epitopes as have been reported for antibodies from human patients [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Nevertheless, isolation of potent neutralizing antibodies with diverse epitopes in this study provides a strong validation for the efficacy of the vaccine and immunization strategy.
