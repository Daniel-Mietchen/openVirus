<p>The objective of this study was to: (1) evaluate the efficacy of an experimental DENV vaccine by the elicited neutralizing antibodies, and (2) characterize the epitopes recognized by the mAbs and examine their potency of neutralization. Although NHPs typically do not develop the disease as humans do following dengue viral infection, they are still the most valuable models available for evaluating the efficacy of experimental dengue vaccines [

The NHP antibodies with epitopes more closely related to those of human antibodies may better inform the preclinical development of vaccines. They are particularly relevant if antibodies can be characterized that recognize diverse epitopes that are neutralizing antibody binding sites also targeted by the human antibody repertoire.
