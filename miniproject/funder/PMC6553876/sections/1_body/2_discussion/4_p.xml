<p>Identifying the target epitopes of the antibodies, generated by rhesus macaque post vaccination, is the best way to understand the molecular determinants of the NHP immune response to DENV. It is worth noting that the epitopes we reported in this study are critical for human dengue antibodies as well as for dengue antibodies from other species [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The mAb d182 recognizes V300 in the I-III linker (E299-304) and the T329 in DIII. A panel of mouse DIII-neutralizing antibodies also targets this region [

These results suggest that d182 may inhibit virus entry by blocking DENV binding to the cell surface heparin sulfate, which is the initial step of infection. We identified that the mAb d559 binds the bc loop of DII, adjacent to the fusion loop. Previously, the potent human antibody 1C19 was reported to recognize this epitope and could neutralize all four serotypes better than any antibodies targeting the fusion loop [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This result shows that the d462 may block the virus infection by the same mechanism, that is, by preventing conformational change during fusion. The unique epitopes revealed by this study suggests a focus for rational vaccine design based on the novel immunogens of DENV.
