<p>The cross-reactivity of serum from patients with DENV and Zika virus, and the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection has presented a challenge for accurate identification of the infecting agent, and diseases control [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This raises questions regarding the role of the DENV antibodies in protective immunity and impact on pathogenesis. In our study, most of the antibodies are relatively weak in neutralizing activity or binding affinity. The less potent cross-reactive antibodies can induce ADE to different dengue serotypes and the Zika virus. We have not yet assessed the ADE effect of the isolated rhesus antibodies. Further studies to determine whether the rhesus antibodies can induce ADE activity will be essential for understanding the efficacy of the experimental dengue vaccine. The NHP could be used as a model for the study of ADE in flavivirus pathogenesis [
