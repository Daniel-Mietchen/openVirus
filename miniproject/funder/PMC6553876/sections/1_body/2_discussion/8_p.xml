<p>In our study, two neutralizing antibodies (d511, d628) recognizing the lateral ridge of DENV2 DIII were isolated from two different macaque subjects. They share similar CDR3 sequences and both heavy and light chains are of the same germlines. The “unique” paired genetic restriction to specific V-genes, and CDR3 sequences indicate that the antibodies might be dominant in the DENV2-neutralizing lineage of the B cell repertoire. Similarly, detection of the dominant VCR01 classes of antibodies has been reported in HIV studies and the restricted IGHV1-69 germline in influenza studies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, neutralizing antibodies are biased towards the VH4 germline, and the light chain did not show a clear preference for any particular germline. These results indicate that the heavy chain may be subject to more selection pressure on humoral response to this vaccination.
