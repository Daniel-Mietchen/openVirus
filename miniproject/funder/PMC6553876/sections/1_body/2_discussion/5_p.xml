<p>This study, for the first time, identified a broadly neutralizing DENV mAb d448 with a novel epitope at the interface of the E and M proteins. The mAb d448 is likely binding to the E protein in the immature DENV virus, interfering with DENV “breathing” by blocking the E-M protein interaction [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As the E protein dynamically switches between dimers and trimers during DENV “breathing,” mAb d448 may block the E protein transition from dimer to trimer.
