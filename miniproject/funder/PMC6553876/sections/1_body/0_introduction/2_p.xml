<p>DENV has four serologically distinct subtypes, DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4, each with an RNA genome of 10.7 kb that is translated into three structural proteins, Capsid (C), Envelope (E), preMembrane (prM), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Immunity induced by primary infection of DENV is effective in protection against subsequent infection by the homologous viral serotype. However, when secondary infection by a different serotype occurs, pre-existing immunity to one serotype of DENV can be an adverse factor causing life-threatening illness such as DHF or DSS [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, it is critical for a DENV vaccine to induce a balanced immune response or elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes [
