<p>The licensed dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, has limited efficacy in protecting against DENV infection. This efficacy depends on the serotype of the infecting virus and the immune status at the time of vaccination [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Unexpectedly, the vaccine has lower efficiency in subjects who were DENV seronegative than in subjects who were DENV seropositive prior to vaccination [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Phase 3 trials, the vaccine showed 35â€“80% protection against infection by all DENV serotypes. However, this efficacy is not consistent with the anti-DENV titer as assessed in the clinical trial. In this trial, over 90% of the subjects showed serum neutralization activity against DENV [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This result indicates that titer is not sufficient for dengue vaccine evaluation. Because of the complexity of viral antigens involved and the polyclonal nature of immune sera, other factors may influence vaccine efficacy. An alternative approach to estimate the efficacy of a dengue vaccine in clinical trials is through a better understanding of the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) induced by the vaccine. Antibody responses can be measured accurately, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, and the epitopes can be mapped for potent neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, vaccine efficacy could be evaluated by serum titer, monoclonal antibody response, and epitopes of neutralizing antibodies.
