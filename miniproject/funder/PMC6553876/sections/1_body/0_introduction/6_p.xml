<p>Comprehensive studies have identified both serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive epitopes in all three domains of the E protein, recognized by various neutralizing mAbs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The mouse antibodies to DIII exhibit potent neutralizing activity. Their neutralization capacity and specificity vary between DENV serotypes. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The lateral ridge (loops between the β-sheets) of DIII, fully accessible on the intact virion, is an epitope hotspot for mouse neutralizing antibodies. It is also a neutralizing site for other flaviviruses, such as Zika and West Nile virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Besides the lateral ridge, mouse antibody targeting the A strand of DIII, has demonstrated strong cross-serotype neutralizing activity, drawing attention to potential immunotherapy applications. DIII is also the antigenic region of the human antibody response. The antibodies isolated from human patients have been shown to bind the lateral ridge and the stands of DIII [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, the proportion of DIII-targeting human neutralizing antibodies is low in dengue-positive human sera [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Humans tend to produce antibodies that bind to epitopes in domains other than DIII [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In general, the fusion loop of DII represents a dominant epitope, and the antibodies specific for this loop are weak and tend to have cross-reactive neutralizing activity against different flavivirus infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. On the other hand, the bc loop adjacent to the fusion loop in DII is an epitope of a highly potent human antibody neutralizing all four DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It has also been reported that mouse antibodies can block virus membrane fusion by targeting the fusion loop and bc loop simultaneously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These examples highlight the importance of the loop adjacent to the fusion loop in inhibiting DENV infection. As for the DI-binding mAbs, the lateral ridge of DI and the hinge region are the epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies from mouse, chimpanzee, and human [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Generally, the DI antibodies neutralize the virus by blocking the conformational change of the E protein during membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Another group of antibodies targets the quaternary epitope whose critical residues lie at the domain interface or across different domains. Recently, a new class of potent neutralizing human mAbs was reported, only targeting the E-dimer on the intact virus surface [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These antibodies are E-dimer dependent, locking the prefusion structure of E protein, preventing the conformational change necessary for virus fusion. They are the dominant neutralizing antibodies in human patients. However, a comprehensive understanding of the DENV epitopes targeted by rhesus macaque antibodies has not been described.
