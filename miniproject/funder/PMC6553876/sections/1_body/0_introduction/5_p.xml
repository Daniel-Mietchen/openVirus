<p>The DENV E protein is the dominant antigenic site of DENV neutralizing antibody. It forms dimeric structures that anchor on the M protein through hydrophobic interaction on the mature virus particle [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Each E protein contains three domains: DI, DII, and DIII [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DI participates in the conformational changes of the virus particle [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. DII interacts with the endosome to lead fusion of the virus after entry using the hydrophobic fusion loop [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. DIII is involved in receptor binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The prM protein forms a heterodimer with E protein to prevent premature fusion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. During virus assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), each set of three prM-E heterodimers form “spikes” on the virion surface. The virus is then transported through the secretory pathway. In the trans-Golgi, the low-pH environment induces the rearrangement of prM-E heterodimers into a flattened conformation. Then the prM protein on immature virions is cleaved by furin or furin-like protease to produce mature virions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the cleavage process is incomplete, leading to a mixture of virus particles in different states of maturity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The diversity of virus structures influences epitope accessibility and thereby affects the neutralizing activity of the antibodies targeting different epitopes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
