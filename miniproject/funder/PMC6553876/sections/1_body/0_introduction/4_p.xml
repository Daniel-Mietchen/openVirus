<p>Non-human primates (NHP) such as rhesus macaques can develop viremia upon DENV infection and have a qualitative immune response similar to that in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, they are often used to evaluate dengue vaccine candidates in preclinical trials. Induction of a humoral immune response by vaccination has been shown to induce protective immunity against dengue infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It was shown that a prime-boost strategy (live attenuated virus prime, DEN-80E boost) in rhesus macaque induced neutralization titers to all four DENV serotypes that were higher than those induced by a prime-boost regime using only tetravalent virus vaccine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To better evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine, we developed a robust method to clone monoclonal antibodies from the antibody-secreting cells of rhesus macaque after vaccination. By characterizing these antibodies, we are able to identify indicators of vaccine efficacy [
