<p>In this study, we investigated antibody responses to an experimental dengue vaccine in rhesus macaques. We cloned and characterized a large panel of mAbs (780 antibodies) from single antibody-secreting B cells (ASCs) using a high-throughput cloning protocol that we reported previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Six potent neutralizing antibodies were identified. Their binding epitopes were mapped using an alanine-scan mutation library across dengue prM/E [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We isolated antibodies with binding epitopes similar to those previously reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. This collection of antibodies exhibited a diverse epitope pattern, with binding sites on the lateral ridge of DIII (d182, d511, and d628), the I-III hinge (d182), the bc loop adjacent to the fusion loop in DII (d559), and the Î²-strands and loops of DI (d462). More significantly, we identified a broadly neutralizing antibody (d448) recognizing an epitope never previously reported in DII, at the interface of the E and M proteins. Discovery of these antibodies with diverse epitopes will aid the design of more effective vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against dengue infection.
