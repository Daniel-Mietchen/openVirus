<p>Recombinant flavivirus envelope protein was coated on the 96-well plates with the concentration of 1 μg/ml at 4°C overnight. Plates were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS, then incubated with the supernatants or purified mAb in 3-fold serial dilutions. After incubation for 1.5 hours at room temperature, the plates were washed 3 times with PBST (0.5% Tween-20 in PBS), followed by addition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) and detected using TMB Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for absorbance signal at OD
 <sub>450</sub> nm using a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Devices). Samples having an OD
 <sub>450</sub> nm of above or equal to 0.1 were designated as positive binders. The OD
 <sub>450</sub> of native control were below 0.4. All assays were replicated three times.
