<p>The live attenuated vaccine (gifted by Dr. Stephen S. Whitehead, National Institutes of Health) comprised dengue types 1–4 (rDEN1-rDEN1Δ30–1545; rDEN2-rDEN2/4 Δ30(ME)-1495,7163; rDEN3-rDEN3Δ30/31-7164; and rDEN4-rDEN4 Δ30–7132,7163,8308). The tetravalent dengue subunit vaccine (V180, Merck and Co. Inc.) comprises truncated forms of envelope proteins (DEN-80E), derived from strains of all four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 strain 258848, DENV2 strain PR159 S1, DENV3 strain CH53489, and DENV4 strain H241). The immunization strategy has been reported previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, all the subjects received the live attenuated vaccine subcutaneously at 0 weeks and then received subunit DEN-80E vaccine formulated with Alhydrogel adjuvant (Brenntag Biosector) intramuscularly at 16 weeks. Bleeds were taken 7 days after a boost. PBMCs were isolated and stained for FACS sorting as described [

 <sup>−</sup>/CD19
 <sup>low to +</sup>/CD20
 <sup>– to low</sup>/ sIgG
 <sup>−</sup>/CD38
 <sup>+</sup> /CD27
 <sup>– or +</sup>. The sorted cells were stored at -80°C until analysis.
