<p>The CM5 sensor chip was pre-activated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Biacore T100, GE Healthcare). The dengue antigens (DEN-80E) were immobilized on the sensor chips and reached targeted 1500 RU. Each antibody (analyte) was serially diluted 2 folds down with concentration ranges at 0–200 nM in running buffer. Association and dissociation were conducted at a flow rate of 30 μl/min with a 5-min association followed by 5-min of dissociation, at 25 °C. Then, the chip was regenerated by two 20-second pulses of 3 M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The data was analyzed using the standard Biacore T100 evaluation software with the 1:1 Langmuir binding model for
