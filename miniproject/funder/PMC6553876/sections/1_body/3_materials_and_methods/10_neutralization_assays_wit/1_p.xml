<p>DENV-RVPs were produced in HEK-293T cells by co-transfection with plasmids of DENV structural genes (CprME) and WNV subgenomic replicon. The plasmids encoding DENV2-CprME (strain: 16681) and the WNV subgenomic replicon with Renilla luciferase reporter gene (pWNII-rep-Ren-IB) were described previsuly [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. We replaced the DENV2-CprME with CprMEs from DENV1 (strain: Hawaii) and DENV4 (strain: H241), respectively, to generate other serotype RVPs. The amino acid residue substitution mutants were created using site directed mutagenesis by PCR. Briefly, HEK-293T cells were plated at a density of 400,000 cells per well in 12 well plate overnight, the cells were then co-transfected with 1.5 μg of DENV structural gene and 0.5 μg of WNV subgenomic replicon. After 4 hours, the culture medium was replaced with low glucose formulation of DMEM (7% FBS), then the cells were cultured at 33°C under 5% CO2 for another 48 hours. The RVPs in the supernatants were harvested by passing through 0.45 μm filters. For infection assay in 96-well plate, Vero cells were added to each well at a density of 30,000 cells per well in 100 μl of DMEM complete medium (7% FBS), then 100 μl RVP were added to each well with the neutralizing antibodies at the final concentration of 3 μg/ml followed by incubation at 37°C for 48 hours. The infected cells were lysed in 20 μl of lysis reagent and assayed using luciferin-containing substrate (Promega: Renilla Luciferase Assay System, E2810). Luminescence was measured using a luminometer. The relative titer of the mutants was normalized to the wildtype RVP. The assays were performed in triplicates and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism.
