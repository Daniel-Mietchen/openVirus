<p>Epitope mapping was conducted using comprehensive mutation libraries made of prM/E from all four DENV serotypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The DENV1 library consists of random mutations introduced at each residue of the DENV1 prM/E polyprotein (strain WestPac), while for DENV2 (strain 16681), DENV3 (strain CH53489), and DENV4 (strain 341750), each prM/E residue was individually changed to alanine (and alanine residues to serine). All mutant clones were sequence confirmed and arrayed into 384-well plates (one mutation per well). Mutagenesis achieved &gt;97% coverage of prM/E residues for each serotype, a total of over 2,400 mutations. Antibody d182 was mapped on the DENV1 library, antibodies d511 and d628 on the DENV2 library, and antibodies d462, d448, and d559 on the DENV4 library. For each screening, a DENV prM/E library was expressed in HEK-293T cells and assayed by immunofluorescence for mAb binding as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In some cases, mAbs were also screened as Fabs after conversion by papain digestion. Antibodies were detected using AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were washed three times with PBS/+0.2% saponin followed by two washes in PBS. Mean cellular fluorescence was detected using a high-throughput flow cytometer (HTFC, Intellicyt). Antibody reactivity against each mutant protein clone was calculated relative to wild-type protein reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type prM/E-transfected controls. Mutations within clones were identified as critical to the mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the test mAb but supported reactivity of other antibodies. This counter-screen strategy facilitates the exclusion of DENV protein mutants that are misfolded or have an expression defect. The mAbs D004, D449, D168, D413, D341, and D195 were used as positive control.
