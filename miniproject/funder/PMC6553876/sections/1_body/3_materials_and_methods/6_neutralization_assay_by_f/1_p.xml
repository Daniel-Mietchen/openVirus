<p>Zika (SMGC-1 strain), yellow Fever virus (17D strain), and West Nile virus (Kunjin, MRM61C strain) were propagated in Vero cells as previously described [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Briefly, 2×10
 <sup>5</sup> of Vero cells were seeded in each well of 24-well plate 24 h before virus infection. The purified antibody d448 was serially diluted and incubated with the virus (5×10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU) for 1 h at 37°C. Vero cells were then incubated with the antibody and virus mixture for 40 h at 37°C supplied with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Afterward, infected cells were collected by trypsin digestion, fixed and permeabilized by Fixation and Permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences); and stained with pan-flavivirus antibody Z6 (for ZIKV, YFN, and WNV) at 2 μg/ml [
