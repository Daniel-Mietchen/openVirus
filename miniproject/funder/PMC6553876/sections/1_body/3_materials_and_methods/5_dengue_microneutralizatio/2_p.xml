<p>For the rhesus macaque sera tittering, two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples from vaccinated animals were incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C with 50 PFU of each DENV. This virus-serum mixture was then added onto Vero cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 4 days. Serum end-point neutralization titers (LiCor
 <sub>50</sub>) were defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that blocks 50% of the DENV infection when compared to virus control included on each assay plate, using an infrared Odyssey Sa imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences) [
