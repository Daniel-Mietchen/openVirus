<p>Micro-neutralization assay was based on staining viral E protein with near-infrared fluorescent dye (IRD)-labeled reagents, as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007716.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Antibody concentration titrations were used in each assay and concentration to generate 50% neutralization activities (NT
 <sub>50</sub>) was derived from the antibody titration curve using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.) with a nonlinear regression and 4-parameter curve fitting model.
