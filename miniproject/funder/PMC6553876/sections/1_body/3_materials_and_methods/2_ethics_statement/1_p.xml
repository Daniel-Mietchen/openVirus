<p>Indian Rhesus macaques were domestically bred, raised and maintained at New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) of University of Louisiana at Lafayette, New Iberia, LA, USA. Flavivirus naïve (i.e. sera negative for Dengue virus 1,2,3,4 and West Nile virus) monkeys of either sex, weighing more than 3 kg were used in this study. The animal studies were approved by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and conducted in accordance with the US Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All animals were socially housed for the study. The dimensions of the cage for paired housing is 8.6 (floor area, square footage) by 30 (height, inch). Each animal’s holding cage was cleaned daily. Animals were provided with object(s) to manipulate or explore. Harlan Teklad Monkey Chow, or its equivalent, was provided daily in amounts appropriate for the size of the animal. The basic diet was supplemented with fruit and novel treats including small quantities of fresh fruits, nuts, or seeds, 2 to 3 times weekly as part of the site’s environmental enrichment program. Tap water was provided ad libitum via automatic watering device. No contaminants are known to be present in the food or water which would interfere with the results of this study. Food was withheld at least 2–3 hours on days of study procedures to insure safe sedation and was offered upon recovery from sedation. Animals were observed twice daily throughout the study for any abnormal clinical signs, signs of illness or distress. All animals were returned to the colony at NIRC at the end of the study.</p>
