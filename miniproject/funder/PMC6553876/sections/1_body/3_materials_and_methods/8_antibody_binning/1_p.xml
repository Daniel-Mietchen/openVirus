<p>An Octet equipped with protein A-coated sensor (ForteBio, Octet RED96) was used to bin DEN4-80E with the mAbs d462 and 5H2. First, 30 μg/ml of d462 and 5H2 were captured onto protein A sensor for 600 seconds. Followed by a blocking antibody (200 μg/ml) to saturate the unoccupied sensors for 300 seconds, the DEN4-80E was loaded in an association step onto the sensor at 30 μg/ml for 300 seconds. The Sensors with DEN4-80E provide a surface for the binding of the secondary mAbs d462, 5H2, d559, d182. If the second antibody showed mass accumulation to the sensors, it was considered to bind to a different epitope than the captured antibody. The mAb d559 was used as positive control, d182 as a negative control.</p>
