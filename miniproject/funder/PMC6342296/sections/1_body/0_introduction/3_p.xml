<p>ZIKV shares extensive homology with dengue virus (DENV). The 4 DENV serotypes interact immunologically: infection with one serotype provides transient cross-protection against infection with heterologous serotypes, but sequential infection with different DENV serotypes is the most important risk factor for severe dengue disease, an effect that is mediated in part by antibody-dependent enhancement [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] do not support ZIKV enhancement by preexisting DENV immunity. Interestingly, throughout the Americas, a precipitous decrease in the number of dengue cases was observed following widespread Zika epidemics [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], suggesting that ZIKV infection might induce cross-protective immune responses against DENV. However, the characterization of potential cross-protection between DENV and ZIKV requires knowledge of longitudinal pre-infection immune histories, which is only available in prospective cohort studies [
