 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], few cases were detected until 2007, though serological evidence existed of circulation in Africa and southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and larger outbreaks were documented in Oceania in 2013â€“2014, in particular in French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. ZIKV caused a major epidemic in Brazil starting in 2015, which rapidly spread to South, Central, and North America and the Caribbean. In Nicaragua, the first Zika case was identified in January 2016.
