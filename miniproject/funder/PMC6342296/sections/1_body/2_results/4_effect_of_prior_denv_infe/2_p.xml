<p>Of the 3,027 children with known DENV infection histories, 2,659 children contributed paired annual serum samples for 2016 and 2017 and were thus included in the ZIKV infection analysis. Of these children, 574 (21.6%) had 1 or more prior DENV infections, 134 (5%) had experienced a recent DENV infection, and 2,085 (78.4%) were DENV-na誰ve (
