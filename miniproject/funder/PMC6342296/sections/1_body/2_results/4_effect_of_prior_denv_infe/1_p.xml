<p>A total of 3,027 children in the cohort had known DENV infection histories and were included in the models examining the effects of prior DENV infection on symptomatic Zika rates. Of these children, 743 (24.5%) had experienced at least 1 prior DENV infection in the cohort, 176 (5.8%) had experienced a recent DENV infection, and 2,284 children (75.5%) were DENV-naïve (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002726.s003">S1 Table</xref>). Rates of documented DENV infection increased with age and were similar among males and females. Children with prior DENV infection had a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic Zika and a lower rate of symptomatic presentation given ZIKV infection than DENV-naïve children. In multivariable models adjusting for age and sex, both having a prior DENV infection and having a recent DENV infection were significantly negatively associated with the incidence of symptomatic Zika. However, when both prior DENV infection and recent DENV infection were included in the model, only prior DENV infection remained significant (IRR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.81;
