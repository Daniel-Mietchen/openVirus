<p>A total of 3,893 children aged 2â€“14 years participated in the PDCS between January 1, 2016, and February 28, 2017. Of these, 3,053 (78.4%) participated throughout the entire study period; 386 (9.9%) were enrolled after January 1, 2016; 440 (11.3%) withdrew or were withdrawn from the study; and 14 (0.4%) both enrolled after January 1, 2016, and withdrew. A majority of the individuals who did not participate in the entire study period were 2-year-old children who were enrolled after January 1, 2016, or children who turned 15 years and aged out of the cohort during the follow-up period.
