<p>In this study, we took advantage of our long-standing dengue cohort study to characterize ZIKV dynamics during the Zika epidemic in Managua, Nicaragua, from its introduction in January 2016 to February 2017. We found a high incidence of both symptomatic and total ZIKV infections and estimated the effective reproduction number during the early growth phase of the epidemic to be 3.3â€“3.4. Girls and older children had a higher risk of ZIKV infection. Notably, PDCS children with prior DENV infection had a lower risk of developing symptoms when infected by ZIKV.</p>
