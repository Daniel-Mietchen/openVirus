<p>In summary, we documented a high incidence of ZIKV infection and Zika disease in children in Managua, Nicaragua, during the 2016 epidemic. We found that prior DENV infection was associated with a decreased risk of Zika symptoms in individuals exposed to ZIKV. This supports that DENV immunity may be protective for symptomatic ZIKV infection. Our findings might be generalizable to other locations that have had DENV circulation in the years preceding ZIKV circulation, including a great majority of countries in the Americas. Conversely, it is possible that this cross-reactivity in the human immune response among closely related flaviviruses may be responsible for the dramatic decrease in dengue cases during and right after the Zika epidemic throughout the Americas. More research is needed to address the possible immunological mechanism(s) of cross-protection between ZIKV and DENV and whether DENV immunity may modulate other ZIKV infection outcomes such as neurological or congenital syndromes.</p>
