<p>The strengths of our study include its large size and prospective nature. In addition, given that our cohort study has been ongoing since 2004, with both symptomatic and inapparent DENV infections being characterized, we are uniquely positioned to examine the effect of prior DENV infection on Zika risk. Our study has several limitations; first, it is restricted to children and thus we cannot comment on the effect of prior DENV infection in adults. Second, we are constrained by the epidemiology of our site, including the limited number of DENV infections in the years immediately preceding ZIKV introduction. Third, due to incomplete DENV infection histories and/or the lack of paired annual serum samples, a subset of the cohort was excluded from the DENV immunity analyses. Fourth, for the identification of symptomatic ZIKV infections, we relied on participants to present at the health center; thus, it is possible that we misclassified some infections as inapparent that were truly symptomatic. If presentation at the health center among children with symptomatic infections was related to DENV immunity, this could have biased our analyses. Fifth, determination of rRT-PCR-negative symptomatic ZIKV infections and inapparent ZIKV infections relied on an algorithm that combined several ZIKV and DENV serological test results and on the ZIKV NS1 BOB ELISA, respectively. Although the algorithm was developed to maximize its diagnostic value and the ZIKV NS1 BOB assay has been characterized in different populations [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we cannot exclude that several symptomatic and inapparent infections were misclassified. Sixth, risk of exposure to DENV and ZIKV are not independent, as the 2 viruses are both transmitted by the same mosquito and the underlying risk of exposure to arboviruses likely varies by home and school location as well as child. Underlying arboviral risk is a potential unmeasured confounder in our study. This may have biased our infection analysis towards the null, as children who have previously been exposed to DENV may be generally at higher risk for arboviral infections than children who have not been exposed to DENV. In part to address this underlying relationship between DENV exposure risk and ZIKV exposure risk, we performed the analysis examining symptomatic presentation among those with ZIKV infections, which removes this potential source of bias. Importantly, the effect estimate for prior DENV immunity obtained in this analysis was very similar to that obtained in the symptomatic Zika analysis, indicating that this potential source of bias did not significantly impact the symptomatic Zika analysis.
