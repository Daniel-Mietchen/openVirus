<p>Flaviviruses are known to induce both virus type-specific and cross-reactive immune responses [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Early evidence of the cross-reactivity of ZIKV- and DENV-induced immune responses was observed during the 2007 Yap Island Zika outbreak, in particular in patients thought to have been previously DENV-exposed [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. More recently, studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies from DENV-exposed persons are able to neutralize ZIKV in vitro and in mouse models [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In rhesus macaques, ZIKV pathogenesis was unaffected by prior DENV exposure (although ZIKV viremia was shorter in pre-exposed animals [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), and in humans with acute, symptomatic ZIKV infection, no major changes in viral load or cytokine levels were reported in DENV-pre-exposed versus DENV-naïve patients [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we show that children with a prior DENV infection have a lower risk of being symptomatic when infected by ZIKV after adjusting for sex and age, suggesting that previous DENV immunity may be protective against Zika. However, studies conducted using sera from humans exposed to DENV suggest that cross-reactive neutralizing responses induced by DENV against ZIKV are neither as strong nor as durable as those induced against heterologous DENV types [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Thus, we analyzed the risk of symptomatic presentation given ZIKV infection in children with a recent (2015/2016 season) DENV infection. The IRR estimate was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.92; 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.020) when adjusted for age and sex; however, including prior DENV infection in the model increased the IRR estimate to 0.80 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.34; 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.393). It is important to note that the incidence of DENV infection in the PDCS during the 2015/2016 season was low, which limits the power of the analysis. Additionally, cross-protection from a prior DENV infection might be provided through other antibody-mediated responses (e.g., antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxity) and/or through cross-protective CD8
