<p>The first Zika case in the cohort was identified on January 2, 2016, followed by 12 cases (detected by rRT-PCR and/or the serological algorithm) through the end of February 2016 (

 <italic>n =</italic> 516; 92.1%) occurred by the end of September. Twelve cases occurred between October 2016 and February 2017. The overall incidence of Zika in our study population was 14.0 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI: 12.9, 15.2), and the weekly incidence peaked in the last week of July, at 123.5 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI: 100.0, 152.6) (
