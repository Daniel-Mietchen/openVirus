<p>Over the study period, 946 children presented 1,111 times with symptoms meeting the study testing definition. A total of 374 cases were positive for ZIKV by rRT-PCR. As many symptomatic ZIKV infections might present clinically after the detectable viremic phase of disease, we also developed an algorithm for serological diagnosis of Zika using the classification tree method (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">methods</xref> above; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002726.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The sensitivity and specificity was 96% and 91%, respectively, for ZIKV rRT-PCR-positive cases; 92% and 97% for OFI cases; and 82% and 99% for DENV rRT-PCR-positive cases. We applied the algorithm produced by the classification tree to the 1,111 cases of illness meeting the testing definition that occurred during the study period. Taking into account both the ZIKV rRT-PCR results and the algorithm, a total of 560 children were laboratory-confirmed as symptomatic ZIKV infections (Zika cases). Of the 560 Zika cases, 354 (63.2%) were confirmed by both rRT-PCR and the serology algorithm. Additionally, 186 cases (33.2%) were confirmed by serology only and 20 cases (3.6%) by rRT-PCR only.
