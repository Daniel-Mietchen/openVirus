<p>We then calculated the incidence of symptomatic ZIKV infections (Zika cases) according to the demographic characteristics of the participants. Zika incidence was higher in girls than in boys (crude IRR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.45; 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.028), with a rate of 15.6 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI: 13.9, 17.4) in girls and 12.5 cases per 100 person-years (95% CI: 11.0, 14.1) in boys (Tables

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Of the 3,893 children in the cohort, 3,296 children provided paired annual samples in 2016 and 2017. The incidence of total ZIKV infections (symptomatic and inapparent) in these children was 36.5 (95% CI: 34.7, 38.6) infections per 100 person-years. Girls had 1.15 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.31; 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.028) times the rate of ZIKV infection of boys. ZIKV infection incidence increased with increasing age (Tables
