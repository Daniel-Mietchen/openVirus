 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, the PDCS is a community-based prospective study consisting of approximately 3,700 children uniformly distributed over each year of age between 2 and 14 years. The study was sized to examine the effects of repeat DENV infection. The study is based at a primary health center, the Health Center Sócrates Flores Vivas (HCSFV), in District II of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. The study area consists of 17 neighborhoods, with most inhabitants living at low to middle socioeconomic status. Primary healthcare is provided by study personnel to all participants, and acute illnesses are screened using the study testing definition (see below). Initial recruitment into the study occurred through door-to-door visits. All children 2 to 9 years old living within the study area were invited to participate; the age range was then extended to 14 years old. Every March, healthy blood samples (annual samples) are collected, and additional participants are enrolled to maintain the cohort age structure and compensate for loss to follow-up. Children aged 2 years are also enrolled year-round to maintain the age structure.
