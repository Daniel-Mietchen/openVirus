<p>Data were analyzed using Stata v14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Relative and absolute frequencies are reported for categorical variables, and mean and standard deviation are reported for quantitative variables. Follow-up time was calculated as the amount of time between January 1, 2016, or enrollment, whichever came later, and February 28, 2017. For those lost to follow-up, follow-up was calculated as one-half the amount of time between last contact with study personnel and the date recorded as lost to follow-up. A Poisson distribution was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence rates. A binomial distribution was used to calculate 95% CIs for seroprevalence and proportion of cases among infections. We used generalized estimating equations assuming a Poisson distribution to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the risk of symptomatic ZIKV infection. Crude and adjusted IRRs were calculated using univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. For analyses examining the risk of ZIKV infection and the risk of symptomatic presentation among all ZIKV infections, Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used. Analyses of the effect of DENV immunity were limited to children with documented DENV infection histories. In addition, all ZIKV cases or infections that occurred prior to March 1, 2016 (
 <italic>n =</italic> 68) were excluded because (1) the testing definition for Zika changed in February 2016 and (2) there is potentially DENV/ZIKV serological cross-reactivity in the ZIKV NS1 BOB assay when performed in samples collected early after the acute infection. Further, analysis of the effect of prior DENV immunity on Zika cases among ZIKV infections was limited to individuals who demonstrated a ZIKV NS1 BOB seroconversion, regardless of case status. Age was explored as a categorical and linear variable, and although the variable form did not impact the conclusions of the models, the continuous version generated a better model fit and thus was included in the final models.
