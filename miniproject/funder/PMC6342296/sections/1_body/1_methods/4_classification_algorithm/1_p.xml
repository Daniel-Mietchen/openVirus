 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]) were used to implement a method called recursive partitioning to group cases by class based on shared characteristics in predictor variables. The classification tree was trained with rRT-PCR-confirmed Zika cases (
 <italic>n =</italic> 368; 3 excluded because of ZIKV/DENV co-infections and 3 did not have sufficient serological data to be used in the training set), rRT-PCR-confirmed dengue cases that occurred before (

 <italic>n =</italic> 13) the introduction of ZIKV, other febrile illnesses (OFIs) that occurred before the Zika epidemic (
 <italic>n =</italic> 75), and OFIs that occurred during the study period in children with rRT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection (
 <italic>n =</italic> 150). For all cases, we measured antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples with the DENV and the ZIKV iELISAs as well as DENV and ZIKV MAC-ELISAs [
