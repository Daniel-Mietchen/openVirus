<p>Symptomatic and inapparent DENV infections have been recorded in the PDCS since study inception in August 2004 through a combination of rRT-PCR, virus isolation, and serological methods for symptomatic cases, and dengue iELISA on paired annual samples for inapparent infections [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Infecting DENV serotype information is available for most symptomatic cases but only for a subset of the inapparent infections [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Prior DENV infection was defined as at least 1 inapparent or symptomatic infection since the participant entered the PDCS until the 2015/2016 season (from March 1, 2015, to February 29, 2016). Recent DENV infection was defined as an inapparent or symptomatic infection during the 2015/2016 season. Children with a documented prior DENV infection or who entered the cohort DENV-naïve and had no documented DENV infections were considered to have known DENV infection histories. Among children with a documented prior DENV infection, those who entered the cohort DENV-naïve and had a single documented DENV infection were considered as having primary DENV immunity, while those who entered the cohort DENV-immune and experienced one or more DENV infections and those who entered the cohort DENV-naïve and had two or more DENV infections were considered as having secondary DENV immunity.
