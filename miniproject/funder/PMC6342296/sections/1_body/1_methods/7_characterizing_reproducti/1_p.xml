<p>To estimate the effective reproduction number (

 <sub>e</sub>) during the early phase of the Zika epidemic in Managua, we employed the generalized-growth method (GGM) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which links the generation interval of the disease [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with case incidence series to extract transmission potential over time [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The power of the GGM lies in its flexibility to produce a range of growth dynamics values via 2 parameters: the growth rate (
 <italic>r</italic>) and the epidemic growth scaling (
 <italic>p</italic>). This growth dynamics value ranges from constant incidence (
 <italic>p =</italic> 0) to exponential growth (
 <italic>p =</italic> 1) [
