<p>Acute (at presentation, day 1–5 after onset of symptoms) and convalescent (day 14–21 after onset of symptoms) blood samples were collected from participants presenting to the HCSFV with (1) fever or feverishness with 2 or more of the following symptoms: headache, muscle ache, joint pain, retro-orbital pain, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, or leukopenia (1975–1997 WHO dengue case definition [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]); (2) fever or feverishness with 2 or more of the following: nausea/vomiting, rash, aches and pains, positive tourniquet test, leukopenia, or any warning sign (2009 WHO dengue case definition [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]); (3) undifferentiated fever; or (4) rash, regardless of additional signs and symptoms. The fourth category was included starting February 2016. A urine sample was collected from participants meeting these testing definitions and presenting Monday to Friday, 7 AM to 5 PM. RNA was extracted from acute serum and, as available, urine samples (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Qiagen) and tested by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) for ZIKV, DENV, and chikungunya virus RNA. Testing was performed in multiplex for the 3 viral RNAs [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Paired acute and convalescent samples were tested using in-house ZIKV and DENV IgM antibody capture ELISAs (MAC-ELISA) and ZIKV and DENV inhibition ELISAs (iELISA) [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, pre- and post-infection (i.e., 2016 and 2017) annual samples were analyzed using a ZIKV NS1 blockade-of-binding (BOB) ELISA [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002726.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. An algorithm was developed to integrate qualitative results from the 2 MAC-ELISAs and the ZIKV NS1 BOB assay, as well as quantitative results from the iELISAs (see below). Illness episodes meeting the testing definition were considered Zika cases (i.e., symptomatic ZIKV infections) if (1) ZIKV RNA was detected by rRT-PCR in serum and/or urine and/or (2) serological test results were consistent with a ZIKV infection using the algorithm developed. Participants whose paired annual samples (i.e., 2016 and 2017) showed a ZIKV NS1 BOB ELISA seroconversion but who were not identified as a Zika case were considered to have experienced an inapparent ZIKV infection. Total ZIKV infections refers to all identified ZIKV infections, whether a Zika case or an inapparent ZIKV infection.
