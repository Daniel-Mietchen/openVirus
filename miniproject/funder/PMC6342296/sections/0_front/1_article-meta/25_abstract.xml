    <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was introduced into the Americas—a region with high levels of dengue virus (DENV) immunity—in 2015.</p>

    <p>Immunity generated by infection with one DENV serotype impacts the outcomes of subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Because ZIKV and DENV are closely related flaviviruses, it is possible that pre-existing DENV immunity may also impact susceptibility to Zika.</p>

    <p>In 2016, we followed the introduction and spread of ZIKV in a large, long-term cohort of children in Managua, Nicaragua, to determine who was infected with ZIKV and, of those, who developed symptomatic infection. For most of these children, the history of prior DENV infection had been well characterized.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>We found that children with prior DENV infection had lower rates of symptomatic Zika than children who did not have prior DENV infection.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>However, we found that prior DENV immunity did not affect the overall rate of ZIKV infection in children.</p>

   <list-item>
    <p>These findings support the idea that prior DENV immunity might cross-protect against symptomatic Zika.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item>
    <p>Future studies are required to address the immunological mechanisms of cross-protection observed, as well as to examine whether prior DENV immunity impacts severe ZIKV infection outcomes such as neurological or congenital syndromes.</p>
