  <title>Dynamics of diversity motifs for avian (A, C, E, G) and human (B. D, F, H) H5N1 influenza A virus proteomes.</title>
  <p>(A–F) Motif incidence (index, major, minor, unique, and nonatypes) in relation to increased total variants incidence. (G–H) Violin plot depicting the frequency distribution of the incidences for the various motifs. The colours for panels A–F follow the labels in panels G–H. The width of the plot (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis) represents the frequency distribution of a given incidence of the indicated motif. The wider the plot, the higher the frequency.
