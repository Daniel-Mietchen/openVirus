  <title>Sequence diversity motifs</title>
  <p>The classification of sequences at a given aligned nonamer position as characteristic diversity motifs is shown above for a model nonamer position of 20 sequences. The sequences are ranked according to their incidences. The sequence with the highest incidence (8/20) is classified as the “Index” nonamer, and all others are considered as “Total variants”. The most prevalent sequence among the total variants is classified as the “Major” variant, present in 5 of the 20 isolates. “Minor” variants comprise of sequences that are of lower incidence than the major variant, but are observed more than once; in this case, two distinct sequences, each repeated once, comprised the “Minor” variants (4/20). The three distinct sequences that are observed only once form the “Unique” variants group (3/20). The incidence of “Nonatypes”, which refers to all distinct variant nonamers (6/20), includes one major variant, two minor variants, and three unique variants for this model position.
