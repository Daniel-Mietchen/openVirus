  <title>T-cell epitope prediction patterns of sequences from randomly selected nonamer positions of different conservation levels, compared between avian and human hosts. Only prediction for HLA class I was performed</title>
  <p>Index sequences are in bold, a dot represents similar amino acid as the index sequence, a “-” represents indel. Sequences in red are predicted to be epitopes, whereas those in black are predicted non-epitopes. Cells in yellow indicate sequences shared by both hosts.</p>
