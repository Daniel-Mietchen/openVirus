<p>Herein, we address the issue through a comprehensive quantitative bioinformatics analyses of both avian and human H5N1 IAV protein sequences reported in public databases. Influenza A virus sequence data is publicly available in specialized repositories, such as the Influenza Research Database (

In order to analyze the diversity in the context of the immune system (antigenic diversity), the bioinformatics analyses were performed on aligned nonamer sequences, overlapping by eight residues (1–9, 2–10, etc.), where each of the sequences at the nonamer positions represents a potential ligand of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs) (

This proteome-wide, quantitative characterization of H5N1 IAV sequence change provides data relevant to the design of therapeutics that overcome the diversity of the virus, besides additional possible utility of the data for diagnostics and surveillance purposes.
