 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Heiny et al. (2007)</xref> had performed a large-scale analyses on the evolutionary diversity of several influenza A virus subtypes in the context of the immune system and reported that H5N1 has a high mutational variability for proteins of both avian and human strains. A continuing goal is a greater understanding of H5N1 IAV proteome sequence diversity, the dynamics of mutation, and effective strategies to overcome the diversity for vaccine design. Thus, a more detailed, quantitative analyses of H5N1 IAV sequence changes is necessary.
