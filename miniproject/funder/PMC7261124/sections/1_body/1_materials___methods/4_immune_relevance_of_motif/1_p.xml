<p>Motif switching positions were studied for their immune-relevance by use of T-cell epitope and B-cell antigenicity prediction tools (

 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et al., 2019</xref>). Only index switching positions were analyzed for this, given the relevance of the index sequence for vaccine target selection. There were only a total of nine such positions across both the avian and human viral proteomes; one was not analyzed due to low sequence number support. The index sequence at a given index switching position was the major variant in the preceding position, while the major variant at the given position was the preceding index sequence. Thus, predicting the immune relevance of the index and the major variant at the index switching position alone would be indicative of a loss or gain of an epitope, relative to each other. NetCTL (

 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>) was used for class II DR supertypes by predicting for 15 representative HLA alleles (DRB1_0101, DRB1_0701, DRB1_0901, DRB1_1101, DRB1_1201, DRB1_1501, DRB5_0101, DRB1_0401, DRB1_0405, DRB1_0802, DRB1_0301, DRB1_1301, DRB3_0101, DRB3_0202, DRB4_0103, DRB4_0101); a peptide was considered as putative epitope if prediction was positive for at least half of the alleles of the respective DR supertype. Bepipred 2.0 (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Jespersen et al., 2017</xref>), accessed through Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), and LBtope (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Singh, Ansari &amp; Raghava, 2013</xref>) were used for prediction of linear B-cell epitopes because they were among the latest benchmarked tools available. The respective default thresholds of these two tools were used to evaluate the antigenicity of the nonamer peptides (index and major) at the index switching positions.
