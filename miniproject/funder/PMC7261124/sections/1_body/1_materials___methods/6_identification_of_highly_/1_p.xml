<p>Highly conserved sequences, with extremely low entropy, are attractive candidates for vaccine target selection as they are evolutionarily robust. Nonamer positions of index incidences ≥ 99% in avian viruses and those completely conserved in human viruses (index incidence of 100%) were selected. Such sequences that overlapped at least one amino acid or were immediately adjacent to each other (not separated by one or more amino acid position) were concatenated. The index sequence incidence criteria of ≥ 99% in avian was chosen because no sequences of at least nine amino acid length were shared between the two viral hosts at 100% incidence. It should be noted that within the concatenated sequences, the starting amino acid of the joined index nonamer sequences are shown in small case. An implication of this is that not all amino acids of the concatenated sequence may meet the incidence criteria set for the index nonamer sequence. Index sequences that were common to viruses of both hosts were further selected for assessment of immunogenicity by searching against reported human T-cell epitopes in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (
