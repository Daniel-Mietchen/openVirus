<p>The index sequence incidences across all the nonamer positions were categorized into three levels of conservation, to study the proteome distribution of conserved and variable sequences: 1) Highly conserved (index incidence ≥ 90%), 2) Highly diverse (index incidence ≤ 20%), and 3) Mixed-variable (index incidence between 90% and 20%). The dynamics of T-cell epitopes for both avian and human H5N1 IAV were studied by randomly selecting three nonamer positions for each conservation level, which corresponded to both hosts –highly conserved (PA: 297–305, PB1: 673–681, and PA: 244–252), highly diverse (only one position qualified for this level; HA: 170–178) and mixed-variable (PB2: 361–369, PA: 59–67, HA: 497–505). The immune relevance of all the unique nonamer sequences (nonatypes) at the selected positions were studied by use of NetCTL (
