<p>Entropy measure is also dependent on the number of sequences in the alignment. Thus, the entropy value was corrected for size bias through a statistical adjustment as described in 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2008)</xref>. Any nonamer sequence with a gap (-) or an ambiguous character (B, asparagine or aspartic acid; J, leucine or isoleucine; X, unspecified or unknown amino acid; and Z, glutamine or glutamic acid) was removed from the analyses.
