<p>The viral protein sequences of each host were deduplicated by use of JalView (
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>) to minimize bias and then aligned by use of the multiple sequence alignment program Clustal Omega (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). All alignments were manually checked and corrected for any inconsistencies, empty columns, gaps and misalignments. Alignment positions that contained 95% or more gaps (insertions or deletions) were removed from the dataset as they had reduced statistical support and can result in artificial diversity measures (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2008</xref>). Alignment positions described in this manuscript are based on the alignment generated from the data used herein.
