<p>As there can only be a single major mutation at a variant nonamer position, by definition, therefore, the scope of different sequences of this motif is strictly limited. Thus, sequence diversity of influenza is embodied in minor and unique mutations, which can exist as many different sequences at the variant nonamer positions. This is particularly for positions with more than 50% total variants, where the minor variants, each with an individual incidence less than or equal to the major variant, were collectively the dominant variant population for most of the positions. Notably, for a small fraction of the positions (&lt;2%), the combined incidence of the minor variants was greater than the predominant index. Minor variants are, thus, a highly dynamic variant population of the proteome; they are a product of the interplay between fitness-selection and continued mutation of the index sequences and major variants. The different sequences of the minor variants alone present a spectrum of sequences that could escape immune recognition or act as altered peptide ligands, affecting the recall of pre-existing immunity (
