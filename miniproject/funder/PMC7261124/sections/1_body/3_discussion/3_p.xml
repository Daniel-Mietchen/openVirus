<p>The major mutation, which by definition must have an incidence of less than that of the index, is limited to a maximum incidence of 50% and must decrease with decreasing incidence of the index. In general, a large proportion (âˆ¼93% for both avian and human viruses) of the major variants had an incidence of &lt;25%, with some of the remaining nearly matching the incidence of the index as total variants increased to more than 50%. The dominance of an index that is an antigenic epitope is challenged by the major variant with increasing total variants, alluding to the possibility of an index switch (
