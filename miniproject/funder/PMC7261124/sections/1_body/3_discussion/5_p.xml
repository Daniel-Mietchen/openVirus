<p>Notably, there was no significant change in the incidence of the unique variants at the positions with more than 50% total variants, unlike in the case of HIV-1 clade B viruses (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), where it increased dramatically for the hyper-variable positions (≥90% total variants); these positions do not exist for H5N1 IAV. Although the average proteome-wide incidence of the unique variants was about 1%, thus, posing questions on their validity, they were observed at the majority of the proteome nonamer positions and, for some, attained a higher incidence (maximum ∼14%) as total variants increased. Similarly, nonatypes, a measure of distinct variant sequences, was chiefly of low incidence (proteome-wide average: ∼2% and ∼3% for avian and human viruses), with increase in incidence (to a maximum of ∼21% and ∼22%, respectively) nearing positions with total variants of ∼79% and ∼64%, respectively. Such positions, which comprised largely of different minor and unique variants, represent selected hotspots for mutation, with implications for viral immune evasion. Notably, the lack of highly diverse positions, where the difference in incidence between the different motifs, including the index, is almost negligible and that switch of motif prevalence is possible, suggests a relatively dominant role of the index sequences for H5N1 viruses.
