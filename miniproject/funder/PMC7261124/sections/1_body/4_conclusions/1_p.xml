<p>Being an RNA virus, H5N1 IAV is prone to a high mutation rate resulting in a population of related yet distinct viruses, which pose a challenge in vaccine design. This work elucidates and provides important insights on avian and human H5N1 IAV antigenic sequence diversity. Nearly all of the nonamer positions of each viral protein for the two viral hosts had at least one variant sequence; significant variability was observed at certain nonamer positions across both the viral proteomes. Despite the marked variability in the proteome, the majority of the nonamer positions had a highly conserved sequence each, with â‰¥90% incidence, and the pattern of conservation was grossly similar between the proteins of the avian and human viruses. Consequently, the effects of sequence change to T-cell epitopes were grossly similar between the two viral hosts. Chiefly, analysed nonatypes of both viral hosts were predicted as non-epitopes, indicating that they may escape immune recognition, possibly leading to pathogenesis. Sequence variants of both host populations appear to further support immune evasion with continued sequence change. However, based on our observation, select positions indicate conservation of immune recognition despite significant sequence change, including non-conserved substitutions. Such positions merit further investigation to better understand the pressures that may be subverting immune escape. This study provides a catalogue of all the mutational changes involved in the dynamics of H5N1 IAV diversity for both avian and human host populations. Each of the diversity motifs exhibited a distinctive pattern and together they represented intrinsic patterns in the structure-function organization of the different sequences in H5N1 IAV quasispecies fitness-selection.</p>
