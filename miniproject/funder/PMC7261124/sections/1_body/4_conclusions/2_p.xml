<p>Development of an effective vaccine that is able to keep pace with the diversity of the virus is exceptionally challenging. A subtle mutational change may have adverse effect on vaccine efficacy. Hence, highly conserved sequences are thought as a solution in selecting vaccine targets that are representative of the majority of influenza viruses, and raise hope for the possibility of a universal vaccine. Index switching raises concern on the usability of conserved sequences for this purpose. However, only one index switching position was observed for H5N1 IAV among the highly conserved sequences (defined as positions with incidence of â‰¥80%), and thus, the conserved sequence at this single position can be excluded for vaccine target selection. We expect a similar observation for other IAV subtypes and possibly other viruses, given the constraints to maintain function at highly conserved positions. In summary, this study has demonstrated the presence of H5N1 IAV sequences that are conserved within and between the viruses of the host populations, with some reported as immune targets and exhibiting conservation that goes beyond H5N1 IAV, covering several major subtypes. The selected highly conserved sequences merit further investigation as vaccine targets.</p>
