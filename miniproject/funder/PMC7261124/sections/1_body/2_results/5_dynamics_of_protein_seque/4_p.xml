<p>The minor variants, defined as sequences less prevalent than the major variant but occurred more than once, were collectively the predominant variant motif for majority of the positions with index incidence of &lt;50%. Unique variants comprised the remaining population of variant sequences. They represent viral strains observed only once in the recorded virus population. They were characteristically distinctive for being present at nearly all of the positions with non-zero total variants, including the highly conserved positions. The incidence of unique variants progressively increased, with a maximum incidence of ∼11–14% for viruses of avian and human hosts, respectively, as total variants inceased; this was despite the presence of other variant motifs. The fact that the unique variants were present at nearly all of the nonamer positions, including highly conserved, of every protein (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">S3</xref>), indicates that they are not artifacts of sequencing or premature sequences. Nonatypes, a measure of different variant sequences at a given position, were generally of low incidence (proteome-wide average: ∼2% and ∼3%) with the highest incidence of ∼21% and ∼22% at positions corresponding to total variants of ∼79% and ∼64% (avian and human viruses, respectively), which principally comprised of different minor and unique variants.
