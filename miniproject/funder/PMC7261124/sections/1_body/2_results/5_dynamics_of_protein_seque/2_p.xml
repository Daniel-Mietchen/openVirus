<p>The distinctive character of the dynamics of the individual variant motifs for the H5N1 IAV proteomes from avian and human hosts is demonstrated by the relationship between motif concentration and increased mutations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Figs. 3A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">3F</xref>). The decrease in conservation, represented by decline of index sequence incidences from 100% to ∼18%, was inversely proportional to the increase in total variants incidences, 0% to ∼82%. This inverse relationship appeared to be in a continuum for positions with total variants of less than 50%, but became sparsely distributed closer to the maximum observed total variants.
