<p>Each of the three variant motifs (major, minor, and unique) displayed a characteristic pattern of incidence change in relation to increased total variants. The major variant, which by definition does not exceed the incidence of the index sequence, exhibited a restrictive pyramidal incidence pattern. As such, the major variant can have a maximum incidence at 50% total variants, limited by the incidence of the index. Prior to the peak incidence, the major variant increases in incidence with increased total variants and reducing index incidence. However, a reverse is observed for the major variant after the peak incidence; its incidence starts decreasing with the continued decrease in index incidence.</p>
