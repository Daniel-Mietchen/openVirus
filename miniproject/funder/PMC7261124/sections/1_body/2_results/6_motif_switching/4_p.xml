<p>Nonamer positions that exhibited index switching were observed to be generally non-immune relevant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Table S4</xref>). Six of the eight positions were predicted to be non-immune relevant for both the index and the major variant; and thus, no epitope gain. One position had both the index (94 YIVEKINPA 102 in HA of the human viral proteome) and the major variant (YIVEKINPV) predicted to be HLA class I supertype-restricted epitope (A2 and A26 for each); and thus, no epitope loss. The other one position (214 KKSYLIRAL 222 in PB1 of the human viral proteome) only had the major variant (KRSYLIRAL) predicted as a supertype-restricted epitope (B27 and B39), with the dominant index as non-epitope (epitope loss). Thus, in summary, seven positions showed no change between the preceding and the index switching position; with only one exhibiting a putative T-cell epitope loss. Similarly, none of the eight positions were predicted to be immune-relevant for HLA Class II DR supertype and linear B-cell epitope; and thus, no change for all the positions. On a separate note, of the eight index switching positions, only one was highly conserved with a ∼82% intra-subtype (H5N1) incidence, and the remaining were of higher variability with intra-subtype (H5N1) incidence of below 55%, to as low as ∼18% (
