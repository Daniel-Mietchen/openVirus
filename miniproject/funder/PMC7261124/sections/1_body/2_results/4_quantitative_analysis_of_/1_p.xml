<p>The protein sequence diversity of H5N1 IAV was further examined by quantitative analysis of characteristic diversity motifs at each of the aligned nonamer positions of the two viral proteomes. There were 19 nonamer-position deletions in human viruses compared to one amongst avian viruses) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Tables S2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">S3</xref>). An example of the quantitative analysis is shown with 13 aligned nonamer positions of HA (158–178) (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The dataset for each of the 13 aligned nonamer positions contained 2,349 to 2,353 sequences. The first position, HA (158-166) was the most conserved with an entropy of ∼0.6, and index nonamer incidence of ∼92%. The remaining, small fraction (∼8%) of the aligned sequences at this position consisted of a major variant (∼5%), minor variants (∼2%), and unique variants (&lt;1%). The incidence of the distinct variant nonamer sequences (nonatypes) at this position was approximately 1%, represented by the single major variant and different minor and unique variants. In contrast, the last position, HA (170–178), of the selected 13 nonamer positions was highly diverse, with a high entropy of ∼4.1 and a low index incidence of ∼18%. The total variants (∼82%) of the aligned nonamers at this position comprised of ∼14% major, ∼66% minor, and ∼2% unique, with a nonatypes incidence of ∼4%. The remaining HA nonamer positions (159–177) were of mixed-variability, with index incidences of between 20–90%.
