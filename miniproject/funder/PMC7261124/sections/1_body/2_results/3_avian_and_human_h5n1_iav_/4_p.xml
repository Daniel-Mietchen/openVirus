<p>Entropy of one was achieved at total variants as low as ∼12% for avian viruses and ∼14% for human viruses. Entropy values of 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and the maximum of ∼4.4 were achieved for avian viruses at total variants of ∼29%, ∼46%, ∼63% and ∼73%, respectively. Likewise, it was at ∼35% (entropy of 2.0), ∼58% (entropy of 3.0), ∼78% (entropy of 4.0), and ∼79% (maximum entropy of ∼4.1) total variants for human viruses.</p>
