<p>Each of the H5N1 IAV proteins was found to contain at least a position with a total variants incidence of more than 40%, and a few proteins were with a total variants incidence of more than 60% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). The entropy and total variants showed a positive correlation and a similar pattern between avian and human viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). Entropy was zero at all positions that were completely conserved, characterized by the presence of only one distinct sequence at the position (0% total variants). As total variants increased, the range of possible entropy values describing the diversity also increased, with an inflection at approximately 50% total variants, where the entropy range started decreasing, albeit with an increasing value. Notably, there were no positions with total variants higher than 83% in avian viruses and 80% in human viruses, respectively.
