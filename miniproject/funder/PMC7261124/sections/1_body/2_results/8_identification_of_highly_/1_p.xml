<p>A total of 302 and 320 nonamer index sequences were identified to meet the conservation criteria of ≥ 99% incidence and 100% incidence for avian and human viruses, respectively. Concatenation of these sequences resulted in 52 and 69 highly conserved, distinct sequences for avian and human H5N1 viruses, respectively. These sequences were found in each of the viral proteins of both hosts, except in M2. Twenty-five (25) of these sequences were shared between viruses of the two hosts, with a match of at least nine consecutive amino acids. Twelve (12) of these shared sequences were found to match at least nine consecutive amino acids of 30 reported human T-cell epitopes in IEDB (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), many of which were restricted to multiple HLA alleles, thus relevant to a larger proportion of the human population. Additionally, 12 of the 25 shared sequences were pan-subtype conserved as they matched at least nine consecutive amino acids of sequences reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Heiny et al. (2007)</xref> that were conserved across H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2 subtypes (≥80% incidence in each subtype). Eight (8) of these 12 were also those that matched the reported T-cell epitopes (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
