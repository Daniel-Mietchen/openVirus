<p>Randomly selected nonamer positions corresponding to H5N1 IAV of both avian and human hosts were analyzed for effects of sequence change to T-cell epitopes at the three conservation levels (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6">Table S5</xref>). Number of nonatypes for the avian viruses ranged from eight to 104 at these positions (highly conserved: three (3); mixed-variable: three (3); and highly diverse: only one such position). Nonatypes for the human viruses ranged from eight to 24. Index sequences were shared between viruses of the two viral hosts for all the positions studied. Similarly, for all these positions, majority of the nonatypes for the human viruses were shared with the avian viruses. The shared sequences were generally non-epitopic. The human H5N1 IAV non-shared sequences were generally also non-epitopic. The avian H5N1 IAV non-shared sequences were generally also non-epitopic, sans for one mixed-variable position 497-505.
