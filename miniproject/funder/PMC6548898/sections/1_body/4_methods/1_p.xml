<p>This study took place within the SHCS. The SHCS is a nationwide prospective cohort study that, since 1988, routinely collects clinical and epidemiological data from HIV-positive persons aged â‰¥ 18 years. The SHCS has been approved by the ethics committee of the participating centers and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The prospectively collected data comprise behavioral and clinical information as well as laboratory measurements, including routine HCV antibody screening for incident infections and HCV RNA to detect reinfections. We estimate that more than 80% of all MSM diagnosed with HIV in Switzerland are followed within the cohort network [

For genome sequencing, we included all MSM with HCV subtype 1a replicating infections who had plasma samples available for sequencing. We refer to these as Swiss MSM sequences.
