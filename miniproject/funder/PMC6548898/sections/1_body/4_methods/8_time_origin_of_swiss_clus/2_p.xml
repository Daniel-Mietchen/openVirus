<p>For this purpose, we reinferred Swiss transmission clusters with 5 or more members using BEAST [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which resulted in time trees for each of these clusters. Our estimations of a clusters’ origins corresponded to the heights of such time trees. BEAST analyses utilized the general time-reversible substitution model with invariant sites (GTRI) with gamma-distributed rate variation (in accordance with the ML estimation depicted above) and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock model [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Birth-Death Skyline Serial model implemented in BEAST provided a surrogate HCV transmission model [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> provides further details on the parameterization of this analysis. The results reported here correspond to runs that reached Markov chain Monte Carlo chain lengths of 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>. The minimum effective sample sizes across estimated parameters was &gt;800.
