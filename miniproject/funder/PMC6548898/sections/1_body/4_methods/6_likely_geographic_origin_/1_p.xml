<p>We classified our study sequences as corresponding to transmissions likely to have occurred by contact with MSM living either in Switzerland or abroad, and termed them domestic or international transmissions, respectively. We classified a study sequence as corresponding to domestic transmission if it was located in a Swiss transmission cluster, and as corresponding to international transmission if it was located in an international transmission cluster. A transmission cluster was defined as Swiss when the fraction of its sequences that were Swiss equaled or exceeded a given threshold named Swiss dominance criterion. We studied Swiss dominance criteria ranging between 50% and 90%. Likely geographic origin of sequences found to belong to more than 1 cluster was determined based on the most internal cluster or pair they belonged to.</p>
