<p>We compared 66 Swiss MSM sequences with a set of background sequences, which included 33 derived from incident infections in persons enrolled in the SHCS with HIV transmission risk other than MSM, 81 from chronic infections in persons enrolled in the SHCS, and 293 sequences retrieved from public databases [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to identify relevant background sequences by means of similarity criteria with respect to the sequences obtained for this study. We used RAxML [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] to infer maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees assuming a general time reversible with invariant sites (GTRI) model with gamma-distributed substitution rates with 4 categories. One hundred replicates resulted in an estimation of the best tree and bootstrap supporting values for each bipartition.
