<p>HCV RNA genome sequences were generated by amplification of almost full-length HCV RNA followed by massive parallel sequencing. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma stored in the SHCS biobank (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shcs.ch" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.shcs.ch</ext-link>) by an automated nucleic acid extractor (EasyMag, BioMerieux) [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Nucleospin RNA Virus Kit (Macherey-Nagel). RNA was then amplified by RT-PCR. A MiSeq (Illumina) instrument was utilized for sequencing. Finally, a consensus sequence was generated for each HCV isolate by iterative sequence alignment against an HCV reference sequence with SmaltAlign (Institute of Medical Virology, University of ZÃ¼rich). The HCV isolate H77 (GenBank accession number 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_004102" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NC_004102</ext-link>) served as reference sequence. Our near full-length sequencing spanned nucleotides 62 to 9376 of this reference. To allow comparison with international sequences we focused on the 436 base pair fragment coding for the C-terminal part of the NS5B region, because this segment is relatively abundant in public databases [

 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
