<p>We identified time changes in the fraction of infections attributable to domestic (versus international) transmission by timing the transmission events associated with our study sequences. As a proxy for transmission time, we used branching times involving our study sequences in a time tree. This time tree was constructed using BEAST by the same method as above and included the same set of sequences as for the ML tree. For this estimation, we only considered branching times corresponding to nodes with posterior probabilities â‰¥70%.</p>
