<p>Fifty percent (30/60; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) of Swiss MSM sequences located in MSM transmission clusters or pairs were located in cluster C1, consisting predominantly of Swiss and German sequences. This cluster contained subtransmission clusters C4, C8, and tree transmission pairs, all consisting only of Swiss sequences and including 13 Swiss MSM sequences in total. Eighteen percent of study sequences (11/60) were located in cluster C2, consisting predominantly of Swiss and British sequences. The Swiss part of this cluster is a Swiss-only subtree, but the bootstrap support value for this subtree (60%) does not fulfil the criteria for a transmission cluster as defined for this study. Six sequences could not be linked to any transmission cluster. Overall, 50% (33/66) of Swiss MSM sequences were located in Swiss-only clusters or transmission pairs.
