 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the fractions of study sequences classified as domestic, international, and unknown transmission for a range of Swiss dominance criteria (minimum percentage of sequences in the clusters that are required to classify a cluster as Swiss). When this criterion was set to 50% or 60%, 80% and 79% of sequences were classified as domestic transmission, respectively. When the criterion was raised to 90%, half of the sequences were classified as domestic transmission.
