<p>Ninety-one percent (60/66) of the Swiss MSM sequences were located within 14 MSM transmission clusters (7 nested, ie, embedded in larger clusters) and 12 transmission pairs (8 nested) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The mean within-cluster patristic distance was 0.27% (range 0%–0.68%). This value fulfils commonly used criteria for clustering (eg, 1%–10%), and therefore provides further support for the adopted cluster definition based on bootstrap values. Only 2 study sequences clustered or paired with sequences from men enrolled in the SHCS who reported intravenous drug use as the most likely mode of HIV transmission. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> displays all transmission clusters and pairs containing study sequences. The median number of identifiable countries in clusters that were not Swiss-only clusters was 4 (range 2–9).
