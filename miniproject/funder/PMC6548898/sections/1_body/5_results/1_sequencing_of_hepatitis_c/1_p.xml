<p>Overall, by means of Illumina technology we obtained 99 HCV subtype 1a genomes from persons who were diagnosed with HCV infections between 1999 and 2016. Sixty-six were from 63 MSM (3 reinfections) and constitute our study sequences, that is the Swiss MSM sequences. The Swiss MSM sequences accounted for 66% of infections with this genotype diagnosed in MSM enrolled in the SHCS during the study period. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the characteristics of the MSM participants. Patients’ median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 41–51) and 75% (47/63) ever reported inconsistent condom use with occasional partners. Fifty-four percent (34/63) and 14% (9/63) reported the use of any or intravenous recreational drugs, respectively. Previous publications have described in detail HIV/HCV coinfected MSM enrolled in the SHCS [
