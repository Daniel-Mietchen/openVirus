<p>The sensitivity analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) supports the observation, derived from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, that the contribution of domestic transmission increased over time. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref> suggests that changing sampling rates do not explain the increasing trend in domestic transmission displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. The simulated fraction attributable to domestic transmission (for 80% dominance criterion) increased from 25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%–25%) between 2000 and 2007 to 82% (CI, 51%–85%) between 2008 and 2016 (versus 54% and 85% for the same time periods in the main analysis). These results suggest that our main findings were robust to variations in sampling density.
