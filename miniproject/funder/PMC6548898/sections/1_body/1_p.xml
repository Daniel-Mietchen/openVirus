<p>Rapid scale-up of early direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for HCV is ongoing in many European and non-European countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as reimbursement restrictions are progressively relieved. Projections from mathematical models for several Western countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>] and early surveillance data from The Netherlands and Switzerland support the claim that DAA scale-up may abate the high incidence of HCV in HIV-positive MSM [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15–18</xref>].
