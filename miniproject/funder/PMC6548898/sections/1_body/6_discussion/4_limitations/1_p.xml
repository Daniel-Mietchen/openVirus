<p>This analysis relied on public databases to obtain background international sequences. While a large number of these were included, the fact that European countries may be unevenly represented in GenBank, is a limitation of this study. Our estimations on linkages of the Swiss epidemic to specific countries were therefore likely biased. The segment of the HCV genome that we chose for these analyses was the one that resulted in the most suitable set of background sequences, in particular because it has been the basis of other phylogenetic analyses across Europe [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, countries such as France and Italy were likely under-represented in our analyses (only 8 and 3 sequences, respectively, were included). More even sampling rates across geographic regions, as well as increased sequencing of longer regions of the HCV genome, should improve estimates of transmission patterns in the future [
