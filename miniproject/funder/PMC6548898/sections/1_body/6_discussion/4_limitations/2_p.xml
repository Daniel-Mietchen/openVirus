<p>The fact that the number of international HCV sequences available from public databases declined towards the end of the study period is also a potential limitation of this study. It could potentially have led to overestimations of the contribution of domestic transmission towards the end of the study period. However, the contribution of domestic transmission started to increase early on, before this disparity could have had any effect. Moreover, the estimated time trend in domestic versus international transmission held true when subjected to a sensitivity analysis that assumed a set of hypothetical international sequences iteratively attaching to the transmission clusters, which deliberately decreased the likelihood of domestic transmission. Finally, potential under-reporting of intravenous drug injection may have prevented us from recognizing more transmission bridges between MSM and persons who inject drugs.</p>
