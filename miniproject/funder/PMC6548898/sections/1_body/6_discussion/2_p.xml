<p>Our analyses suggest that the initial cases of sexually transmitted HCV in MSM in Switzerland are mainly attributable to international transmissions among MSM, and not to spillovers between persons who inject drugs and MSM within Switzerland. Swiss-domestic HCV transmission among MSM has grown over time. This implies that intensive test-and-treat interventions at the national level are likely to succeed. This notion is supported by data from Switzerland, where the Swiss HCVree Trial, a test-treat-and-counsel study [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17â€“18</xref>] has been followed by a decline in the number of cases of acute HCV infections among MSM in the SHCS. Importantly, early data from the Netherlands also indicate declines in incident cases in this population after introduction of universal access to DAA therapy [
