<p>This molecular epidemiology study suggests that both Swiss domestic and international HCV transmission contribute substantially to the HCV epidemic among HIV-positive MSM in Switzerland. The relative contribution of international transmission declined with time and gave way to domestic transmission as the major source of infections. We found no significant trace of transmission bridging from persons who became infected with HIV through drug injection and MSM within Switzerland, suggesting that the HCV epidemics in these 2 HIV transmission groups are likely disconnected. This is in line with a former phylogenetic study of HIV transmission in Switzerland were only 2% of HIV sequences from persons who inject drugs clustered with those from MSM [

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], our study could not assess frequencies of HCV transmission routes (ie, traumatic sex versus intravenous drug use).
