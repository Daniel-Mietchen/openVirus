<p>The relative magnitude of domestic versus international HCV transmission could be a key parameter for the success of isolated national treatment strategies. National microelimination and prevention programs can only be successful if a significant fraction of infections is acquired domestically, while international coordination becomes more important with frequent international transmission. Indirect genetic evidence from Switzerland suggests an important role of domestic transmission [
