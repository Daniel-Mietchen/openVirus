  <p>Time trends in the fraction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections attributable to domestic and international transmission. This classification assumed an 80% dominance criterion and was derived from the time tree inferred using BEAST 2.0. Branching times involving our study sequences (Swiss men who have sex with men [MSM] sequences) served as proxy for transmission times.</p>
