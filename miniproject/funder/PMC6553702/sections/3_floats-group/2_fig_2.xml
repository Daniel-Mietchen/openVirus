  <title>In vitro growth of four ZIKV strains: MR766-NIID, PRVABC59, ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016, and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016.</title>
  <p>A) Plaques formed in Vero cells following infection with each strain. B and C) Growth curves of the strains following infection of Vero cells (B) and mosquito C6/36 cells (C). Cells were added to 6-well culture plates and infected with the strains at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 PFU/cell. Values represent means Â± standard deviation from three independent experiments. Significance was analyzed using two-way ANOVA (***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
