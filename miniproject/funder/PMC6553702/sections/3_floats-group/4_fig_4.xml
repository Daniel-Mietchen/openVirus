  <title>Viremia levels in ZIKV-infected IFNAR1-KO mice.</title>
  <p>Mice inoculated with the three Asian/American strains, PRVABC59 (n = 6), ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016 (n = 6), and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016 (n = 6), were divided into two groups (three mice/group) and blood was collected at the indicated time points at 2-day intervals: (1,) 3, 5, 7, and 9 days post-infection for group 1; and (1,) 2, 4, 6, and 8 days post-infection for group 2. Sera were prepared and used for quantifying the infectious virus titer (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL). Dotted line: detection limit. Significance was analyzed by performing repeated-measures ANOVA with the TCID
   <sub>50</sub> data from 2 to 8 days post-infection (**
