  <title>Weight of testis (A and B) and epididymis (C and D) of ZIKV-infected IFNAR1-KO mice.</title>
  <p>Mice inoculated with the Asian/American-lineage strains PRVABC59 (n = 6), ZIKV/Hu/Chiba/S36/2016 (n = 6), and ZIKV/Hu/NIID123/2016 (n = 6) were euthanized at 2 weeks (A and C) or 6 weeks (B and D) post-inoculation and the testis and epididymis were collected. Significance of differences in tissue weight was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test (*
