<p>To construct a phylogenetic tree, the nucleotide sequences of 33 ZIKV strains were aligned and analyzed using the maximum likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates using the MEGA7 program [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Complete amino acid sequences of the ZIKV strains were aligned using GENETYX gene-analysis software (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
