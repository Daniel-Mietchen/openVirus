<p>ChibaS36 and NIID123 were originally isolated from, respectively, a patient infected with ZIKV in Fiji in 2016 and a patient infected with ZIKV in Vietnam in 2016 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These viruses were propagated in Vero cells (strain 9013). Vero cells and mosquito-derived C6/36 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 28 °C, respectively, under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin (MEM-10FBS). The infectious titer of the viruses was determined using the plaque assay, as previously described [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, Vero and C6/36 cells were plated in 6-well culture plates (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell. Small aliquots of the culture medium were collected periodically and the titer of the infectious ZIKV in each aliquot was determined using a plaque assay performed on Vero cells. Growth curves were statistically compared using BellCurve for Excel (Social Survey Research Information, Tokyo, Japan) employing a two-way ANOVA test.
