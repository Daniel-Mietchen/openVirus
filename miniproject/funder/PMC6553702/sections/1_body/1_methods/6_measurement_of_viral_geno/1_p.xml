<p>Total RNA was extracted from each organ sample using a High Pure Viral RNA Purification Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). ZIKV RNA was quantified by performing quantitative real-time RT-PCR with Fast Virus One-Step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The ZIKV genome was amplified using the following primers: ZIKV 1086 (5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′), ZIKV 1162c (5′-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′), and Probe ZIKV 1107-FAM (5′FAM-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAGTCAGACACTCAA-TAMRA3′) [
