<p>Interferon-α/β receptor-1 gene-knockout (IFNAR1-KO) C57BL/6 mice were produced, bred, and maintained in a specific-pathogen-free environment as previously described [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Mice (8–16 weeks old) were inoculated with 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of each virus in culture medium diluted with MEM supplemented with 2% FBS (MEM-2FBS) through the subcutaneous route in the footpad. Tissue and fluid samples (serum, brain, spinal cord, kidney, spleen, testis, epididymis, sperm, and epididymal fluid) were collected from the ZIKV-infected mice and the infectious virus and viral RNA levels in the samples were measured. Tissue weights were also determined prior to homogenate preparation. To prepare sperm and epididymal fluid samples, cauda epididymis was placed in a microtube containing 100 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incised 4–5 times with scissors to allow the sperm to swim out and disperse, after which the cauda epididymis was removed and the liquid phase was centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was recovered as the epididymal fluid and the precipitate was resuspended in 100 μL of PBS and used as the sperm sample. The collected tissues (10–200 mg) were homogenized in 500 μL of MEM-2FBS and then used for further analyses.
