<p>Comparison of the amino acid sequences of Asian/American-subtype ZIKV strains revealed differences in several amino acid residues between the subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g009">Fig 9</xref>). The amino acid at position 139 of prM is a serine (139S) in the Southeast Asian subtype, but an asparagine (139N) in the Pacific and American subtypes. This site has been shown to be involved in the ZIKV proliferative activity in neural progenitor cells that causes microcephaly in mice; however, a recent report indicated that a confirmed congenital ZVD case with microcephaly in Thailand was caused by infection with a Southeast Asian-subtype virus harboring 139S [

In contrast, our current results show that the Pacific and American subtypes of the virus produced clearly different pathogenic effects on the testis. However, there are distinct differences between the biological system of the fetal brain and male reproductive organs; thus, pathogenesis caused by ZIKV infection in the fetal brain does not necessarily equate with that in male reproductive organs. Therefore, factors such as variations in NS3, NS5, and other regions, which differ among the three strains, might be associated with ZIKV proliferation and the pathogenic effect on the testis and other male reproductive organs (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Point-by-point analysis performed using a ZIKV reverse-genetics system is required in order to identify the site(s) responsible for efficient proliferation and persistent infection of ZIKV in male reproductive organs.
