<p>In this study, we used only one strain for each ZIKV subtype. Several variations might exist among the strains in each subtype and the strains used in the study might not necessarily reflect the properties of each subtype. Recent reports have indicated that Southeast Asian-subtype strains do not always show lower growth potential in cultured cells or lower virulence in mice compared with American-subtype strains, although the Southeast Asian-subtype strains that were used in these studies were repeatedly passaged in mouse brains [
