<p>In this study, we examined the in vitro and in vivo growth of three ZIKV strains that belong to the three distinct subtypes in the Asian/American lineage. Recent studies have demonstrated that Asian/American lineage ZIKV infection in mice is not lethal, but causes testis damage; this indicates that testis damage in ZIKV-infected mice can be used as an index for assessing ZIKV pathogenicity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we pathologically evaluated the male reproductive organs of mice infected with each of the three strains to determine the differences in pathogenicity among these ZIKV strains.
