<p>The ZIKV genome is comprised of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that encodes three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) in one open reading frame [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. ZIKV is classified into two lineages, African and Asian/American; the recent epidemics associated with severe neurological and congenital abnormalities in Pacific regions and the Americas were caused by the spread of Asian/American-lineage ZIKV from Southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses performed using complete ZIKV genomes indicate that ZIKV strains in the Asian/American lineage can be divided into three subtypes, American, Pacific, and Southeast Asian, which present several differences in their amino acid sequences [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies conducted using a mouse model showed that American-subtype ZIKV strains induce more severe neurological disorders and marked immune responses in mice compared with Southeast Asian-subtype strains [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These findings raise the possibility that recent genetic changes in the ZIKV genome altered the properties of the virus, such as virulence and tissue tropism, and also contributed to the spread of the ZIKV endemic area and the increase in the cases of congenital ZIKV infections in Pacific regions and the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, mutations in prM and NS1 were reported to be involved in the differences between Asian/American-lineage strains in terms of pathogenicity in mice, viral protein antigenemia, and interferon induction in host cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, only a limited number of Asia/American-lineage ZIKV strains were previously used for evaluating virulence; thus, further analyses must be conducted using additional ZIKV isolates to elucidate the relationship between genetic variation and pathogenicity among the Asian/American-lineage strains [
