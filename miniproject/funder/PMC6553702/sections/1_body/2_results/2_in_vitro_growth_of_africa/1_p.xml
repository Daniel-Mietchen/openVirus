<p>The plaques formed on Vero cells by NIID123 were clearly smaller than those formed by each of the other three strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). NIID123 also replicated more slowly than the other three ZIKV strains in Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The growth kinetics of NIID123 and ChibaS36 in C6/36 cells revealed a slower replication rate than that of MR766 and PRVABC59 (
