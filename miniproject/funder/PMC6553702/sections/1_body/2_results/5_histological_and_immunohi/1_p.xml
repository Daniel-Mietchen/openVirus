<p>At 2 weeks post-inoculation, no weight loss was observed in the testis of mice infected with each ZIKV strain (

However, at 6 weeks post-inoculation, testis weight was decreased in 5/6 (83.3%) PRVABC59-infected mice and 1/6 (16.7%) ChibaS36-infected mice; the two groups of mice showed significant differences in the frequencies of testis damage (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007387.s002">S2 Table</xref>). Testis weight loss was not observed in NIID123-infected mice and the frequency of testis damage was also significantly lower than that in PRVABC59-infected mice (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0076, Fisher’s exact test). In all three groups of ZIKV-infected mice, the epididymides were smaller at 6 weeks post-inoculation than at 2 weeks post-inoculation, but epididymis weight did not differ among the groups at the same time points (
