<p>Viral RNA was detected in all specimens collected from PRVABC59- and ChibaS36-infected mice at 2 weeks post-inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007387.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Serum viral RNA levels were significantly higher in PRVABC59-infected mice than in ChibaS36-infected mice. Viral RNA was also detected in the serum of NIID123-infected mice, but the levels were significantly lower than those in the serum of PRVABC59- and ChibaS36-infected mice. Viral RNA levels in the testis were significantly higher in PRVABC59-infected mice than in ChibaS36-infected mice, whereas viral RNA levels in the epididymis, epididymal fluid, and sperm/epididymal cell samples from PRVABC59-infected mice were similar to those in the corresponding samples from ChibaS36-infected mice.
