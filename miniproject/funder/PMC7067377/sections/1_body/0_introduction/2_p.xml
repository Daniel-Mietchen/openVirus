<p>Here, we study a large-scale dataset on spatio-temporally resolved accesses to Wikipedia pages on the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, regarded as a proxy for collective attention to this emerging health threat. The epidemic started in Brazil in 2015 and spread to other parts of South and North America in 2016. This study focuses on attention patterns in the United States throughout 2016, and on their relation to media coverage of the epidemic.</p>
