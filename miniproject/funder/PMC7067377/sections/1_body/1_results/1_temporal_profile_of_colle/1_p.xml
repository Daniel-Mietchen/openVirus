<p>Public attention and media coverage of the 2016 ZIKV epidemic showed a distinct and synchronous temporal pattern, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The daily timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) highlights two distinct peaks of attention in 2016: the first, in the beginning of February 2016, corresponding to the international alert raised by the WHO and by the CDC at national level; the second, in August 2016, corresponding to the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted significant attention due to the health concerns for athletes and the related risk of case importation. Such spikes of attention visibly correspond to similar spikes in the media coverage profiles, both in the TV coverage of the epidemic (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The three time series are indeed highly correlated, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient
