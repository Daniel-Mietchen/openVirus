<p>On the contrary, while the profile of Wikipedia pageviews shows a temporal pattern that is very similar to the one displayed by mentions of Zika in media outlets, the temporal profile of the disease incidence is qualitatively very different. The number of new ZIKV cases in the United States reported by the CDC every week (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007633.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) gradually increased from the beginning of 2016 until the summer, with a peak between the end of August and the beginning of September. Notifications of new cases declined afterwards. Summer 2016 was also characterized by the first reports of local ZIKV transmission in Florida and in Texas, events that were also responsible for an increased news coverage of Zika. However, the surge of reported ZIKV cases in the United States did not result in an increased level of attention with respect to the initial spike observed at the beginning of the outbreak. The epidemic profile is indeed not correlated with the timeline of Wikipedia pageviews (
 <italic>r</italic> = âˆ’0.15, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.26) or the media coverage profiles (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.04, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.80 for TV and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.47, for Web news). Such dynamics of public attention can be ascribed to the initial novelty of the outbreak, which was presented as a novel and serious health threat even in the presence of a small number of imported cases. As the extension of the outbreak and the associated risks became clearer to the public, the interest of Americans in looking for additional information on Wikipedia faded over the course of the year, with relatively smaller increments linked to important events such as the Olympics. Such observation is consistent with the presence of a memory effect in the dynamics of Wikipedia pageviews: individuals retain information for some time before their attention toward a topic is elicited again by novel events or anniversaries [
