<p>While a preferential causal direction between media coverage and Wikipedia pageviews does not emerge from the Granger causality analysis, our results support the idea that the media signal and the pageview timeline are highly synchronized, so that the hypothesis of instantaneous causality is supported, both at daily and weekly scale. On the contrary, the epidemiological ZIKV curve does not show to have a predictive power nor in a Granger-causal framework nor as an instantaneous driver of the public attention.</p>
