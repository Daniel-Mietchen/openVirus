<p>To include the ZIKV incidence timeline in our analysis, we build another VAR model with 4 weekly time series: Zika-related pageviews, TV mentions, Web news and ZIKV incidence. For this model we identify the optimal time lag to be 
 <italic>L</italic> = 2 weeks, based on the Schwartz-Bayes information criterion. A Granger causality test using the VAR(2) model identifies a causal relationship between Wikipedia pageviews and the other variables (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−3</sup>), and a causal relationship between Web news and the other variables (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Again, based on a Wald test, an instantaneous causal relationship between TV captions, Web news and Wikipedia pageviews and the other variables is supported (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−3</sup>). ZIKV incidence, instead, does not Granger-cause the other time series nor there is an instantaneous causal relationship between the epidemic profile and the other variables (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.27).
