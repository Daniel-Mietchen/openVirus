<p>One could argue that local patterns of attention may be influenced by local news and local epidemic events, such as case importations or a local increase of disease prevalence. We tested these hypotheses by comparing Wikipedia pageview counts in each state to Web news mentioning the word “Zika” and the name of the state, and to the local ZIKV incidence profiles. Attention profiles in each state were generally positively correlated to Web news mentioning the name of the state, however the degree of correlation ranged from 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.004 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.98) in Wisconsin to 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.75 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) in Texas, showing significant spatial differences across the country (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s005">S3 Table</xref> in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, ZIKV incidence in each state could explain such geographic variations as a negative driver of attention. On the one hand, local patterns of attention in each state were generally not correlated with disease incidence, with the exception of Montana (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.33, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s006">S4 Table</xref> of the Supporting Information. On the other hand, Web news covering Zika in each state were positively correlated with the local incidence profiles (
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.20) only in 13 states out of 50 (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007633.s007">S5 Table</xref> in the Supporting Information) and, at the same time, these states showed the smallest degree of correlation between news and attention. A direct comparison of the 50 states ranked by degree of correlation between news and ZIKV incidence, and between news and attention, showed a negative rank correlation: weighted Kendall’s 
 <italic>τ</italic> = −0.25 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Overall, in those states where local news were following more closely the local epidemic patterns, the dynamics of public attention was not driven much by news. Instead, local attention patterns followed more closely the state news where the latter was more similar to the national one and less correlated with the local ZIKV epidemiology.
