<p>Data were downloaded from the TV News Archive (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.org/details/tv" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://archive.org/details/tv</ext-link>) which is a research library service launched in September 2012. The service is provided by the Internet Archive which, among other sources, collects and preserves television news. The TV News Archive repurposes closed captioning to enable users to search, quote and borrow U.S. TV news programs. For this study, we collected TV news items by searching all mentions of the word “Zika” in the closed captions of any TV News show aired in the United States in 2016, available from the Archive. For each item, the following information is provided: time, TV station, TV program, text snippet of the caption. In total, the dataset comprises 23,855 timestamped mentions of the word “Zika” from 1,410 different TV programs, both in English and Spanish, aired by 64 U.S. TV stations. We did not limit our query to those languages, since the TV News Archive includes broadcasting networks in other languages too. However, English and Spanish were the only languages resulting from our search. Time series analyzed in our study report the number of mentions of “Zika” that appeared each day in 2016, thus including multiple mentions of the word in the same program.
