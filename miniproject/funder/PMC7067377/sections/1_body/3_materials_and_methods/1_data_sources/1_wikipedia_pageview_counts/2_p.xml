<p>The “Zika virus” and “Zika fever” pages are the only two pages in the English Wikipedia that provide information on the disease (note that “Zika” redirects to “Zika fever”) and on the pathogen causing the disease (“Zika virus”). They were, by far, the most accessed pages among all Zika related articles in the English Wikipedia, with the “Zika virus” page totalling almost 8 million worldwide views in 2016, and about 800,000 worldwide pageviews for “Zika fever”.</p>
