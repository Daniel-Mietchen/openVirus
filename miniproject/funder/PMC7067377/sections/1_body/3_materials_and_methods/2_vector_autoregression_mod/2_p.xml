<p>Using the R package VARS, we perform two causality tests for both models, at daily and weekly scale, testing the causal hypothesis for each variable in the model. The first test is a F-type Granger-causality test. The second is a Wald-type test that is characterized by testing for nonzero correlation between the error processes of the cause and effect variables.</p>
