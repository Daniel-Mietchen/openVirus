<p>The increasing availability of novel data streams, such as social media, Web search queries and participatory surveillance data, provides an invaluable resource to measure and quantify the complex interplay between the spread of information, collective attention and the epidemiology of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recently, Wikipedia pageview data have been increasingly used by researchers in epidemiology and infectious disease modeling [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and, in general, Wikipedia-based forecasting models have been proved successful in the case of endemic or seasonal diseases, such as influenza, dengue or tubercolosis [

On the other hand, our study demonstrates that Wikipedia page viewership can provide a temporally resolved measure of collective attention during epidemic outbreaks caused by novel emerging diseases, at a high spatial granularity. Previous works have investigated the effects of external events on the activity of Wikipedia editors and on the number of pageviews [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007633.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The results of our study add further evidence of the value of Wikipedia data in the field of digital epidemiology, especially for capturing information seeking behavior, and attention patterns during disease outbreaks [
