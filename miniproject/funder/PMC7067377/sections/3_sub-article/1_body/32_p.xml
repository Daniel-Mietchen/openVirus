<p>Although the paper is generally well written, the piece would benefit from some additional copyediting. For example, there appears to be an errant question mark in brackets on page 11 of the PDF. The title also may be somewhat misleading, as I believe this is a study of behavior in the US relative to the Zika outbreak but the 2016 outbreak wasn't limited to the US nor was it really centered in the US, per se. The transmission that actually occurred in the US was quite limited. The authors might just want to revisit how exactly they are framing the phenomenon being studied. There was US transmission but much of the news coverage driving the search behavior reflected international events, unless I am mistaken.</p>
