<p>The authors also miss an opportunity to connect this work to other highly relevant results that have appeared in other journals. Consider, for example, Southwell et al. in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a piece that connects news coverage, search data, and social media data regarding the Zika outbreak discussed here. The story is remarkably similar to what we found and so that would be an important foundational citation for the discussion here. Of course, the outcome measures of information seeking are somewhat different but nonetheless the story of ephemeral effect driven by news coverage that was not completely tied to actual epidemiological patterns is consistent. Beyond that, the authors also have an opportunity to connect this piece with a limited but nonetheless important subset of the communication research literature which has looked at communication as a process unfolding over time and which as a result has included time-based analysis of news effects on behavior.</p>
