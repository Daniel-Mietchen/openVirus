<p>Reviewer #2: This paper attempts to measure the drivers leading to information seeking in Wikipedia during the 2016 U.S. Zika outbreak. Specifically, the authors applied various statistical approaches to compare Wikipedia page view data against U.S. news outlets and TV shows at various spatial resolutions (i.e., national, state, and city level). The authors found that Wikipedia searches were driven by national media coverage and not by the magnitude of the outbreak. Although the methodology used is simple, the results are important for understanding the impact of media exposure on collective population behavior.</p>
