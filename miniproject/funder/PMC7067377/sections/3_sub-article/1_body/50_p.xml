<p>1) I suggest you add Sandman's perspective of risk into your literature and into the interpretation of the results. Sandman in his work on risk perception did a pretty good job explaining why experts perceive risk differently from health organizations such as the CDC. He has a list of what he called outrage factors - like novelty (see Sandman, 1987. Risk Communication: Facing Public Outrage), that could really explain why people in your study seem to have lost interest with time. Paul Slovic had some similar work that could also be implemented here - in any case, I think you should add a discussion of risk perception of laypersons and how it is different from that of experts - both Sandman and Slovic could be useful here. Following their perspective - your results are expected and make sense.</p>
