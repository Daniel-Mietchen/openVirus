<p>Reviewer #3: The authors took my and other reviewers' comments seriously and improved the paper accordingly. The result is a more careful analysis that takes into consideration the methodological and theoretical points raised by the reviewers, while better connecting to recent findings in other studies. I appreciate the hard work given to this manuscript in its original and revised versions. I believe the revised version is of considerable theoretical and practical importance for the fields of health, risk, and crisis communication.</p>
