<p>The age at infection with rubella virus is elevated by vaccination, but if the vaccination coverage is insufficient to prevent major epidemics, the insufficient vaccination programme could be responsible for a tragic increase in the number of CRS cases due to an increased risk of infection among pregnant women.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Thus, once a country decides to aim to eliminate rubella, it is critical to ensure a high level of population immunity, among males and females.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The potential consequence of the 1995 change in the Japanese vaccination policy may be that different birth cohorts have different levels of immunity against rubella.

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In fact, there were two notable characteristics of the rubella cases from the 2012 to 2014 epidemic: (1) 72% of the cases were adults
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and (2) the cases were concentrated in males aged 20–39 years (68%).
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> An explicit assessment of the herd immunity is crucial for planning future ways to control the spread of this disease.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12–18</xref> The present study aimed to statistically analyse the transmission dynamics of rubella in Japan, with a particular emphasis on the most recent major epidemic from 2012 to 2014, and to assess the population level immunity over age and time.
