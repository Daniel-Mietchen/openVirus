<p>To allow an explicit comparison between the herd immunity threshold and the observed representative value of the seropositive fraction, the age-standardised seronegative proportion, m
 <sub>1</sub>, was calculated as a function of time from 1983 to 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009928F4">figure 4</xref>A). The results show that the estimate of m
 <sub>1</sub> steadily dropped in males and females from 1983 to 2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009928F4">figure 4</xref>A). While the seronegative proportions in 1983 were 45.7% (95% CI 32.5% to 58.9%) and 35.6% (95% CI 31.2% to 40.0%) among males and females, respectively, the proportions decreased in 2013 to 18.3% (95% CI 16.8% to 19.8%) and 15.6% (95% CI 10.0% to 21.2%), respectively. When the seropositive proportion was compared against the theoretical herd immunity seropositive threshold calculated using R
 <sub>0</sub>=6.1 (83.6%), the estimate among males was still below the herd immunity threshold, and that among females was only slightly above the threshold value. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009928F4">Figure 4</xref>B shows the number of live births at risk for CRS from 1983 to 2013. The number of susceptible live births in 1983 was calculated as 171 875, which was reduced to 23 697 in 2013. The slope of the decline in
