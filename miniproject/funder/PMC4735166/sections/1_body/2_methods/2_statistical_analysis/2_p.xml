<p>Using serial cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey data from 2003, 2008, and 2013, the distributions of HI titre by age and gender were examined. Owing to the small sample size for each age, discrete age grouping was carried out over every 5 years. For this reason, the seroprevalence was compared by age and time as well as by birth year cohort. Seroconversion, following the convention in Japan (corresponding to results of ≥7.3 IU/mL from ELISA), was defined as an HI titre ≥32.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The basic reproduction number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, acknowledged as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case, was estimated at 6.1 for rubella using an age-structured realistic model.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The herd immunity threshold against rubella was calculated by 1−(1/R
 <sub>0</sub>), and came to 83.6%.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While we set the baseline levels of seropositivity and herd immunity by using the threshold described above, a sensitivity analysis was carried out using alternative values, that is, a conventionally accepted cut-off value of HI titre ≥8 and a seroprevalence of 94.0%, as adopted elsewhere.
