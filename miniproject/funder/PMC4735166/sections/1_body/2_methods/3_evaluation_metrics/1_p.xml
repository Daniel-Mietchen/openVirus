<p>To assess herd immunity at the population level, we employed two evaluation metrics. These metrics focused on the seroprevalence data (and did not use vaccination coverage) because a substantial fraction of immune individuals, especially adults, acquired their immunity through a natural infection rather than through vaccination. First, we calculated the age-standardised seroprevalence, m
 <sub>1,g</sub>(t), at calendar time t and in gender g (g=0 for females or 1 for males), as

 </disp-formula>where p
 <sub>a,g</sub>(t) is the observed seropositive proportion and n
 <sub>a,g</sub>(t) is the relative population size at time t and gender g of those aged a years. This metric is interpreted as the age-standardised seronegative proportion. The data for n
 <sub>a</sub> were obtained from the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIAC).

 <sub>a</sub>(t), and the age-specific seronegative proportion in the corresponding age-group:

 <sub>L</sub> and a
 <sub>U</sub> represent the lower and upper childbearing ages of mothers, respectively.
