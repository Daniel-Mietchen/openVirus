<p>The vaccination coverage data were retrieved from the immunisation records of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Vaccination coverage was calculated as the ratio of the annual number of vaccinations to the population size of an age-group that newly entered the participant age-group of vaccination, and this was overlaid with data from the reported rubella cases.
