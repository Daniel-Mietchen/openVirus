 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This serial cross-sectional serological survey, quantifying haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres, has been implemented every year from July to September, non-randomly selecting the geographical area from which it draws its participants. The serum was collected by region from &gt;5400 participants of all ages, recruiting participants from those who visited a prefectural medical facility or public health centre.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The present study takes into consideration the survey data from every 5â€…years since 1983 to investigate the longitudinal trend of age at rubella infection, standardised seronegative proportion, and the number of live births that were born to seronegative mothers and considered to be at risk of CRS.
