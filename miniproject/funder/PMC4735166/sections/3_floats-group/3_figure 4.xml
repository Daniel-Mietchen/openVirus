  <p>Time dependence in the standardised rubella-seronegative proportion and the number of live births at risk for congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in Japan, 1983–2013. (A) The standardised proportion of the population that was seronegative was analysed by sex every 5 years from 1983. The solid line with filled circles shows the male seronegative proportion (≥32), and the dotted line with unfilled circles represents the female seronegative proportion (≥32). Values were adjusted using the age-specific and gender-specific population sizes.

Samples with haemagglutination inhibition titres ≥8 or ≥32 were considered to be seroconverted. The horizontal bold and dotted grey lines indicate the herd immunity thresholds of 83.6% and 94%, respectively,

   <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which were calculated by 1−(1/basic reproduction number). Therefore, a major epidemic should be prevented below this line. (B) The number of live births at risk for developing CRS. The number of live births at risk was calculated from 1983 to 2013; the age-specific annual number of live births was multiplied to the age-specific seronegative proportion in the corresponding age-group and the product was summed over age to yield a standardised proportion. Since the statistics for the number of live births by age of mothers were not available for every corresponding year, the data from the closest year available were taken into account.
   <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Owing to the nature of the calculation, the estimates reflect both the decreasing proportion of women at childbearing age who were seronegative for rubella as well as the decreasing number of babies delivered over time. The error bar represents the 95% CIs derived from a normal approximation to binomial.
