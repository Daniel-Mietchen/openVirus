<p>Our case example has the following major limitations. In the population model, aging, deaths, births, emigration and immigration of the human population are not considered. This assumption can be reasonable for short-term analyses. For future long-term analyses however, open cohort dynamics should be implemented. We did not consider medical history including prior dengue infections with a different serotype that impacts the severity of the disease. Available data to model past dengue infections are limited. With respect to the mosquito incidence, we did not model in detail regionality of breeding places and the growth of the mosquito population during rainy season. The mosquito population size and age distribution, and population dynamics such as growth and decline at the beginning and end of the rainy season have been widely calibrated due to a lack of specific data. The decline of the mosquito population at the end of the rainy season in the calibrated model was slightly slower than the decline displayed by the real world data. This gap is assumed to be caused by unknown biological processes in the mosquito population. For example, the cause of the declining population could be an increase in death rate or a decrease in birth rate. Therefore, the emergent behavior at the end of the rainy season could not be exactly estimated. A common challenge for epidemics also strikes our dengue example: epidemics often occur in yearly, seasonal outbreaks. However, these outbreaks are usually completely different from year to year. Epidemiologists often can only provide limited explanations; therefore the goodness of a model prediction of any upcoming seasonal epidemic is limited. The only sensible approach is to use as an example a single, well-known epidemic from the past to test the effects of interventions. Applying an epidemic model to another season usually requires a fresh calibration.</p>
