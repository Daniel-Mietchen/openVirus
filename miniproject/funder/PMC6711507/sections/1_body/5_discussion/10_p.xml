<p>The case example of dengue epidemics is challenging because the disease is not directly transmitted from human to human but from humans to mosquitoes and mosquitoes to humans. This requires modeling of two different populations leading to complex dynamics. The agent-based dengue model illustrates how these complex dynamics can be reproduced to a great extent, but producing the exact emerging behavior would require increased model complexity.</p>
