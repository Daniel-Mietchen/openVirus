<p>In our article, we will illustrate methodological issues in disease transmission modeling using dengue fever as an exemplary infectious disease. Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. The dengue virus is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes thriving in tropical countries, principally by

With now half of the world’s population being at risk, dengue epidemics are a severe public health problem in tropical countries, causing a large and continuing morbidity and mortality burden. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 estimated a total of 576,900 (330,000–701,200) years of life lost to premature mortality attributable to dengue in 2013 and dengue was responsible for 1.14 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2013 [
