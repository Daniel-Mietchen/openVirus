<p>For evaluations of the effect of interventions on disease spread, the international guidelines developed by the ISPOR-SMDM Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force recommend modeling methods that capture interaction, such as dynamic transmission models [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dynamic transmission modeling is often performed using system dynamics. System dynamics models are deterministic and based on compartments. However, these deterministic compartment models cannot capture stochastic effects such as the extinction of the disease in small populations and complex interactions and behavior. Agent-based models (ABM) are a more flexible alternative approach for dynamic transmission modeling because AMBs are modeling individuals rather than compartments [
