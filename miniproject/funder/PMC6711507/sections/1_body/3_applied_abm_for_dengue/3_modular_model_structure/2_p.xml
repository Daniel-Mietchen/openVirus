<p>The population module of the model initializes a population of persons with age and gender representing the demographics of the simulated region or city. In our model, the size of the human population does not change within the simulated one-year time horizon. The population module also initializes mosquitoes including age and gender attributes. The number of mosquitoes is given as a multiplier of the human population. This multiplier can change at specific points in time and is constant otherwise. A mosquito dies every day with a constant probability, or at the maximum age of 33 days, which results in an exponentially distributed age distribution. The number of mosquitoes born each day depends on the number of mosquitoes that died and the defined multiplier. When the multiplier is changed, a minimum or maximum number of newborn mosquitoes can be applied to prevent an abrupt decline or increase of the mosquito population.</p>
