<p>Our dengue model consist of three modules: (1) population module, (2) contact module, (3) disease modules [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This modular structure has been developed to build a complex agent-base model that provides the flexibility of model adaptions, validation and transparency, meaning easier to review. The modules are loosely coupled; that is, modules are designed in the same way, so that strong dependencies are within one module. This reduces dependencies between modules, so that modules can be extended independently and can even be reused in other models. Modules also fully cover a specific area. This strategy allows for developing, implementing, testing and validating the modules separately. This strategy also supports model extensions and adaptations as they usually address a single module rather the entire model. Validated modules can be reused in several projects to increase credibility and decrease development time. This modular structure consists of a population module, a contact module and a disease module.
