<p>In the second calibration phase, first only the number of mosquitoes at week 25 was increased to create an outbreak. Consequently, the epidemic starts as required. The earlier assumed predefined fixed life span of mosquitos of 33 days, however, leads after 33 days to a large number of infectious mosquitoes dying, which are replaced by susceptible newborn mosquitoes. This causes a significant decline in the human epidemic until a significant portion of newborn mosquitoes get infected and pass their incubation period. Therefore, daily dying probabilities and population growth rates were introduced to gain better mosquito demographics. Parameters were adapted until the epidemics between week 25 and 37 were satisfying.</p>
