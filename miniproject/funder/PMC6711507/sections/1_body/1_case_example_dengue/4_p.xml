<p>Within our project, we aimed building an agent-based model which is suitable to simulate a dengue outbreak in a Philippine city or region. The model allows analyzing the mechanisms of dengue epidemics and evaluating the impact of mosquito (vector) control interventions on disease burden. In this paper, we evaluated the impact of human mosquito ratios on disease incidence to show the effectiveness that a future mosquito control should reach to stop the epidemics. Before we describe the model in detail, we summarize and discuss characteristics of ABM.</p>
