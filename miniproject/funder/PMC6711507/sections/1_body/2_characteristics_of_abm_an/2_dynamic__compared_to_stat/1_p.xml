<p>In transmission models, the incidence of infection is determined by the number of susceptibles and the rate at which susceptible become infected (force of infection). In a static model, the force of infection is constant over time or it can depend on age. In a dynamic model, the force of infection is not a fixed parameter. ABM is a dynamic modeling approach since the probability of an individual acquiring an infection can be implemented depending on contact patterns of the agents (i.e., direct interactions), transmissibility of the infection and the distribution of the infection among the agent population. As a consequence of these factors, the force of infection is usually not constant over time. For example, dengue epidemics mostly underlie seasonal patterns with outbreaks during rainy season. In the dengue model, the mosquito population grows rapidly in a rainy season and more mosquitoes transmit the disease (transmissibility increases), which causes an outbreak. An important advantage, dynamic transmission models are capable of reproducing the direct and indirect effects of interventions for communicable diseases, including herd immunity [
