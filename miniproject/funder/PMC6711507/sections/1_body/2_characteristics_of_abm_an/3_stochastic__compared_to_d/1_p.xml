<p>In a deterministic model (e.g., system dynamics models), a given initial situation (or set of parameter values) always leads to the same results [

In a stochastic model, multiple runs with different underlying random numbers provide a different result due to randomness in model parameters. That is, some model parameters are specified by underlying parameter distributions, and in each run new parameter values are drawn from the distributions. Agent-based modeling is a stochastic and individual-level simulation technique, and therefore, is able to integrate first-order uncertainty. First order uncertainty means that, for example, individuals with the same characteristics (and therefore facing the same probabilities and outcomes) can just by chance experience different effects of a disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0221564.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Stochasticity is included through pseudo-random numbers. Running stochastic models and applying different random numbers leads to different model results. In communicable diseases, stochastic effects are particularly relevant, as they can help to model the extinction of a specific disease in small populations, where extinction also depends on chance [
