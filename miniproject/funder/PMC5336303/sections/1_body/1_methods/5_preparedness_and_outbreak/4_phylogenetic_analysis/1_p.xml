<p>Amplicons generated from the genus-specific Alphavirus RT-PCRs were purified directly using Qiaquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and sequenced in both directions with the RT-PCRs primers using an Applied Biosystems 410 Genetic Analyzer (Foster City, CA), following the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. After identification of the viral sequences using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) Software, RT-PCR specific reactions for the E1/E2 gene and primer walking sequencing were performed (Primers sequences for RT-PCR and sequencing were kindly provided by Tiffany Kautz, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston).</p>
