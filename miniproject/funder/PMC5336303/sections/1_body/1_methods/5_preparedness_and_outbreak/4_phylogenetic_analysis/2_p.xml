<p>Consensus sequences covering the structural E1/E2 gene of the 13 CHIKV strains isolated in Panama were aligned with 40 representative homologous sequences from the GenBank library and The European Virus Archive using the MUSCLE algorithm as amino acids and then returned to nucleotides to conserve codon homology [
