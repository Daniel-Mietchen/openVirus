<p>After identification of the CHIKV index case in each neighborhood, a comprehensive approach by MINSA was implemented to detect new secondary cases. In Rio Abajo neighborhood, house-by-house surveillance of active febrile cases was performed in the city block where the index autochthonous case lived, and in the surrounding blocks. In parallel, when the medical doctor and ICGES alerted MINSA of a new CHIKV case, the NED notified the Vector Control Department at MINSA, and the house-by-house intervention was performed in less than 48h. Guidance about methods of elimination of mosquito breeding sites was provided to the community of the confirmed cases by distributing educational brochures.</p>
