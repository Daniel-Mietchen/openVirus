<p>In January 2014, after the CHIKV emergence in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], MINSA alerted the airports and terrestrial and maritime ports of entry about CHIKV treat. Additionally, CHIKV case definition, information of countries with confirmed CHIKV epidemics was given. As soon as a febrile case from countries with confirmed CHIKV circulation was identified, medical personnel at the airport notified MINSA, and transferred the patients to medical centers for clinical evaluation and serum sample collection, which was then sent to ICGES.
