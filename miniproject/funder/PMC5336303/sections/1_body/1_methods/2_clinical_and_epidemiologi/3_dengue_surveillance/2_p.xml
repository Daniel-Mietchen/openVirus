<p>To maintain the quality of the continuous surveillance program for dengue and other arbovirus like chikungunya, yearly, MINSA trained physicians around the country in case definition to detect and report dengue and dengue-like infections. Laboratory training and sample transportation are provided by GMI and MINSA.
