The executive order N° 1617 from 2014 regulates the mandatory notification of the disease to the National Department of Epidemiology (NED) from public and private institutions and the use of World Health Organization (WHO)'s Dengue suspected case definition: a patient with fever and one or more of the following symptoms: headache, retro orbital pain, myalgia, exanthema, rash, vomiting, malaise, leukopenia, jaundice. A confirmed case is a suspected case with a positive dengue test (isolation, RT-PCR, IgM ELISA or secondary IgG ELISA). Since August 2010, the laboratory diagnosis of dengue is decentralized: the health care facilities perform the detection of NS1 antigen and of IgM/IgG antibodies for acute (≤ 4 days of symptoms) and convalescent (≥ 5 days of symptoms) samples, respectively. Quality control tests for the Dengue Laboratories Network from across the country are performed at ICGES with evaluation of around 10% of the monthly positive and negative samples. Acute samples (0–4 days) were also submitted to ICGES for serotype and genotype surveillance (
