<p>The chikungunya laboratory surveillance was centralized to ICGES during the study period. All the acute (≤ 8 days of symptoms onset) and convalescent (≥ 9 days of symptoms onset) suspected chikungunya cases were tested using molecular methods/viral isolation or IgM ELISA (

Acute samples should have been sent to ICGES in cold chain within 72h of collection. Usually, acute samples that do not meet these requirements are rejected and not tested. Laboratory results were notified to NED within 72h after receiving the samples (

In addition, since January 2014, a passive arbovirus surveillance laboratory was started at ICGES. Acute samples with negative results for both DENV and CHIKV, independent of their arrival through the dengue or chikungunya surveillance, were tested using generic primers [
