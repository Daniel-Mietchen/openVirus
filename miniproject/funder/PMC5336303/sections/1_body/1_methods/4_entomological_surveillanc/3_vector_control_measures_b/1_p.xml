<p>In high and moderate risk neighborhoods, the vector control program fumigates all streets every two weeks by car, using Deltametrine (0.27%) and Cyfluthrin (1.5%). For each dengue or chikungunya suspected case in a neighborhood, independent of the vector house index (high, moderate or low risk), the vector control personnel eliminate breeding sites inside houses and peridomiciliary. If some breeding sites can't be eliminated (for example, water supplies for human use), the vector control personnel applies larvicides (Temephos, Diflubenzuron) to these mosquito breeding sites. Direct fumigation and larvicide application inside houses and peridomiciliary is done only for confirmed DENV and CHIKV cases. When more than four cases were reported in a neighborhood, the intervention zone corresponds to the whole district and all inhabitants have to give the permission to the vector control staff to enter the houses. Prevention and control measure information are distributed to the general population using mass media. However, the frequency of mass media message is increased before and during the raining season (May-November) when Dengue cases generally increase.</p>
