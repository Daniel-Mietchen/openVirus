<p>The vector infestation rates were calculated for each epidemiological week as well as the monthly average from January 2014 to August 2015. The geographic regions analyzed include the districts of Panama and San Miguelito, where the majority of cases were detected. To provide descriptive information about the vector infestation level variation, we performed a box &amp; whisker analysis using the SPSS software package, version 22 (IBM, Corp, New York). A student T-test analysis of mean vector infestation rates was conducted to estimate the differences during May to December 2014 and January to July 2015 (CI, 95%), and differences in abundances of
