<p>In order to determine the general tendency of vector infestation level in the Districts of Panama and San Miguelito during and after CHIKV introduction, we performed a time series analysis. Rates of 
 <italic>Aedes spp</italic> vector infestation were taken as part of the national program for the surveillance of dengue. The data set used in this analysis was collected from January 2014 to July 2015. An exploratory analysis of the data was performed in order to detect missing values, while a descriptive analysis was performed to determine the presence of outliers. Lineal interpolation was necessary in order to reduce the variability produced as a consequence of the outliers and missing data. In order to reduce the variability of the data due to the lack of information during the epidemiological weeks of 14–18, 32–35, 45–53 (2014) and 8 (2015), we performed a linear interpolation and adjusted the cyclical behavior of the time series. Finally, we applied the minimum quadratic method to determine the tendency equation.
