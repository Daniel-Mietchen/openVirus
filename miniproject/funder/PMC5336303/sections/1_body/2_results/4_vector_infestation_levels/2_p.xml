<p>Vector infestation levels observed during the 2014 outbreak fluctuate between 0.4–4.2% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005338.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Low infestation levels were documented mainly during the dry season (January-April) and moderate infestation levels during the rainy season (May-December), where the rate of infection was 4.2%. This corresponds the increase detection of imported CHIKV and secondary transmission (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005338.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). High infestation levels (8.2 to 14.3%) were observed in the rainy season of 2015. The student t-test applied for 2014–2015 showed no significant difference (P &gt;0.05). When the values of infestation were compared between the months of 2014, it was determined that there was significant difference (P &lt;0.05) between infestation rates only during the months of the rainy season, whereas in the dry season there was no difference. By 2015, only significant difference was observed in the months of April and May due to high incidence and outliers.
