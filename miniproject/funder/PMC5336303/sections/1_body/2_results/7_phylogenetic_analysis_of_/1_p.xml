<p>The optimal Maximum-likelihood (ML) tree, based on a 975 nt segment of the E1/E2 genes sequences of 53 CHIKV strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005338.g005">Fig 5</xref>), shows that the 13 Panamanian imported and two autochthonous isolates (Genbank accession number KX255061-63 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], KX355507-16) cluster together within the American clade of the Asian lineage. The Panamanian strains (256821, 257245 and 257263) were obtained from febrile patients that came from Venezuela, while the strain 256899 was obtained from a patient traveling from El Salvador. The majority of imported strains included in our study were obtained from patients with febrile disease that came from Dominican Republic. Two strains were autochthonous to Panama (256619, 256629). Sequences from all Panamanians strains (imported and autochthonous) included in our study are nearly identical to each other, and cluster together with strains isolated in Saint Martin in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the British Virgin Islands during 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. No known mutations of vector adaptation were found in the analyzed E1/E2 sequence.
