<p>To determine if variations over time in vector infestation levels are associated with CHIKV and DENV outbreaks, the CHIKV epidemic curve with imported and autochthonous cases, as well as dengue epidemic curve were superimposed along with the monthly mean infestation rate for Rio Abajo (

The increase of vector infestation levels just before the detection of imported cases was associated with an appearance of autochthonous cases. However, as soon as CHIKV cases were reported, there was a decrease in infestation rates that could be associated with the vector control intervention and educational campaign. Juan Diaz County also maintained a low infestation rate during the period of study. Although imported cases of CHIKV were reported, no autochthonous cases were detected in this County (
