<p>The national epidemic curve for all dengue positive cases (6459) detected between 2014 to July 2015 in Panama shows an increase in the number of cases at the beginning of 2014, before CHIKV detection in May that same year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005338.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This epidemic curve shows a similar pattern to the epidemic curve of dengue cases detected by ICGES during the same period of time, suggesting that dengue laboratory surveillance at ICGES (8.9% [577/6459] of total cases) represented the behavior through time of all reported dengue cases in Panama. CHIKV infections were detected starting in May 2014 when dengue cases were also lower than the previous months (
