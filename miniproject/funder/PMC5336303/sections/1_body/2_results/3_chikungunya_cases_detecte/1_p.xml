<p>In order to reduce selection bias influence and to increase the possibility of detection of CHIKV cases that were not caught through National Chikungunya Surveillance, samples from Dengue surveillance were also analyzed. All the samples received during the time of the study met the quality control requirement and none was rejected for analysis. From a total of 1489 samples (564 DENV positive and 925 DENV negative) received at ICGES through the National Dengue surveillance system representative from all provinces, we randomly selected and tested a total of 879 dengue negative samples for CHIKV detection (612 from 2014 and 267 until July 2015) (
