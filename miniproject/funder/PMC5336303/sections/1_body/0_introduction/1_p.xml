<p>The chikungunya virus (CHIKV, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) is an RNA single-stranded arthropod-borne pathogen that was first recognized in 1952–1953 in southeast Tanzania and northern Mozambique [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Africa, CHIKV was associated with small outbreaks in rural areas, however, in Asia between 1960–1970, the virus was associated with explosive urban epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Based on the geographical distribution and genetic profiles, CHIKV is divided in three major lineages: the East, Central and South African (ECSA), the West African and the Asian lineages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. After a 2004 epidemic in coastal Kenya, CHIKV spread to the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion in 2005–2006, and caused approximately 266,000 cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A single mutation A226V in E1 gene of the ECSA strains, which increases transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, allowed the emergence of CHIKV Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The E1-A226V mutation allowed the rapid diversification of CHIKV IOL via a second wave of mutations in the E2; providing evidence that this mutation enhances the likelihood of IOL transmission, and consequently increases the risk of worldwide expansion [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it was believed that ECSA genotype would be established in the Americas, where 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> populations are present. However, in 2013 autochthonous CHIKV cases due to the Asian genotype were detected in the French Caribbean Island of Saint Martin. This CHIKV genotype later spread to other Caribbean Islands and the Americas causing epidemics in several countries [
