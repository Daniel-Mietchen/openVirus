<p>In Panama, the first imported case of CHIKV was reported in May 2014, and the first autochthonous case in August 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The majority of imported cases were associated with the Colombian, Dominican Republic and Venezuelan epidemics. Two main, but limited outbreaks, were detected in Panama: 1) in Rio Abajo (a county in Panama City) in August 2014 and 2) Puerto Obaldia (a town within an indigenous region near to Colombian border) in January 2015. The incidence rates for 2014 were low (0.5 per 100,000 inhabitants), and no fatalities or severe cases were detected, despite intensive surveillance. This contrasts with the high incidence in 2014 observed in Dominican Republic (5,182.5 per 100,000 inhabitants), Colombia (189 per 100,000 inhabitants) and Venezuela (131 per 100,000 inhabitants) (
