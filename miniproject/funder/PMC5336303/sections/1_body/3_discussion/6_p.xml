<p>No mutations of vector adaptation in the E1/E2 genes of CHIKV strains included in our studies were found. Further studies of 3â€™UTR of Panamanian CHIKV strains, should be addressed because it has been proposed that this genomic region may reduce the fitness of the Asian genotype for efficient transmission by mosquitoes [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] were the major forces that facilitate the dissemination of the Asian genotype through the Americas and not a specific mosquito adaptation like in the La Reunion outbreak [
