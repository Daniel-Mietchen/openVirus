<p>Experimental infections in mice with Mayaro virus (MAYV) and the Alphavirus encephalitis viruses (VEEV and EEEV) have shown cross-protection that seems to last around 2 months [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, it is not clear whether previous infections with VEEV, MAYV or Una virus (UNV) have an impact in CHIKV infection or disease. Moreover the distribution of the main vectors of VEEV, EEEV and probably MAYV and UNV is sylvatic and rural [
