<p>Our study has several limitations. First, the chikungunya suspected case definition was based in fever and arthralgia or arthritis in order to differentiate chikungunya from dengue infections, this may represent a selection bias, as the symptoms may be variable in some chikungunya infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, samples from patients with dengue-like disease were also tested even if the physician did not request chikungunya test. Underreporting of cases is also possible, even if notification is mandatory; this is not a total guarantee that all suspected cases were reported. However, all medical institutions in Panama have epidemiologists that follow notification of cases daily and increase the surveillance during outbreak response. A small number of samples from remote areas were received at ICGES during the study. This is possibly due to the long distance and logistical difficulties that arise for transport of samples. DENV surveillance is able to detect an increase of cases in remotes areas and transport samples to ICGES during an outbreak response, however an increase of cases was not reported during our study. Most cases were treated as ambulatory cases in primary care centers where the majority of information was obtained from the epidemiological notification form. Little information on the clinical evolution is currently available, and the rate of chronic CHIKV infections in Panama is unknown, as most patients did not return to the health facility for follow-up after their first visit. This information contrasted with the high proportion of patients with sequelae that were reported in hospitals from countries like Dominican Republic and El Salvador [

Similarly, in this study only the clinical symptoms described in the notification form were reported, and not chemical or hematologic test were performed, in consequence correlation between clinical presentation, thrombocytopenia or leucopenia was not possible. The Panamanian vector surveillance during the outbreak was performed using Breteau index that is a larval based index, this index have been found to be inadequate as indicators for dengue virus transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Indeed, a study have been proposed that adult mosquitoes index correlate better with positive dengue cases in Iquitos, Peru [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], however no study has been done to correlate these differences indices in Panama with dengue or chikungunya cases and larvae index have also shown to correlate with dengue epidemics in Cuba [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This discrepancy in mosquito estimator to predict outbreak, suggest variations of correlation among countries. MINSA are considering the use of pupa index instead of larvae; nevertheless, this has not yet been implemented. Finally, detection of the circulating virus in mosquitos was not performed during the response; in consequence, there is no estimate on the rates of infected mosquitos for DENV and CHIKV that could help define risk areas of transmission.
