<p>In both years 2014 and 2015, the CHIKV incidence rate was lower compared to DENV. The marked difference observed between CHIKV and DENV in 2014 is probably due to the high number of dengue cases detected during January-April 2014 that corresponded with a dengue outbreak that began just before Chikungunya detection (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Dengue is an endemic disease in Panama, and about 23 years have passed since reintroduction. This fact may influence physiciansâ€™ criteria for differential diagnoses. The sensitivity of dengue diagnosis through the decentralized surveillance should be greater than the recent implemented centralized CHIKV surveillance. In addition, the majority of DENV infections are asymptomatic and sustained DENV transmission by people who are infected without developing detectable clinical symptoms have been proposed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Future studies need to be conducted to determine if there are ecological or virus-specific constraints on DENV or CHIKV, due to usage of the same vectors and reservoir.
