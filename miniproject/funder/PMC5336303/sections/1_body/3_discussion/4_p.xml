<p>The majority of CHIKV cases were found in the Panama City metropolitan area (Districts of Panama and San Miguelito). This is likely related to the fact that the most densely populated areas are Panama City and San Miguelito, and both have a high proportion of immigrants inhabiting or working there. The majority of imported cases in 2014 were from Dominican Republic and in 2015 from Colombia and Venezuela. The latter two countries had reported CHIKV outbreaks during that year [

Human migration of native communities through the Panamanian-Colombian border is very usual. This migration is most likely not reported; therefore, it is difficult to determine if these cases were autochthonous. As Colombia had an important CHIKV epidemic during 2015, it is possible that migration over this border was the most likely way the virus was introduced in the east side of the country.
