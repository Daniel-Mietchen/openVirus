<p>Experimental studies have shown that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> efficiently transmit CHIKV of the Asian genotype with a major fitness in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our analysis of vector infestation levels shows a predominant low to moderate risk for CHIKV epidemics. The detection of only 3 secondary cases during the main CHIKV outbreak in Panama City (Rio Abajo County) suggests that the observed infestation levels along with interventions after a suspected case detection may play a role in the observed pattern of CHIKV outbreak in Panama. Nevertheless, we were not able to test the hypothesis that rapid vector control measures impacted the dynamics of CHIKV transmission in Panama; little information of vector infestation levels in specific locations before and after the control response was available. However, biochemical studies have shown that strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in Panama City are sensitive to the insecticides used currently for control campaign [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The sensitivity of the more abundant Panamanian vector to insecticides and the low number of CHIKV cases in the community following vector control measures suggest that these local control measures applied by MINSA in areas close to confirmed cases were efficacious to limit the number of human cases and the expansion of CHIKV throughout the country. Additionally, because behavior and lifestyle have been proposed to increase or restrict the transmission of DENV rather than the effects of climate in some places [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the role of lifestyle in the distribution pattern of CHIKV infections observed in Panama, should be addressed in future studies.
