<p>Vector control responses at the community level began before the laboratory confirmation, with the notification of a suspected case by the physician to MINSA. After case confirmation and notification, the vector control personnel applied intradomiciliary fumigation in order to complete the response. The algorithm set for the notification of confirmed cases includes notification (around 24 to 72 h) from the laboratory to the treating physician as well as at the local level where the cases are reported and at the National Epidemiology Department at MINSA that informs the Vector Control Department, which in less than 48h organized a complete vector control response with implementation of effective control measures, such an isolation and mosquito control in domiciliary, peridomiciliary and the surrounding community [

During each evaluation, the calibration of the spraying equipment, calibration of the diameter of the mouthpiece and the drop size used in fumigation was done, as well as control of the security of equipment and chemical usage. Human resource was also retrained every year. Population acceptance of fumigation was high as there are familiar with this procedure since Panama sanitation measures during Panama Canal construction [
