<p>In this study, we sought to provide information about viral genetic differences that could explain the paucity of CHIKV cases observed in Panama. However, our phylogenetic analysis indicates that these CHIKV strains from the Asian genotype are nearly identical to those strains that are circulating in the rest of the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These results suggest that a single introduction of CHIKV from the Asian genotype in the Caribbean islands in 2013 spread to the rest of the Americas, and that Panama is not an exception.
