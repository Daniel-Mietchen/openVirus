<p>While many tropical Caribbean and Latin American countries that reported autochthonous infections after 2013 have experienced explosive CHIKV epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], in Panama, from May 2014 to July 2015, we confirmed only 46 autochthonous CHIKV cases (44 through CHIKV surveillance and 2 through dengue surveillance), that corresponds to the 38.6% of total CHIKV confirmed cases (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005338.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Clinical and laboratory findings of CHIKV infections in the Panamanian outbreak were similar to those reported in previous epidemics [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In previous reports polyarthralgia was more prevalent in CHIKV when compared to DENV infections [

Even though the viremia is higher and lasts longer than dengue, our data show that even through both surveillance programs, few cases of CHIKV were detected [
