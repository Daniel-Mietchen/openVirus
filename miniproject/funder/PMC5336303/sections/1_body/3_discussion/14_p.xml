<p>In summary, our data suggest that Panama presented a small and limited outbreak compared with others Latin American countries. Panama was able to maintain low to medium vector infestation levels in the majority of the counties or communities with imported CHIKV cases, and this, along with the interventions after identification of CHIKV infections, as well as other epidemiological conditions, could play a role in the low numbers of cases observed. The constant possibility of new imported CHIKV cases and the introduction of Zika virus in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005338.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] will continue to be a threat for the surveillance and vector control programs. The capacity to maintain the observed pattern will depend on the preservation of low to medium infestation levels and the sustainability of the early case detection system of dengue-like arboviral diseases, as well as the subsequent implementation of vector control measures after detection of new cases before bigger epidemics.
