  <title>CHIKV phylogenetic tree.</title>
  <p>Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree of 53 CHIKV sequences based in the E1/E2 protein gene fragment of 995 nucleotides. The three major viral lineages and the American Clade are shown. British Virgin Island's and strains detected in Panama (imported and autochthonous) are in red like all the American clade strains. Virus labels include country of isolation, strain designation, and year of isolation. The evolutionary relationships were undertaken with the GTR+G+I model. Bootstrap values are shown in major branches. All horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale (bar = 0.02 nucleotide substitutions per site). The tree is midpoint rooted for purposes of clarity only.</p>
