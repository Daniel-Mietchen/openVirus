<p>Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions from 1:10 to 1:80 were prepared for each serum and a volume of 50μL was pipeted into 96-well plate. Viruses were titrated in Vero cells (ATCC CCL81). A volume of 50 μL containing 1000 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was added into each well except for the controls that consisted of PBS. A volume of 50 μL of EMEM medium enriched with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicilin Streptomycin, 1% L-Glutamine 200 mM, 1% Kanamycin, 3% Fungizone, was added to each well of the controls.
