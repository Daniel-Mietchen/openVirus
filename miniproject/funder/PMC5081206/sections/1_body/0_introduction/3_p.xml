<p>Sandfly fever Cyprus virus (SFCV), closely related to Sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), was isolated during a large outbreak of sandfly fever in Swedish United Nations troops stationed in Cyprus; few cases were also caused by TOSV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Greece, in recent sporadic cases of meningitis, (i) TOSV RNA was detected in the CSF of a patient [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and (ii) viral RNA corresponding to Adria virus, a novel virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Salehabad</italic> species, was also identified in the CSF [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To date, SFSV or another SFS-like virus have been neither isolated nor detected by molecular techniques in Greece.
