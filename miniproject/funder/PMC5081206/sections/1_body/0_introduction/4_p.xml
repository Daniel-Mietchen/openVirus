<p>During the last decade, field-to-laboratory integrated studies associating virologists, parasitologists and entomologists have discovered several new phlebotomine-borne phleboviruses; thus there is an increased diversity in each of the three aforementioned species or serocomplexes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the pathogenicity of most of these newly discovered viruses remains unknown, they are sympatric with recognized pathogenic phleboviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Because several viruses of the same serocomplex co-circulate in various regions, interpretation of seroprevalence studies requires using techniques that hold the capacity to discriminate between these antigenically-related viruses. To the best of our knowledge, all studies performed in Greece and Cyprus used either ELISA or IFA tests, which are notoriously prone to cross-reactivity between viruses belonging to the same serocomplex [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To conduct our nation-wide (mainland Greece, Greek islands, Cyprus) seroprevalence study in dogs, we selected neutralisation tests which is the most discriminant assay as previously reported in Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey and Portugal [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although virus exposure to viruses may be quantitatively different in humans and dogs, because of different feeding preferences of phlebotomines, recent studies suggest that virus circulation can be estimated using either human or dog sera since dogs live in close proximity to humans and are readily infected by these viruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our study, dog sera were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies against TOSV, SFSV, and two viruses belonging to the Salehabad complex (Arbia virus isolated in Italy and Adana virus isolated in Turkey).
