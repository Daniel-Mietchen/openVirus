<p>The recent discovery of several new viruses belonging to the three species associated with phlebotomines in the Old World has raised questions about the viral strain currently circulating in the two regions. Since broadly cross-reactive techniques such as ELISA and IIF are not capable to distinguish between viruses belonging to the same serocomplex, we decided to use microneutralisation assay using viral strains or surrogates which presence had been assessed in Greece and Cyprus. Indeed, we consider it valid to use SFSV as a surrogate for SFCV (isolated in Cyprus) and other SFSV-related viruses because amino acid distances observed between the proteins that elicit neutralizing antibodies (Gn and Gc) are well within the acceptable range, ie &lt;5% different for SFSV and SFSV-related viruses[
