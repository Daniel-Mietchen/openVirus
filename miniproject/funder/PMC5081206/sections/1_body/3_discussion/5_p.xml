<p>The largest amount of data available on dogs, at the outset of this study, concerned TOSV, which observed rates (4.4% in Greece and 8.4% in Cyprus) are in the same order of magnitude as those recently reported in dogs in Tunisia (6.8%, [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because all these studies measured neutralising antibodies against TOSV, their results are comparable and they reflect local circulation of TOSV only, not other viruses belonging to the SFNV complex. Together these results demonstrate that TOSV can readily infect dogs. Exposure level of dogs and humans may be drastically different in the same area as previously shown in Tunisia where MN-based seroprevalence rates were respectively at 6.8% in dogs compared with 41% in humans [
