<p>At the outset of our study, the following data were available for Cyprus: (i) there was no serological data in domestic animals (cattle, goats, sheep, dogs or cats) for any phlebovirus transmitted by sand flies; (ii) first evidence of the presence of TOSV, Naples and Sicilian viruses were observed in Swedish soldiers of the United Nations force [
