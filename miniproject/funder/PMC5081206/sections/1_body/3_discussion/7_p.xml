<p>The absence of cross-protection between ARBV-NT-Abs and ADAV-NT-Abs confirm previous data from Turkey [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Accordingly, cumulative percentage of viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Salehabad</italic> species is 21.7%. This is congruent with the results observed in Adana, southern Anatolia, Turkey where domestic animals were presenting high rates of NT-Ab against viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Salehabad</italic> serocomplex [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Tesh et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] did not detect NT-Abs against Salehabad virus (SALV) in human populations suggesting that SALV was not infecting humans. In contrast, NT-Abs against Medjerda Valley virus were described in 1.35% (14/1260) of human sera collected from the general population living in Northern Tunisia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests that at least some viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Salehabad</italic> complex can infect humans and other vertebrates. Interestingly, Adria virus RNA has been detected in the CSF of a Greek patient presenting with meningitis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but was never isolated precluding serological studies aiming at defining the possible impact of this virus in the region and beyond. However, molecular detection of Adria virus in Albania (in sand flies) and in Greece (in human) suggests that its distribution might cover a large geographic area. This constituted the first direct evidence supporting human pathogenicity of a virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Salehabad virus</italic> complex. Isolation of Adria virus is now a priority in order to pursue the studies using neutralization-based serological studies in humans and animals.
