<p>Since several of these viruses are proven human pathogens, our results plead for performing similar studies using human sera to identify geographic hot spots. The increasing number of sequence data for these phlebotomine-borne phleboviruses now enables to design and develop real-time molecular assays. The improved diagnostic toolbox will allow to investgate the medical impact of these viruses in patients presenting unexplained febrile illness and neuroinvasive infections.</p>
