<p>In the present study, dogs living in the Ionian island of Corfu showed a much lower seroprevalence compared to the human population living in the same island (3.9% 
 <italic>vs</italic> 51.7%) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, in this case the techniques used were different; in the human study, ELISA/IIF detected not only TOSV IgG but also IgG raised after infection with other viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Sandfly fever Naples</italic> serocomplex in which 6 new viruses were described during the last decade (Arrabida, Fermo, Granada, Massilia, Punique, Zerdali) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in addition to Naples virus (a proven human pathogen) and Tehran virus. Although none of these viruses were detected or isolated in Greece or Cyprus, the presence of one of these 6 recently discovered viruses or of a yet to be discovered virus may account for these apparently discrepant results. Last, these techniques do not hold the same sensitivity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The same explanation applies for discrepancies observed between high rates of ELISA/IFA TOSV IgG reported in Aegean islands (17.6%,11.5%, 20%, 22% and 34.7% for Lesbos, Rodos, Siros, Crete and Evia, respectively) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared with our findings: 5.3% in north Aegean islands (Chios and Lesbos), 0% in south Aegean islands (Rodos, Siros and Santorini), 1% in Crete and 4.4% in Evia (Stere Hellas)(
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In Central Macedonia, 7.3% of dog sera contained TOSV-NT-Abs, which is in agreement with reported cases of human infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and a recent study showing that TOSV and/or antigenically related viruses are circulating extensively in the area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is worth underlining that, despite using the same technique, discrepant prevalence rates were also described between dogs and humans in Tunisia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, it is difficult to compare results of serological studies performed with different techniques. When using the same technique, results observed in humans and in dogs consistently detected TOSV although they varied considerably quantitatively; therefore dogs can serve as sentinel for humans and vice versa for assessing the presence of TOSV although quantitative results must be interpreted carefully.
