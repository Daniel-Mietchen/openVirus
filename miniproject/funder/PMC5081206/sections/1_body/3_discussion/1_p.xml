<p>At the outset of our study, the following data were available for Greece: (i) there was no serological data in domestic animals (cattle, goats, sheep, dogs or cats) for any phlebovirus transmitted by sand flies, (ii) in the 1970's, 13.1% of 38 adults living in Crete had NT-Abs against Naples virus, and 24.7% and 8.5% of 632 human sera from Athens inhabitants had NT-Abs against Naples virus and Sicilian virus, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; (iv) TOSV RNA (belonging to the lineage C) was detected in the CSF of a patient with meningitis [

 <italic>Salehabad</italic> species, was also identified in the CSF of a patient with meningitis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To date, SFSV or another SFS-like virus have been neither isolated nor detected by molecular techniques in Greece.
