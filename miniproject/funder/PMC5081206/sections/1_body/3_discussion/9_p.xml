<p>The massive prevalence of SFSV-NT-Ab observed in our study is not unexpected and is congruent with entomological and human data in the literature: (i) isolation of Corfu virus on the eponymous island from 
 <italic>Phlebotomus neglectus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; (ii) SFSV IgG detected by IFA in human sera in Northern Greece (Macedonia), Central Greece (Evritania and Larisa), North–Western Greece (Epirus), and Corfu Island; (iii) detection of Chios virus, SFSV-like, in Chios island; (iv) sandfly fever epidemics were reported in Swedish UN soldiers and Greek soldiers in 1984 and 2002, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; (v) a high attack rate (63%) in tourists hosted in Cyprus for a short period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; (vi) a 32% prevalence rate of SFSV IgG in Cyprus native population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast with the two other serocomplexes which display an important range of genetic distance between their respective members, Sicilian virus strains are genetically and antigenically much more closely related [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; therefore, exposure to different SFSV strains (Italy, Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Ethiopia) can be measured by using the prototypic Italian strain. Despite high rates of antibodies in humans and other vertebrates and successive outbreaks in Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], SFSV remains a neglected pathogen, almost never included in diagnostic algorithms despite repeated and accumulating evidence of its involvement in febrile syndromes and in neuroinvasive infections.
