<p>In conclusion, this study indicates that (i) sandfly-borne phleboviruses belonging to 3 distinct genetic and antigenic groups are widely spread and co-circulate; (ii) dogs represent excellent qualitative sentinels for virus transmitted by sandflies and further studies must be done to estimate the role of dogs in the dynamics of transmission, and whether they play a role as reservoir hosts in the natural cycle of these viruses.</p>
