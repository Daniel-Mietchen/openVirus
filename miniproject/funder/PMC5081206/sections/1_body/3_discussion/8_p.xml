<p>Very high rates of SFSV-NT-Abs were observed in Cyprus and Greece. In the latter, rates were consistently above 50% (range 50.7–84.9%); in Cyprus, rates were above 40% (range 40.0–72.6%) except in Ammochostos (26.3%). The extremely high prevalence rates observed with SFSV in young dogs show that this virus continues to circulate very actively in these regions, and beyond as recently described in dogs from Tunisia (50.8%, [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005063.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). In both countries, a statistic association was found between SFSV prevalence and geographic area. The differences of prevalence depending upon the region may be due to the geographic and climatic characteristics of these regions which affect the distribution, proliferation and abundance of phlebotomine vectors of SFSV. Analysis of the questionnaires did not identify any clinical manifestations such a fever and/or neurological signs during the past weeks and months in the SFSV-positive dogs. This tends to suggest that SFSV is not or mildly affecting dogs during the viremic period. Whether or not dogs can play a role as reservoir in the natural cycle remains to be studied. To do so, experimental studies to understand the virus kinetics are necessary. Also, studies aiming at the identification of viremic domestic dogs should be planned in high prevalence areas.
