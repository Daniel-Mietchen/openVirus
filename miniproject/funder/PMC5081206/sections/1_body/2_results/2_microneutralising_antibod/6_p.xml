<p>In Cyprus, none of the sera containing ARBV-NT-Abs were also positive for ADAV-NT-Abs and vice versa; this demonstrated that there is no cross-reactivity through MN assay between these two viruses despite the fact that they belong to the same serocomplex. Exposure to ARBV and ADAV is significantly associated with the age with higher rates observed in older dogs. In contrast, the high rates of SFSV-NT-Abs were observed in the 6-11-month age class in Cyprus and Greece.</p>
