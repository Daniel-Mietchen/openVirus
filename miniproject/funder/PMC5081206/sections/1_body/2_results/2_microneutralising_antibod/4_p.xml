<p>The distribution of TOSV positive sera is quite homogenous within the studied regions (p = 0.248, p = 0.094). There is no significant difference according to the sex of the dogs. In contrast, it appears that the prevalence increases with the age, although it is not statistically significant even when the results of dogs from Greece and Cyprus are merged (3.7% / 5.3% / 7.7%, p = 0.3).</p>
