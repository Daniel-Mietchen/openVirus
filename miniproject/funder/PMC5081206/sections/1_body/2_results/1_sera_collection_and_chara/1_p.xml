<p>In Greece, a total of 1,250 sera (540 male and 710 female, sex ratio 0.76) were collected. The median age was 36 months (range: 3–216). The sera were collected from 32 prefectures, but owing to the variability in the number of collected sera from each prefecture (range: 1–410), the sera were grouped into 12 regions. Of these 12 regions, Thessaly was not included in the analyses because it consisted of 1 serum only. For the other 11 regions, the number of sera ranged from 14 to 410.</p>
