<p>Based on the data of an eight-year (2010–2017) surveillance of HFMD cases in Neijiang city, our study provided a comprehensive review of the epidemiology and distribution of HFMD serotypes in this area. The estimated incidence of HFMD was 49.82 per 100,000, which was lower than the national average of 120 per 100,000 (2008 to 2012) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The incidence rate was similar to that from the Sichuan provincial investigation from 2008 to 2013 (43.65 per 100,000)[
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The incidence rates between 2012 and 2017 represented a temporally changing epidemic in Neijiang, similar to the annual epidemic in Japan, but different from other provinces in China[

 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Taiwan[
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], Singapore[
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and Malaysia[
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where a recurring epidemic was observed every 3 to 4 years. The seasonal pattern of the HFMD epidemic in Neijiang during the study period showed two main epidemic peaks: one in late spring and early summer and the other in late autumn and winter, which was close to that in the Chongqing region [
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This seasonal pattern is consistent with the large-scale national analysis from 2008 to 2012[
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Factors driving the epidemic and seasonal pattern may be related to geographic locations, population density, environmental conditions and even the carriers of the virus, which need to be further evaluated.
