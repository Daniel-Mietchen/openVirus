<p>A high proportion of scattered children among the probable HFMD cases was found in Neijiang during the study period. This is probably because most children in this study were under 3 years of age (median age: 27 months with IQR between 16 and 39 months), and there is a mandatory requirement that the children entering public kindergartens are older than 3 years of age in China. In addition, although private kindergartens do not have the age limitation for entrance, very few children under 3 years of age go to kindergarten for possible reasons such as a higher expense for private than public kindergartens, a lack of trust from parents for private kindergartens, and less availability and accessibility of private kindergartens.
