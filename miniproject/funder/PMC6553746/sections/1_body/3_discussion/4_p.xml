<p>In our study, 4015 HFMD cases analyzed by RT real-time PCR demonstrated that the serotype distribution of the three classifications was EV71 (30.1%), CV-A16 (28.7%) and other EVs (41.2%). The profile of the predominant serotype with other EVs was similar to that from Chongqing city, where the rate of other EVs was as high as 63.9% [

 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Variations in the serotype/genotype distribution in different Chinese geographic locations can be commonly found with other viruses, such as HIV [
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], HBV [
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and HCV [
 <xref rid="pone.0217474.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This is probably because of the diversity of transmission routes and different levels of susceptibility to viruses within the population. It can be inferred that a stable population of HFMD virus has not been formed in the Neijiang region due to the annual fluctuation of the serotype proportions during the study period. In addition, the VP1 sequences of EV71 and CV-A16 from Neijiang were merged in subtypes C4a (EV71) and B2b (CV-A16), which are commonly found in China and have a close phylogenetic relationship with those from other Chinese regions, and no distinct regional cluster was observed. The transmission routes and circulating pattern of HFMD virus in this area should be further explored.
