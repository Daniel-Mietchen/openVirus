<p>The limitations of this study were that only 51.1% (6513/12751) of probable HFMD cases were included in the analysis of the serotype distributions of the three main classifications, and only 110 cases selected from 2014 to 2017 were subtyped to identify the molecular characteristics of the HFMD virus. Further studies should focus on including more probable HFMD cases for RT real-time PCR and sequencing to obtain a comprehensive etiological distribution in this area. However, we can preliminarily obtain the sketch of the serotype composition and a glimpse of the phylogenetic relationships of the EV71 and CV-A16 strains in Neijiang associated with those from other regions in China. Additionally, the impacts of meteorological factors and variations in districts should be included in further analysis to better understand the epidemic patterns of HFMD in this area.</p>
