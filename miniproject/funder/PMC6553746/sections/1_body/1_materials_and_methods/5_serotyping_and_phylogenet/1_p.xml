Each complete VP1 or VP4 sequence was then compared to the sequences deposited in GenBank (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.megasoftware.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>) by the neighbor-joining method under Kimura's two parameter correction (1000 replicates). The HFMD virus reference sequences were retrieved from GenBank, including thirty-three reference sequences covering most genotypes for EV71 and CV-A16, one sequence for CV-A16 (EU812514) as an outgroup in the construction of the EV71 phylogenetic tree and one sequence for EV71 (U22521) as the outgroup in the CV-A16 phylogenetic tree.
