<p>Since this was a retrospective study, the samples collected before Jan 2014 were not included. From Jan 2014 to Dec 2017, randomly selected RT-real-time PCR positive samples (with amplification cycle numbers&lt;30 during RT real-time PCR mentioned above) underwent RT-PCR and sequencing, including EV71+ (n = 30), CV-A16+ (n = 30) and a sole pan-enterovirus+ (n = 50). The viral RNAs were extracted from 140 μL throat swab samples using a viral RNA extraction kit (QIAamp, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 100 μL water. The 891 nucleotides of the entire VP1 region or the 420 nucleotides of the VP4 region of the virus, were amplified using the primers and procedures described previously [
