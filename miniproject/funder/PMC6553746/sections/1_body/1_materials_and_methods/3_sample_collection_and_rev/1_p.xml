<p>For the Neijiang CDC, the application of RT real-time PCR to confirm HFMD cases was enacted in Jan 2012. According to the national guidelines, throat swab samples from 6513 probable cases (available for testing out of 12751 probable cases) from Jan 2012 to Dec 2017 were collected in Neijiang city. Samples were frozen and stored at -80°C at each site before being shipped in batches to the Neijiang Center for Disease Control (CDC), Sichuan CDC and Sichuan University for further testing. Enterovirus RNA was extracted from throat swab samples using a viral RNA extraction kit (QIAamp, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. One-step RT-real-time PCR was conducted using a commercial kit (BioPerfectus Technologies, Beijing, China; Cat No. JC20303) to detect the enterovirus RNA. The commercial assay was developed for multiple detections based on the Taqman probe method, which contains three sets of primer pairs and probes to detect EV71, CV-A16, and pan-enterovirus. The result was considered positive if amplification produced a signal at a cycle number ≤35 and otherwise was considered negative.</p>
