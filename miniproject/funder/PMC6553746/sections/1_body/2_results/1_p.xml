<p>A total of 14 928 probable cases of HFMD were reported during 2010â€“2017 in Neijiang, China, of which 47 (0.31%) were severe cases (

The annual incidence (calculated from probable cases) increased sharply from 19.51 to 70.73 per 100,000 from 2010 to 2012 and varied between 40 and 65 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2017, with an eight-year average annual incidence of 49.82 per 100,000. Notably, the variations in the incidence rates from 2012 to 2017 demonstrated a regular pattern of sine distribution with peaks at even-number years (2012, 2014 and 2016) (

 <sup>th</sup> to 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentile) of ages for the probable HFMD cases was between 14 and 42 months. There were more male than female cases (1.47:1), and most (81.7%) cases were from scattered children (children who do not attend kindergarten and are usually taken care of by their parents), followed by the children in kindergarten (16.5%). The monthly distribution of the probable HFMD cases displayed two epidemic peaks: the major peak was between April and July and the smaller peak was between October and December (
