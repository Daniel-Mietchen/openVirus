<p>Of 110 randomly selected RT-real-time PCR positive samples, RNA from 91 cases was successfully amplified and analyzed for the VP1 or VP4 regions: EV71+ (n = 23/30), CV-A16+ (n = 26/30) and a sole pan-enterovirus+ (n = 42/50) (

Of the 42 sole pan-enterovirus+ samples, 20 were CV-A6 (by VP4 genotyping), 14 were CV-A10 (by VP1 genotyping) and the other EVs identified by VP4 genotyping (n = 8) within this group were CV-A4 (n = 4), CV-A8 (n = 2), CV-A9 (n = 1) and CV-B3 (n = 1).
