<p>Of the 4015 probable cases confirmed by RT real-time PCR and identified for virus serotype, the distribution of EV71, CV-A16 and other EVs were 30.1% (n = 1210), 28.7% (n = 1154) and 41.1% (n = 1651), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217474.g003">Fig 3</xref>). From 2012 to 2017, the serotype distributions changed frequently, and the proportion of EV71 varied between 13.1% (2012) and 55.5% (2011), and CV-A16 varied between 6.1% (2013) and 43.7% (2014), while other EVs varied between 12.9% (2011) and 71.3% (2015) (
