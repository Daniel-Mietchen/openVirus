<p>Specificity is an important criterion for 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> diagnosis, as flaviviruses can induce cross-reactive IgG and high DENV prevalence is observed in the ZIKV endemic area. The specificity of the ZEDIII-based-ELISA was in the same range as that of the commercial test: within a 33.5% prevalence population, the probability of misdiagnosis would be 9.4% for the ZEDIII-based ELISA 
 <italic>versus</italic> 12.1% for the NS1-based assay, which was not significantly different when considering the IC 95% overlap. However, unlike the NS1-based ELISA, the sensitivity of our assay did not depend on the cohort tested. Relative to the NS1-based ELISA, our assay would lead to the misdiagnosis of 1.9% additional positive patients but 7.1% fewer negative patients. The recombinant refolded ZEDIII domain could thus be a good target for diagnosis. According to Matheus 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and our study (data not shown), IgG raised against ZIKV and ZEDIII were still present, with at least 50% of the maximum ODr, after 300 DPSO and up to several years after infection [

This minor limitation could allow us to carry out retrospective seroprevalence studies of the ZIKV outbreak, whereas detecting ZIKV-induced IgG with ZEDIII could be used to detect recent past infections in populations at risk. A specific diagnosis must also be reliable for pregnant women or those planning to become pregnant to indicate their ZIKV immunization status, and not necessarily at the first stages of putative ZIKV infection, to orient medical care, as ZIKV can cause miscarriage [
