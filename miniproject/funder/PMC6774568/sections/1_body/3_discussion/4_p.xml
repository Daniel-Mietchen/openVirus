<p>Given the high DENV seroprevalence observed in the area from which the ZIKV-IgM-positive group (mean age = 40 years) originated (93.5% of the Caribbean island population (mean age = 38 years), [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) it is likely that they were infected with DENV prior to ZIKV infection, although we have no way of knowing whether the antibodies that recognized ZEDIII were actually induced by DENV. We thus purified IgG against immobilized EDIII domains to discriminate between IgG induced by and directed against ZIKV from that induced by DENV but cross-reacting to both ZIKV and DENV. No IgG from the selected pools purified against D2EDIII or D4EDIII recognized ZEDIII. Such a lack of cross-reactivity underscores the high specificity of the immune response against this antigenic domain. It is likely that the anti-ZEDIII antibodies were induced by ZIKV infection and not DENV infection, as we were unable to observe recognition of ZEDIII by the sera of patients who had never been infected by ZIKV. Thus, the high sensitivity obtained with our assay is due to ZIKV-induced IgG recognition and not potential cross-reactive IgG. The binding experiments developed to validate the low cross-reactivity in the ZEDIII-based ELISA showed that IgG purified against D4EDIII partially recognized D2EDIII, and vice-versa. This result is not surprising, as the experimental conditions were designed to force cross-reactivity further than in a classical sero-diagnostic test with high IgG concentrations. Instead, the experiment validates ZEDIII as a relevant antigen for sero-diagnosis. We further validated the high specificity of the humoral immune response against EDIII by assessing the ability of ZEDIII-immunized mouse sera to recognize recombinant EDIII. The sera of ZEDIII-positive mice did not recognize D4EDIII. As the D4EDIII amino-acid sequence is that closest to ZEDIII, it is possible that the result would be the same with any other 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> EDIII. Finally, we designed experiments using DEDIII-purified IgG to show that the observed sensitivity and specificity were due to only ZIKV-IgG binding to ZEDIII. The epitopes present on the surface of DEDIII were only recognized by IgG that did not recognize ZEDIII. IgG induced by ZEDIII immunization recognized only epitopes present on the surface of ZEDIII. Thus, the epitopes recognized by ZEDIII-IgG are highly different from those carried by D4EDIIIand the EDIII epitopes are virus specific. We hypothesized that WNV induced IgG will not recognize ZEDIII.
