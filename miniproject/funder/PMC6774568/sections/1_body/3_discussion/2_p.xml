<p>We divided the set of sera into four groups based on various characteristics that allowed us to confirm their membership in each group. First, we determined the sensitivity of our assay using the reference group, the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group, which recognized the ZEDIII domain with the same sensitivity (90.7% [82.0; 99.4]) as the selected ZIKV-IgM-positive group (92.0% [84.5; 99.5]), allowing us to validate the ZIKV-IgM-positive group as a ZIKV-positive group. Thus, IgM that recognized only the total inactivated ZIKV, but not DENV (56.3% of ZIKV-infected patients), were induced by ZIKV, allowing the diagnosis of a recent ZIKV infection. Second, IgG from the sera of “
 <italic>flavivirus”</italic> patients, selected from 2013 to 2014 in Guadeloupe and Martinique, recognized all 
 <italic>flaviviruses</italic> where and when ZIKV was likely not circulating. The large size of our group and the rational to select the sera allowed us to assemble relevant panels of samples suitable to support a robust and accurate study of ZIKV IgG detection using recombinant ZEDIII antigen.
