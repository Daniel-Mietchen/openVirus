<p>Recombinant EDIII proteins have already been used as IgG-targets in ELISA and Microsphere ImmunoAssay to detect the immune response of horses and humans in seroprevalence studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and, in particular, ZEDIII to link pathology to infection in humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, no study has yet clearly shown the limits, specificity, and sensitivity of a ZEDIII-based ELISA. Our study reinforces precedent EDIII findings and shows the use of recombinant 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> protein-based ELISAs, such as that based on ZEDIII, to be potentially reliable, offering opportunities to develop rapid, inexpensive, and specific first-line assays. Antibodies specific to the infecting 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> are able to protect against a new infection by neutralization [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], whereas cross-reacting antibodies have been extensively linked to antibody-dependent enhancement, increasing viremia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This phenomenon has been observed for both DENV- and ZIKV-induced antibodies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our results suggest that ZEDIII, by inducing a strong and specific immune response, could also be a safe model for the development of vaccines.
