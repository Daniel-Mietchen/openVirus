<p>To date, the most robust and specific ZIKV sero-diagnostic test is the PRNT, which is costly and time-consuming. ELISA is also commonly used but usually serves as a first-line screen prior to PRNT, due to its low specificity. Indeed, we showed that 71% of IgG diagnoses were not reliable with an ELISA performed with inactivated ZIKV and that 48% of 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> sera were ZIKV-cross-reactive. We assessed our ZEDIII-based-ELISA and the NS1-based-ELISA (Euroimmun Assay) on the selected sera of the four groups. The ZEDIII- and NS1-based-ELISAs for IgG were 89.9% to 92.6% and 83.8% to 89.3% specific (calculated with the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group (n = 99) or the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group plus the negative group (n = 149), respectively), and had a sensitivity of 92.0% and 96.0%, respectively (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The sensitivity determined for the NS1-based ELISA varies significantly, depending on the cohort used: from 70.7% with the cohort of Matheus 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to 88.4% (ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group) or 92.0% (ZIKV-IgM-positive group) (Z-test between the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive or ZIKV-IgM-positive groups and the cohort of Matheus 
 <italic>et al</italic>., p = 2.5257 and p = 4.4080, respectively). With our assay, the sensitivity varied non-significantly from 90.7% (ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group) to 92.0% (ZIKV-IgM-positive group). The sensitivity of the ZEDIII-based ELISA can thus be considered stable. The ZIKV-IgM-positive group sera were collected in a DENV-endemic area, where the ZIKV infection is a second 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> infection, whereas this infection was the first for 65.6% of the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group. Thus, the difference in sensitivity could be due to this immunological scar.
