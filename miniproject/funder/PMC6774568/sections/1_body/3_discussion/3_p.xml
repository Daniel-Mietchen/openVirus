<p>The specificity for ZEDIII reached 89.9% and sensitivity 92.0%, whereas IgG presented cross-reactivity against total inactivated viruses (71% of IgG recognized both DENV and ZIKV). This makes recombinant EDIII one of the most robust tools for diagnosis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007747.g003">Fig 3</xref>), correct conformational folding of the EDIII protein is required for specific recognition. Indeed, chemical and heat denaturation of the protein led to the loss of recognition in ELISA assays, likely due to the loss of conformational epitopes, thereby decreasing specificity.
