<p>To date, no broad antibody cross-reactivity study has been performed for 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> with a particular emphasis on ZIKV, despite the often high co-endemicity of flaviviruses. Our study included more than 5,000 samples, providing sufficient power to observe statistically significant cross-reactivity results and select sera for the design of reference groups of patients. First, we observed low IgM cross-reactivity and high IgG cross reactivity against inactivated ZIKV, DENV, and WNV. This is generally observed with 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>-positive human sera, resulting in low diagnostic reliability of IgG-based assays [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The use of peptides or recombinant proteins can partially improve the specificity of IgG-based diagnostic assays. Indeed, ZEDIII is specifically recognized with high sensitivity by anti-ZIKV IgG and can distinguish between DENV and ZIKV in late phase or post-infection. IgM detection shows relatively good specificity (only 23.8% cross-reactivity) permitting the determination of the infecting 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, as already shown [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the IgM response does not persist. Thus, we studied ZEDIII recognition by IgGs, the most persistent antibodies.
