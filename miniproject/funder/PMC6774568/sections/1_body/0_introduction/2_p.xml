<p>According to WHO recommendations, the diagnosis is based on detection of the ZIKV genome by real-time reverse transcription PCR, serology, and neutralization assays, such as plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], further complicates the development of relevant target antigens for reliable serological diagnosis. Several immunodiagnostics based on IgM detection have been developed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, most cases are asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and ZIKV-IgG detection is relevant for dating or confirming infections, especially those of pregnant women, retrospective diagnosis for evaluating transmission intensity to decide on the use of a new prophylaxis, or confirming future ZIKV protection by vaccination.
