<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) was isolated in 1947 in the Zika forest in Uganda [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and has been responsible for sporadic cases for several decades. Epidemics in Yap State, Micronesia (2007) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], French Polynesia (2013) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and more recently the Americas 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], have dramatically changed its status. The association of ZIKV infection with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], have been brought to light during the last outbreaks. ZIKV can be sexually transmitted. This is uncommon for 
 <italic>flaviviruses</italic>, which are arthropod-borne viruses (
 <italic>arbovirus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Infective ZIKV particles have also been found in breast milk but whether neonatal infection or perinatal transmission can occur is unclear [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Due to the ZIKV threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on the 1
 <sup>st</sup> February 2016 [
