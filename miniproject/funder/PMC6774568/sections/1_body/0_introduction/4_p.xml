<p>In this context, we produced a recombinant ZIKV-EDIII protein (ZEDIII) and assessed its recognition by IgG. We constructed four representative panels of reference sera, (1) ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive, (2) ZIKV-IgM-positive, (3) 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>-positive but ZIKV-negative, and (4) 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>-negative, from more than 5,000 sera serodiagnosed at the French National Reference Center for Arboviruses (NRC). The objective was to evaluate a ZEDIII-based ELISA for its specificity (ability to detect IgG raised after infection by ZIKV, but not other flaviviruses) and sensitivity (ability to detect ZIKV-specific IgG in the serum of a patient confirmed to be ZIKV-positive). We thus designed three experiments to evaluate: (1) the specificity and sensitivity of recognition by the IgG of cohort sera, (2) potential purified DENV-IgG cross-reactivity, and (3) the specificity of ZEDIII-induced IgG. The specificity of the assay represents its ability to not detect false-positive sera, that is positivity due to cross-reactive antibodies that are able to recognize a common antigen with the same affinity shared by various viruses.
