<p>Vero cells were inoculated with 0.01 MOI ZIKV (African ZIKV strain, accession number ArB41644) or DENV2 (Martinique DENV2 98–703 strain of 1998, accession number AF208496) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) complemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3.5 (ZIKV) or 7 (DENV2) days. The time of growth depended on the virus. Culture supernatants were centrifuged, and viral particles precipitated with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) and NaCl. The precipitates were washed and resuspended in PBS/Hepes solution. This viral solution was inactivated with beta-propiolactone.</p>
