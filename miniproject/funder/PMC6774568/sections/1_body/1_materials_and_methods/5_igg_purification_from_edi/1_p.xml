<p>IgG were purified from pools of 20 sera from the ZIKV-positive group against ZEDIII, and 20 positive sera from the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>-positive but ZIKV-negative groups against D2EDIII or D4EDIII (25 μL per sera for a total of 500 μL per pool). Antibody purification was carried out in two steps, first on a protein-G column and then on a column with immobilized recombinant EDIII. For the immobilization of EDIII, 1 mg of recombinant ZEDIII, D2EDIII, or D4EDIII in 2.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was covalently bound to an NHS-activated column following the manufacturer’s protocol (GE Healthcare). Four milligrams of protein-G-purified antibodies from EDIII positive sera in 4 mL were then loaded onto the EDIII-coupled columns. After washes with PBS, EDIII-specific antibodies were eluted from the column with 1 mL 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7) and neutralized with 100 μL 1 M Tris (pH 9).
