<p>96-well plates (Maxisorp, NUNC-Immuno Plate) were coated with 200 ng/well of recombinant protein diluted in PBS and incubated over night at 4°C. After removing antigen, wells were blocked with blocking buffer (3% milk in PBS) for 1 h at 25°C. After two washing steps with washing buffer (1% Tween 20 in PBS), they were incubated with 100 μL diluted human serum samples (1:500), diluted purified human IgG (0.15 or 0.06 μg/mL), or sera from vaccinated mice diluted (1:25) in dilution buffer (3% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), then incubated 1 h at 25°C. After four washing steps, the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti–human IgG (1:10,000) (Jackson Laboratories, Immuno Research) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti–mouse IgG (1:40,000) (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in dilution buffer for 1 h at 25°C. After four washing steps, TMB (KPL, TMB microwell Peroxidase Substrate System) was added and the reaction stopped after 5 min with 50 μL 0.25M H

 <sub>4</sub> per well. The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm and the final values, OD ratio (ODr), obtained by dividing the average OD of duplicate wells from that of the corresponding blank non-coated wells. The threshold of positivity was calculated following the equation: m + 3σ (m = mean, σ = standard deviation, α (error) = 1%) on the ODr of the negative-sera group. Self-recognition of human purified IgG ODr was normalized to 100% for each EDIII.
