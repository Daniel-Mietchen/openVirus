<p>The IgG response data of the selected groups (ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive, n = 43; ZIKV-IgM-positive, n = 50; 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, n = 99; Negative, n = 50) were plotted showing the median, 25
 <sup>th</sup>, and 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunnâ€™s correction was used to identify the differences between the medians of the IgG responses with two-tailed and alpha = 0.01 for each test. The two-tailed Z-test with alpha = 0.05 was used to compare the difference in sensitivity of the ZEDIII- and NS1-based ELISAs according to the group or cohort used. The overlap of the IC 95% was assessed to compare the difference of misdiagnoses between the ZEDIII- and NS1-based ELISAs. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the difference of the mouse IgG responses to ZEDIII or D4EDIII.
