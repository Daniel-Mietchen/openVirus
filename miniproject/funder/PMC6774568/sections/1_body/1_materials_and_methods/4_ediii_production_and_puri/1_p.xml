<p>Sequences of the Asian ZIKV strain from the French Polynesia outbreak of 2013, DENV2, the most frequently detected serotype by the NRC for Arbovirus, and DENV4, the DENV strain phylogenetically closest to ZIKV (accession numbers AHZ13508, P09866, and M29095, respectively), were selected for EDIII production using the structure of the ZIKV envelope protein (PDB 5JHM). The ZEDIII, D2EDIII, and D4EDIII coding sequences, optimized for production in 
 <italic>E</italic>.
 <italic>coli</italic>, were synthesized in fusion with a His-tag coding sequence at their 5â€™ end by GenScript. The sequences were then cloned into pET-24a or pET-19b plasmids (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were produced in

 <italic>coli</italic> T7 Iq Express (New England Biolabs) and purified under denaturing conditions prior to

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The purity, conformation, and homogeneity of folding of the protein were controlled by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light-scattering analysis (SEC-MALS) and Coomassie blue-stained SDS PAGE gels.
