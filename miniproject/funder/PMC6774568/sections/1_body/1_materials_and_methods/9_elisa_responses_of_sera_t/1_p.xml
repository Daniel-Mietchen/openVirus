<p>96-well plates (Maxisorp, NUNC-Immuno Plate) were coated with inactivated viruses diluted (1:200) in PBS and incubated over night at 4°C. After removing antigen, wells were blocked with blocking buffer (3% milk and 1% sodium azide in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in the dark. After two washing steps with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), they were incubated with 100 μL human serum samples diluted (1:500) in dilution buffer (3% milk, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% sodium azide in PBS), then incubated 1 h at 41°C. After four washing steps, the wells were incubated with human secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti–human IgG (1:10 000) (Jackson Laboratories, Immuno Research), diluted in dilution buffer and incubated 1 h at 41°C. After four washing steps, TMB (KPL, TMB microwell Peroxidase Substrate System) was added and the reaction stopped after 5 min with 50 μL 0.25M H2SO4 per well. The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm and final values were obtained by dividing the average OD of duplicate wells from that of the corresponding blank wells coated with negative antigen. The threshold of positivity was fixed to an ODr of 3.</p>
