<p>The ZEDIII amino-acid sequence shares 46.3% and 47.2% identity and 64.8% homology with the amino-acid sequences of D2EDIII and D4EDIII, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007747.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The DENV2 and DENV4 EDIII amino-acid sequences share 61% identity and 78.1% homology. The purified EDIIIs analyzed by SEC-MALS and Coomassie blue-stained SDS Page gels showed the elution of a pure protein in a single and symmetric peak with an average molecular weight of 14.5 kDa and a polydispersity of 1.01 (

The presence and importance of the conformational epitopes for ZEDIII recognition was highlighted by the loss of recognition of ZIKV-positive sera against chemically and thermally denatured ZEDIII and a gain of recognition of flavivirus-positive but non ZIKV-positive or negative sera (
