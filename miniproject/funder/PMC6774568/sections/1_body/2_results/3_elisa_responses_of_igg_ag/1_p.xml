<p>We investigated the reactivity of IgG of the four sera groups against inactivated DENV, ZIKV, ZEDIII, and NS1 proteins (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) by ELISA. The ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive, ZIKV-IgM-positive, and 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> groups recognized DENV with medians of 14.4, 16.6, and 12.3 ODr, respectively, with no statistical difference (K = 5.02, p = 0.0811), whereas no negative serum samples recognized DENV (median ODr of 1.1). The ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive, ZIKV-IgM-positive, and 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> groups recognized ZIKV (median ODr of 8.6, 7.3, and 2.8, respectively). The levels of recognition between the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive or ZIKV-IgM-positive groups and flavivirus group were statistically different (Mean rank diff. = 89.61, p &lt; 0.0001; Mean rank diff. = 64.98, p &lt; 0.0001) but similar for the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive and ZIKV-IgM-positive groups (Mean rank diff. = 24.63, p = 0.0993). The negative group did not recognize ZIKV (median ODr of 1.1). The difference between the ability of the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive and 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> groups (median ODr of 2.2 and 1.1, respectively) or ZIK-IgM-positive and 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> groups (median ODr of 3.6 and 1.1, respectively) to recognize ZEDIII was highly significant (Mean rank diff. = 103.3, p &lt; 0.0001, Mean rank diff. = 123.2, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively), whereas there was no statistical difference between the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> and negative sera (median ODr of 1.1 and 1.2; respectively, Mean rank diff. = -13.75, p &gt; 0.9999) or the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive and ZIKV-IgM-positive sera (median ODr of 2.2 [1.7; 4.0] and 3.6 [2.0; 8.5]; respectively, Mean rank diff. = -19.82, p &gt; 0.9999). The median of the OD obtained for the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive and ZIKV-IgM-positive sera against ZEDIII was 0.12 (IQR [0.09; 0.24] min = 0.06; max = 1.96) and 0.29 (IQR [0.17; 0.64] min = 0.07; max = 2.10) respectively, whereas the median OD obtained against the blank was 0.05 (IQR [0.05; 0.06] min = 0.05; max = 0.08) and 0.08 ([0.07; 0.10], min = 0.05, max = 0.23), respectively.
