<p>We compared the reliability of the ZEDIII- and NS1-based ELISA by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV), the false discovery rate (FDR), the negative predictive value (NPV), and the false omission rate (FOR) within a ‘hypothetical population’ with a given prevalence of 33.5% (50/149), composed of ZIKV-IgM-positive (sensitivity identical to that of the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group) and 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> groups (n = 149; 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The likelihood of being positive when detected as positive (PPV) was 82.1% [72.1; 92.1] with the ZEDIII- and 75.0% [64.4; 85.6] with the NS1-based ELISA, whereas the likelihood of being negative when detected as negative (NPV) was 95.7% [91.6; 99.8] and 97.6% [94.3; 100] with the ZEDIII- and NS1-based assays, respectively. The likelihood of being positive when not detected (FOR) was 4.3% [0.2; 8.4] and 2.4% [0; 5.7] with the ZEDIII- and NS1-based ELISAs, respectively, and the likelihood of being negative when detected as positive (FDR) was 17.9% [7.9; 27.9] and 25.0% [14.4; 35.6] with the ZEDIII- and NS1-based ELISAs, respectively.
