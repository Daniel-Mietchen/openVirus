<p>With a calculated positive threshold based on the negative-group values (m + 3σ) of 1.54 (m = 1.17 and σ = 0.13), and tolerating a 1% error rate, one serum (2%) of the negative sera was positive against ZEDIII and 49 (98%) were negative. The smallest OD value considered to be positive with this positive threshold was 0.085, with a blank of 0.055, and the highest OD value was 2.12. The sensitivity was calculated as the number of positive sera from the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive or ZIKV-IgM-positive groups, of which 39 of 43 (90.7%) or 46 of 50 (92.0%), respectively, were positive against the ZEDIII-based assay (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and four (9.3% or 8.0%, respectively) did not react. The sensitivity [95% confidence interval] was thus 90.7% [82.0; 99.4] or 92.0% [84.5; 99.5], respectively. There was no difference in sensitivity between these two groups (Z-test, p = 0.2219). The specificity was calculated as the negative sera in the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group (n = 99) or in both the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group plus the negative group (n = 149). Ten sera (10.1%) of the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group or 11 sera (7.4%) of the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group plus the negative group were positive against ZEDIII and 89 or 138 were negative (89.9% and 92.6%, respectively). Thus, the specificity [95% confidence interval] was 89.9% [84.0; 95.8] or 92.6% [84.4; 100]. These groups were also tested against NS1 protein using the Euroimmun kit. We determined a specificity of 83.8% [76.8; 91.2] with the flavivirus group and up to 89.3% [84.3; 94.3] with the 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> group plus the negative group and a sensitivity of 88.4% [78.8; 98.0] with the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group and 96.0% [90.6; 100.0] with the ZIKV-IgM-positive group (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). There was no statistical difference in sensitivity between these two groups (Z-test, p = 1.3535). The specificity obtained with the NRC ELISA against ZIKV was 46.5% [36.7; 56.3]; the sensitivity was 100% with the ZIKV-RT-PCR-positive group and 96.0% [90.6; 100] with ZIKV-IgM-positive group.
