 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007747.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) represented 71.0% [69.1; 72.2] of the sera (n = 1,485) that reacted against at least one virus (n = 2,091). This cross-reactivity was evaluated by calculating the Spearman r correlation (p &lt; 0.0001; r(IgM) = 0.4191, r(IgG) = 0.7986). The r value for IgG indicates a strong correlation between the recognition of ZIKV and DENV (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007747.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We obtained similar results concerning the cross-reactivity of IgM (11.6% [8.3; 14.9]; n = 42) and IgG (79.7% [77.4; 82]; n = 971) against WNV and ZIKV (
