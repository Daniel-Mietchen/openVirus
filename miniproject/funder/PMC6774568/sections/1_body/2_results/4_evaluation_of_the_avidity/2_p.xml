<p>We next addressed the immune response induced by the recombinant ZEDIII. The median ODr of the sera obtained after the immunization of eight mice by ZEDIII was 2.25 and 1.02 against ZEDIII and D4EDIII, respectively. The difference between the ability of the sera to recognize the two recombinant proteins was significant (W = 36, p = 0.0078). None of the five ZEDIII-positive sera from mice (n = 8) recognized D4EDIII (
