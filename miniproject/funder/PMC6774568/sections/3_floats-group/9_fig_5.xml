  <title>Cross-reactivity and specificity of IgG directed against ZEDIII.</title>
  <p>(A) Cross-reactivity of purified anti-EDIII IgG. Purified IgG against D2EDIII or D4EDIII were tested by ELISA. The recognition of ZEDIII is shown in dark grey, D2EDIII in white, and D4EDIII in light grey. Self-recognition is normalized to 100%. (B) The IgG response to ZEDIII and D4EDIII of immunized mice was measured by ELISA. The median is shown for both ZEDIII and D4EDIII. **W = 36, p = 0.0078.</p>
