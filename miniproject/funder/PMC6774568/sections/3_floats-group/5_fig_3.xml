  <title>Characterization of refolded ZEDIII.</title>
  <p>(A) Raw data of the analytical size-exclusion chromatography of ZEDIII followed by MALS/UV/refractometry. The abscissa and ordinate axes correspond to the elution volume and the molecular weight (Da) obtained by MALS, respectively. The OD
   <sub>280nm</sub> is represented by the non-continuous black trace and the molecular weight by the continuous black trace. The value of the measured molar mass (14.5 kDa) at the volume corresponding to the top of the peak is reported. The population of ZEDIII with a molar mass of 14.5 kDa is more than 95%. (B) Purity of ZEDIII after refolding and purification analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue. MW: molecular weight (in kDa). Lane 1: ZEDIII under reducing conditions (DTT); Lane 2: ZEDIII under non-reducing conditions. (C) Recognition of linear and conformational epitopes by ZIKV-IgM-positive (green, n = 50), 
   <italic>flavivirus</italic> (red, n = 50), and negative (yellow, n = 50) groups by ELISA.
