<p>At 3 months (M3), patients were examined by a team physician to identify CCA cases. At 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12), patients were interviewed by phone using the DAG questionnaire (which is made up of closed questions) to monitor persistent symptoms (in particular joint pain), the impact on quality of life (as measured by the “EQ5D” scale), and treatments received. Patients were definitively classified as having CCA if they answered NO at any time of follow-up from M3 onwards to the following question: “Do you feel completely recovered from CHIKV-infection, in other words, are you now free of joint pain, rigidity, or edema related to this infection?” A clinical examination to describe and manage remaining disorders was proposed to these patients. Only patients who felt completely recovered from chikungunya at all visits from M3 onwards were categorized as NO CCA (without chronic chikungunya disease). The global clinical assessment of CCA subjects was conducted using the “Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire” (MDHAQ). Patients with chikungunya are known to experience a fluctuation of their symptoms (continuously or recurrently) over time. Patients with relapsing CCA were defined as having “disorders present at 1 and/or 2 time points without recovery” and patients with lingering CCA were defined as having “disorders present at all 3 time points: M3, M6, and M12.”</p>
