<p>Of the 193 patients, 21 were lost to follow-up (i.e., they did not attend any of the follow-up visits from M3 onwards), 3 of whom had died before M3 (causes of death were: adenocarcinoma of the prostate, multiple organ failure in the acute phase of CHIKV-infection, and unknown cause). Between M6 and M12, 1 patient died of myeloma; however, this patient was not excluded from the study because he had been reported as CCA at M3 (i.e., prior to his death). Five subjects had an undetermined CHIKC status at all follow-up visits, and were therefore excluded from the analysis.</p>
