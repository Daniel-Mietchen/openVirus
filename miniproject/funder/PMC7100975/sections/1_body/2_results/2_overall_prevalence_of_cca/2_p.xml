<p>A total of 167 patients were classified as either CCA or no CCA. Close to half the patients missed the M3 visit, as only 46 CCA patients and 38 no CCA patients were counted at the time. However, a greater number of patients were evaluated at M6 and M12, respectively 142 (85%; 51 CCA and 91 no CCA) and 143 (86%; 45 CCA and 98 no CCA) patients. Of the 167 participants, 87 had experienced CCA by M12, giving an overall prevalence of 52.10% (CI 95% 44.5–59.7). Ten CCA patients attended only 1 visit, and so their CCA profile (“relapsing” or “lingering”) could not be assessed. Of the 77 CCA patients, 64 (83.12%) had relapsing CCA and 13 (16.88%) had lingering CCA.</p>
