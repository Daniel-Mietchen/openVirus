<p>In our study, increased urea (p = 0.02) and reduced frequency of intravenous rehydration (p = 0.04) were associated with the development of CCA in univariate analysis. This finding suggests that initial dehydration is one of the potential factors leading to the development of CCA, just as it can cause complications in other arbovirus infections [

Our results also indicate that vertigo (p = 0.03) and headache (p = 0.04) are symptoms of dehydration, and that vomiting (p = 0.03) is an aggravating factor for dehydratation. Note that vomiting was a significant factor in the multivariable analysis, along with age and sex. The difficulty in diagnosing dehydration and the lack of human and material resources explain why rehydration was not systematically performed in our cohort of patients with CHIKV.
