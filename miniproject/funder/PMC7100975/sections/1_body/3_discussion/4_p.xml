<p>Because cartilage is largely composed of water [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A study by Sahni et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] on the impact of prolonged dehydration on osseous tissue and calcium phosphate metabolism in mice concluded that prolonged water deficiency leads to decreased bone mass, with an increased rate of bone resorption and mineralization defect. It is also established that calcium metabolism disorders stimulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and activation of bone resorption by osteoclast. In our study, no difference in calcemia was observed between CCA and no CCA patients in the acute phase. However, the rate of calcium was available for only 61 patients (as our study sample was small), and this one-off measure does not reflect metabolic disorders over the medium to long term. In fact, hydration may help dilute pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines recruited in joints and may enhance anti-inflammatory response. While articular cartilage is a mechanically highly challenged material with very limited regenerative ability, recent data by Boettcher et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] have shown that a broad range of mechanical and structural properties of cartilage can be restored after rehydration with physiological salt solution.
