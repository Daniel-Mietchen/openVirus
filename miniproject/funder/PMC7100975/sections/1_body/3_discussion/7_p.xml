<p>Some studies have described the inflammatory and autoimmune processes in the acute and chronic phases of chikungunya disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Several of them have identified a positive relationship at disease onset between CRP level [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], pro-inflammatory cytokines [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and severity at presentation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, no autoimmune markers for CHIKV have been highlighted in observational studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In other studies, biomarkers associated with CCA were IL-6 secretion [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and GM-CSF at disease onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In a study conducted in Reunion Island, the proper role of specific IgG titers in predicting CCA was observed and positively correlated with age, female sex, and severity of initial rheumatic symptoms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Yet, this study found no association between CRP level at disease onset and CCA.
