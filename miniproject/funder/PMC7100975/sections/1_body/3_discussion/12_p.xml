<p>To conclude, this first prospective study conducted during the chikungunya outbreak in Martinique has described the course of the disease in the local population and has estimated the burden at 1 year. Our findings confirm that more than half of adult symptomatic infections become chronic, with age and female sex as major risk factors for incident chronic chikungunya. The predictors of chronicity identified in the acute phase lead us to suggest that dehydration is a compounding factor in the occurrence of persisting chikungunya-associated rheumatic disorders. This hypothesis opens up new avenues for prevention and research in CHIKV pathways.</p>
