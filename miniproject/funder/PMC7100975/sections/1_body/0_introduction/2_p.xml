<p>Chikungunya, a Makonde term meaning “that which bends up” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], is an acute illness similar to dengue that is characterized by the abrupt onset of high-grade fever, followed by constitutional symptoms such as polyarthritis, musculoskeletal pain, headache, and skin involvement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and in rare cases by severe manifestations such as encephalopathy [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], myocarditis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and multi-organ failure. The acute phase (viremic period) lasts from 5 to 10 days on average, and is resolved within a few weeks. In May 2015, the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] defined a person with chronic chikungunya as a “person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least 1 of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.” Chronic arthralgia (i.e., “suspected chronic chikungunya arthritis” or “CCA”) is a common complication post CHIKV-infection. Some studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have reported that 40 to 60% of patients with acute chikungunya experience significantly impaired quality of life in the long term. Other studies have found that patients affected by CCA were significantly older [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], had severe initial rheumatic symptoms [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and had high CHIK-specific IgG titers [

The first autochthonous cases of chikungunya were described in the region in November 2013 (in December 2013 in Martinique) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The Asian lineage was identified as the circulating genotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. At the end of the outbreak (in approximately January 2015), the number of affected people was estimated at 145,000 (36% of the population) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The aim of the present study was: first, to determine the prevalence of CCA at 12 months of follow-up, and second, to search for acute phase factors significantly associated with chronicity.
