  <title>Relationship between the number of simulated Zika virus positive mosquito pools and human infections, and estimated incidence rate of human infections.</title>
  <p>Panel A shows the estimated incidence of human infections per week by the number of Zika virus positive female 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> pools per week. Panel B is the estimated incidence of human infections per week by the number of infections in emergency department patients with two or more Zika virus symptoms per week. The lines are Bayesian negative binomial regression models fitted to predict the estimated incidence of human infections from the number of positive mosquito pools and the number of humans with two or more symptoms. The bands represent 95% credible intervals.
