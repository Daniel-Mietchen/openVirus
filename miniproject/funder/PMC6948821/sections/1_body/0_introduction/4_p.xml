<p>An alternative to detecting arboviruses in humans is virological surveillance in mosquitoes, which involves capturing and testing host seeking female mosquitoes. For West Nile virus, which has a primary transmission cycle between infected 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and birds, virological surveillance in mosquitoes can facilitate viral detection prior to human disease case identification [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, transmission of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses occurs mainly between 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and human hosts. Even during outbreaks, detecting these viruses in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is infrequent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this context, the possible tradeoffs between vector and human virological surveillance are unclear. Here, we leveraged a unique set of data from human and vector surveillance during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic in Caguas, Puerto Rico to compare strategies for detecting and monitoring arbovirus activity.
