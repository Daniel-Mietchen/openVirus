<p>First identified in Uganda in 1947, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in the Americas in 2015 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, multiple surveillance strategies are possible (e.g. active and passive, vector-based and human); all have tradeoffs that may vary depending on the epidemiological situation. For example, a previous assessment of human-based surveillance systems to detect ZIKV transmission in U.S. counties found that despite low probabilities of care-seeking among ZIKV-infected individuals, testing symptomatic people seeking medical care was a more effective strategy than testing blood donors or all pregnant women [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Testing pregnant women was found to be a less efficient strategy because it requires more tests, has a much higher false positive rate, and has a lower probability of detection than testing only patients with two or more Zika symptoms.
