<p>Population-based surveillance and detection of ZIKV is critical to guide timely public health and medical responses to emerging epidemics. Optimal surveillance strategies should be sensitive, specific, and cost-effective [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-transmitted arbovirus surveillance systems have widely focused on testing the human population at risk. In a previous comparison of human-focused ZIKV surveillance approaches, a strategy focusing on patients seeking emergency department care was found to be more effective and efficient than routine testing of pregnant women or blood donors [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> provides an alternative approach to early detection of virus circulation and monitoring of transmission dynamics during outbreaks that does not depend on human surveillance.
