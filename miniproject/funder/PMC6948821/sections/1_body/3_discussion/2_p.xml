<p>In our simulation models for high transmission scenarios, both vector and human surveillance strategies effectively detected ZIKV. In low transmission scenarios, routine mosquito surveillance with high trap numbers had higher detection probabilities, although the probability of detection was still low (7%). This increased sensitivity also implies that for every confirmed human case there are more infected humans in the population than for every positive mosquito pool. That difference may result from the higher barriers to testing among humans in our model, which included developing two or more symptoms seeking care in an emergency department, and being viremic at the time of testing [
