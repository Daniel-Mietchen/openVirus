<p>The simulations suggested some potential gains in sensitivity for virological surveillance of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, a finding substantiated by the detection of ZIKV in mosquitoes in Mexico without reported human cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the increased resources needed are likely prohibitive in most circumstances. For example, during the study period there were 8,518 tests on mosquito pools in a subsection of Caguas compared to 452 tests on suspect human cases in all of Caguas. Some of the testing burden may be ameliorated by using “superpools” for mosquito testing [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], but the trapping itself also remains a challenge. Moreover, despite the intensive mosquito trapping and testing in Caguas and the small proportion of ZIKV-infected people who seek care, human surveillance was more sensitive than mosquito surveillance. In communities without health care facilities or in which people do not seek care, virological surveillance in mosquitoes have an important role. Virological surveillance in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> could also potentially help detect low levels of virus circulation, but only with extensive trapping and testing. In most situations where human surveillance systems already exist, such as in Caguas, human surveillance is likely to be more effective.
