<p>From October, 2016, to August, 2017, 360 sentinel autocidal gravid ovitraps (SAGO) were placed in eight clusters in Caguas encompassing approximately 80,000 residents [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Within each cluster, fixed SAGOs were placed in outdoor areas of randomly selected households located at least 100 m from the adjacent clusters with 109–131 m between each trap. If the homeowner did not give consent or was not home, traps were placed in a location adjacent to the randomly selected site. Each cluster had 38–53 traps placed among approximately 3,000 built structures for an overall trap density of approximately 0.14 traps per building or one trap per 70.5 buildings. Traps were monitored on a weekly basis by field technicians, mosquitoes were sexed, and identified as
