<p>To estimate the probability of detection for each system we assumed that the number of true infections detected in mosquito pools or human patients was generated from a Poisson distribution with the means as the expected number of true positives as described above (
 <italic>E</italic>(
 <italic>P</italic>)). We therefore calculated the probability of detection, 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>detect</italic>
 </sub>, as 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>detect</italic>
 </sub> = 1−
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sup>−(
  <italic>E</italic>(
  <italic>P</italic>))
 </sup>.
