<p>We first calculated the numbers of expected true and false positives from the human and mosquito surveillance strategies. For humans, the expected number of true positives (
 <italic>E</italic>(
 <italic>P</italic>)) was the product of the prevalence of infection, the probability of being tested in the surveillance system, and the sensitivity of the human RT-PCR assay. The expected number of false positives was the product of the probability of being tested in the surveillance system for people not infected with ZIKV and one minus the specificity of the human RT-PCR assay. The expected number of true positive mosquito pools (
 <italic>E</italic>(
 <italic>P</italic>)) was the product of the total number of pools, the probability of a pool containing an infected mosquito, and the sensitivity of the mosquito RT-PCR assay. Finally, the expected number of false positive pools was calculated as the product of the total number of pools, the probability of a pool not containing an infected mosquito, and one minus the specificity of the RT-PCR assay.
