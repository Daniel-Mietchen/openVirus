<p>To assess the relationship between our simulations and the observed data from Caguas, we first fitted these models to the simulation data in order to estimate the relationship between the number of infected humans or mosquito pools observed by the surveillance system and the number of underlying human infections in the population (130,000 for the human surveillance and 80,000 for the mosquito surveillance). We then used the fitted model to estimate the number of infections in the two populations based on the observed numbers of human cases and positive pools from the 2016â€“2017 surveillance data.</p>
