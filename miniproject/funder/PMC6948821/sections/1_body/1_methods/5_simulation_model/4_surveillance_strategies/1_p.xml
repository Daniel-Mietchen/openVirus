<p>We modeled four different surveillance strategies. Three of the strategies used 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> surveillance data at different trap densities: the number of traps equivalent to what was used in the study area of Caguas (360 traps), half as many traps (180 traps), and twice as many traps (720 traps). The fourth model used human surveillance for acutely ill patients with ZIKV symptoms. The four surveillance strategies were evaluated at different transmission densities, ranging from one to 1,000 human cases per 100,000 per week.
