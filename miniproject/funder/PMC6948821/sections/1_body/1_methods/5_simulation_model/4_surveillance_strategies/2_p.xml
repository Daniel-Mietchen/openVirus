<p>Human surveillance data was assumed to be similar to previously published estimates for identifying ZIKV cases from emergency departments in the continental United States [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, we assumed that 20–40% of infections result in symptoms, 10–50% of people with symptomatic infections seek care, 5–50% of those patients seek care in an emergency department, and 82.4–83.3% of those patients have at least two of the following ZIKV symptoms: arthralgia, conjunctivitis, fever, headache, or rash. Human surveillance in Puerto Rico differs from this simulation in at least two ways: reporting was not limited to emergency departments and reporting of suspect cases relies on clinical suspicion, not a specific clinical definition. We used the emergency department assumption and stricter case definition to approximate patients seeking immediate care for acute illness with clinical suspicion of ZIKV. For reported suspect ZIKV patients, we assumed all testing was performed with RT-PCR with sensitivity of 80–95% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007988.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
