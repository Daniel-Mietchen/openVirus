In addition, the virus experiences different selective pressures at multiple levels: during the course of infection, at transmission, and among individuals. Disentangling how these evolutionary forces shape the evolution of the virus at the population scale is important for understanding pathogenesis, how drug- and immune-escape variants are likely to spread in populations, and the development of preventive vaccines. To address this, we deep-sequenced two regions of the HIV-1 genome (p24 and gp41) from 34 longitudinally-sampled untreated individuals from Rakai District in Uganda, infected with subtypes A, D, and inter-subtype recombinants. This dataset substantially increases the availability of HIV-1 sequence data that spans multiple years of untreated infection, in particular for different geographical regions and viral subtypes. In line with previous studies, we estimated an approximately five-fold faster rate of evolution at the within-host compared to the population scale for both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, and for all subtypes. We determined the extent to which this mismatch in evolutionary rates can be explained by the evolution of the virus towards population-level consensus, or the transmission of viruses similar to those that establish infection within individuals. Our findings indicate that both processes are likely to be important.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The speed at which HIV-1 evolves within individuals and across epidemics is substantially different. Identifying the mechanisms shaping this phenomenon has important implications for understanding disease severity and transmission of HIV-1, especially when considering the spread of viruses that are resistant to drugs or natural host defenses in the population. In this study, we analyze newly generated HIV-1 sequences sampled from 34 individuals living in Uganda over multiple years, together with publicly available HIV-1 sequences from Uganda at the population scale. Our findings indicate that HIV-1 evolves around five times faster within individuals compared to the population scale. We demonstrate that there are likely two key processes driving the difference in HIV-1 evolutionary rate at the within individual and population scales. Specifically, we find support for 1) selection against variants in the within-host viral population, which were acquired in the donor because they were beneficial in that individual, and 2) preferential transmission of variants that are similar to those that initiated the infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107652/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7089-7680</contrib-id><name><surname>Lythgoe</surname><given-names>Katrina A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-07-2-0067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinn</surname><given-names>Thomas C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBDR-339251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2399-9657</contrib-id><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>JR and KAL were supported by The Wellcome Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/">https://wellcome.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and The Royal Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://royalsociety.org/">https://royalsociety.org/</ext-link>) grant no. 107652/Z/15/Z (KAL).

This, combined with error-prone viral replication during reverse transcription, means that the viruses an individual transmits to a recipient are unlikely to be identical to those that initially infected them. A firm understanding of how evolution proceeds during the course of infection within an individual, and how this corresponds to evolution of the virus at the population scale, is therefore required to understand how selection acts at the point of transmission. This is important for vaccine design, and understanding how the virus evolves at the epidemiological scale.</p><p>To understand the natural history of within-host HIV-1 infection, historical samples from untreated individuals are needed. The few datasets that exist, where multiple (&#x0003e;2) within-host sequenced samples are available, including from early infection, and spanning years rather than months, include nine subtype B individuals from North America [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], ten individuals from Europe, where eight were infected with subtype B, and two were infected with subtypes C and AE, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and four female individuals from North America infected with subtype B [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Here, we add considerably to this small but important body of data by presenting longitudinal deep-sequencing data from 34 untreated individuals living in Rakai, Uganda, representing infection with pure subtypes A and D, and a variety of inter-subtype recombinants, thus expanding both the geographical regions and the viral subtypes for which data are available. As well as undertaking an evolutionary analysis of the within-host sequence data, we also determined the rate of evolution of subtypes A, C, and D at the population scale within Uganda, during approximately the same time period. Interestingly, we found that the nonsynonymous substitution rate in the gp41 region of <italic>env</italic> is twice as fast for subtype C compared to other subtypes.</p><p>An indication that evolution at the population scale does not merely represent a continuation of directional within-host evolution, with repeated bottlenecks at the point of transmission, is the observation that HIV-1 evolves about two to six times faster within hosts than at the population scale [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although here we examined different subtypes and gene regions to previous studies, our analysis confirms a similar mismatch in evolutionary rates.</p><p>Three alternative hypotheses for the mismatch in HIV-1 evolutionary rates have been proposed [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: The first, called &#x02018;stage-specific selection&#x02019;, suggests that transmission tends to occur early in infection, when within-host evolution is also suggested to be slow, resulting in slower than expected evolution at the population level [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Stage-specific selection is supported by the observation that the rate of evolution at the population level was found to be slower in populations where transmission probably occurs earlier during infection, such as among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although still subject to debate, stage-specific selection is unlikely since cellular and antibody driven escape mutations have been shown to develop rapidly during early infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and because stage-specific selection is expected to lead to a greater mismatch for nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions; a pattern that we do not see [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, a more recent study found a faster rate of evolution in MSM than in heterosexual transmission chains [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting other factors likely explain differing rates of evolution among different groups.</p><p>The second hypothesis, called &#x02018;adapt and revert&#x02019;, suggests that within-host evolution is dominated by the &#x02018;reversion&#x02019; of mutations that were advantageous in the source host but detrimental in the recipient host [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that within-host evolution is biased towards the accumulation of mutations towards the consensus at the population level [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The use of the term of reversion here is contentious because it implies adaptive evolution is going backwards, undoing what was selected for in a previous individual. However, at an individual level, adaptive evolution always goes forwards, thereby selecting for fitter genotypes. It is only when we step back to consider forward within-host evolution in the context of the viruses circulating at the population level that reversion is observed.</p><p>The final hypothesis suggests that during the course of infection viral lineages that resemble the virus that initiated the infection are maintained, and that these &#x02018;founder-like&#x02019; viruses are preferentially transmitted. In this scenario, the cycling of viral lineages through the HIV-1 reservoir maintains these founder-like viruses within the population [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and therefore this process is referred to as &#x02018;store and retrieve&#x02019;. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of HIV transmission chains, in which slower evolving lineages are transmitted [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; studies of discordant couples showing evidence for the transmission of founder-like viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; variation in the rate of evolution along different within-host lineages [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; and the observation that viruses founding new infections are adapted to early infection, yet under-represented in donor populations [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Adapt and revert and store and retrieve have largely been presented as either/or scenarios, but these processes need not be mutually exclusive [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, recombination and differing selection pressures in different genomic regions, means their contributions might not be homogeneous across the genome [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using longitudinal deep-sequenced data from 34 HIV-1 seroconverters from the Rakai District in Uganda, we tested specific predictions of the adapt and revert and store and retrieve hypotheses, in an effort to quantify their relative contributions. First, we tested whether synonymous and/or nonsynonymous mutations show a strong bias in substitutions towards the population consensus, as predicted by &#x02018;adapt and revert&#x02019; [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Second, we tested whether a sufficient number of founder-like viruses persist as infection progresses for their preferential transmission to explain the mismatch in phylogenetic rates for synonymous and/or nonsynonymous mutations, as required for store and retrieve [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Rather than being a case of either/or, our data suggest that both processes are likely to be important in explaining the mismatch in evolutionary rates. Moreover, our analysis supports previous work that purifying selection can explain why rates of viral evolution decline as the timescales over which they are measured increase from decades to millennia [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study population</title><p>Thirty four HIV-1 seroconverters from the Rakai District in Uganda, previously found not to be superinfected with HIV-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] using deep-sequencing (Roche 454, Pleasanton CA) were selected for further analysis based on sample availability (<xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

We fitted a linear regression to the diversity and divergence estimates over time among the 34 individuals. Diversity at third codon positions accumulated at similar rates in p24 and gp41, but diversity at the first and second positions accumulated much more slowly for p24 compared to gp41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This is consistent with stronger purifying selection acting upon p24 and stronger diversifying selection acting upon gp41. This is further supported by the divergence patterns. In p24, nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions accumulated at approximately similar rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>; bottom left panel). In contrast, for gp41 notably greater nonsynonymous divergence than synonymous divergence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>; bottom right panel). We further examined the diversity and divergence patterns by excluding nine individuals, which were likely infected with multiple viral variants (defined as &#x0003e; = 0.02 mean pairwise diversity across all sites in the p24 gene region at the first time point). This may not identify all individuals where multiple viral variants were transmitted, particularly if these variants are very similar or where one variant has been lost. Nevertheless, no discernible impact on mean diversity and divergence trends was observed when these individuals were excluded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1007167.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007167.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Diversity and divergence over time for 34 individuals for both p24 and gp41.</title><p>Top Row: Mean pairwise diversity at first, second, and third codon positions over time for individuals (represented in yellow, pink, and light blue, respectively).

To some extent, this reflects stochastic error associated with short gene regions and the 454-sequencing method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In particular, biases in genome amplification during PCR are likely to result in diversity being underestimated. However, within-host evolutionary dynamics probably also has an important role. One individual (i24) had very high diversity in the gp41 gene region at the third codon position at the first sampling time point, which subsequently declined over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2A Fig</xref>; bottom right panel). Inspection of the maximum clade credibility trees (summary of the posterior tree distribution from BEAST) indicates this individual was infected by at least two different viral variants, which were very similar in p24, but very different in gp41 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This is reflected in the low posterior support for the two infecting lineages in the p24 tree, but high posterior support (0.82&#x02013;1.0) for multiple infecting lineages in the gp41 tree, which were maintained throughout infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The fall in diversity at the third codon position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) between the penultimate and last time points for i24 corresponds to one of the lineages predominating among the sampled viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This probably reflects ongoing within-host competition between the two lineages, with eventually one lineage prevailing. A similar pattern of falling diversity is seen in the p24 gene region of i17, where a fall in diversity at the last sampled time point (1919 days) coincides with the loss of one of the within-host lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Given sequence similarity at the first time point, the multiple lineages observed in i17 probably emerged during infection rather than due to coinfection. In the gp41 region of this individual we also see a drop in diversity between days 828 and 923. This possibly reflects the complex within-host evolutionary dynamics inferred by the MCC tree of this individual (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), although since this individual had a relatively low SPVL (<xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), amplification errors during sequencing could affect the estimates of diversity.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Within- and between-host evolutionary rates</title><p>Next we looked at absolute nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at the within-host level. Estimated rates of within-host viral evolution varied considerably among individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and were consistent with previous measures of within-host rates of viral evolution for subtype B infected individuals in <italic>gag</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the gp120 region of <italic>env</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The comparatively large uncertainty in the estimates of within-host evolutionary rates are most likely due to the short gene regions analyzed and lower rates of evolution compared to gp120. Regardless, a significant mismatch was observed between the within- and between-host evolutionary rates in both gene regions for subtypes A, C, and D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Note that for recombinant infections, individuals have different subtypes at each of the two regions (<xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mean ratios of the within- and between-host rates ranged from 3.0 to 8.8, and were similar for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, and did not differ by gene region or subtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s013">S1 Table</xref>), although some of these estimates were associated with large uncertainties (standard deviation ranged from 1.1 to 5.9). It has previously been argued that higher rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution at the within-host level compared to the between-host level is compatible with store and retrieve, but not stage-specific selection or adapt and revert [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], since under the latter two hypotheses a mismatch is only expected for nonsynonymous substitutions. However, this assumes that synonymous substitutions experience lower levels of selection compared to nonsynonymous substitutions, which might not always be the case due to their effects on RNA secondary structure [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat.1007167.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007167.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Evolutionary rates for p24 and gp41 at the within- and between-hosts scales measured in substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year).</title><p>The within-host nonsynonymous (filled circles) and synonymous (open circles) substitution rates were estimated for p24 and gp41 for all 34 individuals, which are ordered from left to right (subtype A, pink; subtype C, green; subtype D, yellow).

These observations are consistent with gp41 being subjected to stronger diversifying selection than p24, together with p24 undergoing comparatively greater purifying selection. We see similar patterns in the between-host evolutionary rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Notably, subtype C was characterized by the highest overall substitution rate in gp41 (~0.002 subs/site/year), which appears to be driven by a comparatively higher nonsynonymous substitution rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s013">S1 Table</xref>). This elevated rate for subtype C is in line with a previous study, but where substitution rates were estimated from whole-genome sequences that were sampled from a broader geographic distribution [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>To corroborate the within-host evolutionary estimates using the renaissance counting method and hierarchical phylogenetic model, we performed three sets of auxiliary analyses in BEAST for a subset of ten individuals consisting of five pure subtype A and five pure subtype D infections, i.e. for a given HIV-1 infection, p24 and gp41 gene regions corresponded to the same subtype. Furthermore, based on mean diversity at the first time point in the p24 gene region, these individuals were unlikely to have been infected by multiple, genetically distinct strains. The results from the sensitivity analyses are briefly discussed here, but a full description can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s016">S1 Text</xref>. First, we found a strong correspondence in the evolutionary rates for the ten individuals from the original analysis (based on 34 individuals) and the new analysis, which was based on ten individuals with pure subtype infections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This strongly suggests that individuals infected with multiple variants have not impacted the evolutionary rate estimates for individuals infected with single viral variants. Next, we estimated evolutionary rates for the subset of individuals using a full codon substitution model [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which were in good agreement with estimates from the renaissance counting method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Finally, we examined the robustness of the evolutionary rate estimates for the ten individuals to different hyperpriors in the clock hierarchical phylogenetic model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s016">S1 Text</xref> for more details). The evolutionary rate estimates were found to be very similar across different hyperpriors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), strongly suggesting that the posterior estimates of the within-host evolutionary rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref> are mostly informed by the sequence data and are robust to the choice of hyperprior in the hierarchical phylogenetic model.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Link between within-host rates of evolution and set-point viral load</title><p>In a previous analysis comparing within-host rates of evolution with set-point viral load (SPVL), Lemey <italic>et al</italic>. observed a significant correlation between the synonymous substitution rate of the C2V5 region along the backbone branches (ancestral internal branches in the phylogeny that have given rise to the most recently sampled sequences) and the rate of disease progression [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specifically, individuals with slower disease progression had lower rates of synonymous substitution than individuals with faster disease progression. Since SPVL is a strong predictor of disease progression in HIV-1 infection, we examined the correlation between the within-host evolutionary rate and SPVL to determine whether a similar relationship exists between synonymous substitution rate and disease progression in the Rakai cohort. In contrast to Lemey <italic>et al</italic>., we found no significant correlation between the mean absolute synonymous or non-synonymous substitution rate (on either external, internal, or backbone branches) and SPVL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s009">S9 Fig</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s015">S3 Table</xref>). We also tested for a subtype-specific effect, but again, we did not find a significant correlation. The lack of a significant correlation observed here could be because there is no link between substitution rate and SPVL among the Rakai individuals, or because of uncertainty in the substitution rate and/or SPVL estimates. In particular, the p24 and gp41 gene regions have low rates of evolution compared to the C2V5 region, which is typically associated with an order of magnitude higher rate of evolution (see Fig 3 in [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]).</p><fig id="ppat.1007167.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007167.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Changes towards population consensus.</title><p>Top Row: The proportion of polymorphic sites where a mutant allele represents a change towards the (subtype-specific) population consensus.

Limiting our analysis to sites within individuals where the most common (founder) allele at the first time point was at or close to fixation (frequency &#x0003e;0.99), we defined polymorphic sites as those where a different (mutant) allele had reached a frequency of &#x0003e;0.1 at some point during the sampling period. Across all individuals, between 10 and 30 percent of the mutant alleles observed at polymorphic sites represented changes towards population consensus in p24 and gp41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). Moreover, there was a strong bias, with changes towards population consensus at polymorphic sites occurring approximately 1.5 to 2 times more often than expected in the absence of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). Here, we assumed a mutational transition to transversion ratio of two, representing a biochemical preference for transitions. The broad pattern remains the same if we do not assume a preference for transitions, although the calculated bias is higher (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these observations can explain a substantial mismatch in evolutionary rates, in broad agreement with a similar analysis using deep-sequencing data from nine European individuals [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, if viruses that are more similar to the population consensus are preferentially transmitted [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], an even higher mismatch in evolutionary rates could be explained.</p><p>We next considered nonsynonymous and synonymous changes separately. A high proportion of nonsynonymous changes (mean proportion of 0.45 and 0.17, respectively, for p24 and gp41, at 0&#x02013;2 years post seroconversion) were towards population consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). Furthermore, at polymorphic sites, these nonsynonymous changes were associated with a strong bias, such that changes towards population consensus occurred twice as often as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). Considering all sites close to fixation at the first sampling time point (not just polymorphic sites), and assuming mutations are equally likely at all sites, nonsynonymous changes continued to show a strong bias towards population consensus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Together, these observations provide strong evidence for the role of adapt and revert for nonsynonymous substitutions, particularly in p24, which is consistent with stronger functional constraints being present in p24 compared to gp41.</p><p>A reasonably high proportion of synonymous changes were also towards population consensus (mean proportion of 0.10 and 0.11, respectively, for p24 and gp41, at 0&#x02013;2 years post seroconversion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). This was accompanied by a small bias at polymorphic sites in p24, but there was no detectable bias in gp41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). The absence of a strong bias at polymorphic sites suggests adapt and revert contributes little to the mismatch in evolution rates for synonymous changes when comparing rates at the within-host and population scales. Considering all sites, however, a bias towards population consensus was observed for synonymous changes in both gene regions, although this bias was much smaller than for nonsynonymous changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s010">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s011">S11</xref> Figs). In other words, of all the changes that could occur (the vast majority of which will be away from population consensus, since most sites are at population consensus), and assuming mutation is equally likely at all sites, synonymous changes towards population consensus are much more likely than would be expected by chance. The detection of this bias for synonymous changes, when all sites are considered, provides evidence that a high proportion of synonymous changes are non-neutral, because, for example, they affect RNA secondary structure [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This is consistent with the observation that across the whole subtype B HIV-1 genome, synonymous mutations that occur away from population consensus during infection are often weakly deleterious, but with a significant proportion (~10% outside of <italic>env</italic>) being highly deleterious [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Evolution towards population consensus for synonymous changes, when all sites are considered, therefore most likely represents weak purifying selection, possibly exacerbated by the transmission of viruses harboring slightly deleterious mutations due to tight bottlenecks at transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Founder-like virus persists during the course of infection</title><p>Assuming virus is not transmitted directly from the reservoir, a key prediction of store and retrieve is that founder-like viruses should be circulating in the viral population at sufficient frequencies, with a mismatch in evolutionary rates occurring if these founder-like viruses are preferentially transmitted.

This pattern remains if we remove individuals likely infected by multiple variants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). As infection progresses, transmitted viruses are predicted to contribute less to a mismatch in evolutionary rates due to the gradual loss of founder-like viruses. A mismatch is still predicted if the data are partitioned between synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations (assuming selection at transmission is determined by the total number of mutations), although the predicted mismatch is generally less for nonsynonymous mutations. This is presumably because nonsynonymous mutations are subject to stronger within-host selection, and therefore founder-like variants are less likely to be preserved as infection progresses.</p><fig id="ppat.1007167.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007167.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Contribution to the mismatch in evolutionary rates if founder-like virus has a transmission advantage.</title><p>Each point represents the mean contribution of the 34 individuals to the mismatch in phylogenetic rates if transmission occurs during the given time period, and where each viral sequence has a transmission fitness <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = <italic>e</italic><sup>&#x02212;<italic>&#x003b1; d</italic></sup>.

However, if founder-like viral lineages are maintained during infection (because they have spent a long time in the reservoir where neither error-prone replication nor recombination occur) linkage across much longer regions, and possibly the whole genome, is expected for these lineages [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Because we do not have linkage information between sequences in p24 and gp41, we were unable to determine whether viruses that harbor founder-like p24 sequences also harbor founder-like gp41 sequences, as would be expected if the preferential transmission of founder-like viruses explains the mismatch observed in both regions, and more generally the mismatch observed across the whole genome [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, although our observations are consistent with store and retrieve, due to short read lengths (390 bp for p24 and 324 bp for gp41), and relatively low rates of evolution for these two gene regions, we have insufficient power to test whether these founder-like viral variants are maintained because of cycling of lineages through the viral reservoir, or simply due to the stochastic nature by which mutations are accumulated along lineages in these two short gene regions. To resolve this question, longitudinal, long-read deep-sequencing data is needed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using cryopreserved samples from individuals longitudinally sampled before the availability of universal treatment in the Rakai District of Uganda, we have substantially increased the number of individuals for which deep-sequenced data is available for HIV-1 during the course of untreated infection. The main subtypes represented in this HIV-1 cohort are A and D, rather than subtype B, which predominates in the more frequently studied European and North American cohorts. As well as analyzing this within-host sequence data, we also utilized publicly available population consensus sequences from Uganda, enabling us to directly compare rates of viral evolution at both the within-individual and population scales in the same population and for the same regions of the genome.</p><p>It is notable that the virus evolves approximately three to nine times faster at the within-host than at the population scale. This pattern was observed for all three subtypes in both gene regions and for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions.

Together with the observation that within-host viral lineages leading to transmission events evolve approximately half as fast as other lineages [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], these findings build a consistent picture of different rates of evolution for HIV-1 within- and between-hosts, for all of the subtypes that have been analyzed, and across the whole genome. Intriguingly, similar mismatches in evolutionary rates are observed for HIV-2, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], leading us to speculate that such mismatches are a general feature of rapidly evolving chronic viral infections in humans.</p><p>We tested specific predictions of two of the mechanisms that have been implicated as contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates in HIV-1: adapt and revert and store and retrieve, with the aim of quantifying their relative roles. For nonsynonymous changes, our results are consistent with both adapt and revert, and store and retrieve, contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates. For synonymous changes, on other hand, our results are consistent with store and retrieve contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates, but with adapt and revert contributing little (p24) if at all (gp41). We conclude that both mechanisms are likely to have important roles, but that these differ for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, and, given the differences seen between p24 and gp41 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g004">4</xref>), our data suggests their relative contributions also differ across genome.</p><p>Here, we have focused on the mismatch in evolutionary rates when within individual and population level rates are compared, with both rates measured across short timescales of years to a few decades. It is now well recognized that rates of viral evolution at the population level also decline as the timescales over which they are measured increase from decades to millennia [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This is often attributed to a combination of purifying selection, with the appearance and persistence of slightly deleterious mutations (independent of host genotype) over short time scales, but their eventual purging over longer time scales; and saturation effects, which are expected to be pronounced in RNA viruses due to their short genomes and high mutation rates [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we also detected patterns of evolution within individuals that are consistent with purifying selection, specifically the purging of transmitted slightly deleterious mutations, which may contribute to the slowing of measured evolutionary rates at the population level as progressively longer timescales are considered. It is also possible that adapt and revert, and store and retrieve, might provide additional mechanisms leading to this slowing of measured evolutionary rates [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], but further work is needed to assess their likely importance.</p><p>A unique feature of our analysis is the number of individuals included. This makes our overall analysis more robust than those based on fewer individuals, and also highlights the heterogeneity in patterns observed among individuals as well as between the two gene regions we looked at. There is ongoing interest in trying to estimate the number of variants initiating HIV infections [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our analysis highlights that focusing on a single gene region can potentially be misleading. For example, diversity measurements for individual i24 indicate infection by a single variant when looking at the p24 gene region, but multiple variants when looking at the gp41 region. The most likely scenario is that the donor individual (or i24 before the first sampling timepoint) was superinfected by a distinct variant from an unknown individual, followed by recombination in either the donor or i24, which led to the maintenance of two distinct lineages in gp41 but not p24. Similarly, there is interest in estimating time since infection from measures of within-host viral diversity [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, diversity is not always a good measure, as it can be elevated for substantial periods of time due to the persistence of multiple founder lineages, as seen in individual i24, and can drop dramatically as a consequence of within-host population dynamics, as likely seen in individuals i24 and i17, although amplification biases cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The continual adaptation of HIV-1 to different host environments and selection at the point of transmission are both likely to contribute to the complex patterns of HIV-1 evolution observed at the within-individual and population levels. Moreover, different selection pressures acting across the genome coupled with high rates of recombination further complicate the picture [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, recombination is likely to elevate within-host evolutionary rates as a result of generating more diverse viral lineages. Disentangling the evolutionary pressures faced by chronic viruses will not only help us to understand how selection acts across multiple ecological scales [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but will also have direct clinical importance by shaping our understanding of pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], how drug- and immune-escape variants are likely to spread through populations [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and in the development of preventive vaccines [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].

Briefly, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from 140&#x003bc;L plasma, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using a nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to produce amplicons corresponding to portions of the viral p24 (~390 bp) and gp41 (~324 bp) gene regions.

In order to remove any residual contaminating sequences a representative sequence from all distinct viral populations for each sample run in a given NGS sequencing plate were combined in a neighbor-joining tree, and any micro-contamination or spill-over sequences that localized with another unrelated sample were removed. A final manual alignment of the sequences was performed to ensure the sequences aligned within and across the different individuals for all time points, and gaps were inserted where necessary to keep the reads in-frame. One or two base-pair insertions associated with homopolymeric tracks were removed. This realignment typically reduced the number of distinct consensus sequences at each time point because the position of gaps in the sequences was standardized. Through this procedure, most errors associated with 454 sequencing of HIV were corrected for, particularly indels associated with homopolymeric regions [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].

A common approach is to use the consensus sequence at the first sampled time point as a proxy for the founder strain. However, if an individual was infected by multiple strains, this can give misleading estimates and add considerable noise to the data. To help remediate this effect, we identified genetically distinct subgroups at the first sampling time point using hierBAPS (Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure) [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The consensus sequence of each of these subpopulations was then determined, with these representing our proxies of the founder strain(s). We note that although sufficient for our analysis, this is not a good method to determine the actual number of founder strains in our data, with some consensus sequences from the same individual differing by only a single base in our analysis.

For divergence, we estimated the mean pairwise genetic difference at each time point between each viral gene sequence from that time point and the consensus sequence(s) from the first time point. In cases where multiple consensus sequences were estimated, we inferred the most closely related ancestral sequence by only considering the minimum pairwise genetic difference for each sequence against the available consensus sequences.

For the within-host evolutionary analysis, this approach has been shown to yield more precise estimates (e.g. [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]), as it enables information about the evolutionary parameters (e.g. substitution model and molecular clock) to be explicitly shared among the different individual datasets while allowing independent evolutionary histories for each individual. Specifically, renaissance counting is a probabilistic counting method for estimating nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates and site-specific dN/dS ratios using codon-partitioned nucleotide substitution models. It is based on a stochastic mapping approach, which infers the changes (or counts) at each site in the alignment across the phylogeny using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model of nucleotide substitutions, and empirical Bayes modeling to avoid inflated standard errors of the number of substitution counts, namely by excluding counts that are either zero or infinity. Site-specific dN/dS ratios can be estimated by dividing the observed nonsynonymous (cN) and synonymous substitutions (cS) with expected nonsynonymous (uN) and synonymous changes (uS), e.g. dN/dS = (cN/cS)/(uN/uS). As this method is implemented in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, estimates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates also take into account phylogenetic uncertainty. Furthermore, it compares well with methods that use codon substitution models, with the advantage that it is more computationally efficient. For our analysis, we first estimated posterior tree distributions for each individual (for both gene regions), using a codon-structured nucleotide substitution model [<xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], a strict molecular clock, and a constant tree prior, and applied noninformative hierarchical priors on the substitution, clock, and population parameters. These were subsequently used as empirical tree distributions for the renaissance counting analysis, where noninformative hierarchical priors were similarly employed for all evolutionary parameters. To reduce the computational burden of the within-host evolutionary analysis, we used a subsampled dataset for each individual, where 25 sequences per time-point were randomly selected for each gene region. The final dataset comprised of 8100 sequences where each gene-specific individual dataset ranged from 75 to 125 sequences.
