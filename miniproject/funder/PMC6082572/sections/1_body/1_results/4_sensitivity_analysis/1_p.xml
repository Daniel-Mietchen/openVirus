<p>To corroborate the within-host evolutionary estimates using the renaissance counting method and hierarchical phylogenetic model, we performed three sets of auxiliary analyses in BEAST for a subset of ten individuals consisting of five pure subtype A and five pure subtype D infections, i.e. for a given HIV-1 infection, p24 and gp41 gene regions corresponded to the same subtype. Furthermore, based on mean diversity at the first time point in the p24 gene region, these individuals were unlikely to have been infected by multiple, genetically distinct strains. The results from the sensitivity analyses are briefly discussed here, but a full description can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s016">S1 Text</xref>. First, we found a strong correspondence in the evolutionary rates for the ten individuals from the original analysis (based on 34 individuals) and the new analysis, which was based on ten individuals with pure subtype infections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). This strongly suggests that individuals infected with multiple variants have not impacted the evolutionary rate estimates for individuals infected with single viral variants. Next, we estimated evolutionary rates for the subset of individuals using a full codon substitution model [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Finally, we examined the robustness of the evolutionary rate estimates for the ten individuals to different hyperpriors in the clock hierarchical phylogenetic model (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s016">S1 Text</xref> for more details). The evolutionary rate estimates were found to be very similar across different hyperpriors (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), strongly suggesting that the posterior estimates of the within-host evolutionary rates in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref> are mostly informed by the sequence data and are robust to the choice of hyperprior in the hierarchical phylogenetic model.
