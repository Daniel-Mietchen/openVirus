<p>When interpreting these results, it is important to acknowledge the role of recombination, which for within-host viral populations has been shown to limit linkage disequilibrium to about 100â€“200 bps [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, if founder-like viral lineages are maintained during infection (because they have spent a long time in the reservoir where neither error-prone replication nor recombination occur) linkage across much longer regions, and possibly the whole genome, is expected for these lineages [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Because we do not have linkage information between sequences in p24 and gp41, we were unable to determine whether viruses that harbor founder-like p24 sequences also harbor founder-like gp41 sequences, as would be expected if the preferential transmission of founder-like viruses explains the mismatch observed in both regions, and more generally the mismatch observed across the whole genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, although our observations are consistent with store and retrieve, due to short read lengths (390 bp for p24 and 324 bp for gp41), and relatively low rates of evolution for these two gene regions, we have insufficient power to test whether these founder-like viral variants are maintained because of cycling of lineages through the viral reservoir, or simply due to the stochastic nature by which mutations are accumulated along lineages in these two short gene regions. To resolve this question, longitudinal, long-read deep-sequencing data is needed.
