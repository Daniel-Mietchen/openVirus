<p>For both gene regions, a large mismatch in evolutionary rates can be explained if founder-like viruses have a strong transmission advantage (Î± ~ 2), and if transmission tends to occur during the first few years of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This pattern remains if we remove individuals likely infected by multiple variants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s012">S12 Fig</xref>). As infection progresses, transmitted viruses are predicted to contribute less to a mismatch in evolutionary rates due to the gradual loss of founder-like viruses. A mismatch is still predicted if the data are partitioned between synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations (assuming selection at transmission is determined by the total number of mutations), although the predicted mismatch is generally less for nonsynonymous mutations. This is presumably because nonsynonymous mutations are subject to stronger within-host selection, and therefore founder-like variants are less likely to be preserved as infection progresses.
