<p>Assuming virus is not transmitted directly from the reservoir, a key prediction of store and retrieve is that founder-like viruses should be circulating in the viral population at sufficient frequencies, with a mismatch in evolutionary rates occurring if these founder-like viruses are preferentially transmitted. We determined how ‘founder-like’ a virus is within an individual by the number of mutations, 
 <italic>d</italic>, the virus differs from the consensus virus(es) circulating at the first sampled time point. Thus, we are essentially using a small portion of the genome (p24 or gp41) as a surrogate for the whole genome. We next assumed that each viral sequence has a transmission fitness 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sup>−
  <italic>α d</italic>
 </sup>, where 
 <italic>α</italic> determines how rapidly transmissibility declines as sequences evolve away from the first time point consensus sequence(s), under the assumption that 
 <italic>d</italic> is representative of how founder-like the whole genome is. The predicted contribution to the mismatch in evolutionary rates of an individual at a given sampling time point is then given by the mean value of 
 <italic>d</italic> in the viral population at that time point, divided by the expected mean value of 
 <italic>d</italic> in the transmitted viral population (see
