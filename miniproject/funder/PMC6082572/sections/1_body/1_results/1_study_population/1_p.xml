<p>Thirty four HIV-1 seroconverters from the Rakai District in Uganda, previously found not to be superinfected with HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] using deep-sequencing (Roche 454, Pleasanton CA) were selected for further analysis based on sample availability (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the previous superinfection screen, early and late samples were sequenced at the p24 region of 
 <italic>gag</italic> and the gp41 region of 
 <italic>env</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We sequenced serum samples from three additional time points after HIV-1 seroconversion and prior to initiation of ART (anti-retroviral therapy) using identical methods. These data were combined with the previous sequence data for all subsequent analyses, resulting in longitudinal deep-sequencing data for a 390 base pair (bp) region of p24 and a 324 bp region of gp41.
