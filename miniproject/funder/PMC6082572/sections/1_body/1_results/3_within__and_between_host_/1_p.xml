<p>Next we looked at absolute nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at the within-host level. Estimated rates of within-host viral evolution varied considerably among individuals (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the gp120 region of

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The comparatively large uncertainty in the estimates of within-host evolutionary rates are most likely due to the short gene regions analyzed and lower rates of evolution compared to gp120. Regardless, a significant mismatch was observed between the within- and between-host evolutionary rates in both gene regions for subtypes A, C, and D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Note that for recombinant infections, individuals have different subtypes at each of the two regions (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mean ratios of the within- and between-host rates ranged from 3.0 to 8.8, and were similar for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions, and did not differ by gene region or subtype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s013">S1 Table</xref>), although some of these estimates were associated with large uncertainties (standard deviation ranged from 1.1 to 5.9). It has previously been argued that higher rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution at the within-host level compared to the between-host level is compatible with store and retrieve, but not stage-specific selection or adapt and revert [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], since under the latter two hypotheses a mismatch is only expected for nonsynonymous substitutions. However, this assumes that synonymous substitutions experience lower levels of selection compared to nonsynonymous substitutions, which might not always be the case due to their effects on RNA secondary structure [
