<p>In line with the patterns observed for divergence over time, a greater nonsynonymous substitution rate was noted for gp41 than for p24 among the different subtypes, whereas synonymous substitution rates were comparable (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). These observations are consistent with gp41 being subjected to stronger diversifying selection than p24, together with p24 undergoing comparatively greater purifying selection. We see similar patterns in the between-host evolutionary rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Notably, subtype C was characterized by the highest overall substitution rate in gp41 (~0.002 subs/site/year), which appears to be driven by a comparatively higher nonsynonymous substitution rate (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s013">S1 Table</xref>). This elevated rate for subtype C is in line with a previous study, but where substitution rates were estimated from whole-genome sequences that were sampled from a broader geographic distribution [
