<p>We next considered nonsynonymous and synonymous changes separately. A high proportion of nonsynonymous changes (mean proportion of 0.45 and 0.17, respectively, for p24 and gp41, at 0â€“2 years post seroconversion) were towards population consensus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). Furthermore, at polymorphic sites, these nonsynonymous changes were associated with a strong bias, such that changes towards population consensus occurred twice as often as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). Considering all sites close to fixation at the first sampling time point (not just polymorphic sites), and assuming mutations are equally likely at all sites, nonsynonymous changes continued to show a strong bias towards population consensus (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). Together, these observations provide strong evidence for the role of adapt and revert for nonsynonymous substitutions, particularly in p24, which is consistent with stronger functional constraints being present in p24 compared to gp41.
