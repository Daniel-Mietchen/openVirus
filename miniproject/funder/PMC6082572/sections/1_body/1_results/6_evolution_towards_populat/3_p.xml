<p>A reasonably high proportion of synonymous changes were also towards population consensus (mean proportion of 0.10 and 0.11, respectively, for p24 and gp41, at 0â€“2 years post seroconversion; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). This was accompanied by a small bias at polymorphic sites in p24, but there was no detectable bias in gp41 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). The absence of a strong bias at polymorphic sites suggests adapt and revert contributes little to the mismatch in evolution rates for synonymous changes when comparing rates at the within-host and population scales. Considering all sites, however, a bias towards population consensus was observed for synonymous changes in both gene regions, although this bias was much smaller than for nonsynonymous changes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s011">S11</xref> Figs). In other words, of all the changes that could occur (the vast majority of which will be away from population consensus, since most sites are at population consensus), and assuming mutation is equally likely at all sites, synonymous changes towards population consensus are much more likely than would be expected by chance. The detection of this bias for synonymous changes, when all sites are considered, provides evidence that a high proportion of synonymous changes are non-neutral, because, for example, they affect RNA secondary structure [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This is consistent with the observation that across the whole subtype B HIV-1 genome, synonymous mutations that occur away from population consensus during infection are often weakly deleterious, but with a significant proportion (~10% outside of 
 <italic>env</italic>) being highly deleterious [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Evolution towards population consensus for synonymous changes, when all sites are considered, therefore most likely represents weak purifying selection, possibly exacerbated by the transmission of viruses harboring slightly deleterious mutations due to tight bottlenecks at transmission [
