<p>A prediction of adapt and revert is that, of sites where evolutionary change is observed, the accumulation of mutations should be biased towards the population consensus as infection progresses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Limiting our analysis to sites within individuals where the most common (founder) allele at the first time point was at or close to fixation (frequency &gt;0.99), we defined polymorphic sites as those where a different (mutant) allele had reached a frequency of &gt;0.1 at some point during the sampling period. Across all individuals, between 10 and 30 percent of the mutant alleles observed at polymorphic sites represented changes towards population consensus in p24 and gp41 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, top row). Moreover, there was a strong bias, with changes towards population consensus at polymorphic sites occurring approximately 1.5 to 2 times more often than expected in the absence of selection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). Here, we assumed a mutational transition to transversion ratio of two, representing a biochemical preference for transitions. The broad pattern remains the same if we do not assume a preference for transitions, although the calculated bias is higher (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, if viruses that are more similar to the population consensus are preferentially transmitted [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], an even higher mismatch in evolutionary rates could be explained.
