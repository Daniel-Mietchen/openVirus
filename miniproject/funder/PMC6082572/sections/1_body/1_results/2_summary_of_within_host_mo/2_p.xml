<p>Although diversity and divergence tended to increase as infection progressed, we observed considerable variation among individuals, with diversity notably not always increasing between subsequent time points (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To some extent, this reflects stochastic error associated with short gene regions and the 454-sequencing method (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In particular, biases in genome amplification during PCR are likely to result in diversity being underestimated. However, within-host evolutionary dynamics probably also has an important role. One individual (i24) had very high diversity in the gp41 gene region at the third codon position at the first sampling time point, which subsequently declined over time (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2A Fig</xref>; bottom right panel). Inspection of the maximum clade credibility trees (summary of the posterior tree distribution from BEAST) indicates this individual was infected by at least two different viral variants, which were very similar in p24, but very different in gp41 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This is reflected in the low posterior support for the two infecting lineages in the p24 tree, but high posterior support (0.82â€“1.0) for multiple infecting lineages in the gp41 tree, which were maintained throughout infection (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The fall in diversity at the third codon position (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) between the penultimate and last time points for i24 corresponds to one of the lineages predominating among the sampled viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This probably reflects ongoing within-host competition between the two lineages, with eventually one lineage prevailing. A similar pattern of falling diversity is seen in the p24 gene region of i17, where a fall in diversity at the last sampled time point (1919 days) coincides with the loss of one of the within-host lineages (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Given sequence similarity at the first time point, the multiple lineages observed in i17 probably emerged during infection rather than due to coinfection. In the gp41 region of this individual we also see a drop in diversity between days 828 and 923. This possibly reflects the complex within-host evolutionary dynamics inferred by the MCC tree of this individual (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), although since this individual had a relatively low SPVL (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), amplification errors during sequencing could affect the estimates of diversity.
