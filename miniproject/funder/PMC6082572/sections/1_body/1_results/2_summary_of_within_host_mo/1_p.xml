 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates mean diversity (at 1
 <sup>st</sup>, 2
 <sup>nd</sup> and 3
 <sup>rd</sup> codon positions) and divergence (for synonymous and nonsynonymous changes) over time among the 34 individuals for gp41 and p24. We fitted a linear regression to the diversity and divergence estimates over time among the 34 individuals. Diversity at third codon positions accumulated at similar rates in p24 and gp41, but diversity at the first and second positions accumulated much more slowly for p24 compared to gp41 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This is consistent with stronger purifying selection acting upon p24 and stronger diversifying selection acting upon gp41. This is further supported by the divergence patterns. In p24, nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions accumulated at approximately similar rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>; bottom left panel). In contrast, for gp41 notably greater nonsynonymous divergence than synonymous divergence was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>; bottom right panel). We further examined the diversity and divergence patterns by excluding nine individuals, which were likely infected with multiple viral variants (defined as &gt; = 0.02 mean pairwise diversity across all sites in the p24 gene region at the first time point). This may not identify all individuals where multiple viral variants were transmitted, particularly if these variants are very similar or where one variant has been lost. Nevertheless, no discernible impact on mean diversity and divergence trends was observed when these individuals were excluded (
