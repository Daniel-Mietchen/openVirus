<p>In a previous analysis comparing within-host rates of evolution with set-point viral load (SPVL), Lemey 
 <italic>et al</italic>. observed a significant correlation between the synonymous substitution rate of the C2V5 region along the backbone branches (ancestral internal branches in the phylogeny that have given rise to the most recently sampled sequences) and the rate of disease progression [

Specifically, individuals with slower disease progression had lower rates of synonymous substitution than individuals with faster disease progression. Since SPVL is a strong predictor of disease progression in HIV-1 infection, we examined the correlation between the within-host evolutionary rate and SPVL to determine whether a similar relationship exists between synonymous substitution rate and disease progression in the Rakai cohort. In contrast to Lemey 
 <italic>et al</italic>., we found no significant correlation between the mean absolute synonymous or non-synonymous substitution rate (on either external, internal, or backbone branches) and SPVL (

The lack of a significant correlation observed here could be because there is no link between substitution rate and SPVL among the Rakai individuals, or because of uncertainty in the substitution rate and/or SPVL estimates. In particular, the p24 and gp41 gene regions have low rates of evolution compared to the C2V5 region, which is typically associated with an order of magnitude higher rate of evolution (see Fig 3 in [
