<p>Diversity and divergence over time were calculated on the full sequence data using custom-made Python scripts, which are available on github (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/katrinalythgoe/RakaiHIV" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/katrinalythgoe/RakaiHIV</ext-link>). For divergence, we estimated the mean pairwise genetic difference at each time point between each viral gene sequence from that time point and the consensus sequence(s) from the first time point. In cases where multiple consensus sequences were estimated, we inferred the most closely related ancestral sequence by only considering the minimum pairwise genetic difference for each sequence against the available consensus sequences. Diversity corresponded to the mean pairwise genetic differences among the sequences sampled at a particular time point. For both diversity and divergence, we only considered sites with minor allele frequency greater than 0.056% (the estimated error-frequency per nucleotide from [
