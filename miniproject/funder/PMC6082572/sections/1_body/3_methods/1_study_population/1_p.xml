Apart from i11, the first sequenced sample corresponds to the first positive sample (for i11, the first positive sample was 46 days earlier than the first sequenced sample). Individuals who had both gp41 and p24 regions sequenced for both time points previously screened, were not superinfected, and who had at least three additional serum samples available as part of the MER study were included in the study (
