<p>SPVL was calculated using similar criteria to [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], by taking the mean log
 <sub>10</sub> viral load from all visits where viral load measurements were available, which were more than 6 months after the estimated date of seroconversion, and before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy or the onset of AIDS. This included viral load measurements taken from additional visits to those for which sequence data is available. The first viral load measurement from three individuals (i6, i15, and i20) was excluded because they were more than ten times higher than all subsequent measurements, indicating these individuals were in acute infection at the time (i.e. seroconverted soon before the first seropositive sample, rather than at the mid-point between the last seronegative and first seropositive samples, as assumed).
