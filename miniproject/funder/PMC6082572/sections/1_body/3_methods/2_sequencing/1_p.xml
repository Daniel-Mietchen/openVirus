<p>Previously generated sequences were used for this analysis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Briefly, HIV-1 RNA was extracted from 140μL plasma, reverse-transcribed, and amplified using a nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to produce amplicons corresponding to portions of the viral p24 (~390 bp) and gp41 (~324 bp) gene regions. The corresponding HXB2 reference genome positions for p24 and gp41 used in this study are 1429–1816 and 7941–8264, respectively. Successfully amplified samples for both study visits (baseline and follow-up) in at least one region were sequenced using the 454 DNA Sequencing platform as previously described, with adjustments to use a 2-region format (Roche, Branford, CT) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Pools of samples were processed using emPCR Amplification Manual-Lib-L-LV–June 2013 (Roche Branford, CT) using 25% of the recommended amplification primer amount and a 0.2 copy-per-bead ratio [
