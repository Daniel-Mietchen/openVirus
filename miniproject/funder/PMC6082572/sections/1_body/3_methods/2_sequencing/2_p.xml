<p>The resulting sequencing reads were analyzed and similar sequences were combined into a single consensus sequence. The number of reads and consensus sequences for each sample in the study, plus viral load and CD4 counts where available, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s014">S2 Table</xref>. Short sequence reads (&gt;10 bp short of the individual consensus) were removed, and consensus sequences that encompassed a cluster of at least ten individual, near-identical sequence reads were determined and used for all subsequent analyses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In order to remove any residual contaminating sequences a representative sequence from all distinct viral populations for each sample run in a given NGS sequencing plate were combined in a neighbor-joining tree, and any micro-contamination or spill-over sequences that localized with another unrelated sample were removed. A final manual alignment of the sequences was performed to ensure the sequences aligned within and across the different individuals for all time points, and gaps were inserted where necessary to keep the reads in-frame. One or two base-pair insertions associated with homopolymeric tracks were removed. This realignment typically reduced the number of distinct consensus sequences at each time point because the position of gaps in the sequences was standardized. Through this procedure, most errors associated with 454 sequencing of HIV were corrected for, particularly indels associated with homopolymeric regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To reduce the impact of substitution errors introduced through 454 sequencing, we excluded in our evolutionary analyses sites within individuals where the second-most frequent allele frequency was &lt;0.056% (the estimated error-frequency per nucleotide [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]), under the assumption that polymorphisms at these sites were due to sequencing error. We also checked the resulting alignments for recombination using RDP4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which did not detect any recombination breakpoints.
