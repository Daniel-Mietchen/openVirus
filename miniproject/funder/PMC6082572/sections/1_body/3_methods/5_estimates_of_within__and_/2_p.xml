<p>To estimate the between-host evolutionary rates, we collated independent datasets for subtypes A, C and D HIV-1 infections from Uganda using the HIV LANL database. The sequences were subsequently randomly sampled, resulting in approximately 200 sequences in each dataset. For the subtype C dataset, there were fewer sequences available from Uganda (specifically, 43 and 90 respectively for p24 and gp41 gene regions). However, these datasets were considered to have sufficient temporal structure (along with subtypes A and D), as evaluated by root-to-tip regression method in TempEst [
