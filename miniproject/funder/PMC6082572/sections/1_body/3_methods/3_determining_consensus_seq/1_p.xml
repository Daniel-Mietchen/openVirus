<p>Estimating the founder strain(s) that initiated each infection is challenging because the first sampling time point for each of the individuals in our study is estimated to be between 150 and 425 days since seroconversion. A common approach is to use the consensus sequence at the first sampled time point as a proxy for the founder strain. However, if an individual was infected by multiple strains, this can give misleading estimates and add considerable noise to the data. To help remediate this effect, we identified genetically distinct subgroups at the first sampling time point using hierBAPS (Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The consensus sequence of each of these subpopulations was then determined, with these representing our proxies of the founder strain(s). We note that although sufficient for our analysis, this is not a good method to determine the actual number of founder strains in our data, with some consensus sequences from the same individual differing by only a single base in our analysis. For gp41, six individuals had more than one consensus sequence, and for p24, eight individuals had more than one consensus sequence.
