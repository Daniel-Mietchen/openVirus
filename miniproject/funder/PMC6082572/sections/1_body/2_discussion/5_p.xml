<p>A unique feature of our analysis is the number of individuals included. This makes our overall analysis more robust than those based on fewer individuals, and also highlights the heterogeneity in patterns observed among individuals as well as between the two gene regions we looked at. There is ongoing interest in trying to estimate the number of variants initiating HIV infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our analysis highlights that focusing on a single gene region can potentially be misleading. For example, diversity measurements for individual i24 indicate infection by a single variant when looking at the p24 gene region, but multiple variants when looking at the gp41 region. The most likely scenario is that the donor individual (or i24 before the first sampling timepoint) was superinfected by a distinct variant from an unknown individual, followed by recombination in either the donor or i24, which led to the maintenance of two distinct lineages in gp41 but not p24. Similarly, there is interest in estimating time since infection from measures of within-host viral diversity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, diversity is not always a good measure, as it can be elevated for substantial periods of time due to the persistence of multiple founder lineages, as seen in individual i24, and can drop dramatically as a consequence of within-host population dynamics, as likely seen in individuals i24 and i17, although amplification biases cannot be ruled out.
