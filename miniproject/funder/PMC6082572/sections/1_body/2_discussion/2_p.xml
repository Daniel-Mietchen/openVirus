<p>It is notable that the virus evolves approximately three to nine times faster at the within-host than at the population scale. This pattern was observed for all three subtypes in both gene regions and for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions. These estimates are consistent with previous estimates for nine subtype B infected individuals for the gp120 region of

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], these findings build a consistent picture of different rates of evolution for HIV-1 within- and between-hosts, for all of the subtypes that have been analyzed, and across the whole genome. Intriguingly, similar mismatches in evolutionary rates are observed for HIV-2, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C viruses [
