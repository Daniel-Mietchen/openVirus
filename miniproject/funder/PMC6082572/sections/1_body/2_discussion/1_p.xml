<p>Using cryopreserved samples from individuals longitudinally sampled before the availability of universal treatment in the Rakai District of Uganda, we have substantially increased the number of individuals for which deep-sequenced data is available for HIV-1 during the course of untreated infection. The main subtypes represented in this HIV-1 cohort are A and D, rather than subtype B, which predominates in the more frequently studied European and North American cohorts. As well as analyzing this within-host sequence data, we also utilized publicly available population consensus sequences from Uganda, enabling us to directly compare rates of viral evolution at both the within-individual and population scales in the same population and for the same regions of the genome.</p>
