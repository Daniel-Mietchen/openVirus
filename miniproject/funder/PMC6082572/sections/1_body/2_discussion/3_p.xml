<p>We tested specific predictions of two of the mechanisms that have been implicated as contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates in HIV-1: adapt and revert and store and retrieve, with the aim of quantifying their relative roles. For nonsynonymous changes, our results are consistent with both adapt and revert, and store and retrieve, contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates. For synonymous changes, on other hand, our results are consistent with store and retrieve contributing to the mismatch in evolutionary rates, but with adapt and revert contributing little (p24) if at all (gp41). We conclude that both mechanisms are likely to have important roles, but that these differ for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, and, given the differences seen between p24 and gp41 (Figs
