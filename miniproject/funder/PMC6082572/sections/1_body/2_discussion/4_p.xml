<p>Here, we have focused on the mismatch in evolutionary rates when within individual and population level rates are compared, with both rates measured across short timescales of years to a few decades. It is now well recognized that rates of viral evolution at the population level also decline as the timescales over which they are measured increase from decades to millennia [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This is often attributed to a combination of purifying selection, with the appearance and persistence of slightly deleterious mutations (independent of host genotype) over short time scales, but their eventual purging over longer time scales; and saturation effects, which are expected to be pronounced in RNA viruses due to their short genomes and high mutation rates [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we also detected patterns of evolution within individuals that are consistent with purifying selection, specifically the purging of transmitted slightly deleterious mutations, which may contribute to the slowing of measured evolutionary rates at the population level as progressively longer timescales are considered. It is also possible that adapt and revert, and store and retrieve, might provide additional mechanisms leading to this slowing of measured evolutionary rates [
