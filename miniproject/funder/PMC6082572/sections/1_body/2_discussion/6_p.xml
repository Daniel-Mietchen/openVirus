<p>The continual adaptation of HIV-1 to different host environments and selection at the point of transmission are both likely to contribute to the complex patterns of HIV-1 evolution observed at the within-individual and population levels. Moreover, different selection pressures acting across the genome coupled with high rates of recombination further complicate the picture [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, recombination is likely to elevate within-host evolutionary rates as a result of generating more diverse viral lineages. Disentangling the evolutionary pressures faced by chronic viruses will not only help us to understand how selection acts across multiple ecological scales [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but will also have direct clinical importance by shaping our understanding of pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], how drug- and immune-escape variants are likely to spread through populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and in the development of preventive vaccines [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Deeply sequenced, whole-genome reads that avoid PCR generated recombination and amplification errors will be needed to fully delineate the relative roles of all of these pressures across the genome.
