<p>Three alternative hypotheses for the mismatch in HIV-1 evolutionary rates have been proposed [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: The first, called ‘stage-specific selection’, suggests that transmission tends to occur early in infection, when within-host evolution is also suggested to be slow, resulting in slower than expected evolution at the population level [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Stage-specific selection is supported by the observation that the rate of evolution at the population level was found to be slower in populations where transmission probably occurs earlier during infection, such as among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although still subject to debate, stage-specific selection is unlikely since cellular and antibody driven escape mutations have been shown to develop rapidly during early infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and because stage-specific selection is expected to lead to a greater mismatch for nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions; a pattern that we do not see [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, a more recent study found a faster rate of evolution in MSM than in heterosexual transmission chains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], suggesting other factors likely explain differing rates of evolution among different groups.
