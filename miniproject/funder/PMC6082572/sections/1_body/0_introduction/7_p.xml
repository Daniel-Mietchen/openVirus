<p>Adapt and revert and store and retrieve have largely been presented as either/or scenarios, but these processes need not be mutually exclusive [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, recombination and differing selection pressures in different genomic regions, means their contributions might not be homogeneous across the genome [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Using longitudinal deep-sequenced data from 34 HIV-1 seroconverters from the Rakai District in Uganda, we tested specific predictions of the adapt and revert and store and retrieve hypotheses, in an effort to quantify their relative contributions. First, we tested whether synonymous and/or nonsynonymous mutations show a strong bias in substitutions towards the population consensus, as predicted by ‘adapt and revert’ [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Second, we tested whether a sufficient number of founder-like viruses persist as infection progresses for their preferential transmission to explain the mismatch in phylogenetic rates for synonymous and/or nonsynonymous mutations, as required for store and retrieve [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Rather than being a case of either/or, our data suggest that both processes are likely to be important in explaining the mismatch in evolutionary rates. Moreover, our analysis supports previous work that purifying selection can explain why rates of viral evolution decline as the timescales over which they are measured increase from decades to millennia [
