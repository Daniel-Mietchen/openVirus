<p>The second hypothesis, called ‘adapt and revert’, suggests that within-host evolution is dominated by the ‘reversion’ of mutations that were advantageous in the source host but detrimental in the recipient host [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that within-host evolution is biased towards the accumulation of mutations towards the consensus at the population level [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The use of the term of reversion here is contentious because it implies adaptive evolution is going backwards, undoing what was selected for in a previous individual. However, at an individual level, adaptive evolution always goes forwards, thereby selecting for fitter genotypes. It is only when we step back to consider forward within-host evolution in the context of the viruses circulating at the population level that reversion is observed.
