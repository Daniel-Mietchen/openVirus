<p>To understand the natural history of within-host HIV-1 infection, historical samples from untreated individuals are needed. The few datasets that exist, where multiple (&gt;2) within-host sequenced samples are available, including from early infection, and spanning years rather than months, include nine subtype B individuals from North America [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], ten individuals from Europe, where eight were infected with subtype B, and two were infected with subtypes C and AE, respectively [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and four female individuals from North America infected with subtype B [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Here, we add considerably to this small but important body of data by presenting longitudinal deep-sequencing data from 34 untreated individuals living in Rakai, Uganda, representing infection with pure subtypes A and D, and a variety of inter-subtype recombinants, thus expanding both the geographical regions and the viral subtypes for which data are available. As well as undertaking an evolutionary analysis of the within-host sequence data, we also determined the rate of evolution of subtypes A, C, and D at the population scale within Uganda, during approximately the same time period. Interestingly, we found that the nonsynonymous substitution rate in the gp41 region of
