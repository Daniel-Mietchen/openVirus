<p>An indication that evolution at the population scale does not merely represent a continuation of directional within-host evolution, with repeated bottlenecks at the point of transmission, is the observation that HIV-1 evolves about two to six times faster within hosts than at the population scale [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] for both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although here we examined different subtypes and gene regions to previous studies, our analysis confirms a similar mismatch in evolutionary rates.
