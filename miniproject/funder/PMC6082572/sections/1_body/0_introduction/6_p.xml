<p>The final hypothesis suggests that during the course of infection viral lineages that resemble the virus that initiated the infection are maintained, and that these ‘founder-like’ viruses are preferentially transmitted. In this scenario, the cycling of viral lineages through the HIV-1 reservoir maintains these founder-like viruses within the population [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007167.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and therefore this process is referred to as ‘store and retrieve’. This hypothesis is supported by the analysis of HIV transmission chains, in which slower evolving lineages are transmitted [
