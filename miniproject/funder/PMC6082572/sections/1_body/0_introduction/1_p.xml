<p>Infection by HIV-1 is lifelong, and characterized by ongoing viral replication, and consequently the virus can undergo hundreds of rounds of replication between transmission events. This, combined with error-prone viral replication during reverse transcription, means that the viruses an individual transmits to a recipient are unlikely to be identical to those that initially infected them. A firm understanding of how evolution proceeds during the course of infection within an individual, and how this corresponds to evolution of the virus at the population scale, is therefore required to understand how selection acts at the point of transmission. This is important for vaccine design, and understanding how the virus evolves at the epidemiological scale.</p>
