 <p>The speed at which HIV-1 evolves within individuals and across epidemics is substantially different. Identifying the mechanisms shaping this phenomenon has important implications for understanding disease severity and transmission of HIV-1, especially when considering the spread of viruses that are resistant to drugs or natural host defenses in the population. In this study, we analyze newly generated HIV-1 sequences sampled from 34 individuals living in Uganda over multiple years, together with publicly available HIV-1 sequences from Uganda at the population scale. Our findings indicate that HIV-1 evolves around five times faster within individuals compared to the population scale. We demonstrate that there are likely two key processes driving the difference in HIV-1 evolutionary rate at the within individual and population scales. Specifically, we find support for 1) selection against variants in the within-host viral population, which were acquired in the donor because they were beneficial in that individual, and 2) preferential transmission of variants that are similar to those that initiated the infection.</p>
