  <title>Contribution to the mismatch in evolutionary rates if founder-like virus has a transmission advantage.</title>
  <p>Each point represents the mean contribution of the 34 individuals to the mismatch in phylogenetic rates if transmission occurs during the given time period, and where each viral sequence has a transmission fitness

   </sup>. The contribution to the mismatch for each sampling time point for each individual was calculated as the ratio of the mean number of mutations from the founder population, 
   <italic>μ</italic>, to the expected mean distance of transmitted virus from the founder population, 
   <italic>μT</italic>, giving 
   <italic>m</italic> = 
   <italic>μ</italic>/
   <italic>μT</italic>. A mismatch of 1 therefore indicates the case where the within- and between-host rates of evolution are expected to be the same. We show results for a moderate (
   <italic>α</italic> = 1), large (
   <italic>α</italic> = 2), and very large (
   <italic>α</italic> = 3) transmission advantage. The error bars give the 5 and 95 percentiles from bootstrapping over the individuals 100,000 times. Black, all mutations; Blue, only synonymous mutations are considered when calculating the expected mismatch; Red, only nonsynonymous mutations are considered when calculating the expected mismatch (see
