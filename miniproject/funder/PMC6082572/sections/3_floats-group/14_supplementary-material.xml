  <title>Changes towards population consensus.</title>
  <p>For each gene region, the figures give: the proportion of polymorphic sites where a mutant allele represents a change towards the subtype-specific population consensus; the bias towards subtype-specific population consensus for polymorphic sites, with assumed mutational transition:transversion (ts:tv) ratios of 0.5, 2 and 4; the proportion of polymorphic sites that are non-consensus at the first time point, which change towards subtype-specific consensus; and the bias towards subtype-specific population consensus for all sites, with assumed mutational transition:transversion ratios of 0.5, 2 and 4. In all cases, the error bars give the 5 and 95 percentiles from 10,000 bootstraps of the individual data. Black, all changes; Blue, synonymous changes; Red, nonsynonymous changes.</p>
