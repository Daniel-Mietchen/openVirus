  <title>Diversity and divergence over time for 34 individuals for both p24 and gp41.</title>
  <p>Top Row: Mean pairwise diversity at first, second, and third codon positions over time for individuals (represented in yellow, pink, and light blue, respectively). The average change in mean pairwise diversity over time was inferred by linear regression. Bottom Row: Mean nonsynonymous (purple) and synonymous divergence (blue) over time for individuals.</p>
