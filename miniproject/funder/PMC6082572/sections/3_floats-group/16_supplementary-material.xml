  <title>Contribution to the mismatch in evolutionary rates if founder-like virus has a transmission advantage, with individuals probably infected by multiple variants removed.</title>
  <p>This is identical to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g004">Fig 4</xref>, but with individuals i1, i2, i4, i9, i12, i14, i20, i25 and i34 removed since they show high diversity in the p24 gene region at the first sampling time point, indicative of infection by multiple variants from the same donor individual. In addition, i24 was also removed, due to very high diversity in gp41. The error bars give the 5th and 95th percentiles from bootstrapping over the individuals 100,000 times. Black, all mutations; Blue, only synonymous mutations are considered when calculating the expected mismatch; Red, only nonsynonymous mutations are considered when calculating the expected mismatch (see
