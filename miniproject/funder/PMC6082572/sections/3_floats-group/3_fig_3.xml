  <title>Changes towards population consensus.</title>
  <p>Top Row: The proportion of polymorphic sites where a mutant allele represents a change towards the (subtype-specific) population consensus. Bottom Row: The bias in changes towards population consensus. This is the ratio of the proportion of changes that are towards (subtype-specific) population consensus, compared to the expected proportion in the absence of selection, measured at polymorphic sites and with an assumed mutational transition to transversion ratio of two. A bias of 1 means the proportion of changes that are towards population consensus matches the expectation. The error bars give the 5 and 95 percentiles from 10,000 bootstraps of the individual data. Black, all changes; Blue, synonymous changes; Red, nonsynonymous changes.</p>
