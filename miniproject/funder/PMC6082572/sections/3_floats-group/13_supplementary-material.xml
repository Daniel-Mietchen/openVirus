  <title>Scatter plot of mean within-host evolutionary rates and set-point viral load.</title>
  <p>For both gene regions, we estimated the mean within-host evolutionary rates for external, internal, and backbone branches at both nonsynonymous (filled circles) and synonymous (open circles) sites. The points are coloured according to subtype as per 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The solid and dashed lines indicates the best linear fit for nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates, respectively, and set-point viral load. Using a Pearson correlation test, we found no significant relationship between evolutionary rate and set-point viral load in this cohort.
