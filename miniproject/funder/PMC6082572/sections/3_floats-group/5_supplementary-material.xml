  <title>Diversity and divergence over time, with individuals infected by multiple variants removed.</title>
  <p>This is identical to 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007167.g001">Fig 1</xref>, but with individuals i1, i2, i4, i9, i12, i14, i20, i25 and i34 removed since they show high diversity in the p24 gene region at the first sampling time point, indicative of infection by multiple variants from the same donor individual. Top Row: Mean pairwise diversity at first, second, and third codon positions over time for individuals (represented in yellow, pink, and light blue, respectively). The average change in mean pairwise diversity over time was inferred by linear regression. Bottom Row: Mean nonsynonymous (purple) and synonymous divergence (blue) over time for individuals.
