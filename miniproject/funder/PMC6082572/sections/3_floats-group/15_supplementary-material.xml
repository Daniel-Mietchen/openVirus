  <title>Changes towards population consensus, with individuals probably infected by multiple variants removed.</title>
  <p>This is identical to 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007167.s010">S10 Fig</xref>, but with individuals i1, i2, i4, i9, i12, i14, i20, i25 and i34 removed since they show high diversity in the p24 gene region at the first sampling time point, indicative of infection by multiple variants from the same donor individual. In addition, i24 was also removed, due to very high diversity in gp41. In all cases, the error bars give the 5 and 95 percentiles from 10,000 bootstraps of the individual data. Black, all changes; Blue, synonymous changes; Red, nonsynonymous changes.
