<p>In summary, this work suggests that CHIKV outbreaks are affected by high maximum temperatures and smaller urban areas, which leads to higher estimates of

 <sub>0</sub>. These higher 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values are then associated with explosive outbreaks with shorter times-to-peak and higher case counts at time of peak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007878.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This explosive nature of the initial outbreak leads to a lower overall case count compared to those outbreaks that had longer times-to-peak, lower peak-case counts, but cumulatively larger total number of cases. The tortoise-or-the-hare (TotH) model was proposed to also explain differences in infectious dynamics of arboviruses whereby arboviruses that adopt the tortoise strategy (long-lasting, moderate viremia) will persist longer than arboviruses that adopt the hare strategy (short-lived, high viremia) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We show here that this TotH model, previously used to describe micro-dynamics, may also be suited to describe macro-level dynamics of arboviruses. In theory, the tortoise model would seem to be most advantageous for the virus, as it ultimately achieves the longest and most productive transmission. However, in the context of active surveillance and response where vector control may be activated and result in abrupt cessation or decrease in transmission, the hare model may ultimately represent the most fit population-level phenotype [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. That is, in areas where control is implemented–such as in Brazil during the Zika epidemic, or Miami during local transmission there–a faster “out-of-the-gate” phenotype (the hare) may result in more transmission, which could be interpreted as the most fit phenotype in this scenario [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The TotH model of how to think about transmission represents an interesting relationship between perceived transmission intensity and the ultimate magnitude of transmission (i.e. number of cases). Thus, these findings could impact response prioritization, especially in areas where resources are limited. That is, more intense transmission may appear to be the most pressing concern, when in reality the less intense situations may need more intervention… And given the association of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> with eco-environmental variables, the TotH relationship may further have use in predicting allocation of resources at a focal level.” Our findings suggest that the non-monotonic relationship between arbovirus transmission and temperature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] can be at least in part detected with administrative level case counts and the relationships to the lower bounds of

 <sub>0</sub>. And given the association of

 <sub>0</sub> with eco-environmental variables, the TotH relationship may further have use in predicting allocation of resources at a focal level.
