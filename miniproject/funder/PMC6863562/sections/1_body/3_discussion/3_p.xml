<p>The finding that higher 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is associated with smaller urban areas is interesting, especially given that there was a lack of consistently significant relationship between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the total population of the urban area, the total municipality population, and the density of population indicated. Previous work had revealed that transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is positively associated with intermediate levels of human movement [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results indicate that higher 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values are associated with smaller urban areas, which could be indicative of limited movement of humans in that area. The result is highly focal transmission, which has been reported for CHIKV [
