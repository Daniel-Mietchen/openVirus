<p>We investigated several variables that have been associated with arbovirus transmission (and thus

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Though we consider a spectrum of environmental, ecological, and social variables, it is important to note that many other variables likely affect transmission and reporting of cases at different spatial resolutions. Variables such as housing type/quality, income levels, water availability, or access to health services likely all play a role in risk of exposure to arboviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, mosquito density and other socio-ecological variables vary across and within municipalities and are not readily available at the country-level and thus the inclusion of these specific types of variables is of limited value to our model, but urban area size and density of population, included in our study, have been used as proxies for some of these other factors, such as mosquito population [
