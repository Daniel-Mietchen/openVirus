<p>Temperature data of each city were extracted from Worldclim climatic layers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We used data of minimum temperature, maximum temperature and average temperature by using the coordinates taken from the center of the urban area of each municipality that were obtained from the software Google Earth Pro version 7.3.2.5491 (Google LLC, Mountain view, California, USA). The difference of temperature (maximum temperature minus minimum temperature) was estimated from that data.
