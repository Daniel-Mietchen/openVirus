<p>All analyses were performed in 
 <italic>R</italic> version 3.5.1. After 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was estimated as above, we correlated the values of environmental and demographic variables with the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimate using Spearman’s correlation across all municipalities. Correlations with 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 were considered significant. Following this, we wanted to determine if there was a differential pattern of corollaries dependent on the intensity of transmission. As 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is a threshold parameter (lower bound of 1 to indicate outbreak likelihood), we did this by altering the (lower) threshold to indicate differential intensity of transmission. Thus, we conducted the same Spearman’s correlation analysis for the following subsets of municipalities: 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 2, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 2.5, and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 3. These were chosen based on the distribution of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Results</xref> below).
