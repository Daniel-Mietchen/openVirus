<p>Epidemiological data was obtained from Colombian INS which publishes through its web page (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ins.gov.co" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ins.gov.co</ext-link>) the reported cases collected by the national system of epidemiological surveillance (
 <italic>SIVIGILA</italic>). Data for CHIKV cases was taken for the years 2014 to 2016. Data collected through SIVIGILA is reported on a weekly basis, i.e. weekly number of chikungunya cases per city reporting. Population projections developed by the Colombian National administrative department of Statistics (
 <italic>DANE</italic> according to its name in Spanish) were used to estimate population size per city and subsequently incidence. Incidence was estimated per 100,000 individuals per each city. Urban area size (termed “urbanicity”) and map resources were obtained from the National Geostatistical Framework (
 <italic>MGN</italic>, according to its name in Spanish) of DANE.
