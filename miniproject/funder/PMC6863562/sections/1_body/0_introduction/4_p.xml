 <sub>0</sub> describes the epidemic potential of a pathogen, it can also be used to investigate modulation of this potential by external factors. For example, temperature is a known effector of mosquito-borne diseases, particularly as it relates to the vector-virus interaction [

Further, given the differences in transmission dynamics across the municipalities, we investigated the discrepancy between the magnitude of
