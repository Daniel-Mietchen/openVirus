<p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test showed that there were differences in several variables when compared to groups of “low” versus “high” based on the lower bound of the

 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We found consistent differences in the distribution of number of cases when all municipalities were considered (lower threshold

 <sub>0</sub> = 1) versus the modified lower thresholds of 2 or 2.5. Mean, minimum, and difference in temperature was not consistently different across all comparisons. Mean and minimum temperature were only significant between the comparison of
