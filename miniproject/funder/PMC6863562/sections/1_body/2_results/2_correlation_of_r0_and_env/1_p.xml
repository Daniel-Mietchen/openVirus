 <xref rid="pntd.0007878.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> outlines the results of the correlation analysis of 13 variables. When all municipalities were considered, the number of cases, mean, max, and min temperature, as well as the duration of the epidemic and size of urban area were all significantly correlated to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Similar to what is seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007878.g002">Fig 2</xref>, there was a surprising negative correlation between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the duration and number of cases. Temperature was positively associated with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values.
