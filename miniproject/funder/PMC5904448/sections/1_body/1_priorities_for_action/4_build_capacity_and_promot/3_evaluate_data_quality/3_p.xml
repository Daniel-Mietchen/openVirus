<p>To ensure data outputs are interpreted correctly, assessments of data sources are required to indicate quality and value. For example, to compare results across populations and time for each stage of the care cascade, a traffic light system could be used to indicate confidence levels in data sources of high, medium, and low. To generate high quality data, and promote accurate interpretation, conducting quality assessments and analyses to investigate and correct some of the biases of routine data is also needed. Bias may arise, from missing data, non-representativeness, double counting (aggregate data particularly suffer from this), or loss to follow-up. Through identifying bias, methods such as adjustment factors, to support the interpretation of routine data outputs, can be designed.</p>
