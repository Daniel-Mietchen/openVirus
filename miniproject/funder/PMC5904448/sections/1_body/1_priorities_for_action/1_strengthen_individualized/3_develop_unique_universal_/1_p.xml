<p>To facilitate system linkage, better methods are required for the development and integration of unique, universal, health identifiers that work across multiple health services and systems, such as linkage to vital registration, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis control programs, and maternal, new-born, and child health systems [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lessons learned from countries with substantial experience with unique identifiers should be considered to inform adoption or expansion in other countries.
