<p>Testing data are critical for monitoring early (CD4 cell count greater than 350 cells/µL) and, conversely, late diagnosis (less than 350 cells/µL). As low CD4 cell counts can be triggers for more intensive follow-up [

Testing data are also critical for monitoring the pathway from diagnosis to care, an important and often ignored step in the care cascade. In addition, to objectively monitor performance across the 90-90-90 targets, a first stage denominator of overall HIV prevalence is required. To monitor the first and second 90s we require an estimate of persons living with HIV who have been diagnosed for the numerator and denominator, respectively. If systems are strengthened, routine testing data should in the future directly provide estimates of diagnosed HIV, and indirectly through modeling, of undiagnosed HIV in sub-Saharan African settings.
