<p>Recent infection testing algorithms (RITA) can distinguish recently acquired infection from long-standing infection [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recency testing offers the potential to inform action for individual patients, their networks and programs and, if incorporated into routine testing and programmatic surveys, to strengthen estimates of incidence. Examples might include identifying clusters of infection among key populations in outreach testing platforms, or complimenting data on HIV prevalence in routine testing of pregnant women with information on recency. Attention to test accuracy, data quality, ethics, sample size, and analysis and interpretation will be necessary. Nevertheless, the wider adoption of these technologies within routine data systems, especially if the price can be reduced, has the potential to bring new strategic information.
