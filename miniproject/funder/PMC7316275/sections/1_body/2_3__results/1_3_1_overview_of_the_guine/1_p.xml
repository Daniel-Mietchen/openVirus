Health centers, where most of the population accesses health care, provide basic medical care and treatment at the sub-prefecture level, including midwifery services, vaccinations, and essential medicines. In each prefecture, the prefectural health department oversees prefecture-level health policy implementation and provides support to the community level through the prefectural hospitals, prefectural offices for disease control and prevention, and administrative services. The regional health department oversees regional-level health policy implementation and provides support to the prefectural level through regional hospitals and administrative services. Nationally, the Ministry of Health is responsible for national health policy development, national health statistics, and oversight of health programs and health care delivery services; and provides support to the regional level through the Division for the Prevention and Control of Disease.
