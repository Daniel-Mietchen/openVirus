<p>Our evaluation findings are consistent with similar case-based disease surveillance system evaluations in Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0234796.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, the authors of an evaluation of Guinea-Bissau’s cholera surveillance system noted that continued training on surveillance, data analysis, and outbreak response was needed to improve the sensitivity of the system. When evaluating the IDSR for infectious disease control in northern Ghana, researchers identified through key informant interviews that a lack of central-level feedback (e.g., more real-time feedback on data discrepancies) from district health administration to peripheral health workers presented challenges to consistency of reporting and overall surveillance system functioning, a finding consistent with our data from this evaluation [

An evaluation of measles surveillance in Nigeria also noted that, as with Guinea, the surveillance system faced a level of instability based on its reliance on donors for both funding and technical support. The study authors went on to propose that the country move to take complete ownership of the case-based surveillance system to ensure the system’s sustainability through provision of needed funding and logistical support [
