<p>This assessment had several limitations. The results and conclusions presented are based primarily on the verbal information provided by interviewees and supplemented with our assessments of the case log books. Although the field team made every effort to confirm interviewee statements, limited documentation was available to further validate interview results. Without reported cases, immediate reporting at each level of the system could not be assessed. We used U.S. CDC guidelines for surveillance system evaluations, with a focus on the surveillance systemâ€™s operations, resources, and attributes (i.e., simplicity, data quality) [

However, there are additional elements of a surveillance system evaluation that could be considered for future work, including assessment of other system attributes (e.g., sensitivity, positive predictive value, representativeness). Finally, our results of this assessment in Boffa are not necessarily generalizable to other prefectures in Guinea.
