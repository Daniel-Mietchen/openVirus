  <title>Travel datasets.</title>
  <p>Datasets used to capture short-range and long-range mobilities in the United States are depicted as networks on top (commuter data on the left, airline data on the right). Commuter data is shown between counties, whereas airline network is shown for key domestic airports in the United States for a chosen month (January). The distribution of flow volume with respect to pairwise county distances in shown as heatmaps for both the commuter and airline data. Airline flows are fractional because they are mapped to the counties that are served by them.</p>
