  <title>Population normalized total allocation of vaccines per state under the optimized schedule.</title>
  <p>A value of 1.0 indicates that the state received exactly the same amount of vaccines it would have received under the pro-rata schedule. Values greater (less) than 1.0 correspond to more (fewer) vaccines allocated under the optimized schedule than the pro-rata schedule.</p>
