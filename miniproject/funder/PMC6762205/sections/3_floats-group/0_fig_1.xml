  <p>Datasets used in the study are listed on top, and the four main modules of our framework are highlighted in the system diagram. The Travel Module uses long distance airline travel data and short-range commuter flow data to construct the county to county temporal travel matrix. This is used by the Disease Dynamics Module for simulating national scale epidemic spread via the metapopulation model. Additional inputs to this module include the seeding and vaccination schedule, disease model parameters, and vaccine efficacy. While some of these are fixed based on the study design, the Calibration Module uses historical incidence data to estimate the remaining disease model parameters. The calibrated disease model is then used as an oracle to compute the optimized vaccine allocation in the Optimization Module.</p>
