<p>We develop a heuristic for finding a spatio-temporal vaccine allocation using a greedy strategy G
 <sc>reedy</sc>A
 <sc>lloc</sc> with a lookahead parameter, under a fixed vaccine availability schedule. We evaluate the algorithmâ€™s performance by comparing it against a population proportional allocation strategy (baseline). Some of our key findings are: (a) For the scenario under consideration, G
 <sc>reedy</sc>A
 <sc>lloc</sc> leads to considerable reduction in the total attack size compared to the baseline; (b) the performance of G
 <sc>reedy</sc>A
 <sc>lloc</sc> improves with vaccine efficacy, and for influenza seasons with moderate intensity; (c) the identified vaccine allocation strategy resembles a ring-vaccination, applied spatially for the state-level adjacency matrix of the US.
