<p>The overall framework that implements the steps above is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The modular approach allows the refinement of each module, when novel datasets, algorithms, and modeling techniques become available. In the Materials and Methods section, we briefly describe the key ideas involved in construction of the national influenza model, the calibration procedure and the vaccine allocation algorithm. We refer the reader to the

We then present the results of calibration and vaccine allocation using 2014-15 season data as a running example. A preliminary version of the model and early results for V
