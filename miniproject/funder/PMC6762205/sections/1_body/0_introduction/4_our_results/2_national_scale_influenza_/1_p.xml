<p>We develop a national-scale metapopulation model for the spread of influenza by integrating both local and long-distance travel within the United States. We combine data on commuter mobility from the American Community Survey (ACS) with domestic airline passenger data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to capture human mobility across the country. Next, we adopt a metapopulation approach to simulate epidemic spread at the spatial resolution of counties (patches) wherein the temporal travel matrix is used to represent the flow of people between these patches. While similar models exist in the literature [
