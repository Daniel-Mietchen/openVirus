<p>Challenges in calibrating such a complex model include: (a) model non-linearity, (b) large number of parameters, (c) multiple spatio-temporal characteristics to calibrate to (regional attack size, peak timing, etc.), (d) lack of standardized and accurate infection counts. We use two-stage posterior exploration via importance sampling to calibrate the disease model to the total attack size (number of infections) and peak timings of the ten HHS (Health and Human Services) Regions. While peak timings for HHS regions can be obtained from the CDC ILINet (Influenza-like Illness Outpatient Surveillance Network) data, we use a novel approach to estimate total attack size for each region, and demonstrate the calibration performance for 2014-15 influenza season.</p>
