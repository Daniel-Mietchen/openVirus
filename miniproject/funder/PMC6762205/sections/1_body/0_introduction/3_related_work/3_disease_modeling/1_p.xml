<p>There are a number of variants of the SEIR type of models for disease spread, and their applicability depends on the specific assumptions that hold. The most commonly used models are compartmental in nature, assuming well-mixed populations within each compartment. A number of variants have been proposed, including stochastic models, multiple compartments to represent various subpopulations, branching processes, chain-binomial models, etc. Colizza et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] use a patch model of the form we study in this paper. They study the role of long distance travel in the spread of epidemics, and use it to explain the SARS outbreak and to forecast other outbreaks. A different approach that is more suitable for heterogeneous populations is based on a network abstraction [
