<p>Most compartmental models that have been used for studying optimal interventions are relatively simple, and can be solved using simple black-box optimization methods. An example is the work of Medlock et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], who consider the problem of designing an optimal vaccine allocation for the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. They use an age-based coupled ODE model, and observe that the optimal solution is different from the CDC recommendation at that time. Similar studies have been done for other outbreaks, e.g., [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], who observe that prioritization of high-risk individuals leads to more effective strategies. However, most studies for designing vaccination policies do not take into account the spatiotemporal spread dynamics of seasonal influenza, nor the temporal constraints in vaccine production schedule. Thus there is need for coupling a mechanistic model of national-scale influenza spread with realistic vaccine uptake information for deriving an effective vaccine allocation algorithm.
