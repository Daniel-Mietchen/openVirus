<p>There is very limited data on social contact networks and human mobility, and so there has been a lot of work on developing realistic models using different kinds of datasets. Eubank et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] developed a first principles based approach for constructing a realistic synthetic population by integrating over a dozen public and commercial datasets. Coarser models for some countries have been constructed using census and Landscan data, e.g., [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, none of these approaches considers long-distance travel outside an urban region. One of the earliest approaches for considering such travel was by Colizza et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], who use information from airline data to construct a network-based representation of cities across the globe. However, airline flow does not account for all of spatial mobility, especially within the US. In [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the authors construct a radiation model to predict commuter flows in the United States using data on road networks. Especially in the context of national scale disease spread, it is essential to have a model that combines both short-range and long-range human mobility in the United States.
