<p>Our current model can be extended in several ways. Firstly, the model calibration process can be refined to match more detailed trajectories of influenza spread, like the ILI % time series, or the in-season burden estimates being produced by CDC starting 2018-19 season [

Such approaches can then be used to do real-time forecasting and provide vaccine allocation recommendations for an ongoing influenza season. Further, instead of selecting the MAP model for vaccination study, one could use an ensemble of calibrated models based on the posterior distribution, thus being able to quantify uncertainty in the vaccine allocation policyâ€™s effectiveness. Another aspect of the real-world dynamics currently not being captured in our model is that of residual immunity. The national influenza model can be improved by taking into account the co-circulating and dominant influenza strains, as well as the strains present in the recommended vaccine for the season. Note that while improving over pro-rata allocation, greedy algorithm, even with the lookahead duration, may lead to sub-optimal policies. One can develop algorithms that earmark resources for regions with high spreading capacity, thus potentially improving the effectiveness of vaccine allocation.
