<p>Current policies for vaccine interventions are designed based on a host of social and political issues, and tend to be fairly simplistic. For instance, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) directives for targeting pandemic vaccines are based on age group [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For instance, Medlock et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] developed an optimal vaccination strategy for the H1N1 outbreak; their model showed a prioritization for a different age group than the ones recommended by CDC directives. All prior methods are restricted to simple models, and only focus on non-temporal interventions in which the allocation is done ahead of time. In reality, vaccine supply varies over time, and the real problem involves finding an allocation that respects the supply constraints and optimizes the epidemic outcomes.
