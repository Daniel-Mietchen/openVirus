<p>In conclusion, we have presented a national level seasonal influenza model, based on short-range and long-range mobility datasets, and used it to optimize the spatio-temporal allocation of vaccines. For the scenario under consideration, we find that the national attack size can be reduced by up to 17% by allocating the early vaccines to regions around the origin of the epidemic. Most states still end up with close to their overall pro-rata quota of vaccines, however, these findings demonstrate that shifting when and where these vaccines are administered has a sizable impact on the national attack size. Achieving these optimal outcomes would require better surveillance and the ability to accelerate vaccine uptake at will, which presents multiple challenges. However, the study shows there is ample room for improvement and this framework provides means for developing a play-book for epidemic containment.</p>
