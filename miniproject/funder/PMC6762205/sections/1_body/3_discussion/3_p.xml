<p>Finally, the logistics of the supply of medical resources, such as medicines, medical equipment (e.g., ventilators), and medical staff is also very complex. The health infrastructure is generally optimized for typical demand for such resources, and any surge, as would happen during a pandemic outbreak, would place a severe strain on hospitals. Ajao et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] show that over 50,000 ventilators might be needed in the event of a national influenza pandemic outbreak. Since local and state health systems are usually unprepared for such a surge in demand, the Office of the Assistance Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) maintains a stockpile of mechanical ventilators in strategic locations [
