<p>Model calibration is the process of estimating parameters of the computational model that can reproduce observed characteristics in the ground truth. In the context of epidemiology, beyond forecasting, calibrated models allow us to perform counterfactual (i.e., what-if) studies, and address resource allocation questions like V
