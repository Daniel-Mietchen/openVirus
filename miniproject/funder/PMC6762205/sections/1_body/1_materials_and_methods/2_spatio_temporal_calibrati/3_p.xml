<p>Further, it is often useful to factorize the likelihood function, if possible, when the simulation model is required to be calibrated to several different criteria [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One possible way is to sequentially calibrate the model to different criteria. In addition to simplifying the computation of importance weights, the approach allows user to introduce more samples as needed using the intermediate calibrated parameter space. More details on the statistical framework and the two-stage posterior exploration is provided in
