<p>The commuter flow dataset is obtained through the American Community Survey (ACS) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that, among other things, surveys individuals for their county of residence and county of workplace. ACS then provides population adjusted estimates of number of commuters between any pair of counties for a typical day. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows relationship between number of commuters from a source county to a destination county, and the distance between these counties. Other than the high volume of self-loop flows, most of the flows are concentrated in the 10â€“100 miles range.
