<p>Consider a population of individuals each of whom can be in one of the following states: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Recovered/Removed (R), Vaccinated (V). Compartmental models operate under a homogeneous mixing assumption, i.e., every individual can directly infect any other individual. Initially, the entire population is susceptible, except for a few initial infections possibly due to external contact. The disease progression is modeled by the evolution of number of individuals in each of the disease states, often described by a difference or differential equation.</p>
