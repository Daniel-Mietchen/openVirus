<p>Within each patch, we use an SEIRV model, and connect the patches using the travel matrix Θ

 </sup>. When we extend the model for multiple patches, susceptible individuals can be infected by infectious individuals from other patches. This depends on the fraction of individuals moving from county 
 <italic>i</italic> to county 
 <italic>j</italic> on any given day, estimated using the temporal travel matrix Θ
