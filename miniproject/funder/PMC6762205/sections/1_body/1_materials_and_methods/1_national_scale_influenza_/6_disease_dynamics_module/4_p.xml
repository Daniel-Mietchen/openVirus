<p>Note that the model is described through a system of difference equations, with each time step representing a day. The model is deterministic, and represents the average system trajectory. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows an example of the model evolution when simulated with the temporal travel matrix and a hypothetical seeding event in Louisiana.
