 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the number of airline passengers between counties, for a sample month. Contrasting this with that commuter flows, we find the large volume flows are concentrated in the 100â€“1000 miles range. In order to integrate this dataset with the county-level commuter mobility, we first identify the catchment area of each airport (defined as 120 miles surrounding the airport), and apportion the airport flows to counties based on their population in area of intersetion with the catchment area. We also distribute the monthly number of passengers uniformly through the month to get a daily count. Unlike a daily commuter, an airline passenger tends to stay longer in the visiting county. Therefore the effective number of airline passengers in the visiting county is obtained by scaling the flow by stay duration (in our model, we set the average stay duration as 3 days).
