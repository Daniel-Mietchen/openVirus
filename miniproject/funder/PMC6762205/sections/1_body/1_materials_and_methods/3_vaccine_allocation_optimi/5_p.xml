<p>As a generalization, we have also included the lookahead duration 
 <italic>d</italic> (in weeks) as an additional parameter. This means that the potential allocations at a greedy stage of week 
 <italic>w</italic> are evaluated by their reduction of attack size at week min(
 <italic>w</italic> + 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>T</italic>) where 
 <italic>T</italic> is the total duration of the epidemic. While this includes the total attack size (full lookahead, when 
 <italic>d</italic> â‰¥ 
 <italic>T</italic>) as a special case, it also allows us to explore the resulting trade-off due to varying forecast horizons. The detailed algorithm is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007111.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. Additional methods.
