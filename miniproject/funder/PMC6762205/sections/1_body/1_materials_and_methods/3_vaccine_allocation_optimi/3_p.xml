<p>The V
 <sc>acc</sc>I
 <sc>nt</sc>D
 <sc>esign</sc> problem is very challenging, and its exact complexity remains open. A strategy that has been useful in many kinds of intervention design problems is to design a greedy allocation, which selects each decision variable based on the marginal improvement to the objective function. If the problem involves submodular maximization, such a strategy is guaranteed to give a constant factor approximation; see, e.g., [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, V
 <sc>acc</sc>I
 <sc>nt</sc>D
 <sc>esign</sc> involves a minimization, and the objective functions are neither submodular or supermodular, in general.
