<p>Nevertheless, the greedy strategy is a reasonable approach for designing vaccine allocation strategies, and we study it here with an allocation step size of 
 <italic>L</italic>. The algorithm begins with an initial zero allocation. For each week 
 <italic>w</italic>, the algorithm allocates the next set of 
 <italic>L</italic> vaccines to the state 
 <italic>s</italic> which leads to the maximum reduction in the objective value 
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>X</italic>). The algorithm is repeated for week 
 <italic>w</italic>, until we exhaust 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>w</italic>
 </sub>, and then proceed to the next weekâ€™s supply of vaccines. Note that the computation of marginal benefit of allocating 
 <italic>L</italic> additional vaccines to state 
 <italic>s</italic> subject to population constraints, can be computed in parallel.
