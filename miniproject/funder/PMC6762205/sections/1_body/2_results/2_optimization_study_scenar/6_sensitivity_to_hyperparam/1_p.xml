<p>We also tested the sensitivity of greedy algorithm performance to the hyperparameters of the algorithm, namely lookahead duration 
 <italic>d</italic> and the vaccine allocation stepsize 
 <italic>L</italic>. We tested the sensitivity on the best fit configuration for 2014, with total national attack size of 34 million. We observe from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g008">Fig 8</xref> that the solution quality is pretty stable across allocation step size 
 <italic>L</italic>, with marginal improvement for lower 
 <italic>L</italic> (although the runtime for 
 <italic>L</italic> = 100, 000 step size would be roughly 5 times as longer as that for 
 <italic>L</italic> = 500, 000).
