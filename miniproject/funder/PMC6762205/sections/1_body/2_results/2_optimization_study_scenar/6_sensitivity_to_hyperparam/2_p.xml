<p>We also found that a medium lookahead policy (10 weeks) performed better than a short-term or full lookahead policy. This implies that allowing the algorithm to target the reduction of attack size a couple of months into the future, leads to improved performance in the final attack size. Short lookahead duration (5 weeks) does not perform well, because the lookahead is almost comparable to the delay for the vaccine to take effect. For longer lookahead, the algorithm allocates vaccines to states farther from the current epidemic activity to have the most impact on the total attack size at the end of the simulation. This, however, may not limit the spatial spread of the disease per se, and hence may be sub-optimal. As we can see, the medium lookahead policy, through its ring-vaccination style approach, ensures that the disease is curbed near its origin, thus leading to greater overall reduction in the attack size.</p>
