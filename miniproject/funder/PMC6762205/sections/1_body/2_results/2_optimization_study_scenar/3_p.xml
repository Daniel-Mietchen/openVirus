<p>In our study (restricted to contiguous US, including DC), the number of states 
 <italic>S</italic> = 49. Also, we set the number of weeks 
 <italic>W</italic> = 40, roughly the period from September to May corresponding to the influenza season. Therefore, the allocation profile 
 <italic>X</italic> has 1960 spatio-temporal dimensions. The temporal constraint 
 <italic>B</italic> is based on historical vaccine uptake schedue available from CDC FluVaxView [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. CDC FluVaxView provides monthly coverage estimates nationally for the past influenza seasons. We scaled it by the national population to get a vaccine uptake schedule and converted it to the temporal constraint 
 <italic>B</italic>. Note that CDC also provides the vaccine supply and distribution schedule [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], however, we noticed a considerable delay between the supply and uptake schedules, so we chose to use the uptake schedule to reflect ground reality.
