 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g006">Fig 6</xref>. It is useful to remember that all simulations are initialized in Louisiana and Alabama. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g006">Fig 6</xref> shows the allocation by the 10 week lookahead policy with vaccine efficacy of 0.5. We observe that the optimized allocation begins allocating to Louisiana (state code LA), followed by its neighbors Alabama (AL), and Mississippi (MS). This is followed by larger states around Louisiana such as Texas, Georgia, and Florida. This is very different from a pro-rata allocation scheme (distributing the vaccines for each week proportional to state populations). This strategy also resembles a ring-vaccination (in social contact networks), applied spatially to regions around the origin of the epidemic. Further, even though we prioritize some of the states early in the season, the final vaccine allocation for each state is close to its pro-rata quota. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g007">Fig 7</xref>, most states receive their fair-share of vaccines.
