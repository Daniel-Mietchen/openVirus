 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007111.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the attack size under optimized allocation under a 10 week lookahead policy. In the least severe scenario (40 million cases), with the best vaccine efficacy (0.5), we are able to reduce the national attack size by up to 17%. On the other extreme, with 80 million cases and 0.2 vaccine efficacy, the allocation helps, but only minimally (2%). Another thing to note is that for a fixed attack size scenario, with increased vaccine efficacy, the benefit of optimized allocation increases. This makes sense, since this translates to more effective vaccines being moved around.
