<p>We do this to simulate multiple seasons that spread spatially like the 2014-15 season, but vary in their severity (captured by the national attack size 
 <italic>E</italic>) and the efficacy of seasonal vaccine (captured by 
 <italic>v</italic>). In our study setting, we construct 12 scenarios, where 
 <italic>v</italic> takes values in {0.2, 0.35, 0.5} and 
 <italic>E</italic> takes values in {40, 61, 73, 86} where the values are in millions of cases, corresponding to different severity levels based on past seasons of seasonal influenza. Thus for each target attack size 
 <italic>E</italic>, we have three scenarios, in which 
 <italic>E</italic> is achieved by assigning vaccines at 
 <italic>v</italic> efficacy.
