<p>We calibrate the national influenza model at the level of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. We use the timing of peak influenza activity across these regions to test the modelâ€™s ability to reproduce the spatiotemporal variation. To capture the spatial variation of impact, we use the total attack size in each HHS region. Both these calibration criteria are obtained from the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) data provided by the CDC [
