<p>We begin with an initial set of 
 <italic>m</italic> uniformly random parameter configurations according to (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007111.e009">1</xref>). Based on initial runs, we choose to work with 
 <italic>m</italic> = 1000. Full simulations are carried out at these 1000 configurations to obtain simulated regional attack sizes and peak timings. We then perform the two-stage calibration procedure described earlier, to obtain a MAP estimate of the best parameter configuration. For the gaussian likelihood (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007111.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. Additional methods on Calibration methodology), we defined independent errors with a standard deviation of 20% around the calibration criteria [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. While varying the standard deviation may affect the posterior distribution, it is to be noted that the MAP estimator remains unaffected.
