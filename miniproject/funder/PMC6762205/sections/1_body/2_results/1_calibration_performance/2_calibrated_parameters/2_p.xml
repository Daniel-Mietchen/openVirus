<p>For seeding the influenza model, we used data from CDC ILI Activity Level Indicator [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007111.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] for the 2014-15 season. We chose to seed in Louisiana and Alabama, the two earliest states to reach High activity level in the season. Within these states, we chose to seed in the most populous counties (Lafourche parish, LA and Jefferson county, AL) respectively. The seeding policy is consistent with the finding that most influenza seasons likely start from the Southern US [

 <italic>α</italic> = 0.67, 
 <italic>γ</italic> = 0.4 and correspond to mean incubation period of 1.5 days and mean infectious period of 2.5 days [
