  <title>Long range transmission events and potential origins of each epidemic.</title>
  <p>For each season, the purple circles indicate long-range transmission events (i.e. locations far from the set of infectious locations that obtain influenza regardless). Blue circles are locations infected within a two-week window from the 
   <italic>last</italic> long-range event. Red circles depict the potential outbreak origin in each epidemic. Grey circles are infected locations before the first long-range event occurred in each season. Panels on the right indicate when in the epidemic long-range events occurred. Note that the methods used to identify long-range transmission events and estimate the origin of each epidemic are agnostic of one another; in 2008/2009 an early “long-range transmission event” appears near the estimated origin of the epidemic.
