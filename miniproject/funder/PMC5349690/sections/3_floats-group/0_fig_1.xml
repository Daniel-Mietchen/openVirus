  <title>Standardized influenza-like-illness time series from four locations (Denver, CO; Roanoke, VA; Bryan, TX; Spencer, IA).</title>
  <p>Onset times for each season are depicted as red dashed lines. The 2003/2004 epidemic and 2009/2010 pandemic are highlighted in pink as these are major influenza seasons associated with antigenic novelty, where more than 99% of viruses in circulation were of the same subtype (A/H3N2 in 2003/2004 and A/H1N1 in 2009/2010). These major seasons had the most distinct influenza signals, while few locations experienced an increase in ILI during the mild 2008/2009 epidemic dominated by the A/H1N1 virus.</p>
