  <title>Pairwise synchrony as a function of pairwise distance in each influenza season (2002/2003â€“2009/2010).</title>
  <p>The y-axis in each panel is a normalized measure of pairwise synchrony in onset times between locations (values near -1 indicate that epidemics start close together in time, while values near +1 indicate a substantial lag in onset times). The x-axis is distance (kilometers). Each circle represents the mean pairwise synchrony for pairs of locations falling in 50-km distance bins. The black line segments are 95% confidence intervals for the mean in each bin. The red band is the expected pairwise synchrony under the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness obtained by permutation of the onset times.</p>
