  <p>Left panel. Work commutes scale with geographic distance according to a power law of 3.3 (95% CI: 2.66 to 3.95); this relationship is depicted in blue (See also supporting 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A6). Based on our distance-based transmission model, the force of infection between an infectious and susceptible city,

   </sub>, scales with geographic distance according to a median estimated power law of 2.2 (range: 2.08 to 2.65), depicted in red. This indicates that for a 10-fold decrease in distance between an infectious and susceptible pair of cities, the hazard of infection on the susceptible city increases by a factor of ~158 (range: 120–467). Right panel. The force of infection on a susceptible city,

   </sub>, scales with its population size according to a median estimated power law of 0.28 (range: 0.15 to 0.35). This indicates that for a 10-fold increase in population size, the hazard of infection on the susceptible city increases by a factor of 1.9 (range: 1.4–2.2).
