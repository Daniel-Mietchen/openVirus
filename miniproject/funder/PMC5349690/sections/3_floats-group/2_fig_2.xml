  <title>Cumulative epidemic curves display the proportion of locations infected over time in each season.</title>
  <p>In each panel, the x-axis represents weeks since June 1
   <sup>st</sup>, with the corresponding calendar months labeled in orange. Each graph represents 100 possible epidemic curves generated by varying local onset times within estimated bounds of uncertainty. The tightness of the curves indicates that uncertainty in local onset times has little effect on the epidemicâ€™s overall trajectory. Epidemic curves are colored according to the dominant subtype in circulation (black corresponds to A/H1N1 + B, blue to A/H3N2, red to A/H3N2 + B, and purple to A/H1N1pdm).
