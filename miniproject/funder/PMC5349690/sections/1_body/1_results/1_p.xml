<p>Our analysis builds on earlier work indicating that city-level medical insurance claims of influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) are useful and specific indicators of influenza virus activity across the US [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We extend previous analyses of the autumn wave of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] to study spatial spread among 310 distinct geo-referenced locations across continental US during the 2002/03 through 2009/10 influenza seasons, covering both mild and severe epidemics as well as the 2009 pandemic (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A1). Our spatial analysis relies on estimates of local influenza onsets, defined as the date associated with the winter breakpoint in ILI incidence for each location in each season (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Fig A1). Depending on the strength of the influenza signal, we were able to accurately estimate the onset times in 135â€“306 locations in each season (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, we characterize the timing, origin, trajectory, spatial synchrony and long-range transmission events of each of the 8 epidemics. We subsequently fit power-law gravity models with and without explicit mobility indicators to the incidence data.
