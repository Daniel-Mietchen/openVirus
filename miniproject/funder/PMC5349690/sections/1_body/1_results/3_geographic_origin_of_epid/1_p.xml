<p>To better identify the initial focus of each outbreak, we adapted a previously developed method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], where the most likely source location is identified as the location that maximizes the correlation between onset times and the geographic distance to the potential source (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">methods</xref>). Notably, of the eight seasons studied, seven were likely seeded in the Southern US (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The distance signature generally subsided after 1000â€“1500 km, pointing to the importance of one or several long-distance transmission events effectively acting as new sources and obscuring further distance effects.
