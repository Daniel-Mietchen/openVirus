 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g002">Fig 2</xref> depicts the proportion of infected locations over time in each season, illustrating variability in both the epidemic period and the shape of the epidemic curves. The time for influenza to reach all US locations ranged from ~11–22 weeks, while the time for 90% of locations to be infected had a narrower, but still highly variable range (~5–11 weeks, based on the 5
 <sup>th</sup> to 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles,

Across seasons, onset times typically clustered between November and January, with two notable exceptions associated with major influenza seasons in 2003/2004 (Oct.-Nov.) and the 2009 pandemic (Aug.-Oct.). Epidemic curves were generally sigmoidal, indicating that the majority of transmission events happen over a narrow time interval relative to the entire length of the epidemic (

Notable exceptions were the 2005/2006 A/H3N2 season and the 2009 pandemic, both of which had a fairly linear and steady progression of cities becoming infected, and the 2006/2007 A/H1N1+B epidemic which appears to have two “waves” of transmission (
