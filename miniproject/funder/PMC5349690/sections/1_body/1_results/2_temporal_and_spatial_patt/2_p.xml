<p>Maps of estimated influenza onset times reveal clear spatial patterns in all seasons (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A2). Marked radial patterns are observed in at least four seasons: 2002/2003 (the hub of the epidemic is in the Southern US, see also supporting 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A4), 2003/2004 (Southern US), 2005/2006 (Southwestern US) and the 2009 pandemic (Southeastern US). In order to quantify the role of distance on spatial spread, we plot pairwise synchrony in epidemic onsets as a function of geographic distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In all seasons except 2006/2007 and 2008/2009, pairwise synchrony decreased with distance up to 1500–2000 km and departed significantly from patterns expected under the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness. This spatial signature was most pronounced in 2003/2004, 2005/2006 and the 2009 pandemic, in which between 30–58% of synchrony estimates were significantly different from the null (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In 2003/2004 there was a trend towards increasing synchrony between US coasts, as indicated by similar epidemic timings in pairs of locations separated by 2500–3000 km compared to pairs at intermediate distances.
