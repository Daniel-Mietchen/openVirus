<p>Spatial models based on geographic-distance outperformed those integrating mobility-indices in all seasons except for 2006/2007, where the work commutes-based model fit marginally better (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A5 for a comparison of connectivity between the two mobility proxies). Model estimates suggest that the risk of influenza transmission scales with work commutes according to a power law exponent between 0.6–0.8 (median = 0.67,
