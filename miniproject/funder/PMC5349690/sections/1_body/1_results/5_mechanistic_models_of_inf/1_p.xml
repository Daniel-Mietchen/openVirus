<p>Next, we developed a mechanistic transmission model to identify essential drivers of the spatial process in each season, inspired by previous work on influenza [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">methods</xref>). The model captures the directionality of the infectious process, allowing infected locations to transmit disease to susceptible ones. The probability of transmission is a function of the geographic distance between susceptible-infectious pairs (power-law parameter, γ), and each location’s susceptibility is treated as a function of its population size (power-law parameter
