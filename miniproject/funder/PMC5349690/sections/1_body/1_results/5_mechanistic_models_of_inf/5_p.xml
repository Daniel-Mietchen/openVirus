<p>Interestingly, the importance of the normalization parameter (
 <italic>ϵ</italic>) is seen across all models, as estimates were generally close to 1 and always excluded 0 (

 <italic>ε</italic> = 0) would tend to under-estimate influenza risk in cities with few close neighbors (supporting

In other words, under the current sampling scheme, the least connected cities, generally located in the central part of the US, have a stronger risk of infection than their neighborhood alone would predict in the absence of normalization.
