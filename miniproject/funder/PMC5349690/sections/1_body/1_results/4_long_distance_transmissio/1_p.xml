<p>We sought to quantify the number and locations of long-distance transmission events in each season, based on the minimum distance between a newly infected location and the set of previously infected locations. We generated an empirical distribution of this statistic across seasons that takes into account uneven geographic sampling, and defined events occurring in the upper 1
 <sup>st</sup> percentile of this distribution as long-range transmission events (methods and supporting

Long-range events generally occurred early in the epidemic, within the first ~10â€“30% of cities infected (
