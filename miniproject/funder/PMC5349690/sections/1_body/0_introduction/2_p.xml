<p>A number of studies have explored the roles of human mobility, demography, and environmental factors in the spread of seasonal influenza on global and regional scales. These studies have suggested the following “principles”: (i) at a global scale, the worldwide air transportation network serves as the predominant channel for the dissemination of pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses, A/H3N2 viruses in particular [
