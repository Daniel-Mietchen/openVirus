<p>Here, we present a detailed analysis of influenza spread between US cities by modeling a unique set of geo-referenced time series of influenza-like illnesses generated from a large-volume compilation of outpatient medical insurance claims across the US, spanning 8 influenza seasons. Our analysis provides the first detailed characterization of seasonal influenza spread across the continental US and its relation to subtype-differences in susceptibility/contagiousness, human mobility and environmental factors.</p>
