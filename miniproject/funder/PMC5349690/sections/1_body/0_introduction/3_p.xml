<p>Though rare, influenza pandemics offer valuable opportunities to study the dissemination of an invasion wave in a susceptible population, with higher than usual attack rates and intensified data collection efforts. Previous work has indicated that gravity models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] can provide parsimonious descriptions of the spatial diffusion process of pandemic waves, particularly for the 1918 pandemic in England and Wales [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the 2009 A/H1N1pdm pandemic in the US [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These models describe the pairwise spatial interaction between communities as a function of population size and distance, each tuned by power-law parameters. A previous analysis of the 2009 pandemic across the continental US revealed a surprisingly local and radially diffusive wave of spread originating in the Southeastern US [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The observed pandemic trajectory ran contrary to the prediction of fast hierarchal invasion among populous and interconnected locales followed by slower “in-filling” of the interspersed smaller communities. We currently have no guiding principles for when or whether we should expect such a localized mode of spread for seasonal epidemics since there are substantial differences in both the age-groups infected and in population-level immunity during epidemic v. pandemic seasons [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Further, prior work has indicated that global and regional patterns of influenza spread and viral persistence differ by subtype, perhaps mediated by differenced in immunity [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Within a subtype, prior exposure history and antigenic changes may render specific age-strata differentially immune to the particular viral strain in circulation, in turn affecting patterns of spread. In the absence of a full understanding of the interplay between prior immunity and disease dissemination, mobility studies and simulation models must be validated with real-world incidence data.
