<p>Understanding the spatial spread of infectious diseases is essential for clarifying mechanisms of transmission and targeting control interventions. Seasonal influenza offers a unique opportunity to study the spatial diffusion of a directly transmitted pathogen in partially immune populations due the yearly invasion, extinction and subsequent re-invasion of viral strains in the northern and southern hemispheres [
