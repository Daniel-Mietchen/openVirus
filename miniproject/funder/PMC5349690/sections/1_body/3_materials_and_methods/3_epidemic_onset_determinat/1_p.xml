<p>Our goal was to estimate the onset time of influenza in each location for each of the 8 available seasons, 2002/2003-2009/2010. First we selected locations with a sufficient rise in ILI above baseline for further study. Specifically, for each location and season, we computed the difference between the maximum ILI incidence and the maximum ILI incidence in the first 10 weeks of the season (before influenza circulation). We generated an empirical distribution of this statistic across seasons and locations, and excluded locations if their observed statistic fell in the bottom 20
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of this distribution. This produced between 135â€“306 locations per season, based on the strength of the ILI signal in each location.
