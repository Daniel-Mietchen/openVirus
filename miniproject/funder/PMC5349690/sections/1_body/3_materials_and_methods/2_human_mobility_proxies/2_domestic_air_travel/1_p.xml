<p>For each influenza season, we obtained domestic air travel data from the first month with substantial influenza transmission, as provided online from the US Department of Transportation (

We used the “T-100 Market Airline Traffic Data”, which for each month of a given year, contains information on the number of enplaned passengers travelling between any two US airports on direct flights. Passengers changing planes at an intermediate destination airport would be counted twice, once between the initial airport and the intermediate airport, and once between the intermediate airport and the final destination.
