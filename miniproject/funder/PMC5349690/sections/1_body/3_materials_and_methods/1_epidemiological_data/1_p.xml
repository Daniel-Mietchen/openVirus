<p>We compiled weekly time series of influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) from 2002–2010 under a collaborative research agreement with IMS Health, a private data and analytics company that collects de-identified CMS-1500 electronic medical claims from outpatient physician visits throughout the US. The system covered 61.5% of US physicians in 2009 [

Data were stratified by 3-digit zip codes of physicians’ offices and aggregated further according to sectional center facilities as defined by the United States Postal Service, a division akin to a city or occasionally a county. After exclusion of locations with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants to decrease demographic noise, and matching with census population data for denomination, we obtained stable ILI records for 310 locations, which we thereafter denote as ‘cities’ for simplicity. Previous work has shown that standardized ILI time series derived from this surveillance system accurately capture influenza virus activity on a regional and local basis, where standardization is obtained by taking the ratio of weekly ILI visits to the total number of physician visits that week in a given locale, per 100,000 population [
