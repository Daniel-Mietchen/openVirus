<p>Thus, highly positive values of 
 <italic>γ</italic> indicate that the risk of infection decays sharply as a function of geographic distance between the infectious-susceptible pair. If the

  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> term in the model refers to the number of work commutes or airline passengers, based on the original model formulation, large positive values of 
 <italic>γ</italic> indicate that the risk of infection increases as a function of the number of flows between the infectious-susceptible pair. The parameter 
 <italic>ε</italic> captures how the connectivity of a city may vary as a function of the number and location of neighboring cities. The trivial case of 
 <italic>ε</italic> = 0 corresponds to a density-dependent transmission model, in which the total infectious pressure on city 
 <italic>j</italic> is the sum (weighted by distance and population size) of the contributions of each infectious city’s pressure on city 
 <italic>j</italic>. In contrast, 
 <italic>ε</italic> = 1 corresponds to a density-independent transmission model, indicating that the total infectious pressure on city 
 <italic>j</italic> does not scale with the 
 <italic>number or distance</italic> of neighbors, but rather the distance-weighted fraction of neighbors infected [
