<p>Because mobility data was available at the county-level while the epidemiological data were aggregated at the level of cities, we first matched each SCF with the county to which it belongs based on FIPS census information. The vast majority of cities matched to a single county, but 14 cities matched to 6 counties. In this case, we obtained a single epidemic onset for the six counties by taking the inverse-variance weighted average of epidemic onsets in the cities matched to those counties. To allow for comparisons across the three different spatial models, we analyzed data on the same network of cities for each season, and computed Aikaikeâ€™s Information Criterion (AIC) based on the maximized partial likelihood for each model (
