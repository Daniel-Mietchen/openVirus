<p>To construct a domestic airline traffic network that connects pairs of locations in our dataset, for each location we identified all airports within 100 km (or the nearest airport in the event it was beyond 100 km), and assigned all domestic traffic between pairs of airports. Both the work commute and air traffic networks were symmetrized so that flows from city 
 <italic>i</italic> to 
 <italic>j</italic> equal those from 
 <italic>j</italic> to 
 <italic>i</italic>.
