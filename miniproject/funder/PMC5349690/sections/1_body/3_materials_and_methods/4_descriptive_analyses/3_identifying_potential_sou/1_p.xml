<p>To identify the geographic origin of the epidemic in each season, we adapted the “effective distance” method of Brockmann 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], which relies on the concept that epidemics spread radially from an origin, so that epidemic onset times are linearly related to effective distance from the source. This method can be used to (i) identify the correct distance metrics for the disease system under study (effective distances can be based, for example, on geographic distance or mobility proxies) and (ii) identify the most likely origin of the outbreak. Here we focus on the second aspect, and systematically test a large set of locations as potential sources.
