<p>Due to error in our epidemic onset estimation procedure and reporting error, we considered that any one of the first 10% of locations infected in a season could be a potential source for the epidemic. For each potential source location, we computed Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the relationship between each location’s influenza onset time and its geographic distance to the source. We selected the “most likely” origin as the location with the maximum value of the correlation coefficient (supporting
