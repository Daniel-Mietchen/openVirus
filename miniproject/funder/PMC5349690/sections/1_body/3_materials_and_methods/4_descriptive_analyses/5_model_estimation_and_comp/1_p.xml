<p>We maximized the partial log-likelihood over parameters 
 <italic>μ</italic>, 
 <italic>γ</italic>, 
 <italic>ε</italic>, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>, using a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm as implemented in the general-purpose optimization function optim() in R v. 3.1.1. To obtain the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix associated with parameter estimates, we inverted the Hessian of the log-likelihood function evaluated at the maximum partial-likelihood estimates (we also verified that the Hessian was negative definite). For speed, the partial likelihood function was written in C++ and compiled in R v. 3.1.1 using the Rcpp package. Code and a simulated dataset are available upon request.
