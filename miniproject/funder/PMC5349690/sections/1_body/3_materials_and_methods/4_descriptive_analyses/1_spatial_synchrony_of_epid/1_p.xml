<p>For each season separately, we computed the difference (in absolute value) in estimated timing of influenza onset between each pair of locations and the geographic distance separating them. We created bins of 50 kilometers in length ((0–50), [50–100), [100–150)…[4350–4400)) and for each bin computed the mean of the pairwise difference in epidemic onset times. We used a jackknife procedure to obtain variance estimates for the estimated mean in each bin and used these estimates to obtain a pointwise 95% confidence interval for the mean in each bin.</p>
