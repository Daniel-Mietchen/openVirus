<p>To compare against complete spatial randomness in each season, we generated 150 artificial datasets by permuting the original onset times in each location and computed the mean and standard deviation of the absolute value of the difference in epidemic timing in each bin. To obtain summary statistics of the strength of the spatial signature of each epidemic, we tabulated the proportion of bins significantly different from the null of complete spatial randomness.</p>
