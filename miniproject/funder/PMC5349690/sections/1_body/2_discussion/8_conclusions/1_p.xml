<p>Our analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of influenza across eight seasons using granular surveillance data provides several new insights into how geography, human mobility and immunity intermesh to shape the dissemination of influenza in the US. Spatial dissemination is radial and localized, with domestic air traffic playing little role. Intriguingly, epidemics have a propensity to begin in the Southern US, a finding contradictory to existing concepts of environmental forcing on influenza transmission [

Two seasons marked by the circulation of novel viruses (2003/2004 epidemic and the 2009 pandemic) were unique in that influenza arrived earlier in the year than is typical and patterns of spread were particularly localized and radial. Novel influenza viruses appear to spread more locally than previously speculated, perhaps driven by a younger mean age at infection and in turn a decrease in the range of mobility of susceptible hosts. Most importantly perhaps, our work points to a need for highly granular epidemiological datasets to deepen our understanding of influenza transmission, beyond the data resolution available from traditional surveillance schemes. Moving forward, validation of our findings using longer epidemiological records and pathogen genetic information at the same spatial scale will be essential [
