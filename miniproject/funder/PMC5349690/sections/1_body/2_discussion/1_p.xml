<p>Informed disease control and pandemic planning rely on understanding the mechanisms of and variability in the spatial transmission of influenza. Here we studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of annual influenza epidemics in the US over eight seasons, leveraging uniquely spatially-resolved medical claims data on outpatient influenza-like-illnesses (ILI) through an active research collaboration with a data-warehouse company. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed and comprehensive study of the city-level spread of influenza over multiple seasons to date, revealing a number of insights and generating hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission.</p>
