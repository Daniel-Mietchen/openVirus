<p>Prior work on the 2009 pandemic has indicated a role for school openings in modulating the spatial structure of influenza spread during that season [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This was especially important in 2009 because (1) influenza transmission in the US occurred much earlier in the year (August-October) than for seasonal outbreaks, coinciding with the start of the fall school term, and (2) there is substantial geographic variation across start dates for US school fall terms, with earliest school openings in the Southeastern US. In contrast, seasonal influenza outbreaks tend to occur later in the year (onset dates Oct-Jan), typically well into the school fall term. While it is possible that the Christmas holiday break may modulate spatiotemporal patterns in seasonal influenza spread, the timing of this break is more uniform across the US and is not as likely to contribute to spatial variation in spread.
