<p>Prior work has indicated that influenza spread at the state-level in the US is dominated by hierarchical spread between populous states (perhaps driven by inter-state work commutes) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but this work was limited by low-resolution (state-level) mortality data and patterns were averaged across several decades. Our model-based analysis of higher resolution outpatient ILI visits indicates that while more populated locations are at relatively higher risk for influenza transmission compared to less populous locations, this effect is not strong enough for hierarchical spread to predominate over local spread. Indeed, a susceptible cityâ€™s population size contributed only marginally to its risk of obtaining influenza early in an epidemic. It is important to note that this estimated relationship may be confounded by differences in the age-structures of large and small populations, which are not accounted for in our model. In a supplementary analysis (supporting 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A14) we demonstrate that more populous counties are enriched with persons between 20 and 50 years of age, a segment of the population with presumably higher rates of travel (both local and long-distance). Enrichment for this segment of the population in larger counties may confound the relationship between the risk of influenza infection and population size.
