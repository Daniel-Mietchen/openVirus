<p>In complementary analyses, we estimated spatial synchrony in ILI data using the approach proposed in Viboud et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], both at the original resolution of cities and with data aggregated at the state-level. This sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of workflows and demography are more pronounced at the state-level than at the city-level, validating earlier results [

In contrast, the relationship between synchrony and geographic distance predominates at the scale of cities, indicating that spatial data aggregation likely biases the precise characterization of disease spread. The availability of finely spatially-resolved disease data is therefore essential to accurately capture the mechanisms of disease dissemination [
