<p>We identified between one and five long-range transmission events per season, most occurring in the first third of each epidemic and half contributing successfully to the observed dynamics via secondary onward transmission. In model-based analyses, the estimated effect of external seeding varied more than 10-fold across seasons. Whether domestic or international air traffic is responsible for these long-range events and the initial seeding of the epidemic is an important area for future research, which would benefit from complementary analysis of phylogenetic data [
