 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our study points to a predominantly localized mode of influenza transmission within the continental US, even though the exact pathways of epidemic spread and initial seeding events were variable across seasons. The estimated risk of transmission decays sharply with geographic distance from an infected location according to a power-law of ~2.2 (Range: 2.1–2.7). A particularly localized, radial spatial structure was observed in the 2003/2004 and 2005/2006 epidemics dominated by A/H3N2 viruses and, as reported previously [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], in the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic dominated by A/H1N1pdm. We extended previous models of influenza transmission by explicitly connecting disease data with human mobility proxies and found that models driven by geographic distance or work commutes systematically outperformed those driven by air traffic. Taken together, these results do not support domestic air traffic as the dominant mode of spatial dissemination of influenza in the US.
