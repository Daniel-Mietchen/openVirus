<p>Previous work has indicated that work commutes are an important driver of the inter-state spread of influenza in the US [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; here we show that at the scale of cities, models utilizing geographic distance outperformed those using work commutes. The range of connectivity implied by the work commute data may be too narrow to accurately capture influenza transmission, which occurs on a broader spatial scale, likely contributing to the better fit of distance-based spatial models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005382.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Further differences in model fit may stem from the substantially higher degree distribution of the geographic distance network compared to the between-city work-commute network, thereby allowing many more possible pathways for epidemic spread in distance-based models (see supporting 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Figure A5). Reassuringly, however, there was excellent internal consistency between parameter estimates for the work commute and distance-based models (see supporting 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>).
