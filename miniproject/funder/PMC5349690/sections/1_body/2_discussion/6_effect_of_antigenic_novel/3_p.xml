<p>We have not considered the role of human behavior change in shaping the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but we anticipate that the perception of risk during seasonal influenza epidemics is relatively consistent across seasons, and suspect this may play only a minor role in modulating spatial spread. During the 2009 pandemic, the US experienced a widely publicized “herald wave” of H1N1pdm transmission during the spring. By the fall, the US population was broadly aware that H1N1pdm infection was generally mild, likely reducing reactive behavior change during the fall wave of the pandemic. In our study, we model influenza epidemic onset times, rather than the full epidemic dynamics in each location, and is thus our approach is less sensitive to reactive behavior changes in response to growing case counts near the peak of the outbreak.
