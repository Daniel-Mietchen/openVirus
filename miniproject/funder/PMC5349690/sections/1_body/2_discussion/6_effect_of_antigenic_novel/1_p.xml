<p>Given the great interest in predicting how a novel influenza virus will spread through a largely susceptible population, two high transmission seasons merit special attention: the 2003/2004 drift-variant A/H3N2 epidemic and the fall wave of the 2009 pandemic (previously studied in [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] showed that the pre-season population-level susceptibility (~70%), effective reproductive number (1.4–1.6), and overall attack rates (24–33%) were similar for these two major influenza seasons, and in the higher range of seasonal influenza epidemics. We found that in both seasons, influenza virus circulation originated in the Southern US and began earlier in the year than is typical. The relatively slow spread (9–12 weeks) and strong spatial signature of these two seasons is surprising because theory suggests that more transmissible influenza viruses, associated with higher effective reproduction numbers, should spread faster and less radially (because long-distance introductions are more likely) than less transmissible viruses [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The net spatial effect of increased transmissibility is likely modulated by the mobility patterns of the most susceptible hosts, which may vary substantially with age and across seasons.
