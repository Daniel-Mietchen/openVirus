<p>Though a satisfying explanation for these findings remains elusive, the spatial diffusion of novel influenza viruses appears more localized than previously speculated and multiple introductions of influenza may be required to seed an epidemic in any given city, as the probability that a single introduction sparks an epidemic is low. Because commuting flows are on average one order of magnitude larger than air traffic volume [
