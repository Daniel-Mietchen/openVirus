<p>In contrast to previous work [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], our analysis did not find that absolute humidity was an important driver of the spatial spread of influenza. Absolute humidity did not affect the susceptibility of individual cities to influenza infection (supporting 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005382.s001">S1 Text</xref>, Table A3), though our models did not allow for spatial variation in the effect of absolute humidity. This finding is consistent with prior studies of the 2009 pandemic in the US [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, our analysis suggests seven of the eight epidemics studied likely originated in the Southern US, several in humid areas of Texas and Louisiana, a pattern that does not fit with the concept that low humidity favors influenza transmission [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Analyses of longer epidemiological records should shed light on whether the preferred Southern origin of epidemics is due to frequent seeding of influenza in the Southern US (potentially from Central and South America), or if demographic or geographic conditions favor early influenza activity in the South. Importantly, our study did not address the potential role of environmental factors on the local dynamics of influenza, particularly in the weeks immediately following the estimated onset times in each city.
