<p>In line with previous work on the spatial spread of influenza [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] our analysis focuses on epidemic establishment in each location under study, rather than the time of influenza introduction. Epidemic establishment is more complex than the mere importation of influenza cases, as it requires sustained chains of local transmission, which may depend on climatic or virus-specific factors, among others. In our study, the unit of analysis is the city, and only after establishment of sustained local transmission in each city are there sufficient numbers of cases to allow for influenza spread to other cities, as built into the model framework utilized here. The frequency of viral introductions and specific viral migration pathways would be interesting to study but are best addressed by phylogeographic analyses, assuming appropriate sampling of viral sequences early in the epidemic [
