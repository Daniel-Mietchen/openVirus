<p>Another caveat relates to the co-circulation of several influenza virus subtypes or strains in some winters. Syndromic (ILI) time series capture the aggregate effects of these viruses, making it challenging to disentangle the transmission dynamics of one virus from another. We speculate, however, that co-circulation would superpose multiple spatial patterns thereby biasing analyses towards spatial randomness; reassuringly, we observed a spatial signature during epidemics in which multiple subtypes co-circulated (2002/2003, 2004/2005, and 2005/2006). Importantly, this caveat does not apply to the severe and radially diffusive influenza seasons in 2003/2004 and 2009, which were marked by overwhelming predominance of a single antigenically-novel strain.</p>
