<p>We relied on gravity-type power-law models of influenza transmission and incorporated empirical data on human mobility; these models have been validated as parsimonious approximations of both human movement [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A major limitation of these models, however, is that they consider the pairwise interaction between infectious/susceptible cities, but ignore higher order interactions, which may prove to be essential in capturing realistic patterns of human movement. In reality, some combination of work commutes, air travel and other local movements likely drive disease dissemination, and ideally these different connectivity metrics should be integrated in a single model rather than analyzed separately. Because the observed mobility networks are captured on different scales both geographically and temporally, it is not clear how best to combine information across such different networks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005382.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Finally, the observed data represent a sample of locations within the network of interacting cities; the effects of geographic sampling on parameter estimation is poorly understood. Further work is needed to develop realistic model formulations that connect multiple mobility indices and disease datasets at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.
