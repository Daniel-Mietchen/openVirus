 <p>The underlying mechanisms dictating the spatial spread of seasonal influenza remain poorly understood, in part because of the lack of spatially resolved disease data to quantify patterns of spread. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing fine-grain insurance claims data on influenza-like-illnesses over eight seasons in ~300 locations throughout the United States. Using statistical methods, we found that seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US, that influenza spatial transmission is dominated by local traffic between cities, and that seasons marked by novel influenza virus circulation had a particularly radial, localized spatial structure. These findings are in stark contrast to prevailing theories of influenza spatial transmission that suggest that transmission is favored in low humidity environments and that spread is a dominated by air traffic between populous hubs.</p>
