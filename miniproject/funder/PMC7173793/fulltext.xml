In both 2011 and 2012, ninety (90%) of cases were new and had a high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/TB co-infection rate of 72% across all suburbs. Tuberculosis prevalence was highest in the Southern district in both 2011 and 2012. There were pockets of spatial distribution of TB prevalence across West South West, Southern, Western, South Western and Eastern health districts. TB hot spot occurrence was restricted to the West South West, parts of South Western, Western health districts. West South West district had an increased peri-urban population with inadequate social services including health facilities. These conditions were conducive for increased intensity of TB occurrence, a probable indication of high transmission especially in the presence of high HIV co-infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>Increased TB transmission was limited to a health district with high informal internal migrants with limited health services in Harare City.

In line with international best practice, the Zimbabwe National TB Control Program&#x02019;s (NTP)&#x02019;s guidelines recommends ambulatory TB care for both sputum smear positive and smear negative TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In Zimbabwe, the two largest metropolitan cities, Harare and Bulawayo, contributed an estimated 30% of the national TB case load from 2008 to 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Health infrastructure in the two metropolitan cities is well established with well functional health facilities, good road and transport infrastructure and available free TB services to the patients. Causes of the persistently high TB case load have not been fully described besides the known effects of poverty and socioeconomic challenges affecting the general population since the early 2000. The socioeconomic challenges created social instability resulting in high rural to urban migration. For Harare and Bulawayo, the increased populations was against non-expanding social services, thus increasing the risk of TB transmission from overcrowding and poverty [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A national program implemented in 2008 to decongest urban areas created new peri-urban settlements where there were limited health care and other social services. This internal movement of people firstly from rural areas into major urban areas in search of livelihood and later into peri-urban areas to decongest the city, may have changed the city-wide epidemiology of TB and other poverty related diseases as evidenced by the frequent outbreaks of cholera [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

The utility of geospatial techniques in providing critical planning information for TB treatment and care services has been described elsewhere but limited to high income countries [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Few studies have used geospatial techniques to estimate TB transmission pathways and distribution of MDR-TB clusters [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aim of this study was to describe the presence of high clustering of TB cases, an indication of potential high transmission zones in Harare City using geospatial techniques for the period 2011 to 2012. To our knowledge, no studies had been done to describe the spatial pattern of TB in Harare City.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Setting</title><p>Harare city had an estimated total population of about two (2) million in 2012, with a good road network facilitating movement of residents between the twelve (12) health districts. Each health district has several suburbs. Provision of primary health care and maternity care services are through a network of 12 polyclinics, 39 clinics and two infectious disease referral hospitals. Sputum smear microscopy was the TB diagnostic method of choice with Gene Xpert technology being prioritized for high risk drug resistant TB patients only. Culture and drug sensitivity testing for patients with first line TB treatment failure, retreatment, rifampicin mono-resistant on Gene Xpert and other high-risk drug resistant TB patients were outsourced to the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL) at Harare Central hospital, a tertiary government referral hospital. At the end of TB treatment, all patients within the catchment area of the two referral hospitals were discharged through the respective referral hospitals for treatment outcome determination.

District specific HIV prevalence was calculated from the total HIV positive divided by the total tested for HIV. Before detecting the pattern of TB prevalence in Harare over the two years, there was need to test for the presence and nature of TB occurrence. We tested whether the occurrence of TB had a tendency to form a systematic pattern than would be under the hypothesis of randomness i.e., spatial autocorrelation (or dependency). To achieve this, we applied both local and global measures of spatial autocorrelation. To achieve this, the Global Moran&#x02019;s Indices was applied. The global Moran&#x02019;s Index was applied to confirm presence of non-random distribution of TB cases in all suburbs in Harare. The presence of spatial autocorrelation in terms of TB disease estimated the levels of TB clustering, which is indicative of hierarchical expansionary spread in urban areas and across the health districts. With an index ranging from -1 to +1, a score of zero indicated no spatial autocorrelation and a positive value indicated spatial clustering of TB cases across suburbs. A negative value show that neighbouring suburbs were characterised by dissimilar TB cases [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to the Global Moran&#x02019;s I, there was need to understand the type of spatial correlation in the distribution of TB cases by health districts. The Anselin Local Moran&#x02019;s I (LISA) was applied to assesses the influence of individual TB cases within surrounding health districts on other districts [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results of LISA classified health districts into clusters of high TB cases next to high TB cases i.e., high-high, (HH), (low TB cases next to low cases, (LL), &#x0201c;coldspots&#x0201d; and spatial outliers (high amongst low, (HL) or vice versa, (LH). LISA was computed using the following formula [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]:

In Harare, proportion of the working population aged 25&#x02013;49 was the highest due to the presence of employment opportunities [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This may explain the high case load contributed by Harare City to the national burden. The high proportion of new TB cases may indicate that transmission could be the most common mode of acquiring TB disease in Harare as described in studies from South Africa and Zimbabwe [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a country with adequate funding from the partners and Government and no reported shortage of anti-TB medicines, consumables and supplies, the observed high prevalence of new TB cases suggesting continuous transmission require a more focused investigations to understand the drivers of transmission. The high HIV co-infection across all districts maybe driving the TB epidemic. However, despite a similar average HIV prevalence, there were differences in TB prevalence, (cases per capita) by district and also spatial distribution suggesting that HIV alone was not the cause of the observed TB distribution as reported from a study from Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Findings showing an increased risk of TB among the 11&#x02013;19 years age-group were unusual in our study. There are two possible explanations for these findings. First, the prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in Zimbabwe programme had significantly reduced mother to child transmission of HIV in Zimbabwe and those HIV positive children were living longer due to high coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Therefore an accumulation of high risk HIV positive young people in an environment of high TB transmission may have resulted in the increased TB transmission in this age group. Secondly, a study in Cape Town, South Africa showed that adolescent population was more likely to contract TB whilst away from home, mainly at school [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] This could explain the relatively high prevalence of TB in the school going 11&#x02013;19 years age-group in our study.</p><p>Although the TB prevalence (cases per population) showed that the Southern region had the highest TB prevalence, the global Moran&#x02019;s I test showed that the Southern region TB cases were not highly related to any of the neighbouring districts. This shows the utility of analysing epidemiological data in terms of space and time rather than rely on routinely collected surveillance data only. In the Southern district are three health facilities, two clinics and one infectious disease referral hospital. Also, the country&#x02019;s main public transport terminus is located in the Southern district. We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of unrelated TB cases could have been due to people accessing TB services in health facilities from the Southern district but staying outside the district. The contribution of this internal movement for health care services to the TB epidemic remains an area of research need in Zimbabwe as some studies from South Africa have reported TB transmission associated with the transport sector. [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Geospatial analysis of TB cases in Harare city showed that the occurrence was not random. The suburbs with high TB prevalence and showing high transmission intensity were similar in that they were both located in the periphery of the city. In addition, they were providing services to a peri-urban population that had been created by the high rural to urban migration and efforts to decongest Harare city. The worst affected districts were the Southern, West South West and Eastern districts. Studies describing geographic clustering of TB cases found that the most common risk factors for clustering were low socioeconomic status, homelessness, poor housing and low education attainment [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Successful transmission of TB require the presence of infectious cases that interact with susceptible uninfected individuals for a longer period of time [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Conditions that affect early TB diagnosis, early treatment and access to social services therefore promote ongoing transmission of TB. West South West and Southern districts had pockets of peri-urban populations that had no access to health care services and were relying on services outside where they lived. Studies from China and Ethiopia also reported that low access to health care services was associated with increased number of TB cases. [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The Eastern district showed presence of clustering, an indication of relatedness of the TB cases and maybe ongoing transmission. However, there was no evidence of increased intensity of relatedness as observed in West South West district. A few reasons could explain this observation. The Eastern district was next to a rural and farming district that had adequate health facilities, with no overcrowding and relatively less poor. The rural and farming community next to the Eastern district had access to district hospital and several rural health centres servicing the communities. In addition, several small farms next to the Eastern district provided economic activity for the populations and reduced the need to travel towards the Eastern and central districts.</p><p>Assessment of TB transmission had used TB notification data in children, population based surveys using interferon gamma release assays, geospatial techniques and more recently whole genome sequencing [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Molecular epidemiological studies have been criticized for failing to distinguish changes in transmission intensity. The use of geospatial techniques in the African continent have been limited due to software costs and access to spatial data although they provide evidence on changes in transmission intensity [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Optimal methods of assessing TB transmission would be to combine molecular methods with geospatial techniques. [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In our study, we demonstrated the utility of geospatial techniques to provide critical information for public health planning in TB programming.</p><p>Our findings from the first geospatial study of TB epidemiology in Harare brought out several issues critical for targeted TB prevention and control. Firstly, the results have demonstrated that in the absence of adequate public health services, social diseases like TB tend to occur more commonly. The increased contact or social mixing resulting from increased movement in search of social services and livelihood, may have been propagating TB transmission in Harare city and the general population [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This may explain why Harare city, has been contributing the highest TB case load in Zimbabwe. The city is one of the densely populated, contributing about 16.3% of the total population, hence facilitating increased contact between TB susceptible and infected persons [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, despite the decline in the national TB incidence in Zimbabwe, pockets of high TB transmission like Harare city will continue to propagate the disease at national level. Similar findings from metropolitan cities have attributed pockets of increased TB transmission, hotspots, to the continued generalized TB epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The mechanism of spread is believed to be increased social interaction as populations move in search of social services including health care [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Identifying areas of increased TB transmission and plan interventions accordingly is critical for controlling the TB epidemic in Harare City. Also critical is the recognition of non-health sector developmental issues that may affect distribution TB disease.</p><p>Thirdly, our results show that use of geographical information systems (GIS) provides important information on social and environmental characteristics of TB transmission in addition to the known epidemiological characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. With most of the available evidence of spatial epidemiology of TB have been limited to describing the TB case load in terms of prevalence over time, the use of inferential GIS statistics like the Anselin&#x02019;s Local Moran&#x02019;s I and Getis Gi statistics provided additional information on TB transmission dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This information is important in defining areas that require targeted health and developmental interventions.</p><p>Findings from this study may have been affected by use of retrospective secondary data. This limited the time duration of follow up, as the years 2008&#x02013;2010 were excluded due to missing variables on physical address. Follow up of contacts to assess the proportion of secondary cases and confirm the behavioral characteristics of TB patients reported in Harare city was not possible. An anthropological study to adequately characterize and understand the TB epidemic in Harare City is recommended [<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231637.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It was not possible to estimate the direction of the hotspot because of the short two years duration of follow up.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, we conclude that reduced access to public health services in Harare&#x02019;s peri-urban areas was contributing to the ongoing TB epidemic in Zimbabwe. The authors recommend that Harare City council provide public health services to peri-urban areas to interrupt TB transmission. This could be done through establishing health posts with capacity to screen and diagnose TB using Gene Xpert as outlined by the current national health strategic plan. In addition, Harare City health should strengthen capacity of the Western, Southern and Eastern districts to provide early TB case detection and treatment to interrupt TB transmission. Working with other government sector ministries, Harare City council should ensure economic activities are available for the newly established peri-urban settlements. This would reduce population movements in the inner city and thereby reducing potential for spreading infectious diseases like TB.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0231637.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>. <article-title>The spatial epidemiology of tuberculosis in Linyi City, China, 2005&#x02013;2010</article-title>. <source>BMC Public Health</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>12</volume>:<fpage>885</fpage>
