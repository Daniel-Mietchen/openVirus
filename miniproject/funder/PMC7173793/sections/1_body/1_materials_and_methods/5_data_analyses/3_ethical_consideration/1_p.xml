<p>This study was approved by the relevant institutional review boards, Medical Research council of Zimbabwe (MRCZ), number MRCZ/A/1830 and Stellenbosch institutional review board, S16/06/106. De-identified and routinely collected secondary clinical patient data was used. This study was part of a PhD study on migration and TB transmission in Zimbabwe. Ethics permission was on the full protocol including this spatial epidemiology study. Permission to use historical data was provided by Harare City health department and informed consent was waivered by the ethics review committee on the basis that no patient contact was used to collect data and identifiable patient record was removed except the full patient address that was used for GIS. After GIS mapping from the peri-urban settlements where there was no identifiable chronological order of the households, full address information was removed before data analysis.</p>
