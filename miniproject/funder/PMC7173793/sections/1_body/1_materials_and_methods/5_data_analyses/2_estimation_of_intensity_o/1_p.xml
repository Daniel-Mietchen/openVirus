<p>The local Getis-Ord G
 <sub>i</sub>* statistic, a hotspot analysis function in ArcGIS (Ver.10.2, ESRI Inc., CA, USA), was used to test for the intensity of incident TB cases, a measure of hotspots or cold spot occurrence TB in Harare [

 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The calculated ratio of the local sum of the TB cases in the vicinity of a suburb based on a five (5) metre threshold was compared to the total sum of all the TB cases in each health district to estimate intensity of incident TB cases. The intensity of incident TB cases was used to estimate transmission within the health districts. The statistical significance of a Z-score for each suburb was quantified through the presence of hotspots and coldspots of TB incidence, relative to the hypothesis of spatial randomness [

 <sub>i</sub>* calculates a Z-score where a significant positive Z score (Gi*) indicated hotspot phenomenon. A negative Z-score showed cod hotspot [
