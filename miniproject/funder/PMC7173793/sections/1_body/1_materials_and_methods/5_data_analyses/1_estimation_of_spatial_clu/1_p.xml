<p>Prevalence of TB per health district was calculated based on the district TB case notification and estimated district population. District specific HIV prevalence was calculated from the total HIV positive divided by the total tested for HIV. Before detecting the pattern of TB prevalence in Harare over the two years, there was need to test for the presence and nature of TB occurrence. We tested whether the occurrence of TB had a tendency to form a systematic pattern than would be under the hypothesis of randomness i.e., spatial autocorrelation (or dependency). To achieve this, we applied both local and global measures of spatial autocorrelation. To achieve this, the Global Moran’s Indices was applied. The global Moran’s Index was applied to confirm presence of non-random distribution of TB cases in all suburbs in Harare. The presence of spatial autocorrelation in terms of TB disease estimated the levels of TB clustering, which is indicative of hierarchical expansionary spread in urban areas and across the health districts. With an index ranging from -1 to +1, a score of zero indicated no spatial autocorrelation and a positive value indicated spatial clustering of TB cases across suburbs. A negative value show that neighbouring suburbs were characterised by dissimilar TB cases [

In addition to the Global Moran’s I, there was need to understand the type of spatial correlation in the distribution of TB cases by health districts. The Anselin Local Moran’s I (LISA) was applied to assesses the influence of individual TB cases within surrounding health districts on other districts [
 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results of LISA classified health districts into clusters of high TB cases next to high TB cases i.e., high-high, (HH), (low TB cases next to low cases, (LL), “coldspots” and spatial outliers (high amongst low, (HL) or vice versa, (LH). LISA was computed using the following formula [

 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> was the spatial weight matrix corresponding to the suburb pair 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>. Suburbs with high TB cases were classified as hot spots, while the ones with low TB cases were classified as cold spots. Spatial outlier represented the location where there was a mixture of high and low TB cases in neighbouring suburbs. The computation of LISA resulted in five scenarios of results: High-High, Low-Low, Low-High, High-Low, and Not Significant.
