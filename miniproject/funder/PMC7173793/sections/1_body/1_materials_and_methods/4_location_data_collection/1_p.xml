<p>Using the Epi Info electronic register, the TB patients’ physical address was used to get the household location. Patients’ physical location had their coordinates taken using a global positioning system receiver (GPS). We accepted a measurement error of ±3 metres. For residential areas where there was a logical chronology of physical addresses only the first and last ten household numbers had their coordinates taken and the remainder o fthe households, we used Google Earth to digitalise them. Houses that were not on google earth were mapped using the GPS receiver through field visits. The point locations were then entered in a spreadsheet and converted into .
 <italic>csv</italic> for use in a GIS environment. The points were mapped in a GIS environment using ArcMap to visualise the TB cases.
