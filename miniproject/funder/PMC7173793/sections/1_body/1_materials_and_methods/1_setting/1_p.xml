<p>Harare city had an estimated total population of about two (2) million in 2012, with a good road network facilitating movement of residents between the twelve (12) health districts. Each health district has several suburbs. Provision of primary health care and maternity care services are through a network of 12 polyclinics, 39 clinics and two infectious disease referral hospitals. Sputum smear microscopy was the TB diagnostic method of choice with Gene Xpert technology being prioritized for high risk drug resistant TB patients only. Culture and drug sensitivity testing for patients with first line TB treatment failure, retreatment, rifampicin mono-resistant on Gene Xpert and other high-risk drug resistant TB patients were outsourced to the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL) at Harare Central hospital, a tertiary government referral hospital. At the end of TB treatment, all patients within the catchment area of the two referral hospitals were discharged through the respective referral hospitals for treatment outcome determination. The South west south district was a farm converted to residential area to accommodate people who had been displaced through operation restore order. It did not have social facilities including a clinic of its own.</p>
