<p>Geospatial analysis of TB cases in Harare city showed that the occurrence was not random. The suburbs with high TB prevalence and showing high transmission intensity were similar in that they were both located in the periphery of the city. In addition, they were providing services to a peri-urban population that had been created by the high rural to urban migration and efforts to decongest Harare city. The worst affected districts were the Southern, West South West and Eastern districts. Studies describing geographic clustering of TB cases found that the most common risk factors for clustering were low socioeconomic status, homelessness, poor housing and low education attainment [

West South West and Southern districts had pockets of peri-urban populations that had no access to health care services and were relying on services outside where they lived. Studies from China and Ethiopia also reported that low access to health care services was associated with increased number of TB cases. [
