<p>Assessment of TB transmission had used TB notification data in children, population based surveys using interferon gamma release assays, geospatial techniques and more recently whole genome sequencing [

The use of geospatial techniques in the African continent have been limited due to software costs and access to spatial data although they provide evidence on changes in transmission intensity [
