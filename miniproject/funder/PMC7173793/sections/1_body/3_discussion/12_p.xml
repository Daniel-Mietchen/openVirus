<p>Despite the above limitations, we conclude that reduced access to public health services in Harareâ€™s peri-urban areas was contributing to the ongoing TB epidemic in Zimbabwe. The authors recommend that Harare City council provide public health services to peri-urban areas to interrupt TB transmission. This could be done through establishing health posts with capacity to screen and diagnose TB using Gene Xpert as outlined by the current national health strategic plan. In addition, Harare City health should strengthen capacity of the Western, Southern and Eastern districts to provide early TB case detection and treatment to interrupt TB transmission. Working with other government sector ministries, Harare City council should ensure economic activities are available for the newly established peri-urban settlements. This would reduce population movements in the inner city and thereby reducing potential for spreading infectious diseases like TB.</p>
