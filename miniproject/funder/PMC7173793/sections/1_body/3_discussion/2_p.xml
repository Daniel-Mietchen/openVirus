<p>Previous studies have shown that the economically active 25–49 years age-group and male population had the highest risk of TB and HIV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This may explain the high case load contributed by Harare City to the national burden. The high proportion of new TB cases may indicate that transmission could be the most common mode of acquiring TB disease in Harare as described in studies from South Africa and Zimbabwe [

 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In a country with adequate funding from the partners and Government and no reported shortage of anti-TB medicines, consumables and supplies, the observed high prevalence of new TB cases suggesting continuous transmission require a more focused investigations to understand the drivers of transmission. The high HIV co-infection across all districts maybe driving the TB epidemic. However, despite a similar average HIV prevalence, there were differences in TB prevalence, (cases per capita) by district and also spatial distribution suggesting that HIV alone was not the cause of the observed TB distribution as reported from a study from Ethiopia [
