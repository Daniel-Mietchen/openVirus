<p>Secondly, despite the decline in the national TB incidence in Zimbabwe, pockets of high TB transmission like Harare city will continue to propagate the disease at national level. Similar findings from metropolitan cities have attributed pockets of increased TB transmission, hotspots, to the continued generalized TB epidemics [

Also critical is the recognition of non-health sector developmental issues that may affect distribution TB disease.
