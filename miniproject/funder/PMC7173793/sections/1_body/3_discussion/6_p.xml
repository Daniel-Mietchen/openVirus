<p>The Eastern district showed presence of clustering, an indication of relatedness of the TB cases and maybe ongoing transmission. However, there was no evidence of increased intensity of relatedness as observed in West South West district. A few reasons could explain this observation. The Eastern district was next to a rural and farming district that had adequate health facilities, with no overcrowding and relatively less poor. The rural and farming community next to the Eastern district had access to district hospital and several rural health centres servicing the communities. In addition, several small farms next to the Eastern district provided economic activity for the populations and reduced the need to travel towards the Eastern and central districts.</p>
