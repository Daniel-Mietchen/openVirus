<p>Although the TB prevalence (cases per population) showed that the Southern region had the highest TB prevalence, the global Moran’s I test showed that the Southern region TB cases were not highly related to any of the neighbouring districts. This shows the utility of analysing epidemiological data in terms of space and time rather than rely on routinely collected surveillance data only. In the Southern district are three health facilities, two clinics and one infectious disease referral hospital. Also, the country’s main public transport terminus is located in the Southern district. We hypothesized that the increased prevalence of unrelated TB cases could have been due to people accessing TB services in health facilities from the Southern district but staying outside the district. The contribution of this internal movement for health care services to the TB epidemic remains an area of research need in Zimbabwe as some studies from South Africa have reported TB transmission associated with the transport sector.
