<p>Thirdly, our results show that use of geographical information systems (GIS) provides important information on social and environmental characteristics of TB transmission in addition to the known epidemiological characteristics [

With most of the available evidence of spatial epidemiology of TB have been limited to describing the TB case load in terms of prevalence over time, the use of inferential GIS statistics like the Anselin’s Local Moran’s I and Getis Gi statistics provided additional information on TB transmission dynamics [
