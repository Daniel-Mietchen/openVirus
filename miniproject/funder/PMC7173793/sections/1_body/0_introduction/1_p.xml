<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infectious disease transmitted through inhalation of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (
 <italic>Mtb</italic>) in aerosolized droplet nuclei [
 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. High population density, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, poverty, air pollution, population displacements and malnutrition increases the risk of successful TB transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Host characteristics like infectiousness of the infected, number of susceptible individuals, frequency of interaction and social mixing patterns plus virulence of the pathogen promote successful transmission of
