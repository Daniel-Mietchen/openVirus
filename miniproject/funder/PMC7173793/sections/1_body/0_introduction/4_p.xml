<p>Methods to estimate presence of TB hotspot transmission have been limited to either use of geographical information systems (GIS) or molecular techniques or in combination of the two [

 <xref rid="pone.0231637.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aim of this study was to describe the presence of high clustering of TB cases, an indication of potential high transmission zones in Harare City using geospatial techniques for the period 2011 to 2012. To our knowledge, no studies had been done to describe the spatial pattern of TB in Harare City.
