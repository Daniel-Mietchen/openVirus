Health infrastructure in the two metropolitan cities is well established with well functional health facilities, good road and transport infrastructure and available free TB services to the patients. Causes of the persistently high TB case load have not been fully described besides the known effects of poverty and socioeconomic challenges affecting the general population since the early 2000. The socioeconomic challenges created social instability resulting in high rural to urban migration. For Harare and Bulawayo, the increased populations was against non-expanding social services, thus increasing the risk of TB transmission from overcrowding and poverty [
