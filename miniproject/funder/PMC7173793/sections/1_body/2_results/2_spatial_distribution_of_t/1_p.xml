 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231637.g003">3</xref> show the spatial distribution of TB prevalence by health district for Harare City. In both 2011 and 2012 most of the health districts were characterised by suburbs with low (0–11) spatial distribution of TB prevalence, that is, majority of the districts had TB cases that were unrelated to each other. Global spatial autocorrelation for parts of Northern, Eastern, north western, western, south western and south west south, located in the periphery of the greater Harare showed presence of positive spatial clustering of TB cases for both 2011 and 2012 (p-value &lt; 0.05). The clustered distribution of TB cases in the parts of Harare’s peripheral districts indicated the non-random occurrence of the TB cases in the central business districts. Suburbs in the Southern and Western areas of the city had the highest TB prevalence especially the West South West (WSW), South Western and Eastern districts that were related to each other.
