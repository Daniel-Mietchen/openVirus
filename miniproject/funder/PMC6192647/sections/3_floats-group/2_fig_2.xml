  <title>Posterior distributions of the effective reproduction number.</title>
  <p>Marginal posterior distributions of the effective reproduction numbers are shown for different annealing temperatures (i.e., 16, 32 and 64), as obtained from 40,000 chains. Group 1 represents Tokyo and adjacent prefectures, while group 2 represents Osaka and adjacent prefectures. Tokyo has six panels while Osaka has only five because the epidemic period in Osaka was less complex than Tokyo (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205889.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The vertical black line shows the posterior mean value, while the vertical dashed line shows the posterior map (i.e., maximum a posteriori) value, which yields the greatest likelihood value.
