  <title>Comparison of the forecast error between metapopulation and homogeneous models.</title>
  <p>The horizontal axis measures the date on which forecasting was made. The vertical axis measures the root mean square error (RMSE), representing error value. For the homogeneous model, the SIR model without spatial structure was fitted to the dataset for all of Japan. Subsequently, infected individuals were proportionately allocated to each prefecture by population size, so that the prefecture-specific forecast can be compared. Metapopulation was labeled as “meta-population,” while the stochastic SIR model was labeled as “aggregated.” Day 0 is 2 January 2012. Days are counted onward; thus, year 2013 starts on Day 365.</p>
