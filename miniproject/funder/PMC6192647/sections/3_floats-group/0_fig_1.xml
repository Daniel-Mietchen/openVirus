  <title>Epidemic curve of the rubella epidemic from 2012 to 2013, Japan.</title>
  <p>Top: Weekly number of notified cases in Kanto (Tokyo and adjacent prefectures), Kansai (Osaka and adjacent prefectures) and the rest of Japan. Middle and bottom: The number of notified cases in Tokyo (middle) and Osaka (bottom) in log-scale. Epidemic periods are represented by gray-shaded areas, which were visually determined by linear/eyeball extrapolation of the trend, i.e., the epidemic period is switched when the increasing or decreasing trend is swapped.</p>
