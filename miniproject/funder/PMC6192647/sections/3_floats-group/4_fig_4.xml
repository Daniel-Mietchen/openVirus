  <title>Forecasting rubella epidemics in 2012 and 2013, Japan.</title>
  <p>Forecasts with 95% prediction intervals for six prefectures are shown. Six prefectures with different population size (each estimate on the upper right corner) are chosen and displayed. For the 2012 forecasting, we repeated the filtering process up to 112th day (when an exponential growth in the first year begins) and repeated the prediction process up to the end of the epidemic. Forecasted weekly notifications are shown in log-scale. Mean and 95%CrIs in filtering process are displayed by solid curves and gray-shaded areas, respectively. For the 2013 forecasting, the filtering process was continued up to 308th day on which an exponential growth in the second year began.</p>
