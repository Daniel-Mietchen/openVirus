  <title>Predicted cumulative incidence by different spatial vaccination scenarios.</title>
  <p>Cumulative incidence is measured on the vertical axis. The spatial vaccination scenario assumes that we have enough vaccines to increases the immune fraction of the entire Japan by 1% (left), 3% (middle) and 5% (right), respectively, following each policy. Vaccination was assumed to take place in advance of the 2012 epidemic. The horizontal axis represents the number of prefectures to be covered by vaccination. For instance, the value of 4 indicates that vaccination is prioritized only for Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka and Aichi prefectures, i.e., the top four populous prefectures. The value of 47 indicates that vaccines are equally distributed to all prefectures. Median trajectory is represented by a continuous curve. Outer most curves are the 95% credible intervals. Other points are drawn using dotted lines for every 10th percentile point (i.e., 10th, 20th,â€¦, 90th).</p>
