<p>The present study employed a metapopulation epidemic model to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of rubella from 2012 to 2013 in Japan. Using a piecewise constant model for transmissibility, the epidemic curve was approximated by multiple exponential growth curves. We devised a particle MCMC method for inference, and the estimation of parameters during 2013 was successful, while the reliability of parameter estimates in 2012 appeared to be limited. Reflecting these findings, the forecast in 2012 was accompanied by broad uncertainty and large RMSE values, while that in 2013 nicely contained observed future data within the 95% CrI prediction intervals. Assuming that a very small amount of vaccines were distributed in advance of the epidemic, the spatial vaccination scenario appeared to be potentially valuable for selectively vaccinating specific prefectures, however, greater uncertainty was introduced by initial conditions and stochasticity.</p>
