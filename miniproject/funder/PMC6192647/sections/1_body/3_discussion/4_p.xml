<p>Other technical limitations that we cannot address in the present study must be emphasized. First, estimated transmissibility indicated the presence of seasonality, however, increasing and decreasing elements of the epidemic were not accompanied by explicit underlying causal mechanisms (i.e., why it increased and decreased). The eventual end of the 2013 epidemic, while leaving a substantial number of susceptible individuals [

Second, chronological age structure was ignored for simplicity, however, the epidemic was actually aggregated among adult cases and may have been highly dependent on age-specific susceptibility and contact. A fully structured model with space and age is part of our ongoing future work. Third, while capturing spatial transmission, the spatial unit rested on a total of 47 prefectures in Japan and a micro-geographic scale to generate clusters was discarded. Fourth, due to data limitations, intra-annual variations in human movement, demography and other factors were not taken into account. Lastly, while our application was motivated by the 2012–2013 rubella epidemic in Japan, we did not examine CRS in relation to vaccination practice [
