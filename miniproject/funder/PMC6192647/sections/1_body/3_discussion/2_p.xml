<p>To our knowledge, the present study is the first to implement spatiotemporal modeling of the recent rubella epidemic in Japan. The epidemic motivated us to employ a metapopulation model because the epidemic was largely observed in urban cities, including Tokyo and Osaka. Thus, we devised a model to capture that type of prefectural pattern, which indeed enabled us to yield the spatiotemporal forecast and examine potential usefulness of spatial vaccination. While the predictive performance was not necessarily substantial due to piecewise constant modeling with crude intervals as applied to the multimodal epidemic curve, especially in 2012, the forecast with narrower uncertainty bounds was obtained for the greater epidemic in 2013. Indeed, the error bound as measured by RMSE for the metapopulation model yielded better values than the homogeneous model in 2013.</p>
