 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205889.g006">Fig 6</xref> examines variations by different allocations of vaccination. The cumulative number of infected individuals slightly varied with the spatial extent of vaccination. When the vaccination coverage was 3% or 5%, the minimum cumulative count was achieved by allocating vaccines to the top six populous prefectures. While such minimum is identified, dashed lines represent uncertainties surrounding initial condition (of infectious individuals and susceptible individuals) and parameter estimates, which are greater than variations by the choice of prioritizing prefectures to receive vaccination. Interestingly, equal distribution of vaccination yielded a skewed distribution of the cumulative incidence.
