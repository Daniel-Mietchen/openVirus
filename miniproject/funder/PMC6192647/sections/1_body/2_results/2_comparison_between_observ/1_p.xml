 <italic>s</italic> = 2 (i.e., week 16) to avoid any uncertainty associated with initial conditions. That is, we sampled parameters from posterior distributions that were obtained up to day 112 and then simulated the epidemics and case reporting using those posterior distributions (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205889.s003">S2 Fig</xref>. for the vertical axis taking the absolute number of cases). Due to broad uncertainty of parameters in 2012, the size of the epidemic was highly variable. When we filtered the data by week 44 (i.e., s = 4), then uncertainty was greatly reduced. See
