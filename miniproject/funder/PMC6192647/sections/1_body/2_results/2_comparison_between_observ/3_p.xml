 <sub>i</sub> between our metapopulation model and the SIR model without spatial structure. In the latter model, case counts were allocated by the relative population size to each prefecture. Due to stochastic spatial transmission dynamics, the metapopulation model reflects spiky curves in each prefecture and its RMSEs were greater than that of the SIR model without spatial components (see

Moreover, estimates of the 2012 metapopulation epidemic were not accompanied by substantial reliability. The metapopulation model appeared to be superior to the homogeneous model from the midst of the 2013 epidemic onward.
