<p>In addition to age and gender specificities, it must be noted that rubella cases during the 2012â€“2013 rubella epidemic in Japan have been mostly seen in urban areas. Among the total of 16,730 notified cases, 4,116 (24.6%) and 3,600 (21.5%) were reported from Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest prefectures in Japan. Conversely, the cumulative number of cases during the same period remained below 10 cases in 30 prefectures. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205889.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the epidemic curve from 2012 to 2013. Cases were mostly seen in urban prefectures with large population sizes, and two different patterns of epidemic curves, i.e., the one in (i) Tokyo and adjacent areas and the other in (ii) Osaka and areas connected to Osaka, were identified. Namely, the transmission dynamics was geographically heterogeneous and it is likely that the majority of transmissions have occurred in urban cities associated with either Tokyo or Osaka.
