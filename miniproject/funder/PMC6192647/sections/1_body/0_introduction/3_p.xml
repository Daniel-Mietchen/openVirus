<p>To quantify the spatial heterogeneity of rubella in Japan and incorporating that heterogeneity into future intervention planning, it is beneficial to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics accounting for human mobility. The metapopulation epidemic model is a suitable tool to capture spatiotemporal dynamics over discrete patches, which are in line with the actual spatial distribution of a total of 47 prefectures in Japan [

The present study aimed to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of rubella using a parsimonious metapopulation epidemic model and examine the potential usefulness of a vaccination program that focuses on spatial heterogeneity.
