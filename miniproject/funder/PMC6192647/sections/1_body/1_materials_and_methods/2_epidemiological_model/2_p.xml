<p>The transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic> for rubella is assumed to vary with time, perhaps due to seasonality and human contact behaviors. To permit time-dependent 
 <italic>β</italic> to be interpretable, we employed a piecewise constant model for 
 <italic>β</italic>. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205889.g001">Fig 1</xref>, we divide the epidemic into five different phases [Days 0–111, 112–188, 189–314, 315–426 (or 315–503) and 427– (or 504–), where Day 0 is 2 January 2012]. The phases were originally determined by eyeball; in each phase, referring to the rubella case counts, we determined that the qualitative pattern is approximated by the piecewise-liner model on the exponential scale with five knots. Seasonality of rubella during pre-vaccination era has not been objectively identified in Japan, and we did not employ any unsupported mathematical functional form for the transmissibility. In the first phase, only a small number of cases, as seen in other years, were observed. Phases (ii) and (iii) were increasing and decreasing phases in 2012, and phases (iv) and (v) were increasing and decreasing phases in 2013, respectively. In Tokyo, an additional time phase of a “sustained” period was considered between (iv) and (v). That is, in Tokyo, we employed phases (iv), (sustained) and (v) from Days 315–426, 427–552 and 553–, respectively. In Osaka, phases (iv) and (v) were considered from Days 315–503 and 504–, respectively. According to that pattern, we divided prefectures into two groups, i.e., those associated with Tokyo and Osaka, and Osaka group included Fukui, Gifu, Mie, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, Saga and Okinawa, and remainders belonged to Tokyo group. The initial count of cases in Tokyo and Osaka at Day 0 was 5, and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>,0

 <italic>S</italic>

  <italic>i</italic>,0
 </sub> was assumed as 
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, where 
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the fraction susceptible in the beginning of the epidemic, assumed as 1/6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0205889.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (close to an inverse of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, the basic reproduction number, that represents the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a fully susceptible population, which yields the herd immunity threshold, and allow 
 <italic>β</italic> to scale the reproduction number), and 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>

 <italic>i</italic> (

 </sub> − 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>,0
 </sub> − 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>,0
 </sub>). Unknown parameters would then be 
 <italic>β</italic> for each phase and space (i.e., six parameters for Tokyo and five parameters for Osaka). Because 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> = 1 (i.e. the normalized system), the estimates are also interpreted as the effective reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>, which indicates the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case.
