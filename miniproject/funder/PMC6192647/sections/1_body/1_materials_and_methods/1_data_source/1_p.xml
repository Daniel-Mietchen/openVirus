<p>As a notifiable disease in Japan, it is obligatory for rubella to be reported to public health centers and then to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo. Clinical diagnosis rests on the triad of rash, swollen lymph node and fever. We examined the weekly rubella notification data from 2012 to 2013 across all age groups by 47 prefectures.</p>
