<p>Hereafter, the “spatial vaccination” represents a theoretical vaccination scheme that geographically prioritizes urban prefectures with a large population size. Using the parameterized metapopulation model, the effectiveness of spatial vaccination was explored. Specifically, we examined scenarios in which a susceptible fraction among the total population can be vaccinated and reduced by 1%, 3% and 5%, the values of which are in line with the actual amount of vaccines to be potentially secured. These values were examined as the population with these coverages would still remain to be below the epidemic threshold. The vaccine was assumed to elicit all-or-nothing effect and the vaccine efficacy was assumed to be 100% [

In our scenario analysis, the total amount of vaccines was pre-fixed in each scenario and assumed to be distributed to different prefectures in advance of the 2012 epidemic. In one scenario, the total volume of vaccines was distributed to Tokyo only. In another scenario, vaccines were distributed to Tokyo and Osaka only. According to the rank of prefectural population size, we varied the number of prefectures to which vaccines are allocated. To do so, we assumed that vaccinated prefectures increase in a descending order of the rank of population size (i.e. prefectures with bigger population sizes were prioritized for vaccination). The most evenly distributed scenario was to equally cover all 47 prefectures.
