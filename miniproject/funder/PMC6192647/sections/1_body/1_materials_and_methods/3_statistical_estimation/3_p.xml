<p>A total of 11 parameters for 
 <italic>β</italic> were estimated by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, by employing a flat prior distribution and a particle filtering method as well as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In this instance, the posterior distribution is informed primarily for each chain by the likelihood based on particle filtering (or equivalently sequential Monte Carlo approximation) [

 </sub>) is used as priors in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The Monte Carlo estimation algorithm is employed for estimating the posterior distribution. This “nested” Monte Carlo approach is referred to as the particle MCMC method, proposed by Andrieu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0205889.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; the method was recently applied to estimate the age-depth relationship of the Dome Fuji ice core in Antarctica [
 <xref rid="pone.0205889.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To avoid massive rejection of nearly all proposals due to high values of likelihood by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, we employ parallel tempering (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0205889.s001">S1 Text</xref> for details of parallel tempering). Parallel tempering supplements local configurational Metropolis moves with global “swap” moves that update an entire set of configurations, thereby controlling the tails of posterior distribution. We set the annealing temperature, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>pt</sub>, the extent by which likelihood exploration is determined, i.e., to be 16, 32 and 64, among which the value 32 was taken as default. We performed 4,653 + 40,000 iterations of the run of MCMC algorithm. The first 4,653 iterations were discarded as the burn-in period. The convergence of the MCMC is judged by Gelman-Rubin criterion (GRC) [

 <xref rid="pone.0205889.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]: each track of the MCMC chain was split into five sub-chains and the GRC was estimated for each parameter. A GRC value close to 1 (conventionally less than 1.1) was regarded as the signature of convergence, and the optimal annealing temperature was selected by GRC.
