<p id="JVEv5-para-0067">HBV care is ‘neglected’ compared to HCV in terms of treatment and, in addition, there is still limited recognition of the illness. There are several reasons why. First, the greatest HBV morbidity and mortality is found in low- and middle-income countries. In many of these countries HIV had been a major contributor to morbidity and mortality until the development of good coverage of antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, with the advent of DAAs, HCV has become a treatable condition; however, HBV has been left behind. Second, there is no community movement, as there was with HIV, to bring the condition into the spotlight. Civil society is very important for creating advocacy and raising awareness. With the availability of DAAs, this awareness has increased for HCV, although mostly led by drug company treatment campaigns rather than by the affected community. Third, HBV testing needs to be more accessible and cost barriers need to be reduced. HBV monitoring is also difficult with many different steps. Additionally, the timely use of HBV vaccination at birth is a challenge in certain countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where coverage is around 10%.</p>
