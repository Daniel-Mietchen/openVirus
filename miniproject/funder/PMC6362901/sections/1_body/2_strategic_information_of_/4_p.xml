<p id="JVEv5-para-0014">In Athens (Greece), a fast-track intervention to seek-test-link-treat PWIDs has been established, based on a programme established during an outbreak of HIV among persons who inject drugs 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>. Athens accounts for 8700 high-risk drug users, of whom 2450 had actively injected in the past 30 days 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Harm-reduction programmes with opioid substitution therapy (OST) and needle syringe programmes (NSP) are in place, but waiting times are long. In addition, DAAs have been available without restriction since September 2018. However, they are only accessed by a small percentage of PWIDs. The current programme is used to increase diagnosis and treatment for HCV and HIV infection among PWIDs. Chain-referral sampling is used to bring individuals into care (a single individual from a target population is invited and requested to invite three other recruits from their network) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. A combination of rapid identification, fibroscans and biochemical testing are used in a single visit to avoid losing individuals in the care cascade (

In addition, PWIDs are assigned a peer-navigator, who accompanies them to their first liver or infectious diseases clinic appointment. Similarly to Iceland, a national HCV treatment registry is used to monitor progress and to improve linkage to care.
