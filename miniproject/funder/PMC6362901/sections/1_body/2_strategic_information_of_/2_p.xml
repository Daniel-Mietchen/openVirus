<p id="JVEv5-para-0012">Georgia is another country that has successes in eliminating viral hepatitis. There is a high prevalence of HCV infection (5.4% of adults have HCV) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Since 2015, an HCV elimination programme has been in place, based on six main principles: (1) advocacy, awareness and education, and partnerships for HCV-associated resources; (2) HCV transmission reduction; (3) identification of those with HCV; (4) HCV laboratory diagnostics; (5) HCV care and treatment; and (6) HCV surveillance. The programme receives funding from the Global Fund, and is constantly evolving to meet the beneficiaries' needs. Georgia uses an integrated approach by combining testing protocols and care for HIV, TB and HCV. By integrating viral hepatitis care into existing platforms, costs are reduced. To improve coverage and maximise the number of the target population, Georgia decentralises HCV-related services. This improves accessibility for persons living in rural areas. In addition, primary healthcare workers and non-specialised settings near patients' homes are involved in the management of uncomplicated HCV cases.
