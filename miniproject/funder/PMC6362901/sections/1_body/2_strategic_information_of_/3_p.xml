<p id="JVEv5-para-0013">Iceland is also leading in elimination and, according to mathematical models, could potentially reach the WHO elimination targets by 2020 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A nationwide programme has been established, Treatment as Prevention for Hepatitis C (TraP HepC), where universal access to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is combined with intensified screening and harm-reduction efforts. One central virology laboratory serves the entire country and reports all new HCV infections directly to a national HCV registry. Emphasis is on early case finding and treatment of high-risk groups such as persons who inject drugs (PWID) and prisoners, as well as patients with advanced liver disease. Using the treatment-as-prevention (TasP) approach, previously described as a good tool for HIV prevention and described as effective for HCV, the aim is to not only offer a cure to patients but also to reduce the domestic HCV incidence by 80% prior to the WHO elimination goals for 2030 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">[11â€“13]</xref>. The programme has already resulted in a major decrease of HCV prevalence among key risk groups such as PWID and prisoners.
