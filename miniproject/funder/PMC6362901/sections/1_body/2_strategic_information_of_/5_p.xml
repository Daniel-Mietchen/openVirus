<p id="JVEv5-para-0057">In the United States the Veterans Administration (VA) uses Lean as a strategic methodology to improve HCV care (
 <xref rid="JVEv5-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Lean is a business methodology that promotes the flow of value (care) to the customer (patient), through continuous improvement, and increases access to information to ensure responsible decision-making. Currently, 8.9 million veterans receive VA care, and the VA leadership has identified HCV as a priority. ‘Hepatitis Innovation Teams’ (HIT) were installed at each hospital, comprising doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, research nurses, clerks and system redesign personnel. Their aim is to improve HCV care by redesigning care and the delivery processes with the lean methodology, which makes it feasible to measure improvements in variability, access, quality of HCV care and problems with HCV screening. Each year, the HIT leadership teams set national goals for HCV testing rates and treatment rates. In addition, they have constructed HCV dashboards, where providers have clear ‘real-time’ access to patient data. Moreover, HITs established different testing interventions such as: clinical reminders; reflex HCV-RNA testing; performance indicators for healthcare executives; and multimedia marketing. Special programmes are focused on at-risk groups by educating and partnering with mental health and substance use treatment providers and homeless stand-downs. Challenges are that many of the remaining untreated patients have barriers to receiving treatment, such as homelessness, substance use, refusal of treatment, other co-morbidities (e.g. cancer), or do not use VA services at this time.
