<p id="JVEv5-para-0007">Several reasons have been postulated as to the lack of funding for viral hepatitis. First, there is limited knowledge about the high cost of the viral hepatitis epidemic that will continue to grow in future years if current trends in testing and treatment continue. Reaching the 2030 elimination targets by increasing testing and treatment can, however, stop these increasing costs. In fact, achieving viral hepatitis elimination will produce a positive return on investment by 2028 from savings due to the removal of indirect cost associated with viral hepatitis

Egypt for instance is currently undertaking massive screening programmes for HCV, but has built into this screening for multiple diseases including HBV, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. In the first 20 days in October, over 4 million people were screened with 140,000 HCV cases detected; as well as more than 1 million cases of obesity and 20,000 diabetic patients were identified.
