The cascade of care for HBV and HCV showed that one of the major difficulties on the road to elimination is finding the missing millions affected by the illnesses. While Egypt was very successful in treating all known individuals with HBV and HCV, there were many who were undiagnosed and massive testing programmes were needed to identify the missing millions

Subsequently, the lack of polymerase chain reaction machines created the next bottle neck, limiting the number of specimens that could be tested. To solve the capacity problem, a change to diagnosis and screening using point-of-care tests was made. This allowed decentralised testing using mobile units and local testing sites, tackling the issue region by region rather the whole country at once.
