<p id="JVEv5-para-0060">In Rwanda, there is a strong political will to eliminate hepatitis, due to the higher mortality from viral hepatitis than from HIV. The Rwandan government supported hepatitis elimination programmes by allocating $9 million and obtained support from the Global Fund. HBV and HCV prevalence is estimated to vary around 3.1–4.5% and 4.6–8.9%, respectively (total population of 12 million) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. HIV programmes form a successful model for service delivery and platforms for testing (viral load and genotyping). Therefore, hepatitis screening services have been successfully integrated into existing HIV care. In addition, DAAs are freely available. In Rwanda, 280,000 individuals were tested, 9000 patients were treated, and television and radio were used to target individuals aged 45 and older for hepatitis testing to reach the missing millions.
