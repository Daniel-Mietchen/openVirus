<p id="JVEv5-para-0062">A good insight into country-specific epidemics is essential as a baseline for the development of testing approaches. The HCV epidemic in Canada, for instance, is concentrated around birth cohorts and most people are unaware of their risk. Targeted testing in birth cohorts, therefore, would be a perfect strategy, although this would be an insufficient strategy in Egypt, where HCV exists among the whole population. Solely testing the birth cohort results in many undiagnosed infections, so screening programmes should be implemented more widely. By contrast, in Australia, former and current PWIDs are aware of their infection but unaware of the availability of curative DAAs. This does not require a testing programme but linkage to care. Mathematical models can help to identify the most cost-effective testing strategy
