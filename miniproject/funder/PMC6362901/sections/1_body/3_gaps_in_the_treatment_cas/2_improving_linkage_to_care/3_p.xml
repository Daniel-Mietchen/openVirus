<p id="JVEv5-para-0065">In the Netherlands, linkage to care for high-risk groups was one of the major challenges (
 <xref rid="JVEv5-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the community generated innovative ideas. New HCV infections are concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">[35,36]</xref> while new cases of HCV among PWIDs are very low: in 2016 there were 44 cases in MSM with fewer than five associated with injection drug use 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Since 2015, DAAs have become available without restriction, which resulted in a decline in incidence of 70% among MSM 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0011" ref-type="bibr">[11,38]</xref>. However, re-infections are still high and predominantly related to the involvement of MSM in high-risk sexual activities (including chemsex). MSM are, therefore, the key group for interventions. Currently, innovative harm-reduction strategies are used in close collaboration with the community to achieve HCV elimination. NoMoreC is a good example of a community platform where MSM educate other MSM on HCV and safe sex. In addition, play-safe toolboxes can be ordered as well as free HCV home tests, based on dry bloodspot testing 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The aim of this platform is to increase awareness and knowledge, encourage regular and timely testing, and offer tailored advice to MSM to reduce their risk of acquiring HCV
