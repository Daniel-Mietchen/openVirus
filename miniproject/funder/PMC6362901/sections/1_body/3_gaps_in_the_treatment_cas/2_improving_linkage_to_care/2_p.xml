<p id="JVEv5-para-0064">Several minorities also face linkage-to-care issues, often due to stigmatisation and low political commitment. This results in limited service penetration and a lack of engagement of healthcare providers. In the UK for example, homeless persons, are estimated to be 50 times more likely to have chronic HCV infection, but only 3% receive treatment 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. PWIDs also have difficulties in finding health care, which is a significant barrier in linkage to care. There is also a lack of specialised services and programmes for younger people who would particularly benefit from earlier treatment and care. Currently, only Egypt has a testing and treatment programme for adolescents, and more countries should advocate for treatment programmes among this age group. Calling attention to marginalised populations is appropriate since HBV and HCV are often the result of poor healthcare and a problem for civil society as a whole. Public education can build awareness of the burden of disease and linkage to liver cancer to promote greater advocacy by civil society to call on political leaders to commit national resources to HCV and HBV elimination.
