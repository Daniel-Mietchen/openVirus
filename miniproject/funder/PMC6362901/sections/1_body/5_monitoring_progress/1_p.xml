<p id="JVEv5-para-0068">Monitoring progress is an important element in the elimination effort to ascertain if interventions, such as vaccination programmes and other prevention efforts are being effective, whether testing is increasing, and if those testing positive are being linked to care as necessary. Without monitoring, progress cannot be measured, and the impact of the epidemic cannot be understood. WHO recommend three elements for surveillance and 10 core indicators 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. For surveillance: (1) enhanced case reporting of acute hepatitis describes incidence trends and identifies who acquire hepatitis; (2) biomarker surveys generate reliable population-based estimates of the prevalence, preferably by age; and (3) sequelae surveillance captures mortality from viral statistics and the attributable fraction describes mortality trend 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Cascade monitoring relies on aggregated or individual data. If it is not possible to obtain new data, existing data can be extrapolated to provide working estimates to allow the establishment of elimination programmes.
