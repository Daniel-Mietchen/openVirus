<p>The disease dynamics in the ED, in particular, have a high influence over the whole healthcare outbreak (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-02936-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) shows that fast increase in the sizes of the epidemics would follow from the increase in the transmission rates in the ED. Consistently, they would also increase with the increase in the length of stay in the ED (or equivalently to the decrease in the transition rates out of the ED to the ICU, hospital wards, or isolation). Moreover, they increase with the rates of becoming symptomatic due to the isolation of symptomatic infectious patients, in general, and out of the ED, in particular; noting that asymptomatic patients are still infectious but to a lesser degree. Additionally, increasing the relative reduction of infectiousness from the HCWs to patients may be due to the lack of gloves and gowns, would increase the sizes of the epidemics. Sensitivity analysis shows also that the sizes of the epidemics of patients, HCWs, and mobile HCWs are less sensitive to parameters other than those related to the ED and some disease-specific parameters. In other words, changes less than 1% in the values of the latter parameters are sufficient to increase the sizes of the epidemics by 1%.
