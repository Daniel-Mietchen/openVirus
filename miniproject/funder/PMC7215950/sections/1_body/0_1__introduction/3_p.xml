<p>The objective of this work is to mathematically model MERS-CoV transmission between several hospital wards using parameters and data from the King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh (KAMC-R), Saudi Arabia. Modelling will provide insights into healthcare transmission and parameters that may be most influential in reducing future hospital outbreaks. Data from the 102-day long healthcare MERS-CoV outbreak that occurred in King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh (KAMC-R), Saudi Arabia from June to August 2015 was used to calibrate the mathematical model. </p>
