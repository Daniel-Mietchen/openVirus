<p>MERS-CoV infections can be asymptomatic/mild for some patients but fatal to those with respiratory and/or comorbid conditions. The incubation period ranges from 2–13 days with a median of 5 days. MERS-CoV presents as a combination of non-specific symptoms such as cough, fever (≥38 °C), dyspnea, diarrhea, and vomiting [

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define two categories of laboratory tests used to detect MERS-CoV: (1) molecular tests, which look for active infection; and (2) serology tests, which look for previous infection [

Most, if not all hospitals, use real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays to define a confirmed case following CDC’s standard. The CDC recommends conducting multiple tests on each patient. A single negative rRT-PCR would classify a patient as under investigation, or as a possible case. A second negative would classify the patient as MERS negative [

The Saudi Ministry of Health has adopted strict case definitions for the hospitals and created a wave of auditing and inspections to the hospitals to ensure compliance with infection control practices to prevent further healthcare outbreaks.
