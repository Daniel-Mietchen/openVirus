<p>DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV transmission mainly occur in urban and periurban areasâ€”usually consisting of large and heterogeneous districts. National programme managers, district health, and control programme staff urgently require a tool that identifies priority areas for action, particularly where the interventions should start, and ideally includes a rapid diagnostic test to distinguish between the different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases. In the presence of predictive outbreak alarms, a method to focus interventions spatially in a targeted fashion would likely increase the efficiency of available resources. Indeed, the absence of such a tool is a major concern often expressed by national programme managers; after receiving an alarm signal at the district health office, staff need clear guidance on where to intervene with early response actions, particularly for highly focal vector control measures such as fogging.
