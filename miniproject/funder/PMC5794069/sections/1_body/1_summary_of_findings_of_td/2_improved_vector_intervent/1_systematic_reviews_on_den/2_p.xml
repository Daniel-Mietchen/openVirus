<p>When data were not appropriate for meta-analysis, single interventions have been described in systematic reviews elsewhere that address peridomestic space spraying [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further work has been completed on the effectiveness of pyriproxyfen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and work on indoor residual house spraying (IRS), including targeted indoor spraying, is under way. In summary, these results indicate that as single, standalone interventions, these approaches are efficient; however, little evidence exists with respect to reduction of disease incidence.
