<p>A summary of the published literature to-date can be described as follows: (1) Vector control can be effective against 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations; (2) Effectiveness against transmission has been reported in a minority of robust study designsâ€”implementation remains an issue; (3) Single interventions may be largely ineffective with respect to disease reduction in the community; (4) Complex interventions have proven very effective at reducing vector abundance as part of community-based campaigns; (5) Early vector control implementation prior to outbreaks would likely have greater impact at mitigating dengue cases; (6) Methodologically rigorous studies are required to contribute further evidence towards effective vector control strategies.
