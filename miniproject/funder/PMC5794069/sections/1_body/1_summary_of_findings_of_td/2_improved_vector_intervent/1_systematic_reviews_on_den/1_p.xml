<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] evaluated the evidence of the effectiveness of vector control interventions in (a) reducing vector indices and (b) preventing dengue transmission. The searches covered all major indexing databases throughout the period 1980â€“January 2013. The primary outcome was dengue incidence with secondary outcomes comprising a number of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> indices (e.g., Breteau Index, House Index, Container Index, mosquito adults per person, pupae per person); analyses were stratified by study design, intervention, and measures of effect and outcome. The main findings of the meta-analysis were: (1) moderate evidence that house screening can reduce vector abundance and emerging evidence that it reduces dengue transmission; (2) strong evidence that community-based campaigns can impact vector abundance, with emerging evidence for impact on transmission; and (3) no robust studies on the impact of fogging on transmission, with only one study showing an impact on 
 <italic>Aedes albopticus</italic>. The only evidence to-date of effectiveness in preventing dengue transmission is in the form of house screening; the meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the odds of dengue incidence among households with screens (three studies, pooled odds ratio: 0.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.05, 0.93]) compared to unscreened homes. These findings are corroborated by new investigations of screening in Mexico, which have shown window and door screens to be a popular and widely-adopted intervention that can significantly reduce domestic infestations of
