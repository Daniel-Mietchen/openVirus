<p>The research programme labelled “eco-bio-social research” in five Asian and five Latin American countries has, in its first phase, identified the complexity of determinants for vector breeding [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and, in its second phase, identified innovative vector control interventions delivered through partnership models including vector control services, communities, and others. The interventions included protection from adult vectors through insecticide-treated window curtains or screens and/or targeting productive oviposition sites (i.e., in those container types which produce more than 70% of all

 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While the intervention packages including treated window curtains were all able to reduce vector densities significantly, reduction of dengue incidence could not be used as an end-point measure due to relatively small intervention clusters. In settlements with rather compact houses (i.e., houses with few or no openings additional to windows and doors) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] the effect of fixed window screens with insecticide-treated netting materials seemed to have an even stronger and longer–lasting effect, and are well accepted and affordable if certain cost-saving strategies are introduced [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Cost savings are expected to occur with the massive industrial production of window screens, the increased demand by the middle and upper classes, and by the use of cheaper materials (wooden rather than aluminum frames).
