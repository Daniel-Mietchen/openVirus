<p>A systematic literature review [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] examined the published evidence investigating associations between vector indices and dengue cases. After assessment of the epidemiological study designs, all but three of the 18 studies were classified as methodologically weak. Heterogeneity among spatial/temporal sampling and analyses was high, perhaps demonstrating an absence of standardization for conducting such research. Of the 13 studies that investigated associations between vector indices and dengue cases, 4 reported positive correlations, 4 found no correlation, and 5 reported ambiguous or unreliable associations. Of the 7 studies that measured the Breteau Index, 6 reported dengue transmission at levels below the widely used threshold of 5.
