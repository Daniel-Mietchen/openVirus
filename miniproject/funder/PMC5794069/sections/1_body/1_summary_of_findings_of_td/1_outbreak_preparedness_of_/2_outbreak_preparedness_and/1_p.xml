<p>A range of variables that either indicate risk of forthcoming dengue transmission or predict dengue outbreaks have been suggested throughout the literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The combination of these variables, or alarm indicators, for use in early warning systems is the next natural step. An Early Warning and Response System (EWARS) has since been developed following a period of retrospective country dataset analysis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005967.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This recent research has also included the development of a “staged” response system, which gradually introduces greater intervention resources in response to increasing certainty of forthcoming outbreaks. The outbreak warning system (EWS)—a combination of statistical (STATA) and database management (Microsoft Excel) software—will be freely available via the publication
