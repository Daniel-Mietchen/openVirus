<p>Laboratory diagnosis of dengue is currently done either by detecting the virus or its components (viral RNA by PCR, or antigens like NS1) or by detecting immune response by serological tests. A “confirmed case” requires either virus isolation, RNA detection, antigen detection, seroconversion for IgM, or a 4-fold rise in IgG titres; IgM positivity is considered highly suggestive. The timing of testing is critical, considering that both viraemia and NS1 are confined to the first week of illness, and IgM production is transient (lasting 5–6 months), while IgG lasts longer [

However, the combination of PCR or NS1 ELISA plus IgM ELISA appears to accurately identify &gt;90% of primary and secondary dengue cases from a single serum specimen collected during the first 10 days of illness [

While operationally and financially demanding, laboratory confirmation is important, both for clinical management and outbreak identification: it increases the specificity of the information captured by the surveillance system, contributes to syndromic surveillance (e.g., increased numbers of laboratory requests), and may generate serotype- or genotype-specific data as a potential additional outbreak alarm signal.
