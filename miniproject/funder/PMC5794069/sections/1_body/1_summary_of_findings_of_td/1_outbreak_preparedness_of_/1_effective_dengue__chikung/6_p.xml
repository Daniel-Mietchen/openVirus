<p>One question is whether and how what we know about dengue outbreak detection can be applied to Zika and chikungunya. For dengue, we have years of historical incident case data and can construct an “endemic channel.” We do not have this information for the other two, which have so far occurred in naïve populations; therefore, syndromic and sentinel-based approaches seem the best option at this point in time until comprehensive, historic datasets become available.</p>
