<p>Syndromic surveillance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (developed as an additional, often context-specific tool for early outbreak alert) is not limited only to clinical syndromes but may include increased numbers of school absenteeism, increased laboratory requests—as described above—or an increased proportion of positive laboratory results in the inter-epidemic period. These alarm signals can be then integrated into a risk assessment tool (see below). Indeed, enhanced surveillance should aim to combine tools that complement routine reporting, not to replace it [
