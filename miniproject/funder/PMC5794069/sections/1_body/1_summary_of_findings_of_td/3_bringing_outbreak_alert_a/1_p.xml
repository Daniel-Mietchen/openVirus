<p>Based on the above-mentioned research findings on (1) outbreak preparedness of dengue epidemics and (2) improved vector control interventions to control 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>–borne disease transmission, we identified the complementary relationship of the two components. With this in mind we aim to develop a comprehensive intervention package including a) tools for use during the inter-epidemic period—including window screening and community-based campaigns and b) additional interventions for stepwise outbreak response following timely alerts of defined levels. This will require further research (
