<p>According to the available data on successes of house screening in reducing indoor and outdoor vector densities—as well as some evidence to suggest an impact on transmission—house screening seems to be a promising measure to limit the transmission of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne arboviral infections, provided suitable house structure, coverage, acceptability, and sustainability. Additionally, evidence exists in support of complex community-based campaigns to reduce the circulating 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population suggesting that these can directly translate into an impact on disease transmission, although further studies are required.
