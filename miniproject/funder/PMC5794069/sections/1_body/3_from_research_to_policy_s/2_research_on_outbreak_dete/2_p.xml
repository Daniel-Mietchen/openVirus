<p>Vector surveillance data (generally larval/pupal surveys) are frequently captured using non-standardised methods. These data are often used for monitoring the success of an intervention rather than generating time-series data to monitor fluctuations in vector abundance. Furthermore, adult mosquito data are not routinely captured and less so investigated for the presence/absence of viruses. Together, these factors have limited the predictive ability of vector dynamics for epidemic transmission and contribute to the lack of evidence of a correlation between vector density and disease incidence. A transition to capturing adult mosquito data may be a better option. Moreover, establishing the number of adult mosquitos positive for virus will enable the production of fine spatial scale risk maps for targeting of interventions.</p>
