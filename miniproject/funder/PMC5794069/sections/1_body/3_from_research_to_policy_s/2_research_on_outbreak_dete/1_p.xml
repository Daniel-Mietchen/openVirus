<p>The technical handbook for contingency planning, along with the operational guide describing the steps of establishing the EWARS at national, state, or even district level are being considered by several ministries of health. The first year of implementation, monitoring, and evaluation will be crucial to understanding the benefits and limitations of this system. The feedback will influence the direction of the EWARS, whether it can be recommended for general use or whether further adaptations are necessary.</p>
