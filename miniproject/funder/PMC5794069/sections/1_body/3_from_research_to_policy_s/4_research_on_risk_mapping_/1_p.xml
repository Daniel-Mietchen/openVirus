<p>A shift away from global risk maps (which show the burden of dengue and other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases in countries and regions) towards fine-scale risk maps (which visualize, for operational purposes, the infection risk at sub-district level called “localities” or “health areas” or “PHC areas,” etc.) is required to better focus vector control interventions. The addition of fine-scale variables, such as adult mosquito abundance and entomo-virological parameters, will facilitate this process. Human movement and contact-tracing studies are also crucial to understand the role of human behaviour in the transmission of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases (see also Vazquez-Prokopec (2017) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005967.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). Finally, studying the impact upon prevailing herd immunity of newly introduced vaccines becomes now a necessary addition. Together, such advancements will enable national control services to focus and prioritise areas for intervention, both in-between and during epidemic periods.
