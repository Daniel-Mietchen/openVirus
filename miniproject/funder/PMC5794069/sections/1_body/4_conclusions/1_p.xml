<p>Research into the three above-mentioned areas is essential. The combination of early warning systems, improved vector control, and spatial mapping is expected to increase substantially the efficiency of the limited resources countries can afford. Further research is required to bring these three areas together, some of which is already underway. The use of both community-based and public-sector approaches will empower populations at risk, reduce the per-capita cost of interventions, build sustainability, and increase the impact of vector control interventions.</p>
