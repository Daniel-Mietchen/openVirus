<p>As dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika viruses (ZIKV) continue to spread worldwide, there is an ever-increasing need to develop and apply cost-effective, evidence-based approaches to identify and respond to arboviral disease outbreaks. Outbreak response should be timely (i.e., early enough to prevent the epidemic spread of the virus), coordinated among multiple stakeholders, and should make use of existing vector control interventions against
