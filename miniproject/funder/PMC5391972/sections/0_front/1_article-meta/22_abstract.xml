 <p>Pathogens such as HIV can evolve rapidly when the environment changes. One important aspect of a pathogenâ€™s environment is the probability that an infectious contact (a sneeze for a respiratory disease, or an unprotected sex act for a sexually transmitted disease) encounters an uninfected person and thus has a chance to transmit the pathogen. As an epidemic grows the number of uninfected people shrinks, changing evolutionary pressures on the pathogen. While researchers have used models to explore pathogen evolution during epidemics, their models usually neglect important processes such as people entering and leaving sexual partnerships. We compared several evolutionary models for HIV that include partnership dynamics as well as sexual contact outside of stable partnerships. Models of intermediate complexity predicted lower virulence midway through the epidemic (a minimum of 15 years to progress to AIDS) than either more realistic models or simple models with no partnership structure (both with a minimum of 7.25 years to progress to AIDS), because random sexual contacts tended to wash out the effects of stable partnerships. Researchers trying to predict the evolution of pathogens must try to understand the implications of their modeling choices; models of intermediate complexity may not produce intermediate conclusions.</p>
