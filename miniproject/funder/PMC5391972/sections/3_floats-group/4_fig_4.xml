  <title>Univariate distributions of summary statistics.</title>
  <p>Models arranged in order of complexity, as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g003">Fig 3</xref>. For every simulation, three summary statistics are shown: peak time, maximum mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL, and equilibrium mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL. Peak time is the time at which the SPVL reaches its maximum for each simulation run (maximum mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL). Equilibrium mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL is taken by taking the mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL value at 
   <italic>t</italic> = 4000. Because the distribution of equilibrium mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL (lower left panel) for the random-mixing model is very narrow, it has been replaced by a point in order to preserve the vertical axis scaling.
