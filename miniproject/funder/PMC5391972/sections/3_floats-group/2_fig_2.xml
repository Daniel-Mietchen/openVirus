  <title>Model contact structures.</title>
  <p>Schematic representations of models with explicit contact structure. Top row (a,b) shows models with instantaneous partnership formation; bottom row (c,d) shows those where individuals remain single for some period of time between partnerships. Left column (a,c) shows models with within-partnership transmission only; in these models transmission can only occur within serodiscordant partnerships, and serodiscordant partnerships can only be formed by dissolution and reformation of partnerships. Right column (b,d) shows models that allow extra-pair and uncoupled transmission. 
   <italic>Solid arrows</italic> represent infection transitions; 
   <italic>dotted arrows</italic> represent partnership dissolution and formation; 
   <italic>dashed arrows</italic> show influences on infection rate, including both within-pair transmission (blue) and extra-pair/uncoupled transmission (red). In addition to these models, we also use random-mixing and implicit models with only 
   <italic>S</italic> and 
   <italic>I</italic> compartments and heterogeneous models where each compartment is subdivided by sexual activity rate (of both partners, in the case of partnership compartments).
