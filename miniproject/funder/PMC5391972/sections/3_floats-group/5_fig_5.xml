  <title>Pairs plot: bivariate relationships among summary statistics for each model structure.</title>
  <p>The three summary statistics for each simulation are plotted against each other in order to visualize the relationship among the summary statistics and to help compare models. Surprisingly, the implicit model, an approximation for instantaneous partnership formation model (instswitch), shows an almost identical trend with a model that has pair formation dynamics (pairform). The 
   <italic>dashed line</italic> in the equilibrium vs. peak virulence plot (lower left) shows the 1:1 line, where equilibrium and peak virulence are equal. To avoid too much overplotting, only 10% of the parameter sets (randomly sampled) are shown here.
