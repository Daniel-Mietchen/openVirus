  <title>Envelopes of virulence trajectories (population mean log
   <sub>10</sub> SPVL) under all models.
  </title>
  <p>Panels are arranged in order of complexity of contact structure, from “random” (least complex) to “hetero” (most complex). All models were run until 
   <italic>t</italic> = 4000 years using parameters from 1000 Latin hypercube samples to illustrate the range of possible dynamics. Envelopes contain the middle 95% of trajectories (i.e. we select all points between the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles for each model at each year), while center lines show mean trajectories. Truncated series (up to year 800) are shown here.
