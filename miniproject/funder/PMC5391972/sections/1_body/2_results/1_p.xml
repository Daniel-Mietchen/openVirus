<p>Our simplifications of Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reproduce its qualitative behaviour—in particular, its predictions of virulence dynamics—reasonably well. As we calibrate the parameters to achieve initial epidemic growth rates 
 <italic>r</italic> ranging from 0.042 year
 <sup>−1</sup> to 0.084 year
 <sup>−1</sup> (the former value matching the initial rate of increase in prevalence in Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s full model) the initial trajectory of increasing virulence brackets the rate from the original model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). For matching initial growth rates (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.042) the peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL occurs at the same time (≈ 200 years) but the peak virulence is lower than Shirreff’s (≈ 4.3 vs. ≈ 4.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL), as is equilibrium virulence (≈ 4.25 vs. ≈ 4.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL).
