<p>Bivariate relationships (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g005">Fig 5</xref>) help distinguish the results of different models with similar univariate distributions of dynamical summaries. While the relationship between equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL and peak time is similar for all model structures (top left panel), the other relationships show more variation. In particular, the implicit and pair-formation (without extra-pair contact) models are very similar to each other, but distinct from the other models. We still do not have a convincing explanation for this distinction; we would have expected the implicit model to be most similar to the the instantaneous-switching model without extra-pair contact, which most closely matches its underlying assumptions. However, we note that the implicit model derivation is based on defining the force of infection to match a scaled version of
