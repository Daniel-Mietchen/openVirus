<p>Changing the initial infectious density (
 <italic>I</italic>(0)) has little effect on the virulence trajectory. Decreasing 
 <italic>I</italic>(0) makes SPVL peak slightly later and higher, because it allows a longer exponential-growth phase before the transition to endemic dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g001">Fig 1b</xref>). Decreasing the initial SPVL also leads to progressively later, higher peaks in SPVL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). In this case the delay in the peak is more pronounced than for low 
 <italic>I</italic>(0), because the rate of SPVL increase is eventually limited by the mutation rate. The peak SPVL is actually larger for a lower starting SPVL, presumably because lower SPVL also allows for a longer epidemic phase. However, the peaks are similar across the entire range of initial conditions, because even in the most limited (high-
 <italic>I</italic>(0), high-
 <italic>Î±</italic>(0)) cases HIV can evolve close to its optimal growth-phase SPVL.
