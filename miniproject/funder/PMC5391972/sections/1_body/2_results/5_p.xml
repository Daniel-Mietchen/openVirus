<p>The most striking aspect of the univariate comparisons in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g005">Fig 5</xref>), is the similarity between the results of the least (random-mixing) and the most complex (pair formation with extra-pair contact and pairform+epc with heterogeneity) models. The random-mixing model has the lowest variability, because it is unaffected by uncertainty in pair formation and extra-pair contact parameters, but otherwise the virulence dynamics of these three extreme models are remarkably similar. This phenomenon is driven by the strong effects of extra-pair contact in the model with explicit pair formation and extra-pair contact (“pairform+epc” in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g003">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g006">6</xref>). When individuals spend time uncoupled between partnerships, and when these single individuals can transmit disease to coupled individuals, the resulting unstructured mixing overwhelms the effect of structured mixing within partnerships, leading to mixing that is effectively close to random. Once unstructured mixing is strong, adding realistic heterogeneity of mixing to the model has little effect other than increasing the variability in the outcomes.
