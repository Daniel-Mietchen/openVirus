<p>The random-mixing, pairform+epc, and heterogeneous models all predict high population mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL at the virulence peak (median (95% CI) = 4.7 (4.65-4.79), 4.72 (4.37-4.96), 4.72 (4.09-5.03)). In contrast, the implicit model predicts a much lower peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL value: 3.52 (3-4.02) years. The random-mixing, pairform+epc, and heterogeneous models predict rapid progression to AIDS at the virulence peak (median/95% CI = 6.1 (5.7-6.3), 6.02 (5.04-7.7), 6.03 (4.8-9.2)), while the implicit model predicts minimum progression times about twice as long (12.5 (9.6-15.6) years). The corresponding differences in mean within-couple transmission probability at the peak are even more extreme, about a fourfold difference: 0.249 (0.24-0.26), 0.252 (0.19-0.28), and 0.252 (0.15-0.28) per year for the random and pairform+epc models vs. 0.059 (0.02-0.13) per year for the implicit model.
