<p>For parameters involved in partnership turnover (
 <italic>c</italic> and 
 <italic>œÅ</italic>), the figure again shows differences between models with and without extra-pair contact. Models with extra-pair contact show a gradual decrease in peak time, maximum log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL, and equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL with increasing turnover rates. Increases in the other parameters lead to increases in all three summary statistics. In these models, increased turnover rates diminish the effect of extra-pair contact, thus selecting for lower log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL. For models without extra-pair contact, increased turnover rates decrease the level of structured mixing (mimicking extra-pair contact models), resulting in selection for higher log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL.
