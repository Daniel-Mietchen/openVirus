<p>Surprisingly, once calibration is taken into account, the unscaled parameters have little effect overall. Increase in duration (
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>P</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>D</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>D</italic>
 </sub>) in the primary and disease stages generally decreases the equilibrium virulence, peak virulence, and peak time, although the models with uncoupled mixing and random-mixing model have high, relatively constant values with respect to these parameters. The ratio of extra-pair to within-pair contact (
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>/
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>w</italic>
 </sub>) affects summary statistics in the instantaneous-switching +epc model, but not the pair-formation+epc model (probably because the uncoupled individuals present in the pair-formation+epc model make extra-pair contact by coupled individuals less important). Similarly, increasing the ratio of uncoupled to within-pair contact, 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>u</italic>
 </sub>/
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>w</italic>
 </sub>, increases peak and equilibrium log

 <sup>2</sup> of the number of non-cohabiting sexual partners has much systematic effect in the heterogeneous model.
