<p>Our chosen summary statistics (peak time, maximum mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL, equilibrium mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL, and minimum mean progression time) all vary considerably across models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g004">Fig 4</xref>). We first consider the models of intermediate realism: implicit, instantaneous-switching with and without extra-pair contact, and pair formation without extra-pair contact. Some parameter sets for these models lead to low equilibrium virulence (2.3-3 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL). For these data sets, virulence may either increase from its initial value, reaching an early peak (≈ 200 years) between 3 and 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL and then declining to a lower equilibrium value, or in extreme cases virulence may decline immediately, leading to a peak virulence (as we have defined it) equal to the starting value of 
 <italic>α</italic>(0) = 3 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g005">Fig 5</xref>). At the opposite extreme, parameter sets that produce high equilibrium virulence (4.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL) also produce late peaks (&gt; 200 years) and high peak virulence (5.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL).
