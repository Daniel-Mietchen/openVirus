<p>Finally, incorporating additional realism to the model, i.e. combining heterogeneity with all four basic contact structures or allowing for vital dynamics rather than assuming an SIS model, leads to only small differences in the conclusions stated so far (Fig D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005453.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). Relative to our baseline SIS assumption, the effect of adding vital dynamics is to delay the virulence peak slightly and increase both the peak and equilibrium virulence. The changes are small, however: across all models, the maximum increase in time until the virulence peak is 40 years (for the instswitch+epc model), in the peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL is 0.24 units (instswitch), and in the equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL is 0.4 units (pairform). The changes in the most realistic model (pairform+epc) are considerably smaller: an increase of 2 years vs. a decrease of 13 years in the time to the virulence peak for the models with vital dynamics and heterogeneity, respectively; an increase of 0.1 units vs. a decrease of 0.01 units in peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL; and an increase of 0.145 units vs. a decrease of 0.03 units in equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL. Thus, while we can never rule out the possibility of some higher-order interaction among epidemiological phenomena leading to significant changes in our conclusions, we are reasonably confident that the results reported here are robust to additional complexities.
