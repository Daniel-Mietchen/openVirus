<p>Across the entire range of parameters covered by the Latin hypercube samples, all of our models produce qualitatively similar virulence trajectories, which we quantify in terms of population mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g003">Fig 3</xref>: higher population mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL corresponds to higher virulence). Although the speed of virulence evolution varies, leading to wide variation in the peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL (ranging from 3 to 5.5) because HIV can evolve farther toward its growth-phase optimum before the transition to the endemic phase, virulence peaks between 200 and 300 years in all models.
