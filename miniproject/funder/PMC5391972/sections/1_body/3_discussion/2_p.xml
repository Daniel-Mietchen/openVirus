<p>The restriction of transmission within stable partnerships strongly limits eco-evolutionary dynamics by limiting the maximum speed of epidemic growth. An HIV genotype that optimizes SPVL to maximize the speed of spread in a homogeneous population will be sub-optimal in a context where infection can only spread beyond a partnership once it dissolves. This finding echoes a long line of studies that show that population structure leads to the evolution of “prudent” parasites, although most of these studies focus on equilibrium optima rather than eco-evolutionary dynamics [

The more complex contact structures we modeled mitigate these constraints by allowing HIV to spread among uncoupled individuals (through finite pair-formation) and members of stable partnerships (through extra-pair contact), albeit at lower rates than within partnerships.
