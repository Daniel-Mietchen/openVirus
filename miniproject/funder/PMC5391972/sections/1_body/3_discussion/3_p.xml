<p>Thus, we see the biggest differences not between the simplest and the most complex contact structures, which either ignore pair structure completely or allow for extra-pair contact that reduces its impact, but between the complex contact structures and models of 
 <italic>intermediate</italic> complexity. These intermediate-complexity models attempt, quite reasonably, to add at least some of the realism of human sexual behaviour, but err by neglecting the apparently insignificant detail of extra-pair contact. If partial complexity may lead to such mistakes, how can modelers do anything but always strive to build the most realistic models possible?
