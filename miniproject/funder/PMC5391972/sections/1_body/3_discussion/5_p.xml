<p>In the particular example of HIV virulence eco-evolutionary dynamics and the complexity of contact structures we reach the slightly ironic conclusion that the effort put into building a more realistic model essentially cancels out, putting us back where we started when used a naive random-mixing contact model. However, we are not quite back where we started, as the complex models lead to wider, presumably more realistic confidence intervals on the predictions. In general, unstructured mixing—whether occurring through purely random mixing, or through extra-pair contact and contact among people outside of stable partnerships—tends to drive faster virulence evolution, leading to higher peak virulence and lower times to progression at the peak time.</p>
