<p>Researchers have documented that HIV virulence and set-point viral load are changing, on time scales comparable to those portrayed here (e.g., compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g003">Fig 3</xref> to Herbeck 
 <italic>et al.</italic>â€™s estimated rate of change of 1.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL per century [95% CI -0.1 to 3] [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), and have begun to build relatively realistic models that attempt to describe how interventions such as mass antiretroviral therapy (ART) can be expected to change the trajectory of virulence evolution [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While these efforts are well-intentioned, we caution that structural details that are currently omitted from these models could significantly change their conclusions.
