<p>Parameterization is one of the biggest challenges of epidemiological modeling. In addition to following Champredon 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] by doing Latin hypercube sampling across a wide range of epidemiological parameters, we calibrated each set of parameters to the same initial epidemic growth rate, chosen to match the results of previous models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previous models in this area have drawn their parameters from cohort studies from the 1990s [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] rather than doing any explicit calibration to epidemic curves, but they give reasonable order-of-magnitude growth rates (≈ 0.04 year
 <sup>−1</sup>) for the early stages of the HIV epidemic (although considerably lower than estimates of ≈ 0.07 − 0.1 year
 <sup>−1</sup> based on population genetic reconstructions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). However, our reason for calibrating was not to match any specific observed epidemic, but rather to make sure that we were making meaningful comparisons across a range of models with radically different contact structures, and hence involving different interpretations of the same quantitative parameters. For example, in models with instantaneous switching the partnership dissolution rate 
 <italic>c</italic> is identical to the partnership formation rate; in models with explicit partnership formation, the partnership formation rate is also 
 <italic>c</italic> at equilibrium, but might vary over the course of an epidemic. Models with equal parameters but different structures cannot be compared directly; calibration solves this problem.
