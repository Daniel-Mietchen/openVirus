<p>All models must simplify the world. Many constraints—among them data availability, computation time, and code complexity—drive the need for parsimony, with different constraints applying in different contexts. The critical question that modelers must ask is whether the simplified model gives adequate answers, or whether the simplifications lead to qualitative or quantitative errors. This question is especially important for modelers who are hoping that their conclusions will guide management decisions.</p>
