<p>Taking further steps to make the model even more realistic might add further structure, making the random-mixing model predictions less accurate. For example, our model forms partnerships randomly, and assumes that extra-pair contact is randomly mixing across the population; one could instead model extra-pair contact as arising from multiple concurrent partnerships (some, such as contact with sex workers, of very short duration) and/or more structured partnership formation (by age, ethnicity, or behaviour group). In contrast, the elevated viral load in the early stage of HIV infection, neglected in our model, will likely lead to higher maximum epidemic growth rates and allow more scope for transient viral evolution, although only if extra-pair contact is possible. The effects of other realistic complications such as explicit modeling of two sexes (both in contact structure and differential transmission probabilities), temporal and spatial variation in epidemic processes, or presence of genetic variation in hosts are harder to predict. As mentioned above, our compartmental model already requires tens of thousands of coupled differential equations, which will increase multiplicatively with additional model dimensions such as age, sex, or HIV stage. Thus, further model elaboration will best be done with agent-based models.</p>
