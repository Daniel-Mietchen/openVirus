<p>How contact structures are modeled can strongly affect researchersâ€™ conclusions about the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. In particular, a relatively simple, strategic eco-evolutionary model of HIV can predict peak log
 <sub>10</sub> set-point viral loads (over the course of an epidemic) ranging from 3.5 to 4.8 depending on the specific model of sexual partnership behaviour used. This difference in log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL is epidemiologically significant, corresponding to a twofold difference (12 vs. 6 years) in expected time to progression.
