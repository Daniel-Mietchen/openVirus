<p>More generally, any model that wants to be taken seriously for management and forecasting purposes should be calibrated to 
 <italic>all</italic> available data, using informative priors to incorporate both realistic distributions of uncertainty for all parameters from independent measurements [

Such a procedure would also be an improvement on the common—although not universal—practice, which we have followed here, of assessing uncertainty over uniform ranges rather than using distributions that allow more continuous variation in support over the range of a parameter.
