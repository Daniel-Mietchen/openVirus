<p>The evolution of pathogen virulence (the harm done to the pathogen’s host) has both theoretical and, potentially, practical importance. Evolutionary theory suggests that pathogens with higher reproduction numbers (

 </inline-formula>)—the number of secondary infections caused by a single infected host over the course of its infectious period—will increase in prevalence relative to strains with lower reproductive ratios. Pathogens can increase their reproduction numbers either by increasing their transmission rate, the rate (per infected host) at which they infect new hosts, or by decreasing their clearance or disease-induced mortality rate, the rate at which hosts recover or die from disease. The 
 <italic>trade-off theory</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] postulates that transmission and disease-induced mortality rates are both driven by the rate at which the pathogen exploits host resources for within-host reproduction, and that pathogen evolution will thus strike a balance between the pathogen’s rate of transmission to new hosts and its rate of killing its host (or of provoking the host’s immune system to eliminate it). Some biologists have criticized the tradeoff theory [
