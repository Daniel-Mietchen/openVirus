<p>Many existing models of HIV eco-evolutionary dynamics use implicit models that incorporate the average effects of within-couple sexual contactâ€”without representing the explicit dynamics of partnership formation and dissolution or accounting for extra-pair contact; agent-based formulations are more realistic, but can make it difficult to tease apart the reasons behind particular epidemic phenomena. Here we explore the effects of incorporating explicit contact structure in eco-evolutionary models.</p>
