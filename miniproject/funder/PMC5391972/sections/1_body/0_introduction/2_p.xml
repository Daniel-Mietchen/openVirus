 <italic>et al.</italic> have showed that HIV appears to satisfy the prerequisites of the tradeoff theory. The 
 <italic>set-point viral load</italic> (SPVL: i.e., the characteristic virus load measured in blood during the intermediate stage of infection) is a measurable proxy for the rate of HIV within-host reproduction. Higher viral loads are correlated with faster progression to AIDS (higher virulence). Studies of discordant partnerships—stable sexual partnerships with one infected and one uninfected partner—have shown that SPVL is (1) positively correlated with transmission (people with higher SPVL transmit HIV to their uninfected partners sooner) and (2) heritable (when the uninfected partner does become infected, their SPVL is similar to their originally infected partner’s). Furthermore, the rate of increase in transmission has a decreasing slope as progression time decreases, fulfilling the requirements of the tradeoff theory [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used these data to parameterize mechanistic models of HIV virulence evolution, suggesting that HIV invading a novel population would initially evolve increased virulence, peaking after approximately 100-200 years and then declining slightly to a long-term stable virulence level.
