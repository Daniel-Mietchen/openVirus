<p>Because our main goal is to explore how conclusions about virulence evolution depend on the way in which contact structure is modeled, we consider a series of models with increasing levels of complexity in the contact structure, but simplify some of the other epidemiological processes (such as the within-host life history of HIV). We evaluate our models across a wide range of parameters, using a Latin hypercube design; for each model run, we compute a set of metrics that summarize the evolutionary trajectory of SPVL over the course of the epidemic.</p>
