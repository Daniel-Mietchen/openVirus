<p>We developed seven multi-strain evolutionary models covering a gamut including Champredon 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s relatively realistic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s relatively simple [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] contact structures, each of which is based on different assumptions regarding contact structure and partnership dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the effects of the assumptions of (1) instantaneous vs. non-instantaneous partnership formation; (2) zero vs. positive extra-pair sexual contact and transmission; and (3) homogeneous vs. heterogeneous levels of sexual activity on the evolution of mean log
