<p>Our first four models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g002">Fig 2</xref>) explicitly consider partnership dynamics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The first (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g002">Fig 2d</xref>) assumes non-instantaneous partnership formation (i.e. individuals spend some time uncoupled, outside of partnerships) and consists of five states that are classified by infection status and partnership status; single (uncoupled) susceptible individuals (
 <italic>S</italic>), single infected individuals (
 <italic>I</italic>), concordant negative (susceptible-susceptible) couples (
 <italic>SS</italic>), discordant (susceptible-infected) couples (
 <italic>SI</italic>), and concordant positive (infected-infected) couples (
 <italic>II</italic>). The rates of pair formation are based on the numbers of uncoupled susceptible and infected individuals and the pair-formation rate; partnerships can either dissolve into singletons or be transformed into other types of partnerships by infection of one partner. This model also includes extra-pair contact with both uncoupled individuals and individuals in other partnerships (we denote it “pairform+epc”), so that susceptible uncoupled individuals and susceptible partners in any type of partnership can be infected by infected uncoupled individuals or infected partners in any type of partnership.
