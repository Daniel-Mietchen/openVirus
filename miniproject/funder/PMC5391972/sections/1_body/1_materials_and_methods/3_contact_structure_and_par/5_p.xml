<p>Our third and fourth models, which are intended to bridge the gap between models with fully explicit pair-formation dynamics and the simpler, implicit models used by Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], assume instantaneous partnership formation (“instswitch”). The compartmental structure thus omits the single states 
 <italic>S</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic>, comprising only the three partnered states: 
 <italic>SS</italic>, 
 <italic>SI</italic>, and 
 <italic>II</italic>. Like the first two models, this pair of models differs in their inclusion of extra-pair contact: the third model (“instswitch+epc”, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g002">Fig 2b</xref>) includes extra-pair contact (now only with individuals in other partnerships, since uncoupled individuals do not exist in this model) while the fourth (“instswitch”, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005453.g002">Fig 2a</xref>) only considers within-couple transmission. Although these models can also be implemented by setting the partnership formation rate of the explicit partnership models to a high value (we have tested that both methods in fact produce same results), we model instantaneous partnership formation models independently so that scaling the partnership formation rate during model calibration (see 
 <italic>Simulation runs</italic> below) does not affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics.
