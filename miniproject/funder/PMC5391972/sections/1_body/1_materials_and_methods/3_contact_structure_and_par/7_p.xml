<p>Lastly, we incorporated heterogeneity in sexual activity into the models. Individuals are divided into different risk groups based on their level of sexual activity; we scale all aspects of sexual activity, assuming that sexual activity level in both within- and extra-couple contacts is directly proportional to number of non-cohabiting (extra-couple and uncoupled) partners per year [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005453.s002">S2 Appendix</xref> presents results on the effect of adding heterogeneity to other model variants.) While this model lacks some important elements, such as age-structured mixing patterns, needed for realistic models of HIV transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, it represents a first step toward assessing the effects of epidemiological complexity. As even the models shown here push the limits of compartmental-based models (the heterogeneity model comprises 24530 coupled ordinary differential equations), adding further complexity will probably require a shift to an agent-based model framework, as well as considerable effort in model calibration [
