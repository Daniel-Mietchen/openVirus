<p>For simplicity (and following Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic>), all of our base models use an SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) formulation, where there is no natural mortality (and no explicit introduction of newly sexually active individuals into the susceptible pool). Individuals who die from AIDS are immediately replaced by an individual in the uncoupled-susceptible compartment. While admittedly unrealistic, this approach is reasonable given that (1) the natural mortality rate is low relative to the epidemiological dynamics and (2) the infectious period is long, so that the overall rates of disease-induced mortality and recruitment of newly sexually active individuals would roughly balance. To check the importance of this assumption, we also built models with vital dynamics where individuals dying from AIDS are removed from the population, with constant recruitment rates and constant low 
 <italic>per capita</italic> natural mortality rates; this additional structure had only minor effects on the results.
