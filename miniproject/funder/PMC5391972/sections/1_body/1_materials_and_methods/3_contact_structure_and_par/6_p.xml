<p>The fifth and sixth models represent extreme simplifications of sexual partnership dynamics. The fifth (“implicit”) is an implicit serial monogamy model based on the epidemiological model used by Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a random-mixing model that explicitly tracks only the total number of susceptible and infected individuals. However, to reflect the effect of partnership structure, it uses an adjusted transmission rate derived from an approximation of the basic reproduction number of a serial monogamy model with instantaneous pair formation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The sixth model (“random”) is a simple random-mixing model.
