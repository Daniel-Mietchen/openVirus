<p>Knowing the peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL, timing of the peak log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL/peak virulence, and equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL provides sufficient detail to identify the overall shape of the virulence trajectory. In particular, knowing the timing of the peak virulence (how many years into the epidemic the virulence peaks) can help epidemiologists guess whether the virulence of an emerging pathogen is likely (1) to peak early, possibly even before the pathogen is detected spreading in the population, and decline over the remaining course of the epidemic; (2) to increase, peak, and decline over the foreseeable future; or (3) to increase very slowly, peaking only in the far future. To the extent that our simplistic model for HIV reflects reality, we would take the peak time of 150-300 years (
