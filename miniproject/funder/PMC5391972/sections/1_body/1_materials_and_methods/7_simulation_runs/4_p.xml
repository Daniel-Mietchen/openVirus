<p>For each model we derive the following summary statistics: maximum population mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL; time at which this maximum occurs (corresponding to peak virulenceâ€”this is also the time at which the maximum rate of progression and maximum transmission rate occur); equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL; and minimum expected time to progression. Minimum expected progression time is obtained by applying the Hill function (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005453.e002">eq 2</xref>) to the maximum mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL of each run. Equilibrium log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL is calculated after 4000 years of simulated time. Although most simulations reach equilibrium much earlier than 4000 years, we set this very long time horizon because a small subset of the simulation runs show very slow evolution rates.
