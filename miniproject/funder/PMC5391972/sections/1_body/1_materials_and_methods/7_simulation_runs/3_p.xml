<p>We run each model for each of 1000 parameter sets chosen by Latin hypercube sampling, with fixed starting conditions of mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL of 3.0, standard deviation of log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL of 0.2, and epidemic size of 10
 <sup>−4</sup>. After each run, the initial exponential growth rate is calculated. Then the parameters are scaled as described above so that the initial exponential growth rate is scaled to 0.04 year
 <sup>−1</sup>, a value that approximates the growth rates of Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s original models. When calibrating, we run each model for only 500 years (full simulations are run for 4000 years), which is always long enough to capture the exponential growth phase of the model. We use a 4/5 order Runge-Kutta method (
 <monospace>ode45</monospace> from the 
 <monospace>deSolve</monospace> package [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) for all simulations. (For the heterogeneous model, approximately 10% of the samples failed due to numerical instability; we discarded these runs.)
