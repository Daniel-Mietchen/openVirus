<p>In order to allow for all models to have equal initial exponential growth rate, 
 <italic>r</italic>, we need to pick a parameter, 
 <italic>s</italic>, such that lim
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>→0
 </sub>
 <italic>r</italic>(
 <italic>s</italic>) = 0 and lim
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>→∞
 </sub>
 <italic>r</italic>(
 <italic>s</italic>) = ∞. As adjusting either partnership change rate (i.e. partnership formation and dissolution rate) or transmission rate fails this requirement for some of our models, we scaled both partnership change rate and transmission rate by the same factor 
 <italic>γ</italic>: 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>adj</sub> = 
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>base</sub>, 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>adj</sub> = 
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>base</sub>, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>adj</sub> = 
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>base</sub>. Since transmission rate is scaled by 
 <italic>γ</italic>, uncoupled and extra-couple transmission rates are adjusted as well. For the instantaneous-switching and implicit models, none of which track single individuals, only the transmission rate and partnership dissolution rate (in this case equivalent to the partnership change rate) are adjusted.
