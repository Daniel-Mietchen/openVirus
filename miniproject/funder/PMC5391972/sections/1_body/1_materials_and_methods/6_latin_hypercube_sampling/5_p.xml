<p>Two parameters, mean and the squared coefficient of variation (CV) of number of non-cohabiting partners, are sampled for heterogeneity in sexual activity. To allow for a wide range of uncertainty, range for the mean number of non-cohabiting partners was taken from unmarried men, as that was the group with the largest variability [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Omori 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] give a very wide range for the coefficient of variation (≈ 0—20, corresponding to squared CV range of 0-400): we narrowed this range for CV
 <sup>2</sup> to 0.01-100. At the bottom end of the range, an observation that a group behaves perfectly homogeneously (
 <italic>CV</italic> = 0) is likely to be a sampling artifact; at the upper end, the estimate is also likely to be noisy because of the low mean value among married females (who have the largest range of CV). We assume that the number of non-cohabiting partners follows a Gamma distribution.
