<p>Choosing the initial conditions for the simulations is challenging. In many modeling studies, researchers are primarily interested in equilibria (or other long-term dynamical attractors such as limit cycles) and are exploring models that have a single stable attractor, so initial conditions can be ignored as long as we run models for long enough. In eco-evolutionary dynamics, however, the initial conditions do affect our conclusions. We have no empirical information that would justify a particular choice of the fraction infected and the mean and variance of the distribution of SPVL at the point when the pandemic strain of HIV-1 entered the human population; in any case, the level of realism of our model does not support such a detailed consideration of the early dynamics of HIV. In most cases, we started with an initial log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL of 3.0, to match the value used by Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005453.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic> use an initial prevalence 
 <italic>I</italic>(0) = 10
 <sup>−3</sup>; because we calibrated parameters based on the initial epidemic growth rate (see “Simulation runs” below), we set 
 <italic>I</italic>(0) to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> for most runs to ensure that the exponential growth phase lasted long enough for reliable estimation of the initial growth rate.
