<p>We ran most of our models across a wide range of parameters, as described in the next (
 <italic>Latin hypercube sampling</italic>) section. In several cases, however, we inspected only a few parameter sets, to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of the models to initial conditions or to model structure. In particular, we tested model sensitivity to the initial prevalence, 
 <italic>I</italic>(0), and initial mean log
 <sub>10</sub> SPVL, 
 <italic>Î±</italic>(0), using baseline values of all parameters (
