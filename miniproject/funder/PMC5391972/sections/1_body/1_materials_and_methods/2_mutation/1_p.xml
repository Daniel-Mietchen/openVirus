<p>Over the course of infection, mutation occurs within the host. However, we follow Shirreff 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in assuming that SPVL of the strain transmitted by an infected individual is determined by the SPVL at the time of infection and is not further affected by within-host mutation. Instead, the mutational effect is modeled as occurring in a single step at the time of transmission.
