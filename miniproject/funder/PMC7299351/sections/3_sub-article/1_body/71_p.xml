<p>A very well written paper of major interest in the field. The authors estimated a very high HIV prevalence among MSM/TG in Johannesburg, and half of those HIV-positive were virally unsuppressed. These findings indicate gaps in the HIV care cascade that represent missed opportunities to improve the health of HIV-positive MSM/TG and to prevent ongoing HIV transmission.</p>
