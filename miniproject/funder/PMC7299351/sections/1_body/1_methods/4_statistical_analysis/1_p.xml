<p>RDS-II weighting[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to account for sampling design, dropping seed participants (who were purposively selected), and weighting by inverse MSM network size, assuming this was proportional to the probability that they would be given a coupon to participate in the study. Confidence intervals were obtained via bootstrapping.
