<p>We described the sociodemographic characteristics of MSM/TG by HIV status, as tested in the study. We examined reported HIV testing behaviour among participants testing HIV-negative in the study, and the care cascade amongst those HIV-positive. We described the proportion of HIV-negative MSM/TG who had ever tested, tested in the last three, six and twelve months, the location of and satisfaction with most recent test, and future testing preferences. We examined the associations between these preferences and age, sexual identity and gender identity characteristics using chi-squared tests with a correction for survey data[
