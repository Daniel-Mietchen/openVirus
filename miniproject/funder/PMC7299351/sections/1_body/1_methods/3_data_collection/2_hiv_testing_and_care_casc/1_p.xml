<p>Participants gave a blood sample for HIV rapid-testing, ELISA-confirmed if positive (Alere Combo and Advanced Quality HIV tests, back-up Alere Determine), CD4 count and viral load-testing (GeneXpert) if HIV-positive. We considered individuals as virally suppressed if they had &lt;50 viral copies/ml plasma, in line with current South African treatment guidelines[

To aid comparison with past studies and those from other settings, we also show the proportion virally suppressed according to cut-offs of &lt;200 copies/ml, &lt;400 copies/ml and &lt;1000 copies/ml in S2 Viral suppression according to different viral load cut-offs of
