<p>Participants were considered aware of their HIV-positive status if they reported in the self-administered survey ever having tested for HIV and receiving a positive result at their most recent HIV test. Participants reported month and year of most recent HIV test. Assuming tests were conducted on the first of each month, together with interview date we created binary indicators for having tested in the previous three, six and twelve months. Individuals reporting that they had previously tested HIV-positive were asked if they had received care, whether they had “ever started taking ART” and whether they were “currently taking ART”.</p>
