<p>Participants reported their age in years, previous month’s income, highest educational attainment, employment status, religion, population group (using South African categories), marital status, spouse’s gender, neighbourhood of residence and place of birth, their sexual identity, their sex assigned at birth and their current gender identity. We considered participants ‘cisgender male’ if both sex assigned at birth and current gender were male; ‘transfeminine’ if sex assigned at birth was male and current identity was female or transgender, ‘transmasculine’ if sex assigned at birth was female and current identity was male/transgender and ‘non-binary’ if this was their current gender identity. We used the AUDIT scale[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] to assess alcohol use and asked about frequency of use of a variety of recreational drugs, reporting here on use at least once in the past month, excepting tobacco. We used the PHQ-9 scale to assess depressive symptomatology, with cut-off points at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 for none, mild, moderate and moderately severe and severe depression, and asked participants whether they openly talked, tried ‘very hard’ or ‘somewhat hard’ to hide that that they had sex with men with their friends, family and healthcare workers, or neither spoke openly nor tried to hide it. Participants reported aspects of their sexual behaviour in the previous 3 months separately for male and female partners (if applicable), including number of partners, sexual roles (insertive/receptive anal sex or no anal sex, oral sex with men, and vaginal or anal sex with women), frequency of condom use by role (‘always’, ‘most of the time’, ‘some of the time’, ‘rarely’, ‘never’, made binary always/not always), and whether they had given, or had been given money, gifts or favours for sex in the previous 12 months. Participants self-reported experiencing STI symptoms at the time of survey and in the previous 12 months (urethral, genito-urinary or rectal).
