<p>It is encouraging that MSM/TG do not appear to be lagging in the HIV care cascade compared to the general male population in Johannesburg and are reporting positive care experiences. However, given their higher risks as a group and very high HIV burden, there is a need to continue to focus resources towards further improvement, particularly among younger MSM/TG. A better understanding of sexual mixing and transmission patterns could aid in targeting, development of a differentiated care approach to serve the diversity of MSM would be appropriate, and a dedicated study to understand the needs of the transgender population is warranted.</p>
