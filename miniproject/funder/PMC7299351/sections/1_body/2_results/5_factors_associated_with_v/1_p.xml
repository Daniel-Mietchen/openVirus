<p>Being virally suppressed was associated in crude analyses with increasing age, PR = 1.03 for each year, 95% CI 0.99–1.06, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. HIV-positive MSM/TG living in Braamfontein, a central neighbourhood, as compared to Soweto, were less likely to be virally suppressed, though the numbers were small (1/9 compared to 39/66, PR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.00–0.33). MSM/TG who were not open with their family about the fact that they had sex with men were less likely to be virally suppressed, though the evidence for the association was weak (PR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.46–1.14). There was evidence that MSM/TG reporting recreational drug use in the last month were more likely to be virally suppressed (PR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.00–2.44). Having paid a man in money, gifts or favours in exchange for sex in the past 12 months was strongly associated with being virally suppressed compared to not buying sex in the last 12 months (PR = 2.16, 95% 1.61–2.89).
