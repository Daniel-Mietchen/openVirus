<p>24/171 HIV-negative participants reported previous HIV testing but had a missing or partially completed month and year of last HIV test. We did not find statistical evidence for systematic differences between those with and without last HIV test dates (chi-squared tests p&gt;0.1 for all characteristics shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and social network size, with the exception of paying a man in money, gifts or favours in exchange for sex in the last 12 months (‘buying sex’)). Participants reporting buying sex were more likely to have missing dates for last HIV test, 6/17 compared to 18/153, p = 0.008.
