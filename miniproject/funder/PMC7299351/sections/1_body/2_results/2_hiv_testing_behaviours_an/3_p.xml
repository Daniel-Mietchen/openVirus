<p>The most common location for last HIV test was a public clinic or hospital (69/166, 47.1%), followed by a community HIV testing centre for the general public (41/166, 24.8%), while 25/166 (13.2%) had most recently tested at an MSM-specific service. Across all HIV testing locations, MSM/TG reported high levels of satisfaction with the privacy and respect they were shown. The distribution of preferences for future testing venues was diverse and similar to that of last testing location, except for a higher preference for an MSM-specific community testing facility and a private clinic or doctor compared with the percentage who had actually tested in one (19.8% compared to 13.2%, and 18.3% compared to 9.7% respectively). Just under half of participants preferred to test in a public clinic or hospital (46.9%) and preferred to have the test conducted by a doctor/clinician (42.0%), while very few expressed a preference for self-testing (6.0%).</p>
