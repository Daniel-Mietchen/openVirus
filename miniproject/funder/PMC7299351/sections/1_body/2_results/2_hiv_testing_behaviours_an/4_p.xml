<p>There was little statistical evidence that testing preferences varied by sociodemographic characteristics (full results not shown), with the exception of gender identity (p = 0.006). More transfeminine individuals preferred to test in a public clinic/hospital (18/29, 69.3%) compared to cisgender (62/142, 50.3%) and non-binary (5/18, 22.9%) MSM/TG, while fewer preferred to test at a private clinic (2/29, 10.2%) compared to cisgender (28/142, 19.0%) or non-binary individuals (4/18, 30.5%). There was little difference in the percentages preferring to test in clinics targeted towards MSM by gender identity, though there was no response option given for transgender-tailored clinics.</p>
