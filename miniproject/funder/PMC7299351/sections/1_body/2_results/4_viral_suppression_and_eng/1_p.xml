 <xref rid="pone.0234384.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Self-reported knowledge of HIV-positive status was estimated to be 56.5% (95% CI 40.4–72.6%, n = 76/118) and current ART coverage 30.0% (95% CI 17.1–43.0%, n = 39/118) of all those HIV-positive. Of those who reported currently taking ART, there were 10/39 who were not virally suppressed. There were 29 participants who tested positive for HIV and were virally suppressed but who either did not self-report ever testing positive for HIV, or did not self-report current ART use.
