<p>Our study set out to obtain population-representative estimate of HIV testing and the care cascade among MSM/TG in Johannesburg, rather than relying upon modelled estimates. While we found that study outcomes of HIV status, viral load and testing and many sociodemographic characteristics showed evidence of converging well, there were some challenges in achieving a representative sample of MSM/TG (

 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Compared to another study of MSM in Soweto from 2008, we found a lower proportion of MSM/TG who identified as heterosexual or ‘straight’[

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234384.s001">S1 Data</xref>, likely indicating a difficulty in sampling this group. A higher proportion of participants described themselves as Black African compared to the population of Johannesburg overall; recruitment chains originating from White seeds did not achieve more than two sample waves and White and Asian individuals were not recruited by others. Most participants were recruited from four of the nine seeds.
