<p>A further limitation was our reliance upon self-reported measures of HIV testing/status awareness and ART use. That half of MSM/TG verified to be virally suppressed did not report currently taking ART and/or did not report being aware of their status suggests that diagnosis and current ART use were under-reported among men testing HIV-positive in our study, discrepancies that we are investigating further[

 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Misinterpretations about the distinction between ‘undetectable’ viral load and ‘negative’ HIV status in provider interactions may represent an increasingly importance source of misclassification that should be investigated further. While our estimate of viral suppression is biologically ascertained, these reporting biases limit our ability to guide programming in identifying whether the gaps in diagnosis versus initiation and retention on ART are most significant.
