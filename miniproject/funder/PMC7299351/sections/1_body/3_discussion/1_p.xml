<p>We estimated a very high HIV prevalence among MSM/TG in Johannesburg, and found half of those HIV-positive to be virally unsuppressed. These findings indicate gaps in the HIV care cascade that represent missed opportunities to improve the health of HIV-positive MSM/TG and to prevent ongoing HIV transmission. Younger MSM/TG who were HIV-positive were less likely to be virally suppressed, emphasising the need for regular and accessible testing and support to engage in HIV care for this group.</p>
