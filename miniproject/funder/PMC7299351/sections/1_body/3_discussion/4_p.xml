<p>Almost two thirds of HIV-negative MSM/TG reported having HIV tested within the previous 6 months, higher than among MSM in Soweto in 2008 (28%)[

Encouragingly, testing was associated with some indicators of higher risk, including selling sex to men, though not self-reported STI symptoms. There remains a need for sustained HIV/STI testing messages. Transfeminine individuals were less likely than cisgender male individuals to have HIV tested, similar to findings from Cape Town[

Of MSM/TG who did attend HIV testing, it is encouraging that high levels of privacy and respect at last testing experience were reported. That there was not a clear majority preference for testing location and person performing the tests underscores the need for a high volume and variety of accessible and acceptable services for a diverse MSM/TG population. While few MSM/TG reported a preference for HIV self-testing in our study, it is possible that this stems from unfamiliarity: a recent study of MSM in Mpumalanga found high levels of satisfaction with HIV self-testing and increased testing frequency amongst those who had tried it[
