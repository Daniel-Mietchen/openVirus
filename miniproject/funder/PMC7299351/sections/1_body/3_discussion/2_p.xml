<p>We found a higher proportion of MSM/TG to be virally suppressed at 47% (32–62%) than the 34% estimated among all adult males living with HIV in Gauteng in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the 26% estimated in Johannesburg in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and similar to the 47% (95% CI 43–52%) estimated to be virally suppressed among the HIV-positive adult population in South Africa as a whole in 2017[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This was the case even with our lower viral load cut-off of 50 copies/ml plasma as compared to 400/ml plasma. Our estimate is also higher than modelled estimates for virological suppression among South African MSM (22%, data from 2013–2015)[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is plausible that in addition to challenges related to having sex with men, HIV-positive MSM/TG experience some of the same barriers to achieving viral suppression that men as whole do, as estimates for viral suppression among women are higher than those of men overall (43% compared to 58% nationally among adults[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Knowledge of status and current ART use among HIV-positive MSM/TG were much higher than that reported amongst MSM in two districts of neighbouring Mpumalanga province in 2012–2013, (56.5% compared to 28.1% and 14.1% aware of status, 30% versus 14% and 10% on ART)[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our higher estimates could be related to having an urban sample of MSM/TG and to our more recent data collection. Nonetheless, the percentage of HIV-positive MSM/TG whom we found to be virally suppressed remains well below the UNAIDS target of 73% of all those HIV-positive, indicating gaps in the HIV care cascade. It is encouraging however that HIV-positive MSM/TG receiving HIV care, 76% of whom were attending public clinics and hospitals, reported high levels of satisfaction with the service they received.
