<p>HIV surveillance and programming targeting gay and bisexual men, other men who have sex with men and transgender women (MSM/TG) have until recently been neglected in countries with generalised HIV epidemics[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the last ten years, this has begun to change, with increasing funder and policymaker attention paid to the burden of HIV experienced by these populations[

 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], including in South Africa’s National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB and STI’s[
 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Over this same period, coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has greatly expanded and AIDS-related mortality in general populations has fallen dramatically[

 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Effective treatment to achieve viral suppression also avoids sexual transmission of the virus, including among MSM[

 <xref rid="pone.0234384.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Accordingly, UNAIDS set ‘care cascade’ targets specifying that of all HIV-positive individuals in a given population, 90% should be aware of their status, 90% of those aware should be on antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 90% of those on ART should be virally suppressed by 2020[
