<p>The data for this study were collected using respondent driven sampling (RDS), a type of peer-referral or ‘snowball sampling’. Provided that assumptions are met and appropriate weighting is used, the data can be treated as a probability sample and used to obtain representative estimates of the population, eg HIV status. In practice, these assumptions are hard to meet and it is recommended to examine a set of RDS recruitment dynamics to assess the extent to which the sampling might deviate from assumptions, (see guidance on RDS diagnostics (2)). This requires information about participants’ social networks, information about their recruiter and those they recruit, and their position within sampling chains (eg whether one of only nine seed participants). We have given an overview description of the RDS recruitment as an appendix to this manuscript, and one that is specific to this study’s primary outcomes. We have taken care to do this while maintaining confidentiality, eg not giving HIV status of seed participants away via showing bottle net plots or recruitment trees by HIV status, but subsequent studies would need the full RDS information to assess the representativeness of the sample with respect to their specific study primary outcomes, eg to produce and examine convergence and bottleneck plots. We are concerned that there is a high risk of deductive disclosure to making the individual-level RDS data public, in combination with data about other characteristics of participants, including highly sensitive HIV and STI testing results and personal characteristics. Even if we removed individual pieces of identifiable information, we are not confident that this would truly anonymise the data. </p>
