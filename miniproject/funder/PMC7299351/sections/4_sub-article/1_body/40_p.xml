<p>While the authors have correctly interpreted the odds ratios (OR). In this population, these binary outcomes (HIV testing, access to care and viral suppression) are common (&gt;10%), it is often more desirable to estimate a relative risk (RR) or prevalence ratio since there is an increasing differential between the RR and odds ratio with increasing prevalence rates, and there is a tendency for some to interpret ORs as if they are RRs. The authors can estimate the RR in Stata with a log-binomial regression model or should there be convergence issues, apply the Poisson regression model with a robust error variance. A major consideration in public health research is need to communicate study results to a wider non-statistical community i.e. the medical community, general public, and policy makers. Poisson regression with robust variance and log-binomial regression provide correct estimates and are a better alternative for the analysis of this kind of study design with binary outcomes than logistic regression, as the relative risk or prevalence ratio is more interpretable and easier to communicate than the odds ratio.</p>
