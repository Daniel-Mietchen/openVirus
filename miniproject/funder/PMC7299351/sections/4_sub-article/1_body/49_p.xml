<p>Data from this study cannot be deposited publicly because of a high risk of deductive disclosure when reporting all of the information needed to validly analyse the data. This risk is made worse by the vulnerability of the population, which faces social stigma and has reported high levels of harassment, blackmail and abuse in other studies (eg Zahn 2016 (1)) and in our survey. </p>
