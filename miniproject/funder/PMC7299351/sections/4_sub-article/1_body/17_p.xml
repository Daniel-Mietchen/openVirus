<p>Reviewer #1: This study uses RDS methodology to obtain a representative sample of MSM/TG in Johannesburg, in order to investigate: HIV prevalence, HIV testing behaviour in HIV negative individuals and viral suppression in HIV positive individuals. The study found a high prevalence of HIV, that the majority of negative MSM/TG had tested within the last 6 months, and poor viral suppression in PLHIV, although comparable to that of men in South Africa in general.</p>
