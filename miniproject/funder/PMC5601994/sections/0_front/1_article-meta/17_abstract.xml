 <p>Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is a virus of humans and livestock, transmitted by mosquitos and contact with infected animals. Infection can cause severe disease, including hemorrhagic fever, and may lead to death. Historically, the virus was only found in central Africa but it has spread for instance to the Arabian Peninsula. There is a risk that the virus may appear in temperate regions including Europe because global warming is allowing the mosquitos that carry the virus to extend their geographic range. There are no vaccines or treatments available for use in humans so if there is a serious outbreak of the virus it could become an epidemic and cause great economic losses and severe human disease.</p>
 <p>RVFV relies on a protein called NSs to cause disease. In cells of infected animals and humans NSs forms filaments inside the nucleus, the control center of the cell, and disarms the immune system. However, it is not known precisely how NSs works.</p>
 <p>To address this question, Barski, Brennan et al. used a technique called X-ray crystallography to study the atomic three-dimensional structure of NSs. This revealed that the center of the protein contains a core domain that causes the filaments to form. Further experiments identified how the NSs core comes together to build the filaments inside the cell nucleus.</p>
 <p>These findings represent an important step towards understanding how the NSs protein helps RVFV to cause disease in humans and livestock. In the future, this work may aid the development of much needed drugs and vaccines against RVFV.</p>
