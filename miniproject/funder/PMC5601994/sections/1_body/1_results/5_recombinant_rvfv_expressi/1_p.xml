<p>Recombinant RVFV encoding NSs-ΔNΔC (rMP12NSsΔNΔC) was rescued. Working stock of recombinant virus achieved similar titers (1.15 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/mL) to parental MP12 (2.00 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/mL) and no difference in plaque morphology was observed. Reverse transcription PCR analysis was performed to confirm the presence of the NSs truncation. Vero-E6 cells were infected with the recombinant rMP12NSsΔNΔC strain. Twenty-four hours after infection NSs-specific immunofluorescence staining showed prominent filaments in nuclei of infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The morphology of these NSs-ΔNΔC filaments was indistinguishable from structures observed for the parental MP12 strain encoding full-length NSs. Fibrillation was observed only in about 30% of cells infected with rMP12NSsΔNΔC, compared to occurrence of filaments in nearly all cells infected with parental virus.
