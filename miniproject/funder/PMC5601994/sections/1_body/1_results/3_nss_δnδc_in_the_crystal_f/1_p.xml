<p>In the crystal lattice NSs-ΔNΔC molecules were found to pack into a highly organized network of two fibril-like assemblies, referred to here as F1 and F2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), creating large solvent channels. The F1 and F2 crisscross pattern is produced by F1 fibrils running in parallel to each other and the longest unit cell edge, while F2 fibrils are oriented at an angle of 60° with respect to each other, perpendicular to F1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). F1 and F2 fibrils themselves are best described as being composed of repeating NSs tetramer units. Four different, partially overlapping (or alternative) tetramers T1, T2, T3 and T4 can be distinguished that differ in stability and interface areas, according to PISA interface analyses (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), with T1 being the most stable tetramer (
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). F1 is an assembly of T1 tetramers stacked at 60° angles, while F2 is composed of alternating T1 and T2 tetramers arranged at 90° angles with respect to each other. The T1 interface that lies parallel to the F1 fibril is largely determined by hydrophobic packing of the α6 helices. The T1 interface perpendicular to the F1 fibril axis is defined by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the basic face of α1 (Lys84, Gln87, Arg88) and the acidic face of α8 (Glu220, Glu221, Ser228), leading to a large buried interface area of 4 × 852 Å
 <sup>2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The superficially very similar tetramer T2 in F2 fibrils is less stable. Here the molecules are rotated by about 8° with respect to the orientation of the equivalent monomers in T1, and form a twisted tetramer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The register of the α6-α6 interface is shifted, decreasing the buried surface area by 169 Å
 <sup>2</sup> compared to the same interface in T1. The total buried surface area is nearly 1000 Å
 <sup>2</sup> (17%) smaller in T2 than in T1. The B factors for T2 are also notably higher than for T1, suggesting that interfaces in T1, and therefore F1, possess a higher degree of conformational order, contributing to a higher stability of this assembly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). B factors have been used to distinguish biologically relevant interfaces from crystal packing interfaces, which have been found to be characterized by relatively high B factors (
