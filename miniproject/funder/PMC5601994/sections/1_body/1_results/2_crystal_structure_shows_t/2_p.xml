<p>The NSs-ΔNΔC monomer, molecular mass 19,029 Da, measures approximately 30 × 30 × 50 Å. It is composed of eight α-helices with helices α1-α6 and α8 arranged around a long central helix α7. Two short 3
 <sub>10</sub> helices are also present (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Residues 234–244 are devoid of secondary structure and traverse approximately 30 Å of the NSs surface, packed against helices α3 and α7. Two NSs-ΔNΔC monomers constitute the asymmetric unit, with an interface formed by their α8 helices (
