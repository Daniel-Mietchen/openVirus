<p>The NSs-ΔNΔC protein was crystallized at conditions optimized following routine sparse-matrix crystallization screens. The crystals were found to be extremely fragile, and diffracted synchrotron X-rays to 2.2 Å resolution. Crystals belonged to space group

 <sub>4</sub>22. Calculation of the Matthews coefficient indicated a high solvent content of 76%, assuming two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Due to the absence of any molecular replacement models, experimental phasing had to be undertaken. Because of the higher-than-average sulfur content of NSs-ΔNΔC (12 sulfurs per chain of 175 residues) and the highly symmetrical
