<p>To gain insight into the architecture of nuclear NSs filaments, we infected Vero-E6 cells with the recombinantly produced parental RVFV strain MP12 as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Billecocq et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2014</xref>) and imaged cell nuclei containing filaments with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thick filaments of NSs, 0.5–1 μm in diameter, started forming about four hours post-infection and averaged to 1–2 filaments per nucleus. TEM reveals a substructure of these filaments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). They appear to be composed of a bundle of tightly packed, extended parallel fibrils with diameters roughly ranging from 8 to 15 nm.
