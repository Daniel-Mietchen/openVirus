<p>NSs-ΔN was highly soluble (up to 30 mg/mL) in near-physiological buffer conditions. A 2D 
 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum showed well-dispersed crosspeaks, indicative of folded, monomeric protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The central region of the spectrum, spanning chemical shifts of 7.5 to 8.5 ppm in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H dimension, was dominated by 17 intense and narrow backbone amide signals, indicating significant flexibility of corresponding residues. Based on secondary structure and disorder predictions, we concluded the intrinsically unfolded residues were present at the C-terminus of NSs-ΔN. Subsequent removal of the C-terminal 17 amino acids (resulting in doubly truncated NSs hereafter referred to as NSs-ΔNΔC, residues 83–248) yielded protein present as a monomer in solution (

 <sup>1</sup>H-
 <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum was devoid of all but two intense crosspeaks observed for NSs-ΔN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All other signals overlapped well with crosspeaks in the NSs-ΔN spectrum, indicating absence of residues 249–265 does not influence the structure of NSs-ΔNΔC.
