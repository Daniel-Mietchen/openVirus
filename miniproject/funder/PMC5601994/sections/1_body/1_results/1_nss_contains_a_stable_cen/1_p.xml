<p>Full-length NSs protein (residues 1–265) was expressed as a cleavable MBP fusion yielding only a small amount (about 0.1 mg per litre of culture) of soluble protein after removal of MBP. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed secondary and tertiary structure in mature NSs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This construct was therefore redesigned in order to obtain a stable, non-aggregating and soluble fragment of NSs. Secondary structure predictions suggested an N-terminal region with a propensity to form β sheet structure (residues 1–70), connected by an unstructured linker to a central α-helical domain (85-230). The C-terminal region was predicted to be natively unfolded (231-265). Deletion of the N-terminal 82 amino acids (resulting in truncated NSs hereafter referred to as NSs-ΔN, residues 83–265) significantly improved expression yields, solubility and stability. In solution, the NSs-ΔN protein existed in equilibrium between monomeric and multimeric forms (
