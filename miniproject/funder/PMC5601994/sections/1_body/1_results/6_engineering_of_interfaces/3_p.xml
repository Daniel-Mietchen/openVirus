<p>Three recombinant viruses encoding full-length NSs containing interface mutations were rescued, rMP12muT1NSs, rMP12muT3NSs, and rMP12muT4NSs. Recombinant viruses grew to similar titers to that of the parental virus rMP12 and had indistinguishable plaque morphologies. Segment specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the genomic composition of recombinant viruses. NSs-specific immunofluorescence staining showed the presence of filaments in nuclei of rMP12mut4NSs infected Vero-E6 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, no filaments were observed in nuclei of cells infected with rMP12muT1NSs and rMP12muT3NSs. In both cases NSs was detected as speckles or diffusely dispersed throughout the nuclei (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data indicate that all three NSs variants had retained the ability to be imported into nuclei. Mutating interfaces observed in the F1 crystal fibril clearly affected intranuclear NSs filament formation, whereas mutating an interface unique to the F2 fibril did not. Therefore, we conclude that the F1 crystal fibril is not only more stable than F2, but that it also represents the architecture of NSs in intranuclear filaments.
