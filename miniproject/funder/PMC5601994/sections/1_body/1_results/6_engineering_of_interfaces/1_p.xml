<p>To test if the fibrillar crystal packing observed for NSs-ΔNΔC represents a biologically relevant assembly underpinning intranuclear NSs filament formation, combinations of two key residues in three different crystal interfaces were mutated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Residues were chosen that were predicted to be critical for assembly of tetramers present in both or either F1 and F2 fibrils, but not essential for monomer stability. Three NSs variants were generated: NSs-ΔNΔC-muT1 (Arg88Asp, Ser228Ala), NSs-ΔNΔC-muT3 (Lys150Gly, Thr152Gly) and NSs-ΔNΔC-muT4 (Ile216Asp, Met219Ala). Disruption of the polar T1 interface, perpendicular to F1, would interrupt both T1 and T2, and therefore F1 and F2. Residue Arg88, forming two salt bridges to Glu220 and Glu221, was mutated to an aspartate. Ser228, forming a side-chain hydrogen bond with Gln87, was replaced by alanine. The T3 interface, unique to F1, was targeted through replacement of Lys150 and Thr152 with glycines. The hydrophobic T4 interface, formed by the α8 helices of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals, is unique to F2; it was changed by mutating Ile216 to aspartate and Met219 to alanine. These two residues contribute about 50% of the total buried surface area to the α8-α8 interface.
