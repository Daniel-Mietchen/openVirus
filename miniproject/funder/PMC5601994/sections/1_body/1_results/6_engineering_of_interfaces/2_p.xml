<p>NMR spectroscopy was used to assess the effect of these mutations on the folded state of NSs-ΔNΔC in solution. 
 <sup>1</sup>H spectra agreed with conservation of structure in all mutated proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). All spectra showed the same signal dispersion and no indications of significant changes in structure, such as partial unfolding. High-field shifted methyl signals between −1 and 0 ppm were observed at the same chemical shifts in all spectra. Such signals belong to buried aliphatic side-chains, and conservation of their chemical shifts reflects preservation of the hydrophobic packing in the protein variants.
