<p>Our data have implications for understanding the interaction between NSs and TFIIH. The model for NSs function previously proposed (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>) assumes initial binding of NSs to p62, with subsequent disintegration of the TFIIH complex, followed by sequestration of p44 into NSs filaments (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>). This hypothesis is not supported by our findings, as NSs-ΔNΔC lacks the putative p62-binding motif and still yields filaments. The apparent similarity in size and shape of NSs-ΔNΔC filaments to full-length NSs does not allow conclusions about their composition. We cannot rule out the possibility that NSs-ΔNΔC filaments observed in vivo are lacking other proteins such as p44 possibly associated with full-length NSs filaments.
