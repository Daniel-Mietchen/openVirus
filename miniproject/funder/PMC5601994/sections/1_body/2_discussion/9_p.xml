<p>The finding of highly organized fibrils in the NSs-ΔNΔC crystal lattice is intriguing due to the natural propensity of NSs for fibrillation in nuclei of RVFV-infected cells. Mutagenic analyses of interfaces defining the two types of crystal fibrils suggested that F1 likely represents the core architecture of NSs filaments, while F2 is a crystal packing artifact. T1 and T3 interface NSs variants were both detected in nuclei of infected cells. In immunofluorescence staining the muT3 interface variant appeared to be much more abundant than the muT1 variant, suggesting that the muT3 variant of NSs may be more stable than the muT1 interface mutant. This agrees with the predicted stability of the T1 tetramer (
