<p>Deletion of 17 C-terminal residues was based on 2D NMR of NSs-ΔN showing the presence of an intrinsically unfolded region. Notably, this truncation matches one reported in a study where RVFV NSs lacking these C-terminal residues (encoded by recombinant Semliki Forest virus) was localized in nuclei of infected cells, but did not form filaments (

While the C-terminal tail (including the FVEV motif) is missing in the NSs-ΔNΔC construct, we nevertheless observed intranuclear filaments indistinguishable from filaments in rMP12-infected cells. Therefore, neither the intrinsically disordered C-terminal nor the N-terminal regions of NSs are required for filament formation.
