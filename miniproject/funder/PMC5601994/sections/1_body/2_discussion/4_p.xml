<p>NSs does not contain any nuclear localization signals, thus nuclear import likely relies on host proteins such as the p44 subunit of the TFIIH transcription complex (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2004</xref>). Interaction sites for any such binding partners are predicted to be near the N-terminus, since mutation of a PxxP putative protein interaction motif (residues 29–32) results in retention of NSs in the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Billecocq et al., 2004</xref>). Our data, however, show that the N-terminal 82 residues of NSs (including the 29–32 motif) are dispensable for nuclear localization.
