<p>PISA interface analysis indicates that potentially some NSs-ΔNΔC oligomers, but neither F1 nor F2 fibrils would be stable in solution. This agrees with the observation that NSs is distributed throughout the cytoplasm at early time points in cell infection experiments, and only forms distinct filaments inside nuclei. Fibrillation therefore depends on factors present in the nucleus, but not the cytosol. Essential factors could be binding partners, but also other conditions that shift the association equilibrium of NSs towards fibrils such as the excluded volume effect, or molecular crowding, which plays a role in compartmentalization and architecture of cell nuclei (
