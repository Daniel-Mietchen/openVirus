<p>The discrepancies between published results and our findings regarding the terminal regions of NSs may be reconciled if a role for the N-terminal domain of NSs in self-association is considered. The N-terminal domain is included in the NSs constructs used in both studies cited above (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cyr et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Yadani et al., 1999</xref>) that suggest a critical role of the C-terminal tail for NSs self-association. However, removal of the N-terminal domain had a clear effect on the oligomeric state of NSs-ΔN, where the C-terminal tail is present (

In crystal fibrils, NSs-ΔNΔC N- and C-termini are close to an apparent cleft in the middle of tetramer T1, which could accommodate the N-terminal domain, assuming full-length NSs fibrils contain the same core-domain arrangement. In which case, intermolecular interactions between monomer terminal regions are likely (
