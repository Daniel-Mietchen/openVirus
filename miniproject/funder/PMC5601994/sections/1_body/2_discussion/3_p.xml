<p>Recombinant full-length RVFV NSs was found to form large aggregates in solution, and was not suitable for NMR or crystallography. Therefore, we designed a stable construct amenable to crystallization through double deletion of 82 N-terminal and 17 C-terminal residues (NSs-ΔNΔC). Both these regions had previously been linked to biological functions of NSs, particularly its intranuclear localization and fibrillation (
