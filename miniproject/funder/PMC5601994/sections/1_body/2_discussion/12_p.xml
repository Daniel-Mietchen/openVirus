<p>RVFV is one of the most dangerous human pathogens with the potential to cause wide epidemics in the near future. The first high-resolution structure for the main RVFV virulence factor NSs and other data presented here will facilitate a deeper understanding of NSs function. Ongoing research will help determine if NSs filament assembly is required for virulence, a question that this study does not attempt to answer. NSs proteins of phleboviruses and other members of the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order are highly diverse in sequence, but all play roles in suppressing the innate immune response through various mechanisms (

Currently no other NSs protein is known to cause filaments characteristic for RVFV. To establish whether this unique property of RVFV NSs is related to virulence may require animal models, since NSs is dispensable for viral replication and in vitro cell infection, but is required to cause pathology (

Development of modulators of fibril formation may be an attractive option for new therapeutics, especially given the conservation of interface residues in RVFV isolates.
