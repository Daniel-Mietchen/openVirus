<p>The NSs core domain structure reported here represents a novel fold. Comparison of the secondary structure distribution in NSs-ΔNΔC and secondary structure predictions for other phleboviral NSs proteins shows very good agreement, suggesting that, despite low to moderate sequence identity of this core region (15–32%), all phleboviral NSs proteins share a similar core domain fold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). They do however vary greatly in their N- and C-terminal regions, which is particularly evident when comparing NSs from viruses transmitted by mosquitos and sandflies (e.g. RVFV, sandfly fever viruses) with viruses transmitted by ticks (e.g. Heartland phlebovirus and SFTS phlebovirus) (
