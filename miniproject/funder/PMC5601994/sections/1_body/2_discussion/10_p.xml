<p>Biological relevance of the F1 fibril is also supported by accessibility of the α8 helix in this assembly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is partially buried in the F2-specific T1-T2 interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This helix harbors a binding site for SAP30, a component of a repressor complex that regulates transcription of the interferon-β promoter (
