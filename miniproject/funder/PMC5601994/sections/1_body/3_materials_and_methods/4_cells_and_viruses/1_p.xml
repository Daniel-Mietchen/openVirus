Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Cell lines were grown at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> unless otherwise stated. Recombinant viruses containing truncated or mutated NSs proteins were generated using reverse genetics as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Le May et al., 2008</xref>). Stocks of recombinant viruses were grown in BHK-21 cells at 33°C by infecting at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and harvesting the culture medium at 5–7 days post infection (p.i.) All experiments with infectious virus were conducted under containment level 3 conditions. RT-PCR analysis of p1 stock viruses was performed to confirm the correct configuration of the recombinant virus S RNA.
