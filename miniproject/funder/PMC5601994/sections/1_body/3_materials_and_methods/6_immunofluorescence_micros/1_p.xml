<p>Vero-E6 cells were grown on glass coverslips (13 mm diameter), infected with recombinant or parental RVFV at an MOI of 5 and fixed at 24 h p.i. in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS. After permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were stained with specific primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibody conjugates. Localization of the fluorescently labeled proteins was examined using a Zeiss LSM-710 confocal microscope. Images in
