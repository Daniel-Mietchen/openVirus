Cells were infected with serial dilutions of virus and incubated under an overlay consisting of Glasgow minimum essential medium (GMEM) supplemented with 2% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 0.6% Avicel (w/v) (FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia, PA) at 37°C for 4 days. Cell monolayers were fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde and plaques were visualized by Giemsa staining.
