<p>NSs 83–248 (NSs-ΔNΔC) was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2, concentrated to 30 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Protein crystals were grown at 4°C by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 8% (w/v) PEG 10,000 with protein and reservoir combined in a 2:1 ratio. Crystals of NSs-ΔNΔC grew as elongated hexagons and reached their maximum size of about 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm after two weeks. Crystals were cryo-protected by brief immersion in reservoir supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native and anomalous data were collected using a 2.0 Å wavelength beam at the Diamond Light Source (I03 beamline). Diffraction over a 500° angle yielded a high-multiplicity dataset with maximum resolution of 2.2 Å. Crystals indexed in space group
