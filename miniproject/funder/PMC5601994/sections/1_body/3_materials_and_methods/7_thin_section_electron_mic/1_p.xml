<p>Monolayer cultures of Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and infected with RVFV MP12 for 24 h p.i. at an MOI of 3, and subsequently fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde overnight at 4°C. Cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation followed by fixation with 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide (TAAB Labs, UK) and staining with 2% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were then harvested into PBS and pelleted through 1% (w/v) SeaPlaque agarose (Sigma, UK) at 45°C. The agar was set at 4°C and cell pellets were cut into ~1 mm cubes, which were dehydrated through a graded alcohol series (30–100% (v/v)) and embedded in Epon 812 resin (TAAB Labs, UK) followed by polymerization for 3 days at 65°C. Thin sections of 120 nm were cut with a UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Germany) and examined with a JEOL 1200 EX II electron microscope and images were recorded on a Gatan Orius CCD camera.</p>
