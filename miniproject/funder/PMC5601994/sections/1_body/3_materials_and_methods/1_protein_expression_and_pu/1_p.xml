<p>Expression constructs were prepared by cloning RVFV strain MP12 cDNA comprising full-length (residues 1–265), ΔN (residues 83–265), and ΔNΔC (residues 83–248) regions of NSs into a modified pMal-C2x vector (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag downstream of the 
 <italic>malE</italic> (MBP) gene and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease sequence. Proteins were expressed using 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth to an OD
 <sub>600</sub> of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed overnight at 18°C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in the presence of 10 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.2 using sonication. Soluble proteins were separated from cell debris by centrifugation. Soluble protein was purified by nickel metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC). After binding, resin was washed extensively with 10 mM phosphate buffer, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.2 in order to dissociate any bound DNA. MBP-NSs was eluted in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, and dialyzed overnight at 4°C in 10 mM phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, pH 7.2 with simultaneous cleavage by TEV protease. MBP was separated from NSs by reverse nickel IMAC. NSs was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a 16/60 S75 Superdex column (GE Healthcare, UK) in 10 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2.
