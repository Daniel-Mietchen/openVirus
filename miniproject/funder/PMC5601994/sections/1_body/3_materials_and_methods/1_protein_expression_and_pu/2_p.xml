<p>Interface mutation variants of NSs-ΔNΔC were generated through site-directed mutagenesis. NSs-ΔNΔC-muT1 (Arg88Asp, Ser228Ala) was generated in two stages of amplification, while NSs-ΔNΔC-muT3 (Lys150Gly, Thr152Gly) and NSs-ΔNΔC-muT4 (Ile216Asp, Met219Ala) were made in single steps. Interface mutation variants were expressed and purified as previously described for wild-type NSs-ΔNΔC.</p>
