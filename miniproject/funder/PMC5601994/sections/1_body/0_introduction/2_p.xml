<p>RVFV is a zoonotic arbovirus evolved to evade the immune response of mammals and insects. Innate immune antagonism of RVFV is primarily mediated by its main virulence factor, the 30 kDa non-structural protein (NSs), which is transcribed and translated from a subgenomic mRNA derived from the antigenomic S segment early during infection. NSs impedes interferon production through three known mechanisms (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kalveram et al., 2011</xref>), thereby halting global cellular transcription. NSs also prevents activation of the interferon-β promoter specifically by binding to factor SAP30, a member of a multisubunit histone deacetylase transcriptional repression complex that regulates interferon-β expression (
