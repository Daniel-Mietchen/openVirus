<p>A characteristic feature of RVFV pathogenesis is formation of 0.5 μm thick proteinaceous filaments formed by bundles of thin fibrils in the nuclei of infected cells (

It is not clear if filament formation is required for NSs function, that is if any interaction sites are present on the monomeric form of the protein, or are only present in the multimerized, fibrillar NSs. In the absence of structural information it is difficult to dissect NSs function from filament formation. Potential functions of nuclear NSs filaments include sequestering NSs binding partners, causing cell cycle arrest and defects in chromosome cohesion and segregation (
