<p>NSs proteins are encoded in the S segment of the tripartite negative sense single strand RNA genome of most members of the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus, and other families of the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order such as the 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Nairoviridae</italic>, and some members of the 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ly and Ikegami, 2016</xref>). They constitute notoriously difficult targets for structural characterization due to an inherent tendency to multimerize, as well as the putative presence of substantial intrinsically unfolded regions. While high-resolution structures of glycoproteins (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Raymond et al., 2010</xref>) from RVFV and several other bunyaviruses have been determined, no structural information is currently available for any NSs protein, significantly limiting the current understanding of key bunyaviral virulence mechanisms. Structure and function can also not be predicted based on sequence, as NSs proteins are ‘ORFans’, with very little sequence similarity in members of the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order and the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus. Despite large sequence diversity, NSs proteins examined thus far have been found to play roles in the suppression of the host innate immune response. However, this and the diverse mechanisms of NSs function have been studied only for a few viruses.
