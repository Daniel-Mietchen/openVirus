<p>Here we describe the first high-resolution structure of a bunyaviral NSs protein. A truncated stable, soluble core domain spanning residues 83–248 of RVFV NSs (NSs-ΔNΔC) was identified using NMR spectroscopy. The corresponding crystal structure represents a novel all-helical fold. Notably, NSs molecules packed in crystals in double-helical fibrils stabilized by multiple interfaces. Dimensions of these fibrils are in good agreement with fibrils constituting nuclear NSs filaments in RVFV-infected cells. Cells infected with recombinant RVFV encoding NSs-ΔNΔC produced nuclear filaments indistinguishable from filaments observed in cells infected with parental RVFV. Furthermore, recombinant viruses encoding full-length NSs with mutations predicted to destabilize significant fibril interfaces, as suggested by crystal packing, did not induce nuclear filaments. Combination of structural biology with cell infection assays using reverse genetics to tailor the main RVFV virulence factor identified a RVFV NSs core domain sufficient for filament formation in vivo, and revealed the structural basis for NSs nuclear filament formation.</p>
