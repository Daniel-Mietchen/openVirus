<p>Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), of the genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, is one of the most clinically significant members of the 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> family, of the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order (

In humans infections are usually self-limiting, but can develop into hepatitis, retinitis, encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever with fatality rates of 0.5â€“2% (
