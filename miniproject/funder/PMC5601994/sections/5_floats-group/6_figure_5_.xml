  <title>TEM observations of fibrils formed in the nuclei of cells infected with RVFV.</title>
  <p>The outline of an NSs filament within a cell nucleus is indicated in the left panel by red arrowheads. Higher magnifications (middle and right panels) reveal a substructure of NSs filaments, which are composed of bundles of parallel fibrils with estimated widths of 8â€“15 nm. Cyan arrowheads in the right panel indicate one fibril with a width of 10 nm.</p>
