  <title>Sequence alignment of NSs proteins from human-pathogenic phleboviruses (SFTS, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus).</title>
  <p>Secondary structure elements for RVFV-NSs are shown on top of the alignment panels. For the N-terminal domain (top panel) these are based on secondary structure prediction by JPred4 (
   <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>) (dashed lines). Sequence similarity is indicated by gray shading for residues conserved or similar in at least 80% of sequences. Regions displayed in gray font are not aligned. Secondary structure predictions are also shown below each panel for Toscana virus and SFTS virus NSs.
