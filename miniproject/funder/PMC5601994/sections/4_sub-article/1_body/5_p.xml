<p>We agree, however B factors in a crystal assembly do reflect the quality of packing, or the definition of interfaces. A lower degree of order within an interface would make this interface less stable. We have changed the text to avoid any ambiguity, and added a reference to highlight that B factors have been used to distinguish biological interfaces from packing artifacts.</p>
