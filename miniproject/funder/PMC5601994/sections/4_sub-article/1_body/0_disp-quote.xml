 <p>Major Comment:</p>
 <p>Given the reservations expressed above, we ask that the title be modified to remove the adjective "pathogenic" with regard to the nuclear filaments. In addition, we also ask that the Discussion section of the paper be edited to bring up the limitations of the study, as discussed above, making it clear to the reader that the relevance of the fibrils for diseases causation remains to be established. We note that the structural information provided here should facilitate such studies, a point that the authors could make to balance the principal weakness of the work, while not ignoring that weakness.</p>
