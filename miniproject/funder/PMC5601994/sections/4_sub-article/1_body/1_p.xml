<p>The title was changed as suggested. We added a statement to the end of the Discussion to highlight that this study did not attempt to establish a role of NSs filament formation for pathogenicity, and that this is a clear limitation of our work. Establishing the role of filament formation for virulence, which may require animal models, is beyond the scope of our structural and cell-based approach. For instance the observation of similar plaque sizes caused by virus variants studied here does not shed light on the role of NSs filaments in pathogenesis, since NSs protein is not required for viral replication and cell infection. However lack of NSs results in loss of virulence in animal models. We believe the structural data and insight into the molecular determinants of NSs polymerization will greatly facilitate future studies aimed at understanding the role of NSs filaments. It will help answering the questions why RVFV appears to be the only virus inducing such filaments, and if this is in any way linked with the unique spectrum of pathologies associated with RVFV infections, in particular fetal deformities and abortions, which are a hallmark of RVFV.</p>
