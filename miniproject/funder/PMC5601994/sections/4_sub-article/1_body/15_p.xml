<p>We believe the figure is not essential for the paper, but useful for highlighting how a full-length NSs fibril might be based on the NSs-ΔNΔC core fibril. The C-terminal tails have been shown to be natively unfolded, and therefore adding them to the fibril model as extended randomly oriented extensions is justifiable. The figure is now a supplementary figure (
