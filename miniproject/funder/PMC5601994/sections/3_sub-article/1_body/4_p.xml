<p>This manuscript is clear and very well written. The structural studies are excellent, as is the analysis of the fibrils found in the lattice. The figures are clear, and they helped to convey the three-dimensional lattice and fibril interactions. The structure of the RVFV bunyaviral NSs protein is important and will help the field better understand the function of this key virulence factor. The identification of a soluble and crystallizable NSs fragment that can form physiologically relevant fibril contacts in the crystal is a technical achievement.</p>
