<p>The authors identified a soluble monomeric fragment of NSs using gel filtration and NMR. The 2.2 Å structure of the NSs core was determined by phasing with sulfur anomalous signals, and was found to be a novel fold consisting of 8 α-helices. In the crystal, NSs forms two types of fibrils, each with two-start helical symmetry. The authors demonstrated that these fibrils have diameters similar to those observed by thin-section EM in Vero-E6 cells infected with RVFV. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RVFV containing the crystallized fragment of NSs formed similar nuclear filaments as wild-type RVFV. However, viruses containing an NSs gene with either of two structure-based mutations aimed at disrupting the "F1"-type fibril-forming contacts did not form any nuclear filaments in infected cells. The viruses bearing the mutant proteins grew to similar titers and had similar plaque morphologies as the wild-type. The authors conclude that the F1 fibril-forming interface in the crystal (the stronger of the two interfaces) corresponds to the physiological interface responsible for NSs filament formation during RVFV infection. The authors note that the N- and C-terminal tails containing putative protein interaction regions, including the putative SAP30 interaction region, are exposed on the surface of F1 NSs fibrils.</p>
