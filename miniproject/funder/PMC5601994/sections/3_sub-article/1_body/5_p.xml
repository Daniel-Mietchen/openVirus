<p>The reviewers recognize that a weakness of this study is that it does not address the question of whether filament formation is important for NSs function. The authors speculate that the NSs fibrils may promote infection by sequestering NSs binding partners, but it remains unclear whether NSs filaments have any proviral activity beyond that of soluble NSs. Indeed, the finding that the NSs-mutant RVFVs do not form NSs filaments but have the same infectivity as wild-type virus in cell culture, and the lack of conservation of fibril-forming residues in NSs in other phleboviruses (despite predicted conservation of the overall fold of NSs in the genus), suggest that NSs filament formation may not play a fundamental role in the viral replication cycle. Additionally, although the site-directed mutagenesis lends support to the authors' conclusion that the F1 fibrils represent the architecture of NSs filaments in vivo, the data do not rule out the possibility that the native full-length NSs filaments have an alternative conformation in vivo. While recognizing these limitations of the present work, we have concluded that the paper represents a sufficient level of new information concerning this important virus for publication in
