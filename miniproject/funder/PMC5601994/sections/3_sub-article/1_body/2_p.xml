<p>In this study Barski et al. describe the crystal structure of the non-structural protein NSs from Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the Bunyaviridae. NSs is an important virulence factor that impedes interferon production by at least three mechanisms: binding to the p44 subunit of TFIIH; binding to SAP30; and targeting the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR for degradation. Moreover, RVFV NSs forms nuclear filaments, which have been reported to associate with pericentromeric DNA, potentially causing chromosomal segregation defects.</p>
