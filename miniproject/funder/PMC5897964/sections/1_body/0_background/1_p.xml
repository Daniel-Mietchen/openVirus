<p id="Par5">Enteroviruses are non-enveloped single stranded RNA viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> within the family of 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. Seven species of 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> are associated with human disease: 
 <italic>Enterovirus A-D</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhinovirus A-C</italic>. While rhinoviruses commonly cause mild respiratory illness, enteroviruses A-D (EVs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Prior to being reclassified as EV A-D, EVs were originally classified as polioviruses (PV) 1–3, coxsackieviruses (CV) A1–24 and B1–6, echoviruses (E) 1–33 and numbered enteroviruses (68–121) [
