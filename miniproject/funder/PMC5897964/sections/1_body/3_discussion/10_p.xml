<p id="Par35">All the serotyping assays used in the current study, including the EV-A71 specific RT-PCR, VP1 and VP4/VP2 sequencing have previously shown their efficient performance in clinical samples. The application of these assays in samples of patients with CNS infection would help to improve serotyping yield. However, the overall serotyping success rate for patients with CNS infection in the current study was low (58%) as compared to previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This may be due to low viral load or nucleic acid degradation after long-term storage. The low serotyping success rate (25%) of respiratory samples can be explained by the sole use of VP4/VP2 sequencing assay. However, sample degradation and false positivity for EV using generic PCR among RV co-infected patients (68.5%) could not be excluded. Other drawbacks of the current study included the small sample size, the sporadic and expanded geographical distribution of cases that hampered our further analyses for serotype-associated seasonality and geographics [
