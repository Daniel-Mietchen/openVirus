<p id="Par34">Data from this study showed that among patients with CNS infection, children had a higher rate of co-infection than adults. Here, this was due to the fact that both swabs and CSF were used in the diagnostics for children while only CSF was used for adults. In addition, children may be more vulnerable to viral infection than adults, particularly to the locally endemic viruses JEV (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) and DENV (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) [

As JEV and DENV infections are commonly associated with severe disease and mortality, the contribution of EV to the disease phenotype of these cases is uncertain. Similarly, in patients with respiratory infection, the clinical significance of EV infection should be interpreted with caution because of the high rate of co-infection with more common respiratory viruses [
