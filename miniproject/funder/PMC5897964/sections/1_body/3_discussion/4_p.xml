<p id="Par29">EV-D68 has recently been recognized as an important cause of respiratory illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. EV-D68 emergence was first reported from two childrenâ€™s hospitals in the USA in August 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and, shortly after, from countries across the Americas, Europe, and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Here, EV-D68 accounted for 8/31 successfully typed enteroviruses from patients with respiratory illness recruited between 2009 and 2010. It remains unknown why EV-D68 has been circulating in Viet Nam for some time but has not been associated with outbreaks as observed in the USA and other countries in Southeast Asia. We have recently reported an in depth phylogenetic analysis of these EV-D68 viruses showing that their introduction into Viet Nam may have already occurred in 2008 [
