<p id="Par13">Nested RT-PCR for viral protein 1 (VP1) and complete viral protein 4 and partial viral protein 2 (VP4/VP2) was carried out using previously described assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. VP1 RT-PCR of samples from patients with CNS infection was primarily performed using the assay described by Leitch et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and alternatively, the VP1 assay described by Oberste et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The VP4/VP2 assay described by Mirand et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was applied to all samples from patients with respiratory infection and to samples from patients with CNS infection with negative VP1 RT-PCRs. There was no major modification of the original assays except the use of Superscript III reverse transcriptase with Platinum 
 <italic>Taq</italic> (Invitrogen) in the first round RT-PCR and Hotstar Taq DNA polymerase (QIAgen) in the second round PCR and the adaptation of thermal cycling conditions as per supplier’s instructions. In the three assays, 5 μl of viral RNA were used in the first round one-step RT-PCR and then 0.5 μl of the first round PCR product was transferred to the second round PCR reaction.
