<p id="Par10">Data and samples from 5 prospective observational clinical studies on CNS (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and respiratory (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) infections, conducted in Viet Nam between 1997 and 2010 were used [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients were enrolled according to study-specific case definitions for CNS infection, acute respiratory infection and lower respiratory tract infection. The three CNS studies were conducted to determine the etiology of CNS infections in children in Children’s Hospital 1 in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] (2004), and in adults in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases (1997–2008) and in a network of 12 provincial hospitals in the southern and central part of Viet Nam (2007–2010). In these three studies, CSF was obtained from all participants, while throat and rectal swabs were only taken from children. The two respiratory infections studies were conducted to study lower respiratory tract infection in hospitalized children under 2 years of age in two main paediatric hospitals in HCMC (2009–2010) and the antibiotic use in out-patients with acute respiratory infections in Children’s Hospital 1 in HCMC (2009–2010). Respiratory swabs were taken from all enrolled children. Patients positive for generic EV RT-PCRs in CSF or swabs from these studies and with diagnostic specimens available were included in this study. The geographical distribution of included patients is shown in Additional file
