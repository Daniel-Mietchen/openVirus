<p id="Par16">Serotype assignments for VP1 and VP4/VP2 sequences were performed using an automated phylogenetic-based enterovirus typing tool developed by Kroneman et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/enterovirus/typingtool/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/enterovirus/typingtool/</ext-link>. Because the automated typing tool can determine VP4/VP2 sequences at species level only [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], further serotype determination for VP4/VP2 sequences was based on highest nucleotide identity score (HNIS) and highest amino acid sequence similarity (HAASS) with reference prototypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In case of discrepancy, final assignment was based on HAASS and further confirmed using BLAST [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
