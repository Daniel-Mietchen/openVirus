<p id="Par12">EV-A71 detection and typing of samples from patients with CNS infection was performed using real-time RT-PCR as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In brief, 2 μl of viral RNA were subjected to one-step real-time RT-PCR reaction using the SuperScript III One-Step qRT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cycling conditions included one cycle of 60 °C for 3 min, followed by 15 min at 53 °C and 2 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 53 °C (including data acquisition) and 15 s at 72 °C.
