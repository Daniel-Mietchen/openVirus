<p id="Par15">Nucleotide sequences of the VP1 and VP4/VP2 were assembled using Vector NTI Â® Express software v7.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). All the sequences have been submitted to GenBank (MH021887-MH021955). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using BioEdit software v7.0.9 (Ibis Therapeutics, CA, USA) and with the inclusion of reference prototype sequences obtained from GenBank. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed in MEGA software v7.0.26 (
