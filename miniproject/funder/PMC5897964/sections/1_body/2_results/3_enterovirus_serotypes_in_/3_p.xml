<p id="Par25">Among patients with respiratory disease 13 different serotypes of four enterovirus species were identified by VP4/VP2 sequence analysis including A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, 2 serotypes), B (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11, 7 serotypes), C (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 3 serotypes), and D (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8, 1 serotype). CV-A24 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) and EV-D68 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) were the two most common serotypes detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) and these viruses had a close genetic relationship in phylogenetic tree analyses (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
