<p id="Par24">Twenty-one different serotypes belonging to 3 enterovirus species: EV A (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12, 3 serotypes), B (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30, 16 serotypes), and C (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4, 2 serotypes) were identified in patients with CNS infection. The identification of these serotypes was achieved by EV-A71 specific RT-PCR (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8; Additional file 4: Table S2), VP1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 22; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2) and VP4/VP2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 16; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3) sequencing. EV B was the only species detected in adults and the most common species in both swabs and CSF from children (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). EV-A71 was the most commonly detected single serotype, in 9 swabs and 1 CSF of 10 children. Three of these children had a clinical diagnosis of HFMD while the other 7 children had a clinical diagnosis of encephalitis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S2). There was no specific serotype associated with fatal outcome (Additional file 4: Table S1).
