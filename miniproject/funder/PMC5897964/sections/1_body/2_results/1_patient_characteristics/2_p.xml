<p id="Par19">Among patients with CNS infection (
 <italic>n</italic> = 79), 51 were children (median age 2 years, interquartile range [IRQ]: 1–5) and 28 were adults (20 years, IRQ: 17–29.5). All adults had EV detected in CSF and 93% (26/28) had meningitis as discharge diagnosis. Of the 51 children, 10 had EV detected in CSF, and the remaining (41/51) had EV detected in respiratory and/or rectal swabs. Encephalitis was the most common discharge diagnosis (30/41). Fifteen deaths were noted, and all were children with EV detected in swabs only (Table
