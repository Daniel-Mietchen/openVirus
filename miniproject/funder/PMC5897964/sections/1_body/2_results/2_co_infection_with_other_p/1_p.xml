 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most co-infected children (13/14) had EV detected in swabs only. Of the 15 documented fatal cases, 7 were serologically confirmed to have co-infection with dengue virus (DENV; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) (Additional file 4: Table S1). Among the 3 co-infected adults, 2 had cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA detected in CSF and 1 had positive CSF culture with
