    <bold>Figure S3.</bold> Phylogenetic tree analysis of VP4/VP2 enteroviral sequences. A middle-point rooted tree of VP4/VP2 (420 bp) sequences showing the genetic relationship among species and serotypes of the current study (filled triangles and circles) and with reference prototypes. Filled triangles indicate sequences derived from patients with CNS infection and filled circles indicate sequences derived from patients with respiratory infection. (TIFF 1075 kb)
