<p id="Par20">It has been known that humans express α-2,3 and α-2,6 SAs in the lower and upper respiratory tracts, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. But, it has been also reported that humans express both α-2,3 and α-2,6 SAs at a similar level in the upper respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Given the availability of animal models that reflect human respiratory diseases, we conceptually suggest human, swine, and ferret respiratory tracts in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, based on the study of de Graaf et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Human or swine IAVs with α-2,6 SA specificity would be trapped in the upper respiratory tract of the respective host, where α-2,6 SA is abundant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Some replicating viruses may overflow down to the lower respiratory tract, where both α-2,3 and α-2,6 SAs are expressed. Avian IAVs with α-2,3 SA specificity would be also trapped in the upper respiratory tract by α-2,3 SA, but replicate poorly due to the unfavorable temperature. Under such circumstances, only a high dose of avian IAVs allows to escape the trapping in the upper respiratory tract and reach the lower respiratory tract, where the temperature is more favorable for avian IAVs. Even though avian IAVs might overflow from the lower respiratory tract up to the upper respiratory tract, the virus might not replicate there due to the unfavorable temperature, unless there was the PB2 E627K mutation. This may be the reason that avian IAVs are not easily transmissible between humans. In terms of viral adaptation, a rare appearance of avian IAV mutants with α-2,6 SA specificity may not have special selective growth advantages in the lower respiratory tract of humans due to the overwhelming dominance of α-2,3 SA. Only when avian IAVs replicating in the upper respiratory tract, although poorly, acquires the PB2 E627K mutation or a reassortment, with or without acquisition of α-2,6 SA specificity at the same time, the variants may grow out well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Serial passaging of a wild-type H5N1 HPAIV in ferrets could not make the virus airborne transmissible between ferrets, but only those containing the mutations conferring the human type α-2,6 SA specificity and PB2 E627K could acquire airborne transmissibility after several passages in ferrets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Basically, these experiments suggest that, even if a rare mutant retaining the human-type receptor specificity and PB2 determinants might appear during replication of avian IAVs, the mutant might not be easily selected to a domination over multiple passages, at least in ferrets. The reason may be that avian IAVs have their niche of efficient replication in the lower respiratory tract of human, swine, or ferret (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The issue of avian IAV adaptation in humans may not be whether adaptive mutations appears but whether there is a selective force enough for a virus to possess adaptive mutations to grow out to dominance.
