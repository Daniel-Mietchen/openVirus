<p id="Par13">Non-reservoir animals used for influenza virus infection experiments include ferrets, mice, guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, and non-human primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. Historically, the discovery of the first human influenza virus was made by infecting ferrets with throat washings of influenza patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Ferrets could also be readily infected with swine influenza virus. The different species of guinea pigs, mice, rabbits, hamsters, hedgehogs, and monkeys did not develop flu-like symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. However, these asymptomatic animals have become useful for special purposes of influenza virus infection experiments now because virus detection and titration methods have become sophisticated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Especially, mice and guinea pigs are the most accessible animal models cost- and space-wise. In the case of mice, human infecting influenza viruses do not usually infect mice well, which is overcome by adapting the virus in mice through serial passages [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Mice express the avian type α-2,3 SA in the lower respiratory tract, similarly as humans, but not the human type α-2,6 SA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. This is in line with the tendency of experimentally inoculated avian IAVs, regardless of low-pathogenic (LPAIV) or highly pathogenic avian IAVs (HPAIV), being mouse lethal with a relatively low 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. As far as seasonal isolates of human IAVs are concerned, DBA/2 mice have been shown to be highly susceptible to diverse strains of un-adapted IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Ferrets, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters could be infected with most of IAVs without adaptation, but only guinea pigs could be infected with IBV without adaptation and supported the airborne transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Syrian hamster has been tried to replace mice because IAVs could infect it without adaptation and there were airborne transmissions among Syrian hamsters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. However, since guinea pigs can be infected with un-adapted IBVs as well as IAVs and support airborne transmissions, which is readily detectable by the nasal wash titer, any advantage of Syrian hamsters over guinea pigs awaits further reports of the use of animal models in influenza virus research. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are genetically closest to humans. Although NHPs are not a readily accessible animal model, NHPs are indispensable in the cases of vaccine and antiviral tests, where data relevant to humans in terms of pharmacokinetics and physiology are critical [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. ‘Animal Efficacy Rule’ of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires for the therapeutics to demonstrate efficacy in two animal models manifesting human-like symptoms including at least one non-rodent model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Although the needs of testing in NHP models are clearly present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>], most laboratories cannot afford NHPs, and there is other ethical uneasiness about using NHPs. How best to do without NHPs may be a persisting issue in search of appropriate animal models. In the case of influenza virus research, among the frequently used animal models, ferrets appear to be the only non-rodent model other than NHPs [
