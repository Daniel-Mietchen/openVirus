<p id="Par17">Viral pathogenicity is related to host cell tropism but may be separate from the susceptibility of hosts to the virus. IAVs are pathogenic to humans but not guinea pigs, although both are permissive to the virus. The degree of pathogenicity, the virulence of an IAV, is inevitably associated with how well the virus replicates in a tissue or an organ, impairment of which results in a serious disease. In cases of respiratory viruses, those replicating in the lower respiratory tract tend to be more pathogenic than those in the upper respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. Therefore, viral pathogenicity is closely related to inherent replication ability and receptor specificity of the virus. An avian IAV with PB2 K627 has been shown to replicate better in both upper and lower respiratory tracts in mice and more pathogenic to the infected mice than with PB2 E627 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>], although was more pathogenic to mice than the seasonal H1N1 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. Droplet transmissibility of pdm2009 in ferrets was shown to be slightly lower than the seasonal H1N1 virus whereas their contact transmissibilities were equally efficient [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. This suggests that antigenic novelty might play a more important role for the pandemic potential of a certain IAV than viral transmissibility.
