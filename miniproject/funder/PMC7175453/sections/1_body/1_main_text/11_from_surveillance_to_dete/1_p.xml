<p id="Par16">Surveillance of newly emerging IAVs may be approached in two ways; isolating and sequencing a virus using next-generation sequencing (NGS). As we discussed above, it is not enough to look for the molecular determinants by sequencing. Even though full genome sequences are recovered, and their evolutionary relationships are reconstructed, further studies using the viruses should be carried out [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. The classical method of growing viruses in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and human airway epithelial A549 cells might be the first step after a genetic sequence analysis. The MDCK cells express both α-2,3 and α-2,6 SAs and support replication of influenza viruses ubiquitously due to the lack of the Mx protein anti-influenza signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. Therefore, viral growth in the MDCK cells is considered to evaluate the inherent growth potential of the viruses under such a condition where no innate and adaptive immune responses of the host are counted in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. On the other hand, the A549 cells, expressing more α-2,6 SA than α-2,3 SA like in the human upper respiratory tract, may indicate the growth potential of the viruses in the human upper respiratory tract [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. Any swine isolates – avian, swine endemic, or reassortant origin – showing equivalent to or better growth rates in MDCK and A549 cells than the swine-origin pdm2009 virus may be further studied for their pathogenicity and transmissibility in animal models, to determine their pandemic potential.
