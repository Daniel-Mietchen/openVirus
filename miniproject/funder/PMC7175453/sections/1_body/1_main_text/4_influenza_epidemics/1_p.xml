<p id="Par9">The sudden reappearance of 1950s seasonal H1N1 strains in 1977 that was dubbed ‘Russian flu’ right after the 1976 swine IAV epidemic spurred the awareness of the need for pandemic planning [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although the virus had rapidly spread among people under 25 years of age and had been ‘drifting’ as seasonal strains until the appearance of the pdm2009 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the 1977 H1N1 virus may not be considered a pandemic virus. The virus was only a reappearance of previous human IAV most likely by an accidental release and met an immunity gap among young people. The virus was not of a nonhuman reservoir origin, according to the pandemic ingredients summarized above. In case of the H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAVs, they may lack efficient transmissibility to and between humans. However, as shown in ferret studies, they should be under close surveillance for their pandemic potential in advance. In addition to these avian IAVs, swine IAVs should be also monitored because novel strains can be generated by genetic reassortment in swine between avian and human IAVs, as presented in the genesis of pdm2009. In contrast to IAVs, IBVs do not have animal reservoirs, so they might be considered a virus of less pandemic potential.
