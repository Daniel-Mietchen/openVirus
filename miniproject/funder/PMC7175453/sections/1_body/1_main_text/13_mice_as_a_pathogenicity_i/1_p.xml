<p id="Par18">Ferrets have been known to have human-like glycan distributions in their respiratory tract and may develop respiratory symptom after IAV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. However, although most human IAVs including swine IAVs are not pathogenic to mice, mice could be a good initial testing model in terms of cost and handling easiness compared with ferrets, especially for an isolate containing avian origin HAs. Since mice have α-2,3 SA in the lower respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], avian IAVs tend to be pathogenic to mice without a prior adaptation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. Therefore, viral pathogenicity in mice could be an initial pathogenicity indicator of certain IAVs. The first pdm2009 isolate CA04 was more pathogenic in BALB/c mice than the later pdm2009 isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. The pdm2009 isolates from fatal cases were also more pathogenic in mice than from the mild cases, and replacing the HA of the mild case isolate with that from the fatal case could make a more pathogenic virus in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. These experiments show that IAV pathogenicity in mice may reflect inherent lung pathogenicity of IAVs in humans. However, the results of mouse experiments should be interpreted in comparison with a pathologically well-characterized control.
