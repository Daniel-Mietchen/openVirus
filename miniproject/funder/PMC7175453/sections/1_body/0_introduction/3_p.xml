<p id="Par4">Before the H1N1 pandemic inÂ 2009 (pdm2009), an avian H5N1 IAV had been remarked as a strong candidate that would cause a next pandemic given accumulating human infection cases with the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Recently, an avian H7N9 virus has become the focus of attention concerning the increasing number of human infection cases in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, it is important to remember that pdm2009 was caused unexpectedly by a swine origin IAV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], emphasizing the importance of the surveillance of swine IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There are also other subtypes of avian HA and NA isolated from human influenza cases sporadically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Given their pandemic potential, we need to assess these human-infecting zoonotic IAVs in detail by comparing with the viruses that had caused past influenza pandemics.
