<p id="Par2">Of the four types of influenza viruses, influenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) cause major respiratory diseases to humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The IAVs can be classified into different subtypes by the antigenicity of surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin(HA) and NA(neuraminidase). So far, 18 and 11 subtypes have been identified from the HA and NA proteins, respectively, and the last two subtypes (17 and 18 subtypes in HA and 10 and 11 subtypes in NA) were recently discovered from bats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. All other subtypes (H1 through H16 and N1 through N9) have been identified in aquatic birds, which are considered as the main reservoirs of IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast to the IAVs, IBVs are classified into two antigenically distinct lineages, namely Victoria and Yamagata [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While the IAVs infect diverse avian and mammalian hosts including humans, the IBVs are circulating mostly among human beings with a few exceptions of spillover cases reported in seals and swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IAV and IBV infections show similar clinical signs of ‘influenza-like illness’ and outcomes [
