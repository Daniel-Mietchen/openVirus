<p>With the success of the global effort to scale up ART access, LMICs, particularly those in SSA, in which mortality has been dominated by HIV over the past decades, will start to experience syndemics. Increasingly, mortality attributable to NCDs will be greater than communicable diseases as it is in the rest of the world. Improved data collection and surveillance of NCDs among HIV-infected persons in LMICs are necessary to inform integrated NCD-HIV prevention, care, and treatment models that are effective across a range of geographic settings. Implementation of integrated care will strengthen current health systems and facilitate a platform for more comprehensive and less fragmented health care delivery as well as M&amp;E systems. These efforts will preserve the considerable investments that have been made to prevent lives lost to HIV, promote healthy aging of PLHIV, and contribute to meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [

Additional incremental investments in NCD management among PLHIV could broaden health care coverage and support a research agenda, which would benefit both PLHIV and the general population. Furthermore, as countries start to achieve HIV epidemic control, the integration of HIV and NCD management will provide a transition plan for extending the comprehensive care provided to PLHIV to the general population; this will facilitate the goal of improved overall access to health care.
