<p>Registries range from a low-tech paper-based format to a higher-tech electronic format. An electronic medical records (EMRs) system is ideal because it allows for the data to be collected in real-time from a linked EMRs system, and individual or cohort outcomes can be more easily monitored. However, an EMR is not necessary [

Collecting patient data and manually creating a registry is time-consuming and takes health care staff away from patient care [
