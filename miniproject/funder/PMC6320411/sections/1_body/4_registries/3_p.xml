<p>The creation of registries is important and prudent because the current management of NCDs is, in many places, unstructured and unmonitored. Through the creation of registries, health care systems can gain the ability to collect data on NCDs [

However, it is important to ensure that any new data collection requirements render useful information and do not create an additional burden for the health care staff. Registries can also be structured to give feedback on performance, which serves as a benchmark to determine the quality of care and quality improvement at the level of individual providers, health care teams, or clinics. Registries can also be used to support clinical decision making; to allow providers to be proactive rather than reactive, for example, by setting up patient reminders about needed services or follow-up visits; and to share data throughout a practice, among practices, and potentially throughout an entire health care system.
