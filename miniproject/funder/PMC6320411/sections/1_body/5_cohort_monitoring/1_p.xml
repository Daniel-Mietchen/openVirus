<p>An important use of registries is cohort monitoring [
 <xref rid="ref64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], which is inspired by directly observed treatment, short-course for tuberculosis and provides a useful way of assessing whether interventions, as specified in the country guidelines for NCDs, are being performed as well as to track performance and progress of the intervention. This allows the country to review the progressive scale-up of those alive and on treatment and see where these patients are being treated (hospital, urban health center, rural health center, or private clinic). Furthermore, individual patient data can be deidentified and aggregated to determine morbidity and mortality levels for NCDs generally, generate incidence and prevalence rates of complications, and assess performance at local and national levels [

 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] has been reported.
