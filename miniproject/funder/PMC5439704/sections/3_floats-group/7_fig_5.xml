  <title>Gene ontology enrichment terms and KEGG pathway analysis of the predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs.</title>
  <p>The DAVID web-based tool was used to analyze (A) biological process, (B) molecular function and (C) cellular component. GO functional enrichment annotations exhibit in pie charts of the left panel. Bars indicate the number of GOs annotated as unique GO terms and are presented in the right panel. (D) There are 85 pathways in total, as depicted in the pie chart.</p>
