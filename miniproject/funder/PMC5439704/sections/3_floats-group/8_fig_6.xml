  <title>Complexity of the miRNA-regulation networks after infection with EV71 and CA16.</title>
  <p>miRNAs are depicted as a red colored node at (A), (B) and (C). (A) miRNA-targets network. The targets are displayed by light blue color rounded rectangles. (B) miRNA-GOs network. GO term nodes are depicted as green color rounded rectangles. Edges in the network represent inhibitory effect of miRNAs on GOs. (C) miRNA-pathways network. Purple rectangle-shaped nodes denote pathways. Edges indicate a negative correlation between miRNA and pathways. (D) Co-expression network were constructed by adhesion-related targets. Red nodes are target genes and yellow nodes are co-expression genes. Genes with bigger size are more centralized in the network and have a stronger capacity of modulating adjacent genes. Different color lines mean the different interactions between these genes. (E) Hierarchical GO categories of genes involved in adhesions. A 
   <italic>P</italic> value cutoff of 0.05 was used to determine significantly enriched GOs. The color gradient of the yellow nodes, from light to dark, displays the P value, from high to low (the lower the P value, the greater the GO significance level). White nodes are no significant.
