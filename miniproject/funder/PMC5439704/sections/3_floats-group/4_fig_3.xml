  <title>qRT-PCR validation of differentially expressed miRNAs and partial predicted target genes.</title>
  <p>(A) Eight significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were chosen to perform qRT-PCR validation. Data from qRT-PCR analysis are shown as mean ± SEM (N = 3). N, Times of the experiment was performed. Expression changes are in the same direction as determined by the miRNAs sequencing. (B) Six predicted target genes were detected. The data were calculated as mean ± SEM from triplicates with normalization by β-actin.</p>
