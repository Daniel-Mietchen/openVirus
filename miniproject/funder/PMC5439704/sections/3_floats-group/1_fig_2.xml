  <title>Details of all miRNAs.</title>
  <p>(A) Principal component analysis (PCA) showing the distribution and clustering of the individual sample groups. Each spot represents a single array. EV71/CA16-infected samples were distinct from the Con sample. (B) Venn diagram representing Known differentially expressed miRNAs.(C) Time- and strain-specific regulation of differential miRNAs during EV71 and CA16 infections. The columns correspond to expression patterns of differentially expressed miRNAs during the EV71 and CA16 infections relative to Con samples at 6 hpi and 12 hpi. Significance was determined using a fold-change threshold of at least 2 and a P value cutoff of 0.05. The intensity of the miRNA expression is indicated in green (lower level of expression) and red (higher level of expression). Dendrograms between samples and between miRNAs are depicted, where the closest branches of the tree represents samples/miRNAs with the most similar expression pattern.</p>
