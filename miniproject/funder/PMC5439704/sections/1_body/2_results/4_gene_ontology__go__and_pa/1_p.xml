<p>To gain insight into the possible regulatory roles of the 27 known differentially expressed miRNAs in EV71 and CA16 infections, we used the TargetScan and miRDB programs to predict the potential targets of these miRNAs[

 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We found that 2,305 genes were predicted to be potential targets with TargetScan, whereas 3,449 genes were predicted to be potential targets with miRDB (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177657.s004">S2 Fig</xref>). Then GO was introduced into the analysis to reveal functions significantly associated with the predicted target gene candidates of the altered miRNAs. Predicted target functions were classified into 3 core categories: biological process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), molecular function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), and cellular component (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Biological process included ontology rhythmic process, response to stimulus, reproduction, multicellular organismal process, metabolic process, locomotion, localization, immune system process, developmental process, cellular process, cellular component organization or biogenesis, cell killing, biological regulation, and biological adhesion. The molecular function category included transporter activity, translation regulator activity, structural molecule activity, signal transducer activity, receptor activity, channel regulator activity, catalytic activity, binding, and antioxidant activity. The cellular component category included synapse, organelle, membrane, macromolecular complex, extracellular region, extracellular matrix, cell part, and cell junction. Afterward, the predicted targets genes were subjected to the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the PANTHER Classification System. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, 85 pathways were identified, suggesting that these signaling pathways are regulated by the differentially expressed miRNAs during viral infection. Among these pathways, many were intimately correlated with immune regulation (e.g., the apoptosis signaling pathway, B-cell activation, interferon-gamma signaling pathway, interleukin signaling pathway, Toll receptor signaling, T-cell activation, etc.), adhesion signaling (e.g., cadherin signaling pathway, cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPase, Wnt signaling pathway, etc.) and nervous system function (e.g., axon guidance mediated by netrin, synaptic vesicle trafficking, etc.), which suggested that these alterations involved different immune responses, cell adhesion, and neurological symptoms induced by EV71 or CA16 infection.
