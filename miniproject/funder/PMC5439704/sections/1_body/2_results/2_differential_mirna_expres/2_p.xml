<p>Subsequently, the data for all differentially expressed miRNAs were graphed into a Venn diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Common and distinct differentially expressed known miRNAs in response to EV71 and CA16 infection across all time points were displayed. Simultaneously, a total of 135 known differentially expressed miRNAs in all groups were submitted to unsupervised hierarchical clustering to construct a heat map based on the differential expression patterns with log 2 values (infected/control) and fold changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). A positive log 2 value indicated upregulation and a negative log 2 value indicated downregulation. The heat map exhibited marked discrepancies for the same strain at different times as well as for different strains at the same times following infection. Moreover, the hierarchical clusters of groups were in accordance with the result of PCA. Therefore, these results elucidated that known miRNA expression patterns following infection of EV71 and CA16 are strain- and time-specific.
