<p>Ultimately, to verify the expression patterns of the known miRNAs, 8 differentially expressed miRNAs, namely, miRNA-3196, miRNA-5708, miRNA-4286, miRNA-5095, miRNA-204-5p, miRNA-1972, miRNA-4448 and miRNA-4531 were randomly selected from the high-throughput sequencing for qRT-PCR analysis. Overall, except for miRNA-204-5p, most of the qRT-PCR results of other miRNAs were quite consistent with the results from sequencing data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Therefore, these results reinforced the reliability of the sequencing data and we concluded that the difference of miRNA-204-5p was primarily due to the limitations associated with the use of qRT-PCR technology.
