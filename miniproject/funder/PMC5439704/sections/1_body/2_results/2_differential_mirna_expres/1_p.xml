<p>To investigate the changes in miRNA expression profiles in HUVECs during EV71 and CA16 infection, all the mappable sRNA sequences were first compared with the currently known 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> miRNAs in the miRBase 19 database; then these miRNA expression patterns following infection were compared with those of the controls. In this study, only those known differentially expressed miRNAs with a threshold 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05 and a minimum absolute fold difference of 2.0 between the control and infected data sets are described. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177657.t002">Table 2</xref>, after 72 hpi with EV71 treatment, 34 miRNAs were significantly changed, with 14 being upregulated and 20 downregulated. After 96 hpi with EV71 treatment, 39 miRNAs were remarkably changed, with 14 and 25 being up- and downregulated, respectively. After 72 hpi with CA16 challenge, 64 miRNAs were notably altered; 12 miRNAs were upregulated and 52 miRNAs were downregulated. After 96 hpi with CA16 challenge, 92 miRNAs were obviously altered; 36 miRNAs were upregulated and 56 miRNAs were downregulated.
