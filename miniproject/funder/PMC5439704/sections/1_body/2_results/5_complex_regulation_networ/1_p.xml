<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the regulatory functions of miRNAs, we built miRNA regulatory networks to elaborate the interactions among miRNAs and genes, GOs, and pathways. First, to confirm the key target genes, we looked for intersections of related genes in the results of our GO and pathway analyses. A total of 91 common target genes were determined by Venn diagram; these are listed in

Next, 26 known differentially expressed miRNAs, 11 GOs involved in biological processes, and 81 pathways were identified by refining the correlations among the 91 target genes and the miRNAs, GOs, and pathways. Consequently, by integrating these correlations, interaction networks between miRNAs and targets (
