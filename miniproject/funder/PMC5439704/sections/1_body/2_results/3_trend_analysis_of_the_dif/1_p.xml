<p>Based on previous studies which revealed that there were remarkable differences between EV71 and CA16 infections from clinical observation and experiment data of animal models, we hypothesized that the reasons probably depended on the fact that the host miRNAs induced by CA16 infection might be distinct from those that are induced by EV71 infection. Furthermore, although EV71 and CA16 infections stimulate many common miRNAs, some of the induced miRNAs show opposite trends between the viruses. Trend analysis of miRNA expression dynamics was used to profile the differentially expressed miRNAs and to identify the most probable set of clusters generated in the time series. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g004">Fig 4</xref>, we observed that 30 known differentially expressed miRNAs were all separately and gradually increased and decreased in EV71 and CA16 infection in the time series, indirectly suggesting that they may greatly contribute to the key distinctions induced by the two viruses. To further narrow down the predominant differentially expressed miRNAs, we defined a screening criterion as follows: if the 2 ratios (EV71-72h/CA16-72h and EV71-96h/CA16-96h) of one of the 30 known differentially expressed miRNAs fell between 0.5 and 2, it was eliminated (
