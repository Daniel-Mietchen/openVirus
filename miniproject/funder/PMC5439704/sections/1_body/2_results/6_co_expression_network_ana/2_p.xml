<p>Subsequently, we chose the 6 targets to further measure and confirm the miRNA sequencing data. In general, the expression levels of these miRNAs and their targets presented an inverse relationship based on the regulatory mechanisms of the miRNAs. Except for NTN1, the expression levels of target genes were inversely correlated with the expression patterns of the miRNAs regulating these target genes (
