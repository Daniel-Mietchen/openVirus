<p>In this part, we specifically looked into the hierarchical GO categories of the deregulated miRNA-associated targets with the biological adhesion derived from the previously described biological process analysis. In this biological process category produced by the GO analysis, 8 known differentially expressed miRNAs and 6 targets were found to participate in biological adhesion (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177657.t004">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, these targets were used to build a co-expression network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), which contained adhesion molecules (e.g., PVRL3, PVRL4, and CTNNB1, etc.), nervous regulation molecules that participated in axon extension and cell migration during neural development (e.g., UNC5C and UNC5A), and cellular structure formation–related molecules involved in the establishment of cell polarity (e.g., PARD3), among others. These targets and co-expression genes may provide new information regarding the underlying distinct mechanisms caused by EV71 and CA16 infection. In addition, in order to investigate the inner functions of the genes involved in our gene network on the ontology level, these targets were also submitted to a hierarchical GO categories analysis. The results of this pointed to statistically significantly enriched GO terms among the given gene list based on their hypergeometric probability. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, the 6 targets are seen to be significantly enriched in 5 key biological processes, including cell proliferation (e.g., epithelial cell proliferation), cell adhesion (e.g., cell-cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, etc.), signal transduction (e.g., small GTPase–mediated signal transduction and Ras protein signal transduction), nervous regulation (e.g., regulation of synapse organization, regulation of nervous system development, etc.), and interplay between host and virus (e.g., initiation of viral infection, entry into host cell, etc.). Hence, according to these findings, we proposed that 8 known differentially expressed miRNAs may indirectly mediate these GOs, which might harbor significance and/or contribute to the pathogenesis and biochemical characteristics of HFMD patients afflicted with EV71 or CA16 infection.
