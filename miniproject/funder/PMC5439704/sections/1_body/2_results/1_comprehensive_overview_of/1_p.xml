<p>In order to evaluate the effects of EV71 and CA16 infection on miRNA expression in HUVECs, 6 small RNA (sRNA) libraries were constructed and submitted to Illumina sequencing. The details of the resultant sequencing data generation for the subsequent analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0177657.t001">Table 1</xref>. The read classification of different sRNAs types-including miRNA, miscellaneous RNA (misc_RNA), pseudogenes, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and snRNA were identified in the samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177657.s003">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that sRNAs showed dynamic changes in both the EV71- and CA16-infected samples. Additionally, in all libraries, the majority of the sRNAs were 20 to 24nt long, with 22 nt being most abundant, as is typical for Dicer-derived products. Thereafter, the discrete degree of each sample group was examined using PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177657.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The results revealed the distribution and clustering of the individual group samples. The Con group and infected groups formed tightly separate clusters, whereas the EV71- and CA16-infected groups were grouped closely together. These results indicate that there was a notable disparity between the EV71-infected and CA16-infected groups.
