<p>In conclusion, for the first time, this study has demonstrated, by small RNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics approaches, that EV71 and CA16 infections result in specific miRNA expression patterns in HUVECs. More studies are needed to dissect the relevant roles of miRNAs in viral pathogenesis. GO and pathway analysis of the predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were screened from trend analysis and provided comprehensive information about the discrepant biological functions and pathways involved EV71 and CA16 infection. Furthermore, the construction of detailed regulatory networks alsorevealed a global perspective for exploring miRNA-mediated mechanisms. Consequently, it is worth noting that the 8 known differentially expressed miRNAs related to biological adhesion identified in this study are the key miRNAs that modulate cellular junctions in HUVECs and compromise the permeability barrier of HUVECs; these activities may play a role in the dissemination of virus in the CNS.</p>
