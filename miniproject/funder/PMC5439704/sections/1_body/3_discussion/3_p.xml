<p>It is known that the BBB is composed of microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes, comprisinga complex physical barrier through tight cell-cell interactions and having a critical role in protecting against invading pathogens and establishing mechanical strength[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Once the integrity of the BBB is disrupted, CNS pathogenesis is facilitated through increasing viral invasion and spread. For example, West Nile virus (WNV) infection of the brainâ€™s microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVEs) significantly increases leukocyte adhesion to the HBMVE monolayer and transmigration across the HBMVE, suggesting that WNV causes destruction of the BBB. This improves leukocyte infiltration into the brain and fosters neuroinflammation[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Dengue virus (DENV) infection, for example, changes the localization of the tight junction proteins Zonula occludens (ZO-1) and Claudin-1 in mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECs), and this process is closely associated with a decrease in transendothelial resistance, an increase in macromolecule permeability, and an increase in the paracellular passing of free virus particles in MBECs, indicating that the elevated permeability of the BBB allowed the entry of virus into the nervous system and caused the neurological manifestations[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. EV71 and CA16 are also highly neurotropic viruses, potentially causing varying degrees of neurological complications[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, therefore, we focused mainly on the biological adhesion results derived from the GO analysis to perform a more in-depth hierarchical GO category analysis. Our results demonstrate that the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs implicated in biological adhesion were consistently upregulated following EV71 infection and downregulated following CA16 infection. Furthermore, owing to the negative regulation that miRNAs exert on their target genes, it was proposed that an inverse correlation exists between the miRNAs and the corresponding GOs of their target genes. Notably, the functions of biological adhesion induced by CA16 infection were significantly activated, whereas they were inhibited by EV71 infection. These results of hierarchical GO category analysis showed that there are 5 significant differences, as follows: cell proliferation (e.g., epithelial cell proliferation), cell adhesion (e.g., cell-cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, etc.), signal transduction (e.g., small GTPase-mediated signal transduction and Ras protein signal transduction), nervous regulation (e.g., regulation of synaptic organization, regulation of nervous system development, etc.) and interplay between host and virus (e.g., initiation of viral infection, entry into the host cell, etc.).These effects as induced by EV71 infection are more susceptible to dysregulation than they are in the context of CA16 infection. Moreover, most of the target genes linked to biological adhesion for the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs described previously were declined during EV71 infection but overexpressed during CA16 infection, as validated by qRT-PCR. These results further demonstrate that the cell-cell contacts of HUVECs may be disturbed during EV71 infection, indicating impairment of the BBB. Taken together, we hypothesize that the neuropathological manifestations of EV17 and CA16 infection may be mediated by the 8 differentially expressed miRNAs. Additionally, in our previous study, miR-4516, involved in biological adhesion, was reduced and elevated in the EV71 and CA16 infection of human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to the previous speculation, miR-4516 may be the key factor causing the destruction of 16HBE cells in CA16 infection and ultimately leading to the repeatedly occurring phenomenon of CA16 infection and its clinical features, which rarely happens following EV71 infection (unpublished data). Nevertheless, in this study, miR-4516, also discovered in biological adhesion, was increased and decreased in the EV71 and CA16 infection of HUVECs, respectively. Therefore it was postulated that the altered miR-4516 generated in the HUVECs subjected to EV71 and CA16 infections may initiate different degree impairment of HUVECs, thus creating a relatively permissive environment for viral invasion into the brain and contributing to the different outcomes of EV71 and CA16 infections in the CNS.
