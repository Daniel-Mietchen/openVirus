<p>EV71 and CA16, as the main pathogens responsible for worldwide HFMD outbreaks, can cause severe neurological complications and death[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although 3 inactivated EV71 vaccines have already shown substantial protective effect against EV71-HFMD and EV71-related diseases in clinical trials, the current lack of an effective vaccine to treat HFMD induced by other enteroviruses, including CA16, highlights the importance of developing vaccines to prevent the transmission of the other causative agents[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, further investigations identifying the factors that cause the different manifestations of EV71 and CA16 infection are still urgently needed and may provide new strategies for the development of more efficacious vaccines to prevent HFMD outbreaks. In the current study, we identified a total of 135 differentially expressed miRNAs across different time points following EV71 and CA16 infection; of these, both common and unique miRNAs were identified, indicating that miRNA expression in the context of these viruses has strain- and time-specific tendencies. Moreover, since the 6 common miRNA, namely, miR-7851-3p, miR-619-5p, miR-5585-3p, miR-5096, miR-204-5p, and miR-1285-5p simultaneously participated in both EV71 and CA16 interactions with host cells. It is possible that 1 or 2 of them could serve as potential candidates for the antiviral therapy of HFMD. It has recently been estimated that about 60% of human genes may be subjected to miRNA regulation through the degradation of target mRNAs or the suppression of mRNA translation following specific binding to target mRNA, and the roles of miRNAs in pathogen-host interactions have received increasing attention[

 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A growing body of reports indicates that viral infections can remodel cellular miRNA expression, which in turn influences cellular microenvironment and metabolism and eventually leads to viral pathogenesis[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, the influenza virus notably changes cellular miR-106b, miR-124, and miR-1254 expression in favor of influenza replication by regulating human protease genes (such as ADAMTS7, CPE, DPP3, MST1, and PRSS12), which can cause clinical outcomes ranging from mild upper respiratory infections to severe pneumonia[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) obviously enhances let-7f expression in the host, which likely contributes to delayed viral clearance and inhibits let-7i and miR-30b expression, thus promoting viral replication[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, these altered miRNAs appear to exacerbate the severity of disease. Hence it is no surprise that abnormal miRNA expression is intimately associated with the development and progression of various infectious diseases[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Additionally, evidence from different researchers is accumulating that some miRNAs are involved in the infectious cycle of CA16 or EV71; for instance, 3 key miRNAs (miR-545, miR-324-3p, and miR-143) can be used to distinguish EV71 infection from CA16 infection in patients with HFMD[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated expression of the circulating miR-876-5p is a specific response to severe EV71 infections[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and miR-432* regulates the replication of CA16 in RD cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another study has reported a dramatic reduction in EV71 replication when DGCR8 (an essential cofactor for miRNA biogenesis) was knocked down prior to EV71 infection, suggesting that EV71 might utilize the host’s miRNAs to enhance viral replication[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Collectively, our discovery of the specific miRNA expression patterns that are produced during EV71 and CA16 infection in HUVECs provides powerful insights into the different mechanisms of viral pathogenesis regulated by miRNAs. Following, these findings further elucidate the key disparities between EV71 and CA16 infection.We further isolated 30 differentially expressed miRNAs that displayed opposite expression trends. The functions of some miRNAs among these 30 have been studied by other researchers. For example, miR-183-3p was validated as a potent prognostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma in female nonsmokers[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and declining expression of let-7e-3p was associated with cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of proliferation of cervical cancer cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. High endogenous and circulating miR-1246 modulated by the direct upstream regulator octamer 4 (Oct4) was shown to be a novel diagnostic marker as well as a tool for therapeutic intervention in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by cooperatively driving Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, miRNA-1246 was found to be a target gene of p53 in the progression of various cancers, including cervical, colorectal, esophageal, hepatic, and pancreatic cancers[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It was also found that the expression of miR-1246, which was increased in EV71-infected cells (in agreement with our findings), could suppress the expression of the disc-large homolog 3 (DLG3), known to contribute to neurological disorders[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, the miR-4492 was significantly upregulated in EV71-infected RD cells, consistent with our results[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the specific roles of these differentially expressed miRNAs in our study of EV71 and CA16 infection remain largely unknown and need further exploration.
