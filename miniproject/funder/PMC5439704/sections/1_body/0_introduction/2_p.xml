<p>microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, 18- to 25-nucleotide (nt), long single-stranded noncoding regulatory RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Through complementary pairing with messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs exhibit inhibitory effects by inhibiting translation or stimulating mRNA degradation[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A number of recent studies have reported that miRNAs participate in regulating the expression of at least 60% of human genes and play an important role in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, immune responses, the stress response, and the production of chemokines and cytokines[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, aberrant miRNA expression seems to play a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of several human diseases, especially cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disorders[

 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the altered expression of specific miRNAs has been explored in a search for novel biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of various diseases as well as their progression and the efficacy of their treatment[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, as our knowledge of the role of miRNAs in host-pathogen interactions has advanced, it has been found that viral infections can mediate changes in the expression of cell-specific miRNAs[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Such changes represent not only a potential host defense mechanism against infection by efficiently inhibiting viral invasion with minimal clinical consequences but also establish an environment for productive viral infection and/or latency by promoting evasion of the host antiviral immune response or enhancing viral replication and survival in host cells, with the potentially severe outcomes[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In other words, these changes in cellular miRNAs may directly contribute to viral pathogenesis, suggesting that in-depth research into cell-encoded miRNA functioninduced by EV71 and CA16 may help to explain why diverse clinical features result from infections caused by these viruses.
