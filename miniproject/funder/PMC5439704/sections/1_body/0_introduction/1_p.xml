<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread viral illness generally occurring in infants and young children, especially those less than 5 years of age[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsakievirus A16 (CA16), members of the human enterovirus A species within the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the family Picornaviridae, are the predominant etiological agents of HFMD[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Over the past decade, a series of sporadic cases as well as large epidemics associated with HFMD have arisen in the Asia-Pacific region; therefore HFMD has emerged as a serious threat to public health[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although EV71 and CA16 share relatively high nucleotide and amino acid homologies (77% and 89% respectively), the clinical manifestations caused by the two viruses are significantly different[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Unlike CA16, which causes milder symptoms that resolve within a few weeks, EV71 infections usually cause severe central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, prior development of HFMD vaccines has almost exclusively focused on EV71, and 3 successfully developed inactivated EV71 vaccines have been approved by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) since 2015[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although these vaccines are effective in providing protection against EV71 infections, their effectiveness may be limited because they cannot induce highly potent and broad cross-protection against various genotypes of other enteroviruses, including CA16[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, several severe and fatal cases involving CA16 have recently been reported, and epidemiological surveys indicate that HFMD cases induced by the co-circulation of, co-infection by, or recombination between EV71 and CA16 are increasing[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This trend has led to more serious outcomes than would be expected from infection with a single virus. Thus there is an urgent need for a multivalent vaccine against multiple enteroviruses that would help to control enterovirus-related HFMD epidemics. In our previous study, we found that there were significant anti-CA16 neutralizing antibodies in the healthy junior rhesus macaque immunized with the experimentally inactivated CA16 vaccine, but these neutralizing antibodies failed to protect against CA16 infection[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, it is our hope that further investigations of the molecular mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 will provide a new strategy for the development of a broad-spectrum HFMD vaccine.
