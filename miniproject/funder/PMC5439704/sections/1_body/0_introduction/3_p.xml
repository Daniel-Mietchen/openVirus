<p>Currently, there are several reports indicating that EV71and CA16 can elicit ectopic host miRNA expression profiles in different infected cells, such as human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in rhesus monkeys[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, miRNA biogenesis has unique cell-specific patterns, suggesting that these different miRNA expression profiles would only partially explain the clinical symptoms and might be not involved in the CNS symptoms. EV71 and CA16 are both highly neurotropic viruses that have induced severe CNS complications in patients, and such CNS complications have been recognized as the main causes of fatal HFMD[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the underlying neuropathogenetic mechanisms of EV71 and CA16 infections have yet to be clearly understood. Two likely routes by which these viruses invade the CNS have been considered: it may be transmitted to the CNS from the blood, across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), or it may enter the CNS through retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerves[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The BBB comprises an interdependent network of brain capillary endothelial cells, endowed with barrier properties, and perivascular cells, containing astrocytes and pericytes that are responsible for maintaining the barrier[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, many neurotropicviruses from the systemic blood circulation, such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], West Nile virus (WNV)[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], can infect the endothelial cells of the BBB, thus disrupting its integrity and eventually entering the CNS. With all this in mind and with the help of high-throughput sequencing technology, we used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which are often used to build models of the BBB 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, to investigate alterations in miRNAs due to EV71 and CA16 infection. It is hoped that the results of this study will provide future perspectives regarding the mechanisms underlying EV71 and CA16 neuropathogenesis.
