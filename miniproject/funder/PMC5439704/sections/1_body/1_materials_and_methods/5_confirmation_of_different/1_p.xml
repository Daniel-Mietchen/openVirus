<p>High-throughput sequencing of differentially expressed miRNAs was further verified for 8 randomly selected miRNAs, including 7 known miRNAs, by qRT-PCR using extracted miRNA samples as templates. Additionally, based on an analysis of the predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs, we also randomly chose 20 targets for indirect corroboration of miRNA expression by qRT-PCR. The protocols for qRT-PCR of miRNAs and mRNAs according to the respective manufacturer’s instructions were used as described in our previous study. Relative miRNA and mRNA abundance were determined by normalizing the miRNA of interest to U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and β-actin mRNA, respectively. Then their relative expression was calculated in terms of threshold cycle value (CT) using the 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method[
