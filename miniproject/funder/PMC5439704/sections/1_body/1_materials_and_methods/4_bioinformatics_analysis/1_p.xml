<p>The bioinformatic analysis of the reads aligned to known 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> pre-miRNA in miRBase 19 was performed as previously described[
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177657.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, 7 main aspects, including principal component analysis (PCA), differential expression analysis of miRNA sequences, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, trend analysis, target prediction, and functional enrichment of differentially expressed miRNAs, construction of regulatory networks and hierarchical GO category analysis of deregulated miRNA-associated target genes with key GO-biological process categories were systematically analyzed in this study utilizing the corresponding software. The details of this process are shown in
