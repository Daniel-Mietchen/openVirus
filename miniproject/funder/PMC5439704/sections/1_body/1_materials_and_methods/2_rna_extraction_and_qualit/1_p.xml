<p>Samples from the previously mentioned groups were sent to the National Engineering Center for Biochips in Shanghai. miRNA was isolated from each group using a mirVana
 <sup>TM</sup> miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA purification was carried out after RNA isolation using a miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and integrity of the purified RNA were determined by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA); only samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) value greater than 7 were retained for miRNA profile analysis.
