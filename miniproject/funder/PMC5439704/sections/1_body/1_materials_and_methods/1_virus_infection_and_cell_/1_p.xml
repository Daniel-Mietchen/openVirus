<p>HUVECs purchased from Jennino Biological Technology were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco, USA), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma, USA) in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> virus infection, approximately 1×10
 <sup>5</sup> HUVECs per well were plated in 6-well plates and incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2. When HUVECs completely adhered to the 6-well plates, they were infected EV71 (sub-genotype C4, GenBank: EU812515.1) or CA16-G20 strain (sub-genotype B, GenBank: JN590244.1), which were isolated from an epidemic in Fuyang, China in 2008 and from an HFMD patient in Guangxi, China in 2010, respectively. The inoculation quantity of EV71 and CA16 is strictly controlled in lgCCID50 = 5/100μl, that is, the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of EV71 and CA16 is 1. The virus titers of EV71 and CA16 were previously examined in Vero cells and then stored -80℃ in our lab. The cells were collected at 0, 72, and 96 hours post infection (hpi), resuspended in Trizol (TIANGEN, China) and stored at -80°C until used. Cells infected with EV71 and CA16 for 0 hpi were used as controls. Simultaneously, we defined the following experimental groups: EV71-0h, EV71-72h, EV71-96h, CA16-0h, CA16-72h, and CA16-96h. Additionally, the EV71-0h and CA16-0h groups were used for normalization (the normalization value was set to 1), and they were designated as the control. Each group was processed in triplicate and pooled separately for subsequent total RNA extraction.
