<p id="Par16">YFV is the prototype member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (family Flaviviridae), with a single-strand positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The genome has a 5′ end cap structure, and it is translated into a polyprotein precursor. The polyprotein is then cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into three structural proteins (capsid, envelope, and membrane proteins) and seven non-structural proteins (named NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [
