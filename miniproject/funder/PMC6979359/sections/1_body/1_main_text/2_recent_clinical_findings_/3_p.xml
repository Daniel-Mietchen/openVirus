<p id="Par20">Other studies have demonstrated different outcomes and patterns regarding YF infection. Although YF is mainly viscerotropic in humans, Marinho and colleagues (2019) described a case of a 3-year-old girl with severe manifestations in the central nervous system. The patient had mildly elevated amino transaminases but no classical YF signs or symptoms. After six days of hospitalization, the child died, and postmortem analysis showed wild-type YFV RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and in urine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], until 28 and 47 days after the onset of symptoms, respectively. These findings indicate that YFV might persist in the host for more extended periods than previously thought. During the follow-up of two YF patients, increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and serum aspartate transaminase (AST) (ALT &gt; 1000 IU/L and AST &gt; 301 IU/L) were observed two months after the onset of YF. The serum transaminases persisted elevated for up to six months [
