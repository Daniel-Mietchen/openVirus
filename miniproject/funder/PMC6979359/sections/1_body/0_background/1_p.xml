<p id="Par15">Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes yellow fever (YF), an acute disease affecting humans and non-human primates (NHP) in several South American and African countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In humans, YF ranges from asymptomatic infection to non-specific symptomatic illness and fatal hemorrhagic fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the existence of a safe vaccine, massive YF outbreaks occurred recently in Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Humans are considered incidental hosts for YFV. The virus is maintained by different cycles in tropical and subtropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and South America via transmission among different mosquitoes and NHP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most of the experimental studies with YFV were performed with Old World NHP, but little is known about YF and the pathogenesis in Neotropical NHP. Neotropical NHP are considered highly susceptible to YFV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which may be related to the recent introduction of the virus into the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given the ongoing YF outbreaks in Brazil (2016–2019), we present the main aspects of sylvatic YF, including historical and recent outbreaks in the country.
