<p>SHUV was previously isolated from field-collected pools of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and from mosquitoes, but their relative importance in SHUV transmission remained to be confirmed. Here, we show for the first time that SHUV is able to infect and replicate in biting midges as well as in mosquitoes, but only the biting midge species evaluated in the present study can be considered competent vectors.
