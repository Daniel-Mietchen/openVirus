Considering our results obtained with both a tropical and temperate mosquito species, it seems unlikely that mosquito species play an important role in the SHUV transmission cycle. Our findings are in line with an earlier study on the closely-related SBV, which showed no evidence for involvement of mosquitoes in transmission, although SBV was able to infect
