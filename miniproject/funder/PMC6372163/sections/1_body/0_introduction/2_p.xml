<p>Shuni virus (SHUV; family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, Simbu serogroup) is a possible arbovirus that recently emerged in two very distant areas of the world [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More recently, SHUV was associated with malformed ruminants in Israel [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Emergence of SHUV in areas outside Sub-Saharan Africa shows the potential of this virus to spread to new areas, and increases the risk for SHUV outbreaks in bordering territories such as Europe. Isolation of SHUV from a febrile child and detection of antibodies in 3.9% of serum samples from veterinarians in South Africa shows that SHUV can infect humans as well, although its ability to cause human disease is still uncertain [
