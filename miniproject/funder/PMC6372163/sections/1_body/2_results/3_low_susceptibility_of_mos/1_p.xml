<p>SHUV was previously isolated from field-collected mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar to the biting midges, SHUV titers of ingested blood were determined for a selection of 10 fully engorged female mosquitoes that were directly stored at -80Â°C after feeding on an infectious blood meal with a SHUV titer of 3.0 x 10
