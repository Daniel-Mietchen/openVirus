SHUV was isolated from diverse species of domesticated animals and wildlife, and is associated with neurological disease, abortions, and congenital malformations. Recently, SHUV caused outbreaks among ruminants in Israel, representing the first incursions outside the African continent. The isolation of SHUV from a febrile child in Nigeria and seroprevalence among veterinarians in South Africa suggests that the virus may have zoonotic potential as well. The high pathogenicity, extremely broad tropism, potential transmission via both biting midges and mosquitoes, and zoonotic features of SHUV require further investigation. This is important to accurately determine the risk for animal and human health, and to facilitate preparations for potential epidemics. To gain first insight into the potential involvement of biting midges and mosquitoes in SHUV transmission we have investigated the ability of SHUV to infect two species of laboratory-colonised biting midges and two species of mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology/Principal findings</title><p><italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic>, <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>, <italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic>, and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> were orally exposed to SHUV by providing an infectious blood meal.

Apart from viruses such as West Nile virus and Rift Valley fever virus that are well-known to cause a significant impact on human and animal health, many arboviruses remain neglected. Shuni virus (SHUV) is a neglected virus with zoonotic characteristics that was recently associated with severe disease in livestock and wildlife. Isolations from field-collected biting midges and mosquitoes suggests that SHUV may be transmitted by these insects. In this study, four main vectors that transmit other arboviruses were selected to test their susceptibility to SHUV. Laboratory-reared biting midge species (<italic>Culicoides nubeculosus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>) and mosquito species (<italic>Culex pipiens pipiens</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) were exposed to SHUV via an infectious blood meal. SHUV was able to successfully disseminate in both biting midge species, whereas no evidence of transmission by both mosquito species was found.

In particular the order Bunyavirales comprises emerging pathogens such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has included both CCHFV and RVFV to the &#x0201c;Blueprint&#x0201d; list of ten prioritized viruses likely to cause future epidemics and for which insufficient countermeasures are available [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the veterinary field, prioritized viral diseases of animals, including RVFV, are notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties, OIE). Apart from pathogens that are recognised as major threats by WHO and OIE, many have remained largely neglected. Before the turn of the century, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus were among these neglected viruses until they reminded us how fast arboviruses can spread in immunologically na&#x000ef;ve populations [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although these outbreaks came as a surprise, in hindsight, smaller outbreaks in previously unaffected areas could have been recognised as early warnings.</p><p>Shuni virus (SHUV; family <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, genus <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, Simbu serogroup) is a possible arbovirus that recently emerged in two very distant areas of the world [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SHUV was isolated for the first time from a slaughtered cow in the 1960s in Nigeria [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During subsequent years, the virus was isolated on several occasions from domestic animals including cattle, sheep, goats, and horses [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], from wild animals including crocodiles and rhinoceros [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and from field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More recently, SHUV was associated with malformed ruminants in Israel [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Emergence of SHUV in areas outside Sub-Saharan Africa shows the potential of this virus to spread to new areas, and increases the risk for SHUV outbreaks in bordering territories such as Europe. Isolation of SHUV from a febrile child and detection of antibodies in 3.9% of serum samples from veterinarians in South Africa shows that SHUV can infect humans as well, although its ability to cause human disease is still uncertain [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Proper risk assessments rely on accurate knowledge of disease transmission cycles. Arbovirus transmission cycles can only become established when competent vectors and susceptible hosts encounter under suitable climatic conditions. Although SHUV has been isolated from pools of field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the role of both insect groups as actual vectors remains to be confirmed. Detection of virus in field-collected insects is not sufficient to prove their ability to transmit the virus. Arboviruses need to overcome several barriers (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. midgut and salivary gland barriers) inside their vector, before they can be transmitted [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to virus isolation from field-collected vectors, laboratory studies are therefore needed to experimentally test the ability of vectors to become infected with, maintain, and successfully transmit arboviruses (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., vector competence) [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

Importantly, the finding that two different biting midge species from European and American origin are highly competent vectors suggests that various species of <italic>Culicoides</italic> may function as vectors of SHUV.</p><p>SHUV infection and replication in biting midges seems more efficient compared to other biting midge-borne viruses such as SBV and Bluetongue virus (BTV), which generally result in infection rates up to 30% [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both SBV and BTV have caused sudden and large-scale epizootics in Europe, with devastating consequences for the livestock sector [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The relatively high SHUV transmission potential by biting midges and ongoing emergence of SHUV to areas outside Sub-Saharan Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], should therefore be interpreted as a warning for its epizootic potential.</p><p>In contrast to the high infection rates in biting midges, only few orally exposed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes became infected with SHUV during 10 days of incubation at 28&#x000b0;C. In addition, no evidence of successful dissemination to the salivary glands was found. SHUV replication and dissemination (8%) was observed when the virus was directly injected into the thorax of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. This indicates that both the midgut infection barrier and the salivary gland barrier prevent infection and subsequent transmission of SHUV by <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. None of the <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes that were orally exposed to SHUV became infected during 10 days of incubation at 25&#x000b0;C. Moreover, replication of SHUV was low in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic>, because the virus was not able to replicate to high titers when it was directly injected into the thorax. However, a relatively high percentage of mosquito saliva samples contained SHUV. We therefore conclude that the midgut barrier is the main barrier that prevents infection of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>p</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> with SHUV. Considering our results obtained with both a tropical and temperate mosquito species, it seems unlikely that mosquito species play an important role in the SHUV transmission cycle. Our findings are in line with an earlier study on the closely-related SBV, which showed no evidence for involvement of mosquitoes in transmission, although SBV was able to infect <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Recent outbreaks of SBV and BTV showed the tremendous impact of midge-borne viruses on animal health [<xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0006609.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our study demonstrates highly efficient infection and dissemination of SHUV in two biting midge species (<italic>C</italic>. <italic>nubeculosus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>), which illustrates its potential for emergence. SHUV should therefore be considered as an important arbovirus which may emerge further internationally in the near future. Future studies should test vector competence of field-collected <italic>Culicoides</italic> species for SHUV, to more accurately predict the efficiency of SHUV transmission following a first introduction into currently free areas. In addition, we recommend the development of diagnostic assays and a vaccine. These actions are essential to be prepared for newly emerging arboviruses with zoonotic potential such as SHUV.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) for kindly providing SHUV, the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) for kindly providing eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>nubeculosus</italic>, and Barbara Drolet (ARS) for kindly providing eggs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>sonorensis</italic>.
