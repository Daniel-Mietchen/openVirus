  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 
   <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) sequences obtained from ART naive and experienced patients from the Roraima state.
  </title>
  <p>HIV-1 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Roraima (red terminal branches) were combined with reference sequences (black terminal branches) of all HIV-1 group M subtypes (A–D, F–H, J, and K). Shaded boxes indicate the position of HIV-1 subtypes detected in Roraima. Asterisks indicate the position of sequences with ADRM (dark) and TDRM (blue). Only a
   <italic>LRT</italic> values at the branch of subtype B, subtype C, and the two highly supported clades of sequences with ADRM are shown. Trees are rooted at midpoint and the branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site.
