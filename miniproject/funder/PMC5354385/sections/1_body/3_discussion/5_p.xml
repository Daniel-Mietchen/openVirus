<p>It is also interesting to note that although the median plasma viral load of patients without ADRM (2,917 copies/ml) was much lower than of those with ADRM (130,360 copies/ml range), not all patients harboring ADRM displayed evidence of treatment failure. Indeed, a significant proportion of patients with ADRM (63%) displayed undetectable plasma viral loads at the time of sampling, and the prevalence of ADRM among patients with detectable plasma viral loads (32%) was only slightly higher than among patients with undetectable viral loads (25%). On the other hand, among the ART-experienced patients with plasma viral loads &gt;1,000 copies/ml, 44% harbored HIV strains fully susceptible to antiretrovirals. Thus, a significant proportion of the apparent therapeutic failures among HIV-1-infected patients from Roraima could probably be attributed to problems of sub-optimal therapeutic adherence rather than to selection of drug-resistance strains.</p>
