<p>In conclusion, our study indicates that the HIV-1 epidemic in Roraima is mostly dominated by the B subtype and that the epidemiological relevance of other subtypes and recombinants forms is much lower than that described in other Brazilian states. Our findings also revealed a relatively high frequency of undetectable viral load and a relatively low prevalence of ADRM among treatment-experienced individuals from Roraima. As the HIV-1 epidemic and the use of ART spreads towards the innermost parts of Brazil, continued molecular surveillance studies will be essential to monitor temporal changes in the prevalence of drug resistant strains among treatment na√Øve and experienced patients in those areas.</p>
