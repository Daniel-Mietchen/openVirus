<p>Among the 12 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from drug na√Øve patients here analyzed, only one displayed a TDRM to NNRTI, whereas no TDRM to NRTI or PI were detected. A much higher level of ADRM (28%), by contrast, was observed among subjects under ART included in our study. Most HIV-1 isolates with ADRM harbored some level of resistance to both NRTI and NNRTI (60%), whereas others displayed resistance to only NNRTI (23%), to both PI and NRTI (12%), or to only PI (6%). No patients with ADRM to all three classes of antiretroviral drugs were detected in this study. The phylogenetic analysis reveals no highly supported clades of HIV-1 sequences with the same set of ADRM, thus supporting that DRM observed among patients under ART most probably evolved independently after initiation of therapy and were not directly transmitted among subjects.
