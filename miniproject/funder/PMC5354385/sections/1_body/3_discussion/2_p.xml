<p>These results indicate that the HIV-1 molecular epidemiologic profile observed in Roraima is much more homogenous than that described in any other Brazilian state, even from the Northern region [

On the other hand, Boa Vista (the capital of the Roraima state) is located close to the Venezuelan and Guyanese cities of St. Helena de Uairén (230 km) and Lethem (114 km), respectively. Notably, among the 73 patients included in our study and that attended the Public Health Central Laboratory in Boa Vista, two patients were from St. Helena de Uairén and one patient from Lethem, reflecting the intense human mobility across the Roraima borders with Venezuela and Guyana. Consistent with this, we recently described a singular high prevalence of non-pandemic subtype B variants of Caribbean origin in Roraima [
