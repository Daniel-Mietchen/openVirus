<p>The prevalence of ADRM here detected in Roraima (28%) was relatively low compared to the higher levels of resistance to NRTI, NNRTI and/or PI (&gt;80%) reported in other Brazilian states from all country regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It could be argued that most previous studies of ADRM conducted in Brazil analyzed populations of HIV-1-infected individuals failing ART and that the relative low rate of ADRM observed in Roraima may be explained by a low frequency of virological failure among treated patients. However, the estimated prevalence of ADRM in Roraima remains comparatively lower to that described in other Brazilian states even if we only considered those ART-experienced patients with detectable viral load (32%), or those patients with plasma viral loads &gt;1,000 copies/ml (56%) that is the viral load cut-off for HIV resistance genotyping according to the guidelines of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (
