<p>Although this study suggests a low prevalence of both TDRM and ADRM among HIV-infected individuals from the Roraima state, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively low size of the study populations. New surveillance studies of both untreated and ART-treated patients will be necessary to obtain more accurate estimates of the prevalence of TDRM and ADRM in this Brazilian state. The application of more specific questionnaires will be necessary to quantify the relative contribution of therapeutic success and sub-optimal therapeutic adherence to the low prevalence of ADRM observed in Roraima. Finally, information about previous and current ART regimens used by the patients will be also of paramount importance to fully explain the high rate of ADRM observed among patients with undetectable plasma viremia.</p>
