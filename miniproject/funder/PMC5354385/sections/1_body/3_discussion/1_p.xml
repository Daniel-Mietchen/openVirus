<p>The current analysis showed that the HIV-1 epidemic in the northernmost Brazilian state of Roraima is almost exclusively driven by the subtype B. Among the 73 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) gene sequences analyzed, 72 were classified as subtype B and one as subtype C. A previous study analyzed 36 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) gene sequences from Roraima and classified 31 sequences as subtype B and five sequences as BF recombinants [
 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. When both studies are combined, we obtained that the predominant HIV-1 clade circulating in Roraima was subtype B (94%), followed by BF recombinants (5%) and subtype C (1%).
