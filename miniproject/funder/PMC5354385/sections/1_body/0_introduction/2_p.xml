<p>Nearly half (52%) of Brazilian people living with HIV/AIDS are under antiretroviral therapy (ART) [
 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This has substantially reduced the AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, but also has led to a substantial increase in the emergence and transmission of drug resistant viruses in the Brazilian population [
 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nation-wide studies of HIV-infected treatment-naive individuals estimate that the overall rate of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and/or protease inhibitors (PI) in Brazil increased from 6.6% to 12.2% over the past 10–15 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the same period, the prevalence of acquired drug resistance mutations (ADRM) to NRTI, NNRTI and/or PI remained persistently high (&gt;80%) among ART-experienced patients from Brazil [
