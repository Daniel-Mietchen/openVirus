 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0173894.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Among the 73 individuals included in this study, 12 were drug naïve and 61 were under ART. The period of diagnosis of the HIV infection ranged between 1995 and 2013. Most patients were males (57.5%) and the overall median age was 37 years (21–57 years range), with similar values for both males (37 years, 24–57 years range) and females (37 years, 21–56 years range). More male patients declared to be heterosexual (57%) than homosexual (33%) or bisexual (10%), whereas only one female declared to be homosexual. The major risk factor for HIV infection identified was unprotected sex (81%), followed by iatrogenic transmission/intravenous drug use (12%), while for 7% of the patients the route of transmission was unknown. The median of CD4 T cell counts was 448 cells/μl (74–1,822 cells/μl range). The CD4 T cell counts was &lt;350 cells/μl for 36%, between 350 and 500 cells/μl for 22%, and &gt;500 cells/μl for 33% of the participants. The median of plasma viral load was 54,614 copies/ml (&lt;40–1,383,017 copies/ml range). Plasma viral loads were below limit of detection (40 copies/ml) for 58%, between 51 and 10,000 copies/ml for 19%, and over 10,000 copies/ml for 16% of the participants. Most patients (79%) were from the capital, Boa Vista. The remaining ones were from other municipalities of the Roraima state (16%) or neighboring cities outside Roraima (5%), including one patient from Manaus (Amazonas state), two patients from St. Helena de Uairén (Venezuela) and one patient from Lethem (Guyana).
