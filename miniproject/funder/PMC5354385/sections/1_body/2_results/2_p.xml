<p>All patients recruited had HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) genes amplified and sequenced, and nearly all were characterized as subtype B (91%), except one classified as subtype C (9%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173894.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among the 12 treatment-na√Øve patients analyzed, only one harbored a TDRM to NNRTI (G190A), whereas no TDRM to NRTI or PI were detected in the study population. Two out of 61 HIV-1 PR/RT sequences obtained from patients under ART were excluded due to the presence of APOBEC3GF-mediated G to A mutations. Among the remaining 59 treatment-experienced patients, 17 (29%) harbored HIV-1 strains with ADRM that conferred some level of resistance to NNRTI, NRTI and/or PI (
 <xref rid="pone.0173894.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among these, 14 (24%) patients had ADRM to NNRTI (being K103N and G190A the most common), 12 (20%) patients had ADRM to NRTI (being M184V the most frequently found) and three (5%) patients had ADRM to PI. Five (8%) patients showed ADRM to only one class of antiretroviral drugs (NNRTI or PI), 10 (17%) patients showed ADRM to both NRTI and NNRTI, and two (3%) patients showed ADRM to both NRTI and PI. No patients showed ADRM to all three classes of antiretroviral drugs. The median plasma viral load of patients without ADRM (2,917 copies/ml) was much lower than of those with ADRM (130,360 copies/ml range), although the proportion of patients without ADRM that displayed undetectable plasma viral loads (70%) was similar to the corresponding proportion of patients with ADRM (63%) and the prevalence of ADRM among patients with detectable plasma viral loads (32%) was only slightly higher than among patients with undetectable viral loads (25%). HIV-1 sequences containing DRM were widely dispersed in the phylogenetic tree among sequences with no DRM (

 <italic>LRT</italic> &gt; 0.90) pairs of related sequences with ADRM were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173894.g001">Fig 1</xref>), but sequences within each pair displayed a different set of ADRM (
