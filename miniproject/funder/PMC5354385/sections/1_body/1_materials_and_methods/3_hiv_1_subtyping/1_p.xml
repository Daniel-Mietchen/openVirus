<p>HIV-1 subtypes were initially determined with the REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool 3.0 software [

 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to estimate the reliability of the obtained tree topology. All sequences were also subjected to bootscanning analyses using the SimPlot 3.5.1 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0173894.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to identify possible recombination breakpoints. Bootstrap values supporting branching with HIV-1 reference sequences were determined in Neighbor Joining (NJ) trees, based on 100 resamplings, with a 250 nt sliding window moving in steps of 10 bases.
