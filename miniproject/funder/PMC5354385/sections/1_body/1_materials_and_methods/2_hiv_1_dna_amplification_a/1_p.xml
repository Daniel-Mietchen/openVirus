<p>Blood samples collected in Boa Vista were transported to the Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane, the FIOCRUZ unit in Manaus, for HIV amplification and sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μl of total blood using the automated system QIAcube, with QIAamp DNABlood Kit (QIAGEN, Germany), following manufacturer’s recommendations. The entire protease (PR) and part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) (nucleotides 2253–3272 relative to the HXB2 clone) gene was amplified and sequenced as previously described [
