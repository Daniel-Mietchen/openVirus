<p>We collected 5ml of peripheral blood samples from 73 HIV-1-infected persons that attended the Public Health Central Laboratory in Boa Vista/Roraima (LACEN-RR), a reference unit from the Brazilian Ministry of Health that receives samples for monitoring of CD4+ T cell count and plasma viral load, between January 2013 and February 2014. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (â‰¥18 years of age) of either sex with a recent or chronic diagnosis of HIV-1 infection, and of any treatment status. Our sampling represents more than 10% of the HIV-infected population in Roraima in this period and covered eight out of 15 municipalities in the Roraima state. All patients that participated in this study were informed of the procedures and signed the informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the Federal University of Roraima (COEP/UFRR) (CAAE number: 15629013.8.0000.5302).</p>
