<p>Most pathosystems associated with studies on vector- virus (persistent)-host interactions typically involve a host plant that is very susceptible to the pathogen. Assuming that effects on the preference and fitness of vectors are aided by phenotypical and physiological alterations of the host, it would be worth investigating whether such effects on vectors are noticeable with hosts that are recalcitrant to infection. This study addresses the issue by using tomato genotypes that exhibit recalcitrance or resistance to TYLCV. A number of TYLCV-resistant genotypes with resistance genes (

 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, TYLCV could be acquired from resistant genotypes and inoculated to susceptible genotypes [

 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, TYLCV resistant genotypes could function as inoculum sources and could influence TYLCV epidemics.
