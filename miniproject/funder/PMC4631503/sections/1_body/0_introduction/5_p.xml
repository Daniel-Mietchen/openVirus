<p>Due to quick disease progression following TYLCV infection and severely altered phenotype in the case of TYLCV-susceptible genotypes than TYLCV-resistant genotypes, and the ability of whiteflies to readily acquire the virus from TYLCV-infected resistant and susceptible genotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], we hypothesized that virus accumulation in TYLCV-resistant genotypes would be above the threshold of TYLCV acquisition by whiteflies for a longer time period than in TYLCV-susceptible genotypes. We also hypothesized that due to less severe symptoms on resistant genotypes; TYLCV-infected resistant genotypes could be phenotypically more attractive to whiteflies for a protracted period than TYLCV-infected susceptible genotypes. Our working hypotheses are illustrated with a graphical model (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To test our hypotheses two TYLCV-susceptible and four TYLCV-resistant genotypes were selected. Virus accumulation in all genotypes was estimated at three time intervals i.e. at 3, 6, and 12 weeks post inoculation (WPI), and the ability of whiteflies to acquire TYLCV from both susceptible and resistant genotypes was evaluated. Subsequently, the preference of non-viruliferous and viruliferous whiteflies towards TYLCV-infected and non-infected plants was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 WPI for both susceptible and resistant genotypes. Developmental time, as a parameter of whitefly fitness, was also measured on TYLCV-resistant and susceptible genotypes.
