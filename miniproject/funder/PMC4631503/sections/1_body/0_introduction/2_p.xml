 <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) is a single stranded monopartite DNA virus in the Genus 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> and family 
 <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> that causes yellow leaf curl disease in tomato plants. Infected plants are characterized by yellowing, upward leaf curling, and stunting [

 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), transmits TYLCV, in a persistent and circulative manner [
