<p>Primers for partial TYLCV amplification by real time PCR were designed using Primer-BLAST [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Primers flanking a 102 bp region in the C2 ORF were selected (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Real time PCR was performed using SSoFast™EvaGreen
 <sup>®</sup>Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Mastermix buffer (2x) was combined with forward and reverse primers (final concentration of 0.5 μM), 1 μl of DNA, and nuclease-free distilled water for a final volume of 20 μl. Quantitative PCR was conducted using Mastercycler
 <sup>®</sup> ep realplex
 <sup>4</sup> (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). An initial denaturation step (2 min at 98°C) was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (15 sec at 98°C), and a combined step of annealing and extension at 65°C for 20 sec. Finally, melting curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the specificity of fluorescence signal. Each sample tested was duplicated, and the absolute number of copies present in each sample was quantified. For this purpose, a standard curve was created by including a series of eight 10-fold dilutions of pCR
 <sup>®</sup>2.1-TOPO
 <sup>®</sup> plasmids containing C2 fragments. An approximately 700 bp fragment that included the C2 ORF was amplified using PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and the primer pair C2-1159, C2-1853 described in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To achieve a final volume of 25 μl, 1 μl of each primer (at a final concentration of 0.4μM) were added to 22μl of the reaction buffer (1.1x) with 1 μl of DNA. The reaction was performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler Pro thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified product was ligated to pCR
 <sup>®</sup>2.1-TOPO
 <sup>®</sup> (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) plasmid and transformed to 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chemically competent cells (TOP10) following manufacturer’s guidelines. Plasmid DNA was extracted using GeneJet Plasmid miniprep kit (Fermentas, MA, USA) and linearized after digestion with Hind III restriction enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA concentration in the samples was measured in ng/μl using Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE), and the number of copies was estimated based on the formula: number of copies = (amount in ng * 6.022x10
 <sup>23</sup>)/(length of vector in bp *1x10
 <sup>9</sup>*650), in which the weight of a base pair (bp) is assumed to be 650 Da [
