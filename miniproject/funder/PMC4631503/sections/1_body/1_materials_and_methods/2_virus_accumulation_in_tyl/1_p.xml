<p>Plants used to evaluate TYLCV accumulation were transplanted into 15 cm diameter x 14 cm tall pots to allow adequate plant development throughout the period of study (12 WPI). Plants were inoculated using viruliferous whiteflies as described above. A sample of 100 mg of young leaf tissue in the apex region was collected. Total DNA from samples was immediately extracted using DNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen,Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer guidelines. Six plants were sampled for each cultivar at each time period (3, 6, and 12 WPI), and the experiment was repeated once (n = 12 for each genotype).</p>
