<p>Six commercially available tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) genotypes were chosen for this study. They included two TYLCV susceptible genotypes, Amelia (Harris Moran Seeds Company, CA, USA) and Florida 47 (Seminis Vegetable Seeds, MO, USA), and four genotypes that are resistant to TYLCV viz. Tygress (Seminis), Security (Harris Moran), Shanty (Hazera Seeds Inc., FL, USA) and Inbar (Hazera). Genes such as 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> and 
 <italic>Ty-2</italic> confer resistance to TYLCV in resistant genotypes. Plants were grown in Sunshine LP5 Plug Mix (SunGro Horticulture Industries, Bellevue, WA, USA) substrate using 10 cm diameter x 8 cm tall pots and fertilized weekly with water-soluble Miracle-Gro (Scotts Miracle-Gro products, Inc., OH, USA) at 0.5g/l. Plants were maintained in the greenhouse at 25–30°C with a 14h L:10h D photoperiod in whitefly-proof cages 45Lx45Wx90H cm
 <sup>3</sup> (Megaview Science Co., Taichung, Taiwan). TYLCV isolate was first collected from a TYLCV-infected tomato plant in a commercial tomato farm in Montezuma (Macon County, GA, USA) in 2009 [

TYLCV was maintained since then in a susceptible genotype (Florida 47) through repeated inoculations of 4-leaf stage plants (approximately 4–6 weeks old) with viruliferous whiteflies at 20 whiteflies per plant using clip cages (4 cm tall x 4 cm diameter) [

 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (B biotype), first collected in Tifton, Georgia, were reared on 15 to 20 cm tall cotton plants grown in 10 cm diameter x 8 cm tall pots (Hummert International, Earth City, MO) in whitefly-proof cages under the same conditions described above.
