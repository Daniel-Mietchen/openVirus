<p>Effects of TYLCV infection on whitefly development were studied on a resistant genotype (Security) in comparison with a susceptible genotype (Florida 47). Three plants from each genotype with and without TYLCV infection were used. Infected plants were obtained by whitefly-mediated inoculations as described earlier. The experiment was initiated six WPI by attaching three clip-cages on each plant with two females in each cage for 48 h. Eggs and immatures were monitored daily following the same methodology as explained above. The experiment was performed in a growth chamber at (26 ± 3°C) (mean ± SD) and a photoperiod of 14:10 h (L:D).</p>
