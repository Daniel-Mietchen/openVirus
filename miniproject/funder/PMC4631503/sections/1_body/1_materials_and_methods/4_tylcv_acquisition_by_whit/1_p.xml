<p>TYLCV acquisition by whiteflies was also evaluated at the three time intervals specified above. Whiteflies were introduced in clip-cages and attached to leaflets on TYLCV infected plants and given an acquisition access period (AAP) of 72 hours. Whiteflies in cages were subsequently transferred to cotton (a non-TYLCV host plant) leaves for another 72 hours. Whitefly DNA was extracted using DNeasy blood and tissue mini kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) pooling five insects in each sample following manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Three samples (15 whiteflies) were processed for each cultivar and for each time interval. The experiment was repeated once (n = 6 for each genotype). Each sample tested was duplicated, and the absolute number of copies in each sample was quantified using qPCR as described for plant tissue samples.</p>
