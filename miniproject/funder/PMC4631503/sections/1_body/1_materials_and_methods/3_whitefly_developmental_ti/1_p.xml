 <italic>tabaci</italic> adult development was studied on TYLCV-resistant and -susceptible genotypes. For this purpose, 6-week-old plants maintained in 15 x 14 cm pots in a growth chamber (Percival, Perry, IA) at 26± 0.1°C (mean ± SD) with 14:10 h (L:D) photoperiod were used. Three plants per cultivar were used, and three clip-cages containing two adult females were attached to each plant allowing an oviposition period of 48 hours. Once adult whiteflies and cages were removed, six eggs in each cage were randomly selected and monitored daily until adult emergence.
