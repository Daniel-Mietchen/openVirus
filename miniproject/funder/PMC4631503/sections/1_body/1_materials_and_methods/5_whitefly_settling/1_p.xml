<p>Whitefly settling assays were conducted at three time intervals: 3, 6 and 12 WPI. Two tomato genotypes were used viz. a TYLCV susceptible (Florida 47) and a TYLCV resistant genotype (Security). Settling assays were carried out with either viruliferous or non-viruliferous whiteflies. In the former case, whiteflies were given an AAP of 72h on symptomatic TYLCV-infected tomato plants. Non-viruliferous whiteflies were maintained on cotton as described previously. TYLCV infection or lack thereof in a subset of whitefly samples was confirmed by PCR (using C2-1159, C2-1853 primers) once the experiment was completed. The settling arena included a plastic cylinder 16 cm diameter x 31 cm tall. The cylinder was sectioned at 9 cm from the top and a strip of rubber foam (1.9 mm wide x 11.1 mm thick) was placed surrounding the edges to provide stability. This allowed to position leaflets from each genotype while being attached to the plant. The leaflets were positioned opposite to each other (

 <sup>®</sup>, American Can Company, Greenwich, CT). After cooling the vial on ice for a few minutes, whiteflies were allowed to enter the arena from the vial placed at the bottom. The number of whiteflies settling on each plant was recorded after 24 hours. Five replications were performed for each vector type (viruliferous or non-viruliferous) and repeated twice (n = 15) for each time interval (3, 6 and 12 WPI). Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions at 20–25°C and a photoperiod of 12h L:12 h D.
