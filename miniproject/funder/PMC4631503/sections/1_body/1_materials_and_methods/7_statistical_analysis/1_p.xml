<p>In general, data from experimental repeats were pooled for each study prior to conducting statistical analysis. Differences in TYLCV copy numbers in various genotypes at each time interval were assessed by subjecting the data to generalized linear mixed model using PROC GLIMMIX with suitable transformation in SAS Enterprise 4.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, USA). Genotypes (treatments) were considered as fixed effects, and replications were considered as random effects. Treatment means were separated using the Tukey Kramer option in SAS at Î± = 0.05. Whitefly developmental time (egg to adult) data for each life stage were subjected to median one-way analysis using PROC NONPAR1WAY in SAS. Genotypes were considered as fixed effects and replicates as random effects. Whitefly settling differences between infected and non-infected leaflets in each genotype at each time interval were evaluated by logistic regression using PROC GENMOD in SAS assuming a binomial distribution and a logit link function. Whitefly developmental time on infected and non-infected plants of each genotype was evaluated using median one-way analysis as described earlier.</p>
