<p>While it is true that a few studies have documented direct effects of the virus on hemipteran vectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], much of the evidence available today on vector-pathogen interactions seem to indicate that effects of vectors are facilitated by virus-induced host plant phenotypic or physiological alterations. This study clearly documents that pathogen-induced host effects on vectors preference and performance are not fixed but could rather vary temporally. Also, such interactions could fluctuate tremendously with varying degrees of susceptibility of the host plant to the pathogen. These results point to the limitations of generalizing vector-pathogen interactions by conducting experiments at a single time point as well as using a highly susceptible host. Furthermore, these results contribute to a better understanding of relevant factors (i.e. plant genotype, time post inoculation and infection status of vectors) that may drive epidemics of whitefly-transmitted TYLCV.
