<p>In contrast to whitefly responses in three and six weeks, TYLCV-induced modulations on whiteflies settling faded away 12 weeks after inoculation. At this point of time, additional factors aside from virus accumulation and symptom expression could have played a role in vector preference and/or settling. For example, whiteflies are known to preferentially feed on plants that are enriched with high concentrations of nitrogen [

 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In our system, physiological and phenotypical changes that occurred at 12 weeks may have negated preferential settling of non-viruliferous whiteflies to virus-infected plants. Whether the settling patterns observed over time were related to changes in availability of nutrients and/or secondary metabolites needs to be further investigated.
