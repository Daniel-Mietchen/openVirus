<p>In addition to preference, performance of vectors on TYLCV-resistant and -susceptible genotypes could play a critical role in virus spread. Previous studies indicated direct effect of TYLCV infection in the b-biotype, where a number of whitefly life table parameters were negatively impacted [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] thereby suggesting a pathogenic role of the virus on this biotype. In contrast, TYLCCNV greatly increased the performance by indirectly affecting the plant physiology and by promoting sustained ingestion from the phloem sieve elements [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Results from the current study revealed that whiteflies completed their development sooner on virus-infected plants when compared with non-infected plants suggesting a positive fitness effect, presumably by the indirect effect of virus infection mediated through the plant. A number of studies so far have also documented similar positive fitness effects of whiteflies when reared on 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic>-infected plants than on non-infected plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A number of them have also reported neutral to negative effects on whiteflies [
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A majority of these studies were conducted with susceptible host plants and not with recalcitrant or resistant host plants. When the developmental time of whiteflies was examined on TYLCV-infected and non-infected leaves, no differences in developmental time between infected or non-infected plants were observed in the tomato resistant genotype. These results reiterate that host plant susceptibility to the pathogen could be a major driving factor that influences vector-pathogen interactions.
