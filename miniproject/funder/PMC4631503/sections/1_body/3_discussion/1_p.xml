<p>The main objectives of this study were to examine the temporal effects of a persistent virus (TYLCV) infection as well as the effects of host (tomato) susceptibility to the virus on vector (whitefly) preference and performance. Previous research has shown that semi-dominant genes such as 
 <italic>Ty-1</italic> confer resistance to TYLCV by limiting symptom expression and restricting virus accumulation [

 <xref rid="pone.0142114.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the temporal impact on virus accumulation and the subsequent effects on vector preference and performance were not investigated. In this study, TYLCV copy numbers at three representative time points in two TYLCV-susceptible and four TYLCV-resistant genotypes were estimated using quantitative PCR. Results indicated that, irrespective of virus-susceptibility status of the host plant, viral copy numbers dropped after the initial observation at three weeks post inoculation. Nevertheless, most severe symptoms appeared beyond three WPI (~from 5 to 6 weeks) (
