<p>Even though the development of whiteflies was not influenced by the presence or absence of the resistant gene, TYLCV acquisition ability of whiteflies seems to be dependent upon the susceptibility status of tomato genotypes. Results from this study demonstrated that whiteflies acquired fewer viral copies from TYLCV-infected resistant genotypes than from susceptible genotypes irrespective of the time post inoculation. This suggested that TYLCV acquisition is a function of virus accumulation on the plant tissue they feed on. Kollenberg et al. recently proved this hypothesis by exposing whiteflies to feed from a solution of purified virions at a specific concentration and thereafter quantifying virus load in the insects [
