<p>In this study, the preference of viruliferous whiteflies was reversed 12 weeks after inoculation, a slightly higher proportion of insects settled on infected plants of the susceptible genotype. However, the opposite result was found for the recalcitrant cultivar. As explained before, other factors aside from the sole impact of virus infection could have influenced this outcome. Overall, virus-induced effects on whitefly preference were not so robust in the case of the TYLCV-resistant genotype as in the susceptible genotype. The results observed in this study have reshaped our original hypotheses that TYLCV-resistant genotypes would accumulate virus above the threshold of acquisition by whiteflies for a longer period and remain attractive to vectors longer than susceptible genotypes. Our results indicate that both TYLCV-susceptible and TYLCV-resistant genotypes, upon infection, could accumulate virus loads well above the threshold of virus acquisition; however, severity and timing of symptom development in the TYLCV-susceptible genotype could facilitate viral epidemics better than TYLCV-resistant genotypes by manipulating vector preference.</p>
