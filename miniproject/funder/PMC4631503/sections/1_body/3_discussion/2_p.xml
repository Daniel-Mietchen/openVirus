<p>This study also assessed whether tomato genotypes harbouring resistance genes to TYLCV itself had any impact on whitefly development by measuring the developmental time. Whiteflies on non-infected resistant genotypes developed both faster (i.e Security) and slower (i.e. Tygress) than on the susceptible genotype (Amelia). These findings corroborate previously observed results that resistant genotypes by themselves did not affect whitefly development [
