 <italic>tabaci</italic> successfully developed from egg to adult on all genotypes. Median developmental time varied with genotypes (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The total developmental time on Tygress was longer than on other genotypes (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, developmental time does not seem to be associated with TYLCV resistance, as whitefly median developmental time on three other TYLCV-resistant genotypes (Inbar, Shanty and Security) was very similar to that of susceptible genotypes (Amelia and FL-47) (
