<p>More viruliferous whiteflies settled on non-infected leaves, a converse effect than what we observed with non-viruliferous whiteflies, which preferred to settle on TYLCV symptomatic leaves (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). At three weeks post inoculation, viruliferous whiteflies preferentially settled on non-infected leaves versus TYLCV-infected leaves of both the susceptible (
