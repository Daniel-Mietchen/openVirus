<p>Settling differences between infected and non-infected leaves were evaluated using one TYLCV-susceptible (Florida 47) and one TYLCV-resistant (Security) genotype. In general, TYLCV infection status of whiteflies, TYLCV susceptibility status of resistant and susceptible genotypes, as well as timing post inoculation influenced whitefly settling.</p>
