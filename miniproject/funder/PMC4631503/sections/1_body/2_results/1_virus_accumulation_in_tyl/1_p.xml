<p>Significant differences in virus accumulation were observed among tomato genotypes at 3 weeks (

 <italic>F</italic> = 43.26; df = 5, 64; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001), and 12 weeks (
 <italic>F</italic> = 12.71; df = 5, 63; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0001) post inoculation, respectively (

Susceptible genotypes (Amelia and Florida 47) accumulated greater numbers of viral copies when compared with resistant (Inbar, Security, Shanty and Tygress) genotypes regardless of the time post inoculation. Viral copy numbers did not differ significantly among TYLCV-resistant genotypes (
 <xref rid="pone.0142114.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). The numbers of viral copies in TYLCV-susceptible genotypes were 3 to 22 times greater than in TYLCV-resistant genotypes. Regardless of the genotype, the copy numbers were greater at 3 weeks post inoculation than at 6 and 12 weeks post inoculation. There was a substantial decrease in viral copy numbers from 3 to 6 weeks, but that was not evident from 6 weeks to 12 weeks (
