<p>Whitefly development was monitored on infected and non-infected leaves of one TYLCV-susceptible (Florida 47) and one TYLCV-resistant (Security) genotype. Whitefly median developmental time varied with TYLCV infection, but not in both genotypes. The total developmental time from egg to adulthood was less on TYLCV-infected Florida 47 leaves than on non-infected leaves (
