<p>Whiteflies were able to acquire the virus from infected plants regardless of the genotype for all time periods (

 <italic>F</italic> = 5.31; df = 5, 27; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0020), 6 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 10.43; df = 5, 30,

 <italic>F</italic> = 4.11; df = 5, 28; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0070) WPI, respectively. Accumulation of TYLCV in whiteflies following a 72h AAP on TYLCV-susceptible genotypes was up to three orders of magnitude greater than in whiteflies that were given an AAP on TYLCV-resistant genotypes. However, the ability of whiteflies to acquire the virus from infected plants of susceptible or resistant genotypes was not influenced by the time of inoculation (
