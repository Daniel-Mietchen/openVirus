  <p>The figure represents accumulation of viral copies in the leaf tissue with time for both, resistant (black line) and susceptible (grey line) genotypes. The threshold for virus acquisition by the vector (dashed black line) and the threshold for vector preference towards infected plants (solid black line) are also shown.</p>
