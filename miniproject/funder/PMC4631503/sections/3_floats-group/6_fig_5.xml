  <title>Settling of non-viruliferous whiteflies (

  </title>
  <p>Bars with standard errors indicate percent settling of non-viruliferous adult whiteflies on TYLCV-infected (black bars) or non-infected (grey bars) leaves of a TYLCV-resistant (Security) and a susceptible (Florida 47) genotype 24h post release. Panels show whitefly settling on infected and non-infected plants after 3, 6, and 12 weeks post inoculation, respectively. Different letters indicate significant differences between treatments at Î± = 0.05 based on least square means.</p>
