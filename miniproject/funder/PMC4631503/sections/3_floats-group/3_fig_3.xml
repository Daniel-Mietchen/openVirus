  <title>TYLCV accumulation in leaf tissue at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post inoculation (WPI).</title>
  <p>Circles with standard errors represent average number of TYLCV C2 copies accumulated in leaf samples from TYLCV-resistant and -susceptible genotypes (Amelia and Florida 47). Copy numbers were estimated by qPCR followed by absolute quantification using plasmids containing TYLCV C2 gene inserts as standards. Different letters on bars indicate significant differences in copy numbers among treatments as deduced by Tukey-Kramer grouping (Î± = 0.05). Y-axis is shown in a logarithmic scale.</p>
