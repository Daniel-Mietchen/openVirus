  <title>TYLCV acquisition by whiteflies (
   <italic>B</italic>. 
   <italic>tabaci</italic>) at 3, 6 and 12 weeks post inoculation (WPI).
  </title>
  <p>Circles with standard errors represent average number of TYLCV C2 copies accumulated in whitefly samples (5 whiteflies in each sample) that were exposed to a 72 h AAP on TYLCV infected foliage of TYLCV-resistant and -susceptible tomato genotypes followed by 72 h of caging on cotton plants. Copy numbers were estimated by qPCR followed by absolute quantification using plasmids containing TYLCV C2 gene inserts as standards. Different letters on bars indicate significant differences in copy numbers among treatments as deduced by Tukey-Kramer grouping (Î± = 0.05). Y-axis is shown in a logarithmic scale.</p>
