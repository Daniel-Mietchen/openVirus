<p>Seasonal cyclicity is a ubiquitous feature of acute infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and may be a ubiquitous feature of human infectious diseases in general, as illustrated in Tables 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007327.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Each acute infectious disease has its own seasonal window of occurrence, which, importantly, may vary among geographic locations and differ from other diseases within the same location. Here we explore the concept of an epidemic calendar, which is the idea that seasonality is a unifying feature of epidemic-prone diseases and, in the absence of control measures, the local calendar can be marked by epidemics (
