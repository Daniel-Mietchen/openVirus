<p>From an ecological perspective, wildlife systems offer a rich arena to study the diverse ways in which behavior impacts disease transmission. Understanding transmission within wildlife is not only relevant for zoonotic infections but is also important for conservation ecology (i.e., in order to protect populations from disease-induced declines, such as is currently experienced by Tasmanian devils, North American bats, and amphibians worldwide). More broadly, understanding the ecology of disease transmission in wildlife can lead to insights that may be applied to human health. Wildlife and urban human populations exist at opposite extremes of a continuum of exposure and/or subjection to natural environmental cycles. Due to the potentially more extreme effect of natural environmental cycles on wildlife disease systems—including climatic influences on wildlife behavior—wildlife could serve as a model for developing methods and conceptual frameworks needed to disentangle the contribution of environmental cycles and behavior from other drivers of disease transmission.</p>
