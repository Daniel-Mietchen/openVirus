  <title>Relationship between dengue annual incidence rates and the 5 selected explanatory variables.</title>
  <p>For each selected explanatory variable (A to E), mean annual incidence rates observed in 28 communes of New Caledonia (crosses), and mean annual incidence rates predicted by the univariable SVM model based on the corresponding explanatory variable (dots). The curve represents the univariable SVM model predictions over the whole observed range of the explanatory variable (non-linear regression curve). RMSE of each model are 53 (A), 68 (B), 69 (C), 72 (D), 75 (E), as presented in
