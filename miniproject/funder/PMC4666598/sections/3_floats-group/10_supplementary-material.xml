  <title>Increase of mean temperature in Noumea as projected by ten coupled atmosphere-ocean models at the 2100 horizon.</title>
  <p>The yellow-green curve (1971–2005) represents the observed mean temperature in Noumea. The other curves represent the average of the annual time series simulated by the ten models over the historical period (1971–2005, red curve), and the 2006–2099 period under RCP 4.5 (blue curve) and RCP 8.5 (green curve) scenarios. Horizontal segments represent the average of the time series over the given periods (1980–1999, 2010–2029 and 2080–2099). Arrows represent the average increase in mean temperature for each time period (see 
   <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Background shadings represent the annual range of mean temperature simulations over the ten models.
