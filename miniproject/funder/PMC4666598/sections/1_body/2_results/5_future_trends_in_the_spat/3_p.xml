 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref> show the potential future spatial distribution of dengue incidence rates during epidemics according to the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. By the end of the century, dengue incidence rates during epidemic years could reach a maximum of 378 cases per 10,000 people per year in the most affected commune under the RCP 4.5 scenario (

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, communes at low risk now might experience a sharp increase in dengue incidence rates during epidemic years from 64 to more than 200 cases per 10,000 people per year. According to RCP 8.5 climate projections, the average (across communes) dengue mean annual incidence rates during epidemic years could raise by 29 cases per 10,000 people per year for the 2010–2029 period, and by 149 cases per 10,000 people per year for the 2080–2099 period, almost doubling dengue burden in New Caledonia by the end of the century (
