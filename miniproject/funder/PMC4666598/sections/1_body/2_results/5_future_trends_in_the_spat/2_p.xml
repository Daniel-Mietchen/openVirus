 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> shows a comparison of the average (across epidemic years) annual dengue incidence rates predicted by the SVM model (panel 6B) or the linear model (panel 6C). The SVM model performs slightly better than the linear one: the correlation coefficient between observed and predicted incidence rates are 0.89 (SVM) and 0.85 (linear), and the RMSE are 42 and 43 cases/10,000 people/year respectively for the SVM and the linear model. The low RMSE of the linear model (~43 cases per 10,000 people per year) shows that the linear model based on the two best explanatory variables is suitable. The Shapiro-Wilks and the Bartlett's test confirmed the normality and homoscedasticity of residuals.
