 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows, for both climate change scenarios, the average increase of mean temperature for the two selected 20-year periods compared to the 1980–1999 historical simulations. All models predict that the mean temperature will increase over time, with projections being more pessimistic for RCP 8.5 simulations. The CMIP5-AR4 inter-model variability in temperature increase is presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>. According to the RCP 8.5 scenario, temperature could increase by more than 3°C by the end of the next century, with a standard deviation across models of only 0.6°C, showing the strong coherency in different model projections.
