<p>By definition, the average across epidemic years of age-standardised annual incidence rates reflects mainly the spatial pattern of severe epidemics, i.e. epidemics of years 1995, 1998, 2003 and 2009. During years 1995, 1998 and 2003, the North-eastern corner was the most affected. During the 2009 epidemic, the most affected communes were Voh and Kon√©, on the West coast (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> for the location of these communes), but the North Eastern corner was still severely affected [
