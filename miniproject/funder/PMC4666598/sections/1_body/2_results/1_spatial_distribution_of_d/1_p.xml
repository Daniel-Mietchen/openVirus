 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows that once an epidemic spreads over the territory, dengue cases are distributed heterogeneously. Mean annual age-standardised incidence rates across epidemic years range from 22 to 375 cases per 10,000 people per year, with a mean across communes of 168 cases per 10,000 people per year and a standard deviation across communes of 83 cases per 10,000 people per year. On average the East coast is more affected than the West coast. We can also see that the North-eastern corner of New Caledonia is heavily affected, with dengue incidence rates two to three times higher than in the rest of the territory.
