<p>The semi-variograms of dengue incidence rates did not reveal any significant spatial autocorrelation, whether they were calculated for each epidemic year separately or on the average incidence rates across years. This suggests that the local spread of dengue viruses around a case imported in a commune do not exceed the mean radius of a commune in New Caledonia, e.g. approximately 13 kilometres. Hence, we did not incorporate any spatial structure into the subsequent models.</p>
