<p>When looking at univariable non-linear SVM models, the best variable explaining the spatial heterogeneity of dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates is the percentage of unemployed people per commune. The second most important explanatory variable is the mean temperature. Rainfall is the least explanatory variable of those selected for multivariable regression modelling. Moreover, the RMSE of models based on observed rainfall almost equal the initial standard deviation (across the territory) of dengue average annual incidence rates, which means that rainfall are poor predictors of dengue average annual incidence rates during epidemic years. The relationship between dengue average annual incidence rates and each of the explanatory variables is linear, except for the fraction of unemployed people (
