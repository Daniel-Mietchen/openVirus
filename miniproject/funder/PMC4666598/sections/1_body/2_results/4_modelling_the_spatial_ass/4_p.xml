<p>The best explicative model is a model predicting increasing average annual incidence rates during epidemics in communes where the mean temperature and the mean number of people per premise increase (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The influence of these two variables on the spatial structure of dengue incidence rates is close to linear as shown by almost parallel contour lines on 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>. This model accurately predicts the sharp mean increase in incidence in the three communes of the North East of New Caledonia (Hienghène, Ouégoa and Pouébo). The maximal error of the model is observed for Farino (West coast), which is the only commune where all inhabitants live at an altitude higher than 200 m above sea level.
