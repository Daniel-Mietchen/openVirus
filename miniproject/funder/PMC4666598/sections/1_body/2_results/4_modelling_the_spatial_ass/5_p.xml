 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and of average annual incidence rates as predicted by the best SVM model based on two explanatory variables (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). This model captures the observed spatial heterogeneity in average annual incidence rates between the East coast and the West coast, as well as the sharp increase in the three communes of the North East.
