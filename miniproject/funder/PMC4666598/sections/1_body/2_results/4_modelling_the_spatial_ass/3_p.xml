<p>All models based on two explanatory variables and including at least one variable related to rainfall (best RMSE of ~58 cases per 10,000 people per year) performed worse than the best univariable model (RMSE of ~53 cases per 10,000 people per year). This suggests that in New Caledonia, rainfall has little influence on the spatial variability of dengue viral circulation at the commune level. Models combining two explanatory variables (excluding rainfall) performed better than models based on only one variable. The addition of a third explanatory variable did not improve significantly model performances. Hence we focused our attention on models combining two explanatory variables.</p>
