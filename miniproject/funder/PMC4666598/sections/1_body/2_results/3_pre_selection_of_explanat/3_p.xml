<p>PCA of climate variables (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) shows that in New Caledonia, temperature is the factor accounting for most of the spatial climatic variability among communes. Temperature is highly correlated with the first PCA axis which represents 68% of the total climatic variance. Temperature and rainfall are not spatially correlated at the commune level. In each group of temperature or rainfall variables, the variables most spatially correlated with dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates were the average mean temperature (Mean temp) and the mean daily rainfall during the wettest quarter of the year (Wettest quarter) (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition to these two variables, we decided to keep a third variable, the average daily rainfall, for further statistical modelling, as this variable is more easily available in other countries or climate model simulations.
