 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows Pearson's correlation coefficients (rho) between each explanatory variable and dengue age-standardised annual incidence rates averaged across epidemic years. Dengue is spatially positively correlated with variables related to temperature and precipitation, but is negatively correlated with variables reflecting mean thermal range or extreme thermal conditions (see "Isothermality", "Temp range" or the number of days when maximum temperature exceeds 32°C in January, February and March in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that, in a given commune, marked temporal variations of temperature is a factor limiting viral circulation. Based on the linear dependence measure of correlation, dengue is also more strongly associated with temperature than with precipitation. Socio-economic variables are highly spatially correlated to dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates. Variables reflecting people's way of life (e.g. place of birth), local human density (e.g. mean number of people per household, percentage of premises under 40 m
 <sup>2</sup>), or human movement are more correlated with dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates than variables related to the housing type (e.g. premises with inside toilets) (absolute value of rho up to 0.75 for the former and 0.58 for the latter). In particular, the fact that the place where people were born is spatially significantly associated with dengue fever incidence rates (correlation coefficient around 0.5 for people born in New Caledonia and– 0.5 for people born elsewhere) whereas the type of premise is not (absolute correlation coefficient lower than 0.3 for variables describing access to water or electricity) suggests that individual behaviours have a stronger influence on incidence rates than local housing conditions.
