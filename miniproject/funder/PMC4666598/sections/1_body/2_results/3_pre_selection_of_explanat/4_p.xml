 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> shows that the spatial variability of socio-economic factors mainly reflects the spatial distribution of people with different cultural habits. Communes where a high proportion of inhabitants live in a tribal way, in small premises, with few means of transportation and a high percentage of unemployment are opposed to communes where many people live a western way of life, in permanent buildings, using air conditioning and getting around using cars. Even though the number of people per premise seems to be correlated with the proportion of people living in tribes, we kept this variable as it stands out of the cluster of variables representing the way of life. We thus decided to keep the percentage of unemployed people and the mean number of inhabitants per housing as representative of socio-economic factors for further statistical modelling.
