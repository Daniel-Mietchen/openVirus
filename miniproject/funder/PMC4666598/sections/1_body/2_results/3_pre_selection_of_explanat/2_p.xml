 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> shows the PCA results. For clarity reasons, we only show the results of PCA performed on the variables most spatially correlated with dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates, with an absolute Pearson correlation coefficient over 0.6 for socio-economic variables, and over 0.4 for climate variables (these thresholds were selected after verifying that they did not modify the variable pre-selection results).
