<p>From an oversimplified point of view, there are three population groups, having different cultural and social habits: Melanesian people, people of French descent who migrated two hundred years ago, and people from various origins who migrated recently. Although the three groups are spatially partially mixed, Melanesian people live mostly on the East coast, whereas the second group live mostly on the West coast and the third group live mainly in Noumea.</p>
