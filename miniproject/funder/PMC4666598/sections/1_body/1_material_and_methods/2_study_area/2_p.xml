<p>New Caledonia is located at the limit of the tropical zone between latitudes 19째 and 23째 South. The East coast and the West coast are separated by a mountain range culminating at 1629 m. Climate is heterogeneous: the East coast and the southern tip of the main island get more rain than the West coast, as mountains provide a vertical lift to the warm and humid air brought by trade winds. Average rainfall range from 800 mm/year in some western weather stations to 3200 mm/year in the East. Temperature can drop below 10째C during the cool season on clear nights and sometimes rise above 35째C due to the influence of tropical air masses [
