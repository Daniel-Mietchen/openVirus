<p>In New Caledonia, dengue represents a major public health problem with large epidemics affecting the territory every three to five years and involving a succession of all four serotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Co-circulation of different dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) during major epidemics is rare, and has been observed only once (2009). Before 2003, vector control measures consisted in systematic chemical control of adult mosquitoes covering large areas during the warm season, independently from the occurrence of dengue cases. Since 2003, systematic spreading of adulticide has been stopped, and vector control measures include continuous large communication and prevention campaigns fostering source reduction aimed at all citizens, as well as focal chemical control of adult mosquitoes 100 m around declared cases within 24 h of notification. Public Health infrastructure is reliable, and the surveillance system for dengue fever has been efficient for many years. All people have access to medical care, even though people living in remote areas might have more difficulties to reach local health centres.
