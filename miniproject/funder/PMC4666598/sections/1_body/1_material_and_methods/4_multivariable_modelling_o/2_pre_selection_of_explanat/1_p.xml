<p>To reduce the number of variables to study, the number of models to build and to facilitate interpretation, we first used principal component analysis (PCA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] separately on climate and socio-economic variables to identify clusters of correlated explanatory variables. In each cluster, we selected the variable most correlated with average (across epidemic years) annual dengue incidence rates as representative of all other variables in the cluster. We were then left with a set of three climate variables and two socio-economic variables as inputs for modelling the incidence rates (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).
