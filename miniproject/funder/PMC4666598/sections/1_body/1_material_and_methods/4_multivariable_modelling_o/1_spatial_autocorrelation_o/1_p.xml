<p>In order to assess the global spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of average (across epidemic years) yearly dengue incidence rates over the territory to know whether we had to take it into account in the modelling process, we used semi-variograms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We compared the semi-variogram of observed incidence rates to 200 semi-variograms obtained by random permutations (i.e. without replacement) of the spatial locations of each commune centroid. Distances between pairs of commune centroids were calculated along the roads to take into account the potential influence of the central mountainous chain in the spatial spread of the disease. These semi-variograms measure the global auto-correlation over the entire territory. Therefore, they are not able to detect potential localised auto-correlation. We also assessed the SAC of annual incidence rates for each epidemic year, to assess the presence of global diffusion patterns that could be masked by calculating the average annual incidence rates across epidemic years.
