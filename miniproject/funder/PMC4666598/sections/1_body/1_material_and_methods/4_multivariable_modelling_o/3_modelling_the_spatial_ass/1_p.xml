<p>To overcome several methodological issues such as multi-collinearity between explanatory variables [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] or the possible existence of complex non-linear links between the explanatory and the response variables, we chose to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to model the link between the five selected explanatory variables and mean yearly dengue incidence rates. SVM is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm that can be used in high dimensional multivariable classification or regression problems [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It can be used to model non-linear links without any

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The advantages of using such models are that they do not rely on any assumption regarding the distribution of the response variable; hence there is no need for checking the normality or homoscedasticity of residuals. As they are non-parametric, they are also robust to collinearity between explanatory variables and, compared to classic parametric non-linear models, there is no need for data exploration to specify the shape of the link between the explanatory and the response variables. Another advantage of using such non-linear models to begin with instead of classic linear ones is that explanatory variables potentially linked to the response variable in a non-linear way are not wrongly discarded.
