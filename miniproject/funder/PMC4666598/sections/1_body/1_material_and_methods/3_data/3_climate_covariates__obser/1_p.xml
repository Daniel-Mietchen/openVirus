<p>Observed rainfall, maximal temperature (Max temp) and minimal temperature (Min temp) were provided by Meteo France on a daily basis from 1995 to 2012 in 118 weather stations scattered all over New Caledonia. We first selected data from the same time periods as the epidemiological data (September of epidemic year 
 <italic>n-1</italic> to August of epidemic year 
 <italic>n</italic>). To handle missing data, only time series covering at least a full continuous year were kept resulting in 67 locations for temperature, and 113 locations for rainfall (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). For each variable, at each weather station, we then calculated a typical year time-series, 365 days long, by averaging data recorded on the same day and month across the years of the study period (i.e. we averaged data recorded every January 1
 <sup>st</sup>, every January 2
 <sup>nd</sup>, etc.). We then calculated the average of these 365 day-long time series. This average is hereafter called “climate index”, thus obtaining one climate index for each climate variable at each weather station.
