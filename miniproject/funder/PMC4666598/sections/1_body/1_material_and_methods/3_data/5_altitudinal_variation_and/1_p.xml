<p>To assess the effect of altitudinal variation on dengue incidence rates, we used the official New Caledonia’s digital elevation model, available on a 10 m resolution grid map ([
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). To obtain a map of the mean altitude of human settlements per commune (variable “dem” in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), we applied the same upscaling algorithm as for the climate data: we assigned each tribe and each city the altitude of the pixel the tribe or city was lying in, then we calculated a mean altitude over all tribes belonging to a same commune, a mean altitude over all cities belonging to a same commune, and finally calculated an average of the tribe and city mean altitude weighted by the percentage of people living in either. We thus obtained a map of mean altitude per commune that takes into account only the altitude of the locations where hosts are present, and where dengue transmission can actually occur. Although mountains in New Caledonia can be as high as 1 629 m, in 24 out of the 28 communes included in the study, people live below 100 m of altitude in average. In 3 communes, people live between 100 m and 150 m in average. In only one commune people live at 250 m in average.
