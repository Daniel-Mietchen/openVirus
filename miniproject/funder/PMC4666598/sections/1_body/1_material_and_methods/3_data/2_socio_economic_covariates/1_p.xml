<p>From the 2009 territorial census [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], recorded at the commune level, we selected a total of 51 variables that could potentially influence dengue transmission. These variables can broadly be categorised in sociologic variables reflecting people's activity and financial means, variables linked to human movement within or between communes, variables linked to people's housing, and variables linked to human local density (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for a complete list of these variables). Because human density per commune is very low and does not reflect local densities, we decided not to include it in the analysis. 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows maps of two of these social variables. In New-Caledonia, the percentage of unemployed people (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) varies from 3 to 27% of the population depending on the commune. Unemployment is higher on the East coast than on the West coast, with the fraction of unemployed people being over 10% in most of the eastern communes. The average number of people per household represents local densities (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). It varies from 2.9 to 5.3 people per household over the territory, and is highest in the communes in the North-East.
