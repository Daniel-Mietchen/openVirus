<p>We studied 24,272 cases of dengue fever reported to the Direction of Sanitary and Social Affairs (DASS-NC) from 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 1995 to 30
 <sup>th</sup> September 2012, a period over which the spatial location of cases was recorded at the commune level. For each reported case, the date retained to calculate incidence rates was the date of consultation, which can differ from the date of infection by one to two weeks. Cases were recorded on a clinical basis, but more than 71% of declared cases have also been laboratory confirmed either by virus isolation, viral RNA detection (RT-PCR) or NS1 antigen detection (ELISA), or by detection of IgM (ELISA). During the study period, changes in the surveillance system have been homogeneous over the country, making spatial analysis of mean incidence rates possible.
