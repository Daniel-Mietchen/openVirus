<p>Age-standardisation was necessary as the age structure of the population varies from one commune to another, and age groups are affected differently by dengue epidemics (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We performed age-standardisation using a direct method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which consists in calculating the expected incidence rate in each commune if all communes had the same (arbitrary) age-structure. We chose the World Health Organisation standardised population as the reference population for the arbitrary age-structure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Population numbers and age-structure of each commune used to calculate age-specific incidence rates were interpolated linearly from the 1989, 1996, 2004 and 2009 territorial censuses [
