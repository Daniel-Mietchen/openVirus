<p>For each of the 33 communes composing New Caledonia, we calculated mean yearly age-standardised incidence rates over epidemic years during the study period, i.e. 1995, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2009. Epidemic years were defined according to the tercile method described in Descloux 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]: a year is considered epidemic if the annual incidence rate of this year over the entire territory is in the upper tercile of annual incidence rates calculated between 1971 and 2012 (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>. annual incidence rate over the territory &gt; = 18 cases per 10,000 people per year). As the majority of outbreaks display a similar seasonal evolution (beginning in January, epidemic peak between March and May, and end in July) and according to the climate seasonality in New Caledonia, to calculate annual incidence rates, in each commune, we aggregated data annually from 1
 <sup>st</sup> September of epidemic year 
 <italic>n-1</italic> to 31
 <sup>st</sup> August of epidemic year 
 <italic>n</italic>. We then calculated, in each commune, the average annual incidence rate across epidemic years. Average incidence rates over epidemic years of the study period are a robust indicator of how easily the virus circulates in a given commune during epidemics (i.e. from 1
 <sup>st</sup> September of year 
 <italic>n-1</italic> to 31
 <sup>st</sup> August of year 
 <italic>n</italic> of the selected years), independently from the inter-annual variability of spatial patterns from one epidemic year to another.
