<p>Model simulations are available at different spatial locations depending on the spatial grid used by each model. For each model, we selected time-series from the spatial point closest to Noumea. We first assessed the necessity of performing a statistical downscaling to correct the retrieved time series so they fit the locally observed temperature time series [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], but concluded that correction was not necessary for estimating average increases in mean temperature in New Caledonia. For the periods 2010–2029 and 2080–2099, we calculated the increase of mean temperature averaged over the 20-year periods compared to the 1980–1999 historical data average (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). By comparing this mean increase to the mean increase in time series taken from other close grid points around New Caledonia, we concluded that this mean increase could be considered homogeneous over the whole territory. As all 10 selected models predictions were coherent (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), we averaged the mean increases over all models. By applying this mean increase to the map of current temperature experienced by people during epidemic years (shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), we obtained temperature maps for the periods 2010–2029 and 2080–2099 for both climate change scenarios. As projection errors are not readily available for each model, to calculate prediction error of the projections of the mean increase in temperature, for each 20-years period and each scenario, we used the standard deviation across all 10 models as a proxy (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref> to see the inter-model variability of temperature increase).
