<p>To obtain maps of mean temperature under different global warming scenarios, we first retrieved historical (1971–2005) and future (2006–2099) projections of mean temperature simulated by ten coupled ocean-atmosphere models from the 5
 <sup>th</sup> Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project–Assessment Report 4 (CMIP5-AR4) experiments [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The ten selected models are "bcc-csm1-1", "CanESM2", "CCSM4", "CNRM-CM5", "HadGEM2-CC", "inmcm4", "IPSL-CM5A-MR", "IPSL-CM5B-LR", "MPI-ESM-LR", and "NorESM1-M". They were selected based on their capacity to reproduce a reasonable climate in the South Pacific [

Two scenarios of emission (greenhouse gases and aerosols)—referred to as "Representative Concentration Pathways" (RCPs)–were chosen: RCP 8.5 refers to a high emission scenario while RCP 4.5 refers to a midrange mitigation emission scenario. In this article, these data are respectively denoted "historical" (1971–2005), "RCP 4.5" and "RCP 8.5" (2006–2099).
