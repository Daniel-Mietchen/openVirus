<p>As described below in the results section, temperature is a key factor determining dengue spatial variability over New Caledonia. We thus decided to explore the evolution of dengue average annual incidence rates during epidemics under changing climate conditions (considering all others variables as remaining constant), by applying the best explicative multivariable model with inputs from maps of temperature for the future (see methods/data/climate covariates: assessing the trends of future mean temperature in New Caledonia). Because the use of kernels in nonâ€“linear SVM models impairs predictions outside the observed range of explanatory variables, we built a linear approximation of the best SVM model on present observed data. The linear approximation consists of a simple linear model linking the two best explanatory variables to observed dengue age-standardised average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates as the response variable. Normality and homoscedasticity of residuals were confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilks' test and the Bartlett's test respectively [

To evaluate the error in incidence rates predictions due to the inter-GCM variability of mean temperature increase projections, we calculated, for each time-period and each scenario, the average annual incidence rates during epidemics as predicted by each GCM, and then calculated a standard deviation of predicted annual incidence rates across the different models.
