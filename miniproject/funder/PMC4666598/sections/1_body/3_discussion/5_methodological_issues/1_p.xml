<p>The analysis of the spatial pattern of infectious diseases, in relation with environmental or socio-economic factors raises a number of methodological issues, such as the presence of spatial auto-correlation, the spatial scale of aggregation of the data, the existence of possible non-linear links between the response and the explanatory variables, or the presence of multi-collinearity between the response variables. Most issues have already been addressed in the past, and solutions already exist to handle them. For example, the reviews by Dormann 
 <italic>et al</italic>. deal with multi-collinearity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The main issue we have been confronted with in our study was the spatial upscaling of meteorological data observed at precise locations to the same spatial level of aggregation as the epidemiological data. In existing spatial studies of dengue fever at a national scale, authors have geo-spatially interpolated climate variables on regular grids using kriging methods, and have averaged gridded values over a given administrative division [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This approach has two drawbacks in New Caledonia. Simple kriging models do not take into account the potential elevation between two given points, leading to biased estimates of temperature in mountainous regions. Moreover, the traditional approach used in climatology, which consist in aggregating temperature over grid points taken uniformly over the whole aggregative area makes the implicit assumption that people at risk are distributed homogeneously over the aggregative area. This is particularly problematic in New Caledonia where large areas are not inhabited. In our approach, as epidemiological data are collected at the individual level, we tried to estimate the climate conditions for each individual (and therefore for the mosquitoes surrounding each individual). However, the algorithm used introduces some noise, due to the fact that the weather stations are sometimes kilometres away from some towns or tribes. High spatial resolution climate data obtained from high resolution modelling of atmospheric conditions could be used, but some noise will be introduced by the modelling error compared to the observed data. This issue needs further attention in the future to increase the quality of spatial epidemiological and environmental studies.
