<p>To calculate mean incidence rates, we have used the consultation date of cases. Consultation can occur 1 to 5 days after the onset of symptoms, and the incubation period lasts 4 to7 days on average [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which means that the consultation date can differ from one to two weeks from the date of infection. This loss of temporal precision is not important here to calculate maps of incidence rates, as for each commune, we have averaged incidence rates across many years.
