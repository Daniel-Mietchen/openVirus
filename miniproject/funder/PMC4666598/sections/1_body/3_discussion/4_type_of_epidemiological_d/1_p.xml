<p>Here we used data collected routinely by the Direction of Sanitary and Social Affairs. As any surveillance system, it is highly probable that not all dengue cases have been recorded. However, in New Caledonia, the data is of high quality, and the spatial standardisation of the surveillance system (i.e. all the actions taken to be able to compare data collected by different people, at different places [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]) is good, which means that the proportion of cases that are not recorded by the surveillance system are probably comparable from one commune to another. Hence, maps of incidence rates calculated from routinely collected data can be used to study the spatial variability of true incidence rates.
