<p>Regarding the link between socio-economic variables and dengue incidence rates during epidemics, a limitation of this study is the absence of historical time series of socio-economic variables. We then had to assume that the data retrieved from the 2009 census is representative of the mean socio-economic spatial pattern over the epidemic years of the 1995–2012 period. As there has been no major historical event leading to population migration in New Caledonia during this time period and as socio-economic variables represent mainly people’s way of life, we think this assumption is realistic.</p>
