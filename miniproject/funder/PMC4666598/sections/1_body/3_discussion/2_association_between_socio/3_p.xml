<p>Regarding the spatial association found between the fraction of unemployed people (i.e. peopleâ€™s way of life) and dengue incidence rates during epidemics in New Caledonia, it is interesting to point out that on the East coast, a larger fraction of inhabitants are Melanesian people living in tribes, whereas on the West coast, the majority of people are people from French descent having a western way of life. It would be interesting to perform sociologic studies to precisely identify which human behaviour leads to an increased risk of catching dengue fever. Such information would be useful to define communication messages towards at risk populations.</p>
