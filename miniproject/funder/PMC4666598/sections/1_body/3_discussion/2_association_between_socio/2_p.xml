<p>Our results are consistent with previous studies that have pointed out the importance of socio-economic factors on the spatial distribution of dengue cases, whatever the spatial scale studied: national (&gt;200 km) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or local (&lt;10 km) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The spatial association between the percentage of unemployed people and dengue in New Caledonia cannot be interpreted in terms of lack of economic activity only, as shown by the PCA on socio-economic factors. This variable we selected as input for the models is highly correlated with other variables reflecting the way of life, socio-economic and cultural differences existing in New Caledonia, which are in turn highly correlated to housing type. Therefore, at this spatial scale in New Caledonia, it is difficult to statistically differentiate the role played by human behaviour, human activity or housing type in dengue fever transmission. However, those three factors influence the contact rate between viraemic patients or susceptible hosts on one hand, and mosquitoes on the other hand. This highlights the importance of limiting the contact between humans and vectors and should lead local authorities to strengthen communication campaigns about personal protection measures towards populations at risk.
