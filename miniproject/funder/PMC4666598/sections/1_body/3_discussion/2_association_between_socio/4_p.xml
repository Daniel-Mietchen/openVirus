<p>The spatial association between the number of people per household and dengue incidence rates can be explained by the short flight range of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. These mosquitoes are often captured in the very house where they emerged or in the neighbouring houses, flying an average of 40 to 80 m during their life [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as the main vector are known to be highly spatially focal, with dengue cases usually clustering within 200 m to 800 m of each other [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Our results suggest that, in New Caledonia, dengue cases probably cluster within houses. Sick people should protect themselves until they are no longer vireamic to avoid human to mosquito transmission, and people living around a case should protect themselves to avoid getting infected while infectious mosquitoes are still active in the neighbourhood. Taking such individual actions could reduce the intensity of dengue transmission and reduce dengue burden over the territory. This message could be strengthened in the recommendations given by the authorities.
