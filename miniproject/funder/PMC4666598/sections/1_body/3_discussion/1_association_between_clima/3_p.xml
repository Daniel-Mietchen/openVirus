<p>The positive association found between the mean temperature and dengue incidence rates is consistent with the one found in previous studies having analysed the spatial distribution of dengue cases at spatial scale &gt; 200 km [

In these studies as well as in ours, all regions were located between 10° and 25° of latitude, at the fringe of the tropical area, except Argentina, where the region studied extends to 35° South. In the 10° ˗ 25° latitudinal band, annual mean temperature lies in a range of temperature where the life cycle of the mosquito is very sensitive to temperature changes [
