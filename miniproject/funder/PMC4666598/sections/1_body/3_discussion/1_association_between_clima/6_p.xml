<p>It would be interesting to perform the same kind of multi-factorial spatial analysis in areas of epidemic or endemic transmission located closer to the equator, where the mean temperature is higher, to see what climatic factors impact the spatial distribution of cases. This kind of study could help understand better the complex interplay between the different factors (climate, socio-economic, immunologic, viral, entomologicâ€¦) associated with dengue fever transmission.</p>
