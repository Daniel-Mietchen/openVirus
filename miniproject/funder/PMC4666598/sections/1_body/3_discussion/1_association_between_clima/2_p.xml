<p>In Noumea, the main city, precise climate variables and important thresholds values have been identified as necessary conditions to trigger an epidemic (e.g. number of days when maximal temperature exceeds 32°C in January/February/March, and number of days when maximal relative humidity exceeds 95% during January [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). At the scale of the entire territory, we found that the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemic years is strongly influenced by the average mean temperature. These results suggest that temperature has a major role in dengue dynamics in an insular territory characterised by climate seasonality. However, we did not find a strong association between the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemics and average rainfall or with the number of days when maximal temperature exceeds 32°C. The variables influencing either the triggering of an epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] or its spatial distribution are not the same. Our findings highlight the complexity of studying and understanding dengue dynamics, the importance of well separating the two epidemiological processes of epidemic triggering in a susceptible population, and its intensity once it has started by clearly defining the modelling target (incidence rates for epidemic intensity, or dummy variables for epidemic triggering), and the importance of well defining the scale of study (temporal evolution, or spatial distribution).
