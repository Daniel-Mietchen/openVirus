<p>The spatial association found between temperature and dengue incidence rates during epidemics in New Caledonia can be explained by the influence of temperature on the life cycle of the mosquito transmitting the virus in New Caledonia, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. High temperatures increase the productivity of the breeding sites through an acceleration of the metabolism of the mosquito, and a faster development of the micro-organisms the larvae feed on, resulting in a higher vector density even with the same number of breeding sites [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. High temperatures also speed up the extrinsic incubation period [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> adult mosquitoes, a review of 50 field mark-release-recapture studies has shown that in the field, unless temperatures become extreme (over 35°C or less than 5°C), temperature has little effect on daily mortality rate [
