<p>Some

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], thus influencing the vector density. Rainfall also increases the relative humidity, which extends the mosquitoes’ lifespan and therefore the likelihood of those who had an infectious blood meal to reach the infectious stage. However, our study suggests that in New Caledonia, there is no strong association between rainfall and the spatial distribution of cases during epidemics. A plausible explanation can be the multi-factorial nature of dengue fever, and the relative influence each factor plays on dengue dynamics: despite suitable rainfall conditions, dengue might not circulate well if other factors are limiting dengue viral circulation, such as some human behaviour influencing the contact between vector and host. This aspect has been highlighted very clearly in the United States [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Some studies have found that the effect of rainfall on vector density can be modulated by human activities such as water storage practices [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, in New Caledonia, we are not aware of specific practices to store water that could explain the lack of association between rainfall and virus circulation intensity. Another potential explanation could be that in dry areas, breeding sites are filled up by other non-climatic mechanisms, such as automatic irrigation or plant watering.
