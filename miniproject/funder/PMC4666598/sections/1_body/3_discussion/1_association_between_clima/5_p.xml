<p>Worldwide, the spatial association between rainfall and the spatial distribution of dengue cases at a “national” scale (&gt; 200 km) is not as clear as the one for temperature: one spatial study did not find any association between dengue incidence rates and rainfall [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], whereas two others did [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other factors influencing dengue transmission (e.g. anthropogenic factors influencing the availability of filled breeding sites) and not included in the different studies might blur the rainfall signal.
