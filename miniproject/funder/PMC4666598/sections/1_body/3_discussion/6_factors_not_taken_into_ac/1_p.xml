<p>Some factors that could influence the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemics have not been taken into account in this study: the location of the first cases introduced each year, the spatial variability in population immunity, viral factors such as the serotype circulating, or factors associated to the mosquito such as the spatial variability in vector competence, or dengue vector control measures. We decided not to include the serotype, as we performed the analysis on averages over several years, and as, except in 2009, there was no co-circulation of different serotypes over the territory. Therefore, spatial differences in the level of viral circulation cannot be associated with genetic differences between serotypes. A territorial seroprevalence survey to assess population immunity has been implemented recently in New Caledonia, but data are not available yet. It could be interesting to include environmental variables derived from GIS data or remote-sensing in this kind of study. For example, GIS data about built areas could be used to create indicators of the proximity of houses to reflect the fragmentation of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> habitat per commune, given that fragmentation of this habitat could potentially slow down viral circulation. The amount of vector control effort implemented in each commune is heterogeneous on the territory, as this activity falls within the communeâ€™s authority, and each commune is free to implement or not the territorial guidelines. The vector control effort in each commune is thus difficult to quantify, and data were not available yet at the time of analysis. As soon as these data will be collected by local authorities, they could be incorporated in the modelling process to assess the efficiency of vector control measures.
