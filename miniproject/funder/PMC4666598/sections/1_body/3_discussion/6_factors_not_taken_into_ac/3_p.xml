<p>Two other viruses transmitted by

 <italic>aegypti</italic> like dengue virus caused outbreaks recently in New Caledonia. Chikungunya virus has been introduced on four occasions since 2011 but in each case, the outbreaks were limited to a few cases in Noumea and surroundings. Conversely, Zika virus caused large epidemics over the territory in 2014 and 2015, with more than 1,500 confirmed cases and more than 11,000 estimated cases. Although these viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito as dengue fever, no sufficient data are available to know if the socio-economic and climatic factors driving epidemics are the same. It is likely that local vector competence and population immunity represent major limiting factors. Although dengue has caused major outbreaks in NC in 2013, chikungunya viruses have only caused a limited number of cases for reasons that remain unexplained today and despite the competence of local

It is likely that climatic factors and interactions between viruses circulating together between human-hosts and mosquito-vectors influence the epidemiology of arboviruses in New Caledonia.
