<p>The study we present here is about the spatial heterogeneity of dengue incidence rates across epidemic years, independently of the inter-annual variability of dengue incidence rates from one epidemic year to another. The mean spatial pattern studied is very robust to changes in the definition of an epidemic year, as severe epidemics will always be considered in the calculation of the mean, whatever the threshold used to distinguish epidemic from non-epidemic years. It would be interesting to know whether the spatial association found here between the severity of dengue epidemics, temperature, local people’s density and people’s way of life is consistent through time or not, and to identify the factors associated to the temporal variability of spatial patterns.</p>
