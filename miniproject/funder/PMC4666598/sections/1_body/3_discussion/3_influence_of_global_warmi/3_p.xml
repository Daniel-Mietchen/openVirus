<p>As said earlier, the positive association found between temperature and dengue incidence rates during epidemics for mean temperatures ranging from 22°C to 25°C can be explained by the effect of temperature on the mosquito life cycle and duration of extrinsic incubation period. Here, by applying a statistical model built using current observed temperature to future projections, we make the assumption that the biological effect of temperature on the mosquito life cycle and on the extrinsic incubation will remain the same under the range of temperature that might be observed in the future. For most parameters influencing transmission, this assumption is reasonable. For example, we know that in Thaïland, for DENV-2, the extrinsic incubation period is reduced from 15 days at 30°C to 7 days at 32–35°C [

However, because we used a statistical model, we were not able to incorporate the known negative effect that an increase in temperature might have on dengue transmission when temperature reaches extremes. For example, a review of fifty mark-release-recapture studies has shown that the survival and longevity of

 <italic>Aegypti</italic> mosquitoes is highly reduced when temperatures exceed a threshold, which might be around 35°C [
