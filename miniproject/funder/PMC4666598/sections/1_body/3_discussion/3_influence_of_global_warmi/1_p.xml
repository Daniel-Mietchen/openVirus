<p>The results about climate change must be interpreted keeping in mind that they represent a climate risk only, and that the spatial association between dengue incidence rates during epidemics and temperature might change over time depending on socio-demographic changes, or changes in dengue control strategy. Assuming all other factors remain constant in time, our results suggest that Public Health authorities can expect the dengue burden to raise significantly during the next century over the territory, and can expect the dengue spatial range to increase. As the GCM projections are spatially homogeneous over the territory, and as the model used to predict dengue incidence rates in the future is linear and is based on only one climate variable, the predicted absolute increase in dengue incidence rates is currently the same for all communes. This highlights the need for spatially downscaling GCM projections to gain a better understanding of the impact of climate change in the future.</p>
