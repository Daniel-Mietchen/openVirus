<p>Communes that are already severely affected by dengue epidemics will have to prepare to face higher burden of dengue fever. For communes that are at low risk now, we can see that in the future they might be affected as severely as communes at high risk now. These communes might not be prepared now to face severe epidemics of dengue fever, and they will probably need support for adaptation.</p>
