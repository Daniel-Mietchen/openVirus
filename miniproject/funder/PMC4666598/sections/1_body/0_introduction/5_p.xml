<p>New Caledonia, where the present study takes place, has a unique situation: it is a developed insular territory located in the inter-tropical area of the South Pacific where the access to high quality data and the lack of terrestrial borders with other countries make it a natural laboratory to study dengue dynamics. A gross average of ten imported cases is detected each year by the Public Health authorities. However, large dengue epidemics develop only every three to five years, sometimes causing the circulation of the same serotype during two consecutive years [

A recent study analysing the temporal relationship between dengue epidemic occurrence and climate variables at an inter-annual scale showed that the development of an epidemic in New Caledonia needs precise climate conditions relying on both temperature and relative humidity [
