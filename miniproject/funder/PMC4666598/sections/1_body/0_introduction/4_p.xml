<p>Spatial analyses at a country or territorial scale (&gt; 200 km) are scarce. Some of these studies focused on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease only [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and proposed hypotheses about the underlying processes, but did not include analyses of potential explicative factors. To our knowledge, there are only five studies to date identifying and quantifying spatial risk factors for dengue at a “national” scale &gt; ~200 km and &lt; ~1000 km. Four studies identified temperature as having a major influence on the spatial distribution of locally acquired dengue cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the last one did not assess the role of climate factors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The role of other factors in the spatial distribution of dengue cases varied from one place to another. For example, in Australia (Queensland) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], rainfall seemed to play a minor role whereas in Brazil, rainfall played a major role [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Argentina [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], urbanization level was a key factor in dengue fever spatial distribution, and in one province of Thailand [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the main factor identified was the proximity to major urban centres. No association was found with socio-economic covariates in Argentina [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] or Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
