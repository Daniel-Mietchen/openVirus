<p>Dengue fever is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease, with an estimated 50 million people being infected each year and 2.5 billion people living in areas at risk of dengue worldwide [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The true burden of clinically apparent dengue could be twice as high, and the total burden of dengue fever infections could reach 390 million people when including asymptomatic cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Whereas only nine countries were affected by dengue epidemics in the 1970's, more than a hundred countries are now reporting dengue outbreaks on a regular basis, making dengue fever the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This rapid global spatial spread over the past 40 years probably results from recent socio-economic changes such as global population growth and uncontrolled urbanisation. Lack of effective mosquito control in endemic areas, increased international air traffic or decay in public health infra-structure in developing countries are also important factors that could explain the rapid regional spread of the disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in a given country where there are sufficient numbers of susceptible hosts, these factors need to be associated with suitable climate conditions before dengue fever can establish, since it is transmitted by mosquito species whose life cycle is influenced by temperature, humidity and rainfall [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Indeed, several studies have pointed out that the current geographic distribution of dengue fever or its vector worldwide could be predicted accurately based on climate variables using either statistical models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or deterministic models [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004211.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other studies have pointed out that climate change could have profound consequences on the epidemiology of dengue fever, because increased temperature and rainfall could facilitate viral transmission and could lead to the geographic expansion of the mosquito species responsible for its transmission [
