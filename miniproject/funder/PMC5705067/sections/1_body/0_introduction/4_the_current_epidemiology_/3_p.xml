<p>The most common risk for HIV infection across the country and in the Siberian region is exposure through sharing of injecting equipment among people who inject drugs (PWID) [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002462.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the 2016 Federal AIDS Center surveillance, PWID accounted for the largest proportion of new diagnoses of any risk group at 48.8%; followed by heterosexual sex at 48.7%; homosexual sex, reportedly 1.5%; and 0.8% among perinatally infected infants [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002462.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These proportions are of uncertain validity, however, and confidence intervals were not reported. Adding to these uncertainties, the proportion of infections due to “undetermined diagnoses” in the data reported by Federal Scientific for the Prevention and Combat of AIDS is high and has been increasing for the past 10 years [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002462.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In 2014, 55.4% of new infections were reported as “no data” with regards to the source of infection [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002462.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Under-reporting of risks, especially same-sex behavior, given existing laws banning the sharing of information related to homosexuality and official allowance of stigma towards gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002462.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], is highly likely to affect these results [
