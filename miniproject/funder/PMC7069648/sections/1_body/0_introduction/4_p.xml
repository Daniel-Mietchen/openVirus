<p>The other serotypes of DENV have also been reported in Kenya, however the sequence data is very limited or lacking leaving the involved genotypes of the detected virus strains unknown. In 2011 an outbreak caused by DENV-3 was reported from Mandera region, north east Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During 2011–2014 samples of febrile patients were studied for dengue in Nairobi, northern and coastal Kenya resulting in detection of DENV-1–3, DENV-1 was reported to be the dominating serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. DENV-1 was also reported to be the dominating serotype in febrile children of Chuilambo and Kisumu, Western Kenya in 2014–2015, with all the four DENV serotypes detected by using DENV typing RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The main vector of DENV 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic> is known to be present in western parts and the coastal region of Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Sylvatic cycles of DENV are known to exist in Western Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These have not been detected in Kenya, although sylvatic yellow fever virus is known to circulate and the environmental factors would likely allow sylvatic cycles of DENV as well [
