<p>No previous information was available for rural Taita–Taveta County regarding flavivirus seroprevalence or DENV transmission. The flavivirus IgG seroprevalence in Taita–Taveta was found to be 14%, which is considerably higher than in Nairobi but yet notably lower than in coastal region (34–67%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The location of Taita-Taveta near to the dengue endemic coastal counties is likely a factor contributing to the higher seroprevalence [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The result may also be influenced by patient age, as the adult patients sampled in Taita–Taveta were probably more likely to be exposed to DENV or other flaviviruses during their life, than the younger patients sampled in Nairobi. The seroprevalence data obtained from this study cohort of febrile patients may not represent the general population in the region, and further studies with comparable study cohorts, such as general population would be needed for evaluating the regional exposure to flaviviruses in different regions of Kenya.
