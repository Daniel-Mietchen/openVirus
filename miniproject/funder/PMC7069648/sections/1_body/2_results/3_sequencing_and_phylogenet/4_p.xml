<p>The molecular clock analysis dated the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the Kenyan strains in year 2012 (95% HPD 2012–2013); a year prior to the 2013 epidemic in Mombasa. For the sequences sampled in this study and those sequenced from Malindi, the time to the most recent common (tMRCA) was 2014 (95% HPD 2014–2015).</p>
