<p>Acute DENV infection was documented by molecular methods in five patients who were found to be positive in pan-flavivirus RNA screening (0.9%) and further confirmed by sequencing. All these patients were sampled in Taitaâ€“Taveta County (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Four of the five PCR-positive samples were collected in May 2016 and one in June 2016. The DENV NS1 antigen assay was positive in three of the viral RNA positive patients. Virus isolation was attempted for three DENV-2 RNA positive samples, for which sufficient amounts of sample were available. The virus was successfully isolated from two samples in C6/36 cells (
