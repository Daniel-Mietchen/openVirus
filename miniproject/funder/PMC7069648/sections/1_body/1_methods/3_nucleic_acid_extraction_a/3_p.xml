<p>The first and second round PCRs were carried out in 50μl reaction volumes using 2μl of cDNA in the first round PCR. A total of 2μl of the first round PCR product was used as a template in the second round PCR. The thermal cycling conditions (for both rounds) included initial denaturation at 95°C for 3min followed by 35 times a cycle at 94°C for 40s, 50°C for 50s, and 72°C for 1.5min.</p>
