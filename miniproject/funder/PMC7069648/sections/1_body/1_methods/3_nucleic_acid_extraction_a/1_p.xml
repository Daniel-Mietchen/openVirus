<p>Nucleic acids were extracted from 200μl of serum or plasma sample using a MagNa Pure LC instrument and MagNa Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with an elution volume of 50μl. A pan-flavivirus RNA screening, targeting the NS5 gene, was performed using a real-time SYBR green one-step RT-PCR assay followed by a semi-nested amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis as described in detail by Moureau et al.

 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A total of 5μl of the nucleic acid extract was used as a starting material according to the Moureau et al. protocol, with the modification of using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the semi-nested amplification step. Tick-borne encephalitis virus strain Kumlinge A52 (a non-endemic flavivirus to Kenya) RNA was used as a positive control in the pan-flavivirus RNA screening.
