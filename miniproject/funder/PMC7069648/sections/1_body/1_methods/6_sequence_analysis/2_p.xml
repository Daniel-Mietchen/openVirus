<p>Complete coding sequences of the DENV-2 cosmopolitan genotype were retrieved from the GenBank (accessed in 1 March 2019) for phylogenetic analysis. Representative strains of the other DENV-2 genotypes (American, Asian American, Asian I, Asian II and sylvatic) were also included in the initial analysis. The initial analysis suggested that the Kenyan DENV-2 strains form a distinct cluster together with strains of Indian origin. These strains were selected for a more detailed analysis. Another data set was constructed of the E-gene that contained all available E sequences that clustered together with the Kenyan/Indian subcluster identified on the basis of initial complete coding sequence analysis.</p>
