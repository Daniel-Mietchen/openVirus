<p>This status (DENV marker positive or negative) served as a response variable, and age, gender and county were defined as confounding variables. Continuous age was reduced to two categories with age &lt;30, or 
 <bold>â‰¥</bold>30. First, potential risk variables were individually examined in the model with confounding variables. Then, the variables that proved to be significant in these models were tested in different combinations in a model with confounding variables to find the best multivariable model with the most significant risk factors. Interactions and multicollinearity between all variables in the models were tested. The phi coefficient was utilized in measuring multicollinearity and a value of &gt;0.5 was set as a limit for strong multicollinearity [
