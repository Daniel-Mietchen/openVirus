  <title>Median integrated relative errors (mIRE) in estimating model parameters and infection prevalence as well as prediction for simulated epidemics in a population of 10 000 with 50% âˆ’ 70% attack rate.</title>
  <p>A) Epidemic scenarios used to evaluate the performance of calibration methods. Each scenario consists of 50 stochastic trajectories obtained by simulating the model in

In each panel: MSS: Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (the method proposed here); I.Poi: Independent Poisson (Benchmark Method A); PF: Particle Filter (Benchmark Method B); EnKF: Ensemble Kalman Filter (Benchmark Method C). P-values are from Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test evaluating the hypothesis that the median of relative errors for the MSS approach is smaller than that of I.Poi (first row), PF (second row), and EnKF (third row); p-values smaller than 0.001 are displayed as ***, p-values in between 0.001 and 0.01 as ** and between 0.01 and 0.05 as *. The values of mIRE for some scenarios fall above the vertical axis range and are not displayed.
