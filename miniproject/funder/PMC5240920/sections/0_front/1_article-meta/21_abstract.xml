 <p>The sporadic emergence and spread of novel human pathogens poses a continuing threat to global public health. Early and accurate prediction of epidemic behavior is needed to inform effective public health policy decisions which much balance the risk of major outbreaks with the substantial costs of interventions. Key parameters governing the behavior of epidemics, however, cannot be directly observed and hence computational techniques are required for parameter estimation and prediction on the basis of imperfect surveillance data. In this paper, we develop a method (Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems, MSS) that utilizes accumulating epidemic data to estimate in real-time (1) key epidemic parameters including the average number of secondary cases and the mean duration of infectiousness, (2) the future number of cases, and (3) the unobserved number of infected individuals in the population. Employing comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that MSS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art calibration and prediction techniques in the majority of simulated scenarios. MSS may thus allow policy makers to respond more effectively and use resources more efficiently in the face of emerging epidemic threats.</p>
