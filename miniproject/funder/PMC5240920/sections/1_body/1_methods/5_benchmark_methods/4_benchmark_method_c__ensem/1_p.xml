<p>We selected the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for the third benchmark method. EnKF does not use a likelihood function

After such updating, the ensemble is considered as a sample from the posterior distribution for both the parameters and the states.
