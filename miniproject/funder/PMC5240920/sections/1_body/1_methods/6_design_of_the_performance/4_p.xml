<p>We implemented each of the calibration methods in Mathematica [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and evaluated their performance based on their ability to accurately (1) estimate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, effective 
 <italic>R</italic> (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>eff</sub>), the duration of infectiousness, and the current number of infectious individuals, and (2) predict the incident number of diagnoses (for the subsequent week and 3 weeks in the future) and the total cumulative cases (over the subsequent 3 weeks and over the whole epidemic). We note that in our analysis, we calibrate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and mean duration of infectiousness, and 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> are calculated based on the samples of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and mean duration of infectiousness for likelihood evaluations.
