<p>To compare the performance of our approach with that of the three competing benchmark methods (described above), we use several different simulated scenarios after the introduction of a novel viral pathogen epidemic. We develop a simple stochastic compartmental model where population members are grouped into four mutually exclusive compartments (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005257.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In this model, Infective individuals may infect Susceptibles with whom they come into contact. We assume that Infective individuals will eventually seek treatment due to worsening symptoms (and move to the Treatment compartment). Here, cases under treatment do not transmit infection and those who recover from the disease have full immunity against reinfection with the pathogen (and moved to the Recovered compartment).
