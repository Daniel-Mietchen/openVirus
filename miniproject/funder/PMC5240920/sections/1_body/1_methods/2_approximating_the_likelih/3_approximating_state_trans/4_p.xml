<p>An important question remains about how well this proposed LNA method approximates the probability distribution of epidemic states. Relying on an extensive numerical analysis, we will demonstrate in the Results section that for the epidemic scenarios considered, our method yields accurate parameter estimations and reliable predictions. We also note that our method does not rely on a single LNA model to approximate the entire epidemic trajectory. For each observation period [

 </sub>], it generates a new LNA model to approximate the epidemic behavior only over this particular period.
