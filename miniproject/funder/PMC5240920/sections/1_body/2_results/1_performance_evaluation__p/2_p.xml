<p>In all 9 scenarios (defined by epidemic severity and population size) and 5 estimation times (8 and 4 weeks to peak, at the peak, and 4 and 8 weeks after the peak), the MSS method either outperforms the competing benchmark methods or demonstrates similar performance. In particular, we note that in contrast to other approaches, the MSS method offers continuous improvement in the accuracy of parameter estimation as epidemics progress and more observations become available. At the peak and thereafter, MSS displays dominating performance, which is attributable to the more accurate likelihood approximation offered by this approach (see
