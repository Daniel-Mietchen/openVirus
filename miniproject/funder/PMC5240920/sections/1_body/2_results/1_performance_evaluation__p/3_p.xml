<p>Furthermore, the MSS method performs significantly better than the other competing methods in estimating the true (and unobserved) prevalence of infection. This suggests that the state updating procedure utilized by MSS method is more effective than the state updating methods employed by PF and EnKF. It is worth noting that the high IRE for infection prevalence at the beginning and the end of epidemics is the result of the small number of infectious individuals during these phases. While this impacts the performance of all methods (including MSS), the effect is small for MSS as the state updating procedure leads to more reliable state estimates. Also, since the estimation of the effective
