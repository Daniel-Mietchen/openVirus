<p>We note that the performance of I.Poi (in terms of estimating

 </sub>) deteriorates as more observations accumulate (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005257.s002">S8B –S8C</xref> Figs. A potential explanation of this observation is that I.Poi uses the mean of 1000 stochastic simulations which is likely to be close to the deterministic solution. If the observed stochastic trajectory peaks early or late, each additional observation will deviate from the expected behavior (for the true parameter) and, therefore, the precision worsens.
