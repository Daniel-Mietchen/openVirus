<p>The performance of each method tested does not change markedly between scenarios which differ by host population size (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005257.s002">S8B–S8E</xref> Figs). Even though the trajectories appear less stochastic when larger host populations are considered, because all scenarios assume a small number of infective persons in the early phase, there remains substantial stochasticity during the period of initial take-off which influences the timing of the epidemic peak.
