 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005257.g005">Fig 5A–5C</xref> shows the results of testing the hypothesis that the MSS method outperforms all benchmark methods at 0.05 significance level at different epidemic times. This figure suggests that, in the majority of cases, the MSS method demonstrates either statistically superior or similar performance to the benchmark methods (represented by Green, Blue and Black colors). We note that even for the small number of situations in which MSS is statistically dominated by another benchmark method, the absolute difference in mIRE (as shown in
