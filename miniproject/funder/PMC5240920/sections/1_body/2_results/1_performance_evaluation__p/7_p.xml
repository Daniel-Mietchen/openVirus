<p>In the analyses presented so far, we assumed that the model structure is correct and that the calibration target (i.e. weekly number of diagnoses) can be accurately measured. To test the robustness of the results to imperfect calibration targets, we allowed for accumulating observations to be disturbed by an error term that follows a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 100. In this sensitivity analysis, the MSS method demonstrated the ability to cope with noisy data and sustain its performance (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005257.s001">S1 Text</xref> subsection 2 “Equations of the SEITR model”) but an SITR model is chosen for parameter estimation and prediction. This allowed us to test to what extent model misspecification could erode the performance of these approaches, which is important because the true epidemic process may not be known. This sensitivity analysis revealed that each of the calibration methods considered here maintained their performance under this particular model misspecification scenario with respect to most performance criteria, but had problems with estimates for

Since the misspecified model used for calibration does not include the additional Exposed compartment, the size of Susceptible compartment is overestimated by all calibration methods, which leads to inaccurate
