<p>In all 9 scenarios (defined by epidemic severity and population size) and 5 epidemic times (8 and 4 weeks to peak, at the peak, and 4 and 8 weeks after the peak), the MSS method demonstrates superior or similar performance against the competing benchmark methods. As for the estimation targets, benchmark methods show higher integrated relative errors during both early and late phases of epidemics. This behavior occurs due to the small number of infectious individuals (which results in a low number of diagnoses) during these epidemic phases. The state updating procedure employed by the MSS method plays a central role in sustaining the performance of MSS method under these conditions.</p>
