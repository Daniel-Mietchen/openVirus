 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005257.g006">Fig 6Aâ€“6C</xref> displays the results of testing the hypothesis that the MSS method outperforms all benchmark methods at 0.05 significance level at different epidemic times. This figure suggest that in the majority of cases the MSS method demonstrates statistically superior than or similar performance to the benchmark methods (represented by Green, Blue and Black colors). We note that even for case where MSS is statistically dominated by another benchmark method, the absolute difference in mIRE (as shown in
