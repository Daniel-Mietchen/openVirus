<p>Our numerical analysis suggests that the combination of noisy observations and model mis-specification will erode the performance of all calibration methods considered here

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005257.s009">S8</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005257.s010">S9</xref> Figs which show similar results fort he noise-free and noisy scenarios). This finding highlights the importance of selecting a model structure that adequately reflects the complexity of the disease.
