<p>The performance of PF and EnKF can be affected by the choice of observational variance (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005257.e044">Eq 13</xref>). The observation variance we selected for our analyses is adapted from [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which is a heuristic choice but has proved reliable in previous studies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We ran a sensitivity analysis on this parameter by dropping the absolute variance term from 10,000 to 1, and observed no major change in the performance of PF and EnKF methods in populations of various size. This suggests that the absolute term in the observational variance is not the determining factor in the relative performance of EnKF, PF and MSS.
