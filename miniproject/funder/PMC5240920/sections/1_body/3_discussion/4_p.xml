<p>A main advantage of the MSS technique is that the LNA needs only to be employed on the relatively short time intervals between recordings and not over the whole course of the epidemics. This is possible by employing the state estimation procedure to initialize the LNA on the succeeding interval. Additionally, the simulation studies presented here and previous work in a Systems Biology context [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] show that LNA can yield accurate estimates for parameters for stochastic systems. Nevertheless, if required, LNA accuracy can be improved by using higher order terms for correction [
