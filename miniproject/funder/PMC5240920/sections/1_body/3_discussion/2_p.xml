<p>The superior performance of MSS can be attributed to the use of LNA to capture the correlations between epidemic compartments throughout the simulated outbreak, and to the state updating procedure employed by MSS. While it would be in principal possible to incorporate an LNA approximation into a PF framework, we used the version of PF that is commonly used [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for the purpose of this comparison study. The main difference between EnKF and MSS is that EnKF does not use an approximation for the likelihood for an observation but rather updates states and parameters based on correlation between compartments and data using multiple parameter vectors. The MSS state updating procedure allows the calculation of these correlations using a single parameter vector. This results in a more accurate description of correlations between compartments as epidemic data are accumulating.
