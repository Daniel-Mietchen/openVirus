<p>We note that the performance of filtering methods can be impaired by filter degeneracy, a phenomenon where particles or members of an ensemble or filter have a very small likelihood value that varies over orders of magnitude even for the best members/particles. Our implementation of PF and EnKF is consistent with the original implementation by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and both methods are equipped with suitable mechanisms to handle filter degeneracy. Despite the fact that the MSS approach proposed here does not include such a mechanism to address filter degeneracy, MSS demonstrated very competitive performance in these simulated epidemic scenarios. We believe that speaks to the promise of MSS and potential extensions of this methodology.
