<p>We note four main limitations of our study. First, while including the necessary complexity to offer a suitable platform for our analyses, the epidemic model used to evaluate the comparative performance of calibration methods is highly simplified. Investigating the impact of model complexity level on the performance of calibration methods would be of immediate interest for future research. Second, our evaluation are based on “simulated” epidemic trajectories. While only simulated scenarios can allow us to calculate the relative errors in estimating the unknown parameters (e.g.

 <sub>0</sub>, mean duration of infectiousness), further investigation using real-world data is required to comprehensively evaluate the performance of MSS along with other existing calibration methods.
