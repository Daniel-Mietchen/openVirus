<p>Third, in our analyses, we used an SITR model of influenza epidemics that allows for a delay between the time of infection and time of diagnosis. Our model, however, does not account for the fact that in reality only a portion of influenza cases will be reported as not all infected individuals will have severe enough symptoms to seek care. If the fraction of cases that remains undetected is known and fixed, this is easily handled in the model with the addition of compartments and parameters to reflect the observation process, However, the degree of underreporting is often unknown and may change over the course of an epidemic. Such underreporting impacts the performance of all available calibration methods, and the development of novel approaches that can better account for this phenomenon is an important direction for future research.</p>
