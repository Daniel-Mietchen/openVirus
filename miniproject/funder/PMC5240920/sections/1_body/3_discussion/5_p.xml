<p>The computationally challenging part of the MSS is the interval-wise evaluation of the LNA which consists of

 </sub> + 1)/2 ODEs where 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> stands for the number of compartments. PF and EnKF, on the other hand, only require the solution of the ODE system that consists of 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> equations. The I.Poi. requires the execution of stochastic simulations for each parameter and is the most cost intensive of all four alternatives tested. MSS can be easily carried out without the use of a computing cluster: calibration and prediction for one time-series at the peak of the epidemic takes roughly 5 minutes on an Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630 v3 with 16GM RAM, see the
