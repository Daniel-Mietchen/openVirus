<p>The LNA has been successfully applied to describe intrinsic stochastic fluctuations in various contexts [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The LNA provides accurate approximation for large populations or when the fluctuations are small compared to the steady state of the system. As also suggested by the results presented here, LNA can perform well even when the system is not in steady state as long as the intervals over which the LNA projections are made are sufficiently small (here, observations occurred at weekly time steps for epidemics that lasted up to 100 weeks).
