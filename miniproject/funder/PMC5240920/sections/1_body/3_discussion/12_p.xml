<p>And finally, our simulation study assumed that epidemic parameters, such as contact rate, remain constant through the outbreak. In reality, however, some epidemic parameters may vary over time due to changes in population behavior and interactions. We also note that for simplicity, our analysis used only one type of real-time observations (i.e. weekly diagnoses), but the methods presented here can be extended for scenarios where multiple sources of real-time data (e.g. disease-related hospitalizations and deaths) are available.</p>
