<p>Our results suggest that the MSS calibration method can address several major challenges inherent in parameter estimation and model-based prediction during outbreaks, when the true epidemic state can be only partially observed and the behavior of disease spread is most stochastic. Using a comprehensive set of simulation studies, we compare the performance of our method to several existing state-of-the-art calibration methods including a particle filter (PF) [
