<p>In this paper, we describe an alternative method for calibrating a general class of stochastic compartmental models using the types of data that would be available during the early period of epidemic spread. Unlike deterministic models, stochastic models capture chance events, a feature that proves essential for the accuracy of model-based parameter estimation and prediction during pathogen emergence.</p>
