<p>Our calibration method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), utilizes a linear noise approximation (LNA) approach and a state-updating procedure to approximate the likelihood of observations while explicitly accounting for the interdependency between subsequent epidemic observations. Using simulation experiments, we compare the performance of MSS with several competing approaches in terms of accuracy in estimating parameters, predicting future behaviors, and inferring the current epidemic state. We test the sensitivity of the performance of these approaches to observational noise and model misspecification.</p>
