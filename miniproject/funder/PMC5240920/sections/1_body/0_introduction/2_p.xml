<p>Estimating epidemic parameters is challenging during this initial period of disease emergence because the dynamics are stochastic and the processes governing disease spread are complex and usually only partially observable. Public health decision makers, therefore, require tools to make inference about the true state of the epidemic and the values of fundamental epidemic parameters using observations that can only imperfectly represent the true epidemic state (e.g. reported disease-related illnesses serve as an imperfect measure of incident cases).</p>
