<p>There has been substantial recent progress in the development of methods to infer epidemic parameters from partial epidemic observations [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, infection network models are commonly used when symptom onset date for each reported case is available [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005257.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In these models, disease spread is described as a directed network in which the nodes represent cases and the directed edges between nodes represent transmission links. In the absence of the type of detailed individual-level data required by infection network methods, compartmental transmission dynamic models have been used for parameter estimation and for projecting epidemic trajectory. These models divide the population into disjoint subgroups (e.g. susceptible, infectious, and recovered) and transitions between the epidemic states are described using ordinary differential equations (for deterministic models) [
