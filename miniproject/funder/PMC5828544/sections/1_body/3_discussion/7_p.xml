<p id="p0180">In our study, the level of nAb necessary to protect against detectable circulating viral RNA may be only addressed by evaluating the ZKA190 mAb positive control group where 3 of the 5 mice exhibited no detectable viral RNA in the serum. Levels of nAb achieved in these mice 12 h after passive transfer ranged from approximately 2000 to 11,000. The specific 3 mice with no detectable viral RNA on day 4 had nAb levels 12 h after passive transfer of 2379, 3202, and 11,347 while the two mice with detectable viral RNA had nAb levels of 1989 and 5049. Therefore, nAb levels above approximately 2000 were required to provide sterilizing immunity for 2 of the 3 mice with the outlier being a nAb titer of 5049 that was not sufficient to prevent the detection of viral RNA. Other groups have provided evidence that sterilizing immunity can be achieved in the mouse model. Richner et al., using a modified mRNA vaccine expressing prM-E, protected AG129, C57Bl/6, and Balb/c mice against death (

 <sub>50</sub> nAb titer of approximately 10,000 was sufficient to prevent viremia and tissue dissemination. Sumathy et al., using inactivated ZIKV adsorbed to alum, immunized rabbits and passively transferred the immune sera to Balb/c mice which were subsequently challenged with the African MR766 ZIKV strain. No viremia was detected in these mice when circulating levels of nAb were as low as approximately 100 PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> (
