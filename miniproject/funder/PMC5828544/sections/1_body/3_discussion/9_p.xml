<p id="p0190">In summary, we evaluated the protective capacity of passively transferred VLP-induced immune sera to AG129 mice. The immune sera were able to protect mice against weight-loss, morbidity, and mortality. Although circulating viral RNA levels following ZIKV challenge was reduced by at least 3-logs vs. control mice, a reduction that would likely prevent infection of mosquitos, sterilizing immunity was not achieved. Additional studies evaluating this ZIKV VLP vaccine candidate's capacity to protect against ZIKV challenge in mouse and NHP models will be instructive. In our specific case, VLP immunization induced high ZIKV-specific nAb titers in the range of 2849 (VLP-induced sera) to 3837 (VLP + alum-induced sera). It will be of interest to evaluate the level of ZIKV-specific nAb that is maintained over an extended period of time to define the duration of VLP vaccine-induced nAb immune response. We currently have an ongoing VLP active immunization study whereby the AG129 mice were immunized with a dose titration of the VLP vaccine formulated with alum. It will be of importance to determine to what extent mice will be protected against viral challenge when higher ZIKV-specific nAbs are achieved.</p>
