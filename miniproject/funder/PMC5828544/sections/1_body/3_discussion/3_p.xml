<p id="p0160">The ZIKV VLP may have unexpected structural changes to the surface of the particle due to either its chimeric composition and/or production of two distinct particle sizes. We have not done extensive epitope mapping by antibody recognition of our VLP vs. the native virus. In preliminary studies, we do know that our VLP is recognized by the highly characterized antibody, ZIKV-117 (
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Sapparapu et al., 2016</xref>). Epitope mapping studies by this group revealed that ZIKV-117 antibody recognizes a unique quaternary epitope on the E protein dimer-dimer interface. Additional epitope mapping studies will be required to further understand any structural changes our ZIKV VLP may present vs. the native virus.
