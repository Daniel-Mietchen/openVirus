<p id="p0170">Although passive transfer of nAbs was protective in adult mice, this level of protection did not provide sterilizing immunity. As determined on Day 2 post-infection, viral RNA levels in serum for the VLP-induced and VLP + alum-induced immune sera (neat) groups were below the assay's threshold of detection with the exception of one mouse, in the VLP + alum group, which had a low level of detectable viral RNA. However, by Day 4, VLP and VLP + alum-induced immune sera groups registered viral RNA levels of 3262 and 1481 GE/mL, respectively. Whether this extent of viral RNA reduction in human subjects would be sufficient to protect a developing fetus is unknown, but we assume even low levels of viral RNA may be a potential risk. Further, the fact that nAb titers increased from the 12-hour to the 18-day time point suggests that virus replication likely induced de novo nAb production. The circulating nAb titer 12-hour post-transfer for the positive control ZKA190 mAb group diminished by day 18 (3870 to 293), suggesting that ZIKV replication was sufficiently reduced to prevent de novo antibody production and that the drop of nAb titer was likely due to tissue binding and the half-life of the antibody in vivo. However, it should be noted that the ZKA190 monoclonal antibody group had two outliers regarding viral RNA levels on Day 4. Two out of 5 mice achieved detectable RNA levels of 240 and 2152 GE/mL potentially signifying low levels of viral replication in these mice.</p>
