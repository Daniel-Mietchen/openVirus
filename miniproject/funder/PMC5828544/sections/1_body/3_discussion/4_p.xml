<p id="p0165">Immune sera generated in CB6F1 mice following VLP immunization, were transferred to AG129 mice and, as expected, nAb titers of 2849 (VLP-induced sera) and 3837 (VLP + alum-induced sera) were diluted in the circulation of recipient AG129 mice to levels of 359 to 394, respectively. This level of circulating antibody was sufficient to prevent weight loss, morbidity, and mortality following ZIKV challenge relative to unimmunized controls. However, immune sera diluted 1:5 prior to transfer resulted in circulating nAb titers of only 80 and 120 and provided minimal protection. Only 2 out of 5 mice survived in each of the groups receiving 1:5 diluted sera, VLP and VLP + alum groups.</p>
