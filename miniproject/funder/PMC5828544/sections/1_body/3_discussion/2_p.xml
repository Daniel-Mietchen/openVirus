<p id="p0155">The objective of this study was to determine whether passive transfer of ZIKV-specific nAbs generated by ZIKV VLP immunization in CB6F1 mice could protect AG129 mice upon ZIKV infection. ZIKV VLP particles were generated by transient PEI chemical transfection of HEK293 cells using an expression plasmid encoding ZIKV structural genes prM and E. VLPs in the cell supernatant harvest were processed by column chromatography resulting in highly purified VLP particles. Two particle sizes of 35 nm and 55 nm were evident by EM analysis. Similar particle sizes were observed for the flavivirus Tick-Borne Encephalitis (

Allison and colleagues identified two major size particle classes, separated on sucrose gradients, stained by uranyl formate, and analyzed by EM that appeared to be distinct assembly products of 30 nm and 55 nm. The smaller particle corresponded in size to the mature wild-type mature subviral particles where the E proteins are arranged in a regular

In contrast, Boigard et al. generated a more uniform Zika VLP particle size distribution of 50 nm to 65 nm in diameter (mean 60 nm) when observed in electron micrographs (

A possible reason for this consistent size distribution of VLPs may be due to the addition of the capsid component to the structural gene cassette, i.e., CprME. They were unable to detect the capsid protein in the VLP transfected lysates using an anti-C antibody but assumed that due to detection of E and prM proteins that the capsid was cleaved.
