<p id="p0025">As the geographic range of ZIKV increased, so did appreciation that ZIKV could cause serious human disease (

 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Oehler et al., 2014</xref>). Concern was also amplified with the observation of an approximate 20-fold increase in incidence of congenital microcephaly in the 2015 outbreak in Brazil (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Vogel, 2016</xref>). Evidence that ZIKV infection is associated with fetal microcephaly is, in part, based on the observation that microcephaly coincided temporally with the ZIKV outbreak (offset by ~ 6 months) and subsequently, the detection of ZIKV in microcephalic fetal brain tissues (
