<p id="p0035">The envelope (E) protein of flaviviruses is involved in binding cellular receptors, enabling viral entry, and is the major target for nAbs (
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Modis et al., 2003</xref>). Isolation of monoclonal antibodies from ZIKV-infected donors has shown that the majority of the humoral immune response is directed to the E protein, with the most potent nAbs directed against the DIII lateral ridge and complex quaternary epitopes including more than one E domain, such as the DII dimer interface (

For these reasons, and because of the inherent safety of VLP vaccines, we have chosen a VLP vaccine development approach that efficiently generates antibodies against the ZIKV E protein. As shown here, neutralizing antibodies induced by this VLP vaccine, upon transfer to AG129 mice, provided significantly protection against subsequent ZIKV challenge.
