<p id="p0030">Little is known about the nature and duration of protective immunity following natural ZIKV infection. To address this issue, the search for natural correlates of protection (CoP) relies on in vitro studies of post-infection immune responses and animal models of ZIKV infection. For several licensed vaccines, correlates of human protection rely on accepted levels of antibody titers, e.g., measles, influenza, pneumococcal and Hepatitis A (

In contrast, clinical field trials to demonstrate vaccine efficacy are challenging to design and execute due to the fact that epidemics are difficult to predict, often sporadic, leading to a decline of ZIKV incidence in a given population before the clinical trial sites are functional.
