<p id="p0020">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus closely related to human pathogens such as yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and dengue viruses (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Pierson and Diamond, 2012</xref>). ZIKV was initially discovered in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 in a sentinel Rhesus monkey that developed viremia (

 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Hayes, 2009</xref>). ZIKV, apparently uniquely among arboviruses, is also transmitted by sexual activity. High viral loads have been detected in semen from infected patients (

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Hills et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Musso et al., 2015</xref>), and sexual transmission from infected men and women to their partners has been reported (
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hastings and Fikrig, 2017</xref>). It has been reported in mice that ZIKV infection damages the testis and leads to male infertility (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Govero et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Because of the usual benign course of disease and high percentage of subclinical infections, ZIKV was initially discounted as a significant human pathogen until a major outbreak occurred in 2007 on Yap Island, Micronesia (

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 2008</xref>), followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia from 2013 to 2014 (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016</xref>), and subsequent spread into many countries throughout the Western Hemisphere (

 <xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). Brazil reported an estimated 500,000 to 1,500,000 human cases of ZIKV infection in 2015 (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Bogoch et al., 2016</xref>) and it is likely that Zika will ultimately spread throughout most areas that have significant populations of vector mosquitos.
