 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>c, the mice in the VLP-induced immune sera, VLP + alum-induced immune sera, and ZKA190 mAb groups were significantly protected against mortality relative to the Alum (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0015) and Naïve control (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0021) groups. All mice in the Alum only and Naïve groups succumbed to infection by Day 16. Partial protection was afforded in the VLP (1:5 diluted sera transfer) group where only 2 of 5 mice survived. Similarly, only 2 mice survived in the VLP + alum (1:5 diluted sera transfer) group.
