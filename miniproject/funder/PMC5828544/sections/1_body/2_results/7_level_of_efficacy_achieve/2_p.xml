<p id="p0135">Protection against ZIKV challenge afforded by passively transferring immune sera to AG129 mice is shown in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. AG129 mice that received undiluted sera from VLP immunized mice or VLP + alum immunized mice retained approximately 100% of their body weight over the course of the 18-day study (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>a). This observation was also the case when the positive control ZKA190 mAb was transferred. However, mice that received VLP and VLP + alum-induced sera diluted 1:5 prior to transfer experienced precipitous weight loss beginning at approximately Day 11. Severe weight loss was also evident in the Alum and Naïve control groups starting approximately Day 10 following ZIKV challenge.
