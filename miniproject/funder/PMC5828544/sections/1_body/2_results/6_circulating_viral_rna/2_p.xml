<p id="p0125">To evaluate viral RNA in circulation, blood samples were collected on days 2 and 4 post-ZIKV challenge and analyzed by RT-qPCR (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a and b, respectively). Peak viral RNA in serum, measured in genome equivalents (GE)/mL, in the Alum and Naïve groups were reached on Day 2, attaining geomeans of 463,631 and 317,848, respectively. Compared to the Alum-only control group, a significant reduction in GE/mL (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001) was observed when VLP and VLP + alum-induced immune sera were transferred to AG129 mice prior to the ZIKV challenge. The VLP and VLP + alum groups had &lt; 100 GE/mL, a reduction of at least 3 logs relative to the Alum only group. Administration of 1:5 dilution of VLP-induced and VLP alum-induced immune sera also significantly reduced the GE/mL (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001), albeit to a lesser extent, with geomeans of 564 and 986, respectively. The positive control ZKA190 mAb, when passively transferred to AG129 mice, also significantly reduced GE/mL to below detectable limits (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001).
