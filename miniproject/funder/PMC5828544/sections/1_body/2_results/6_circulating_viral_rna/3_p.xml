<p id="p0130">By Day 4, the amount of viral RNA in serum increased for all test article groups, with GE/mL detected of 3262 (VLP); 70,501 (VLP 1:5); 1481 (VLP + alum); and 18,627 (VLP + alum 1:5), 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b. The relative GE levels in the Alum and Naïve groups dropped by Day 4 with geomeans of 35,830 and 19,328, respectively. In spite of the increase in the amount of viral RNA observed in the test article groups (neat sera), the GE levels still remained significantly lower vs. the Alum control group, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012 (VLP) and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 (VLP + alum). The transferred ZKA190 mAb was most protective, with 3 of 5 mice presenting GE levels below the detection limit on Day 4, with significantly lower GE levels vs. the Alum control group, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008. This is predictable due to the higher ZIKV-specific nAb titers measured at 12 hour post-transfer compared to VLP-induced and VLP + alum-induced immune sera. Interestingly, with regard to the ZKA190 mAb group, there were two individual mice that did attain detectable levels of viral RNA in the serum, 240 and 2152 GE/mL, potentially indicating viral replication and lack of sterile immunity. In support of viral replication in these mice is the observation that the nAb titers 18 days post virus challenge for these mice were 716 (240 GE/mL) and 943 (2152 GE/mL). In contrast, the three mice with no measurable viral RNA levels in serum at Day 4 had low level NT
 <sub>50</sub> titers of 146, 147, and 150 at the 18 day post challenge time point.
