<p id="p0100">The ZIKV VLP vaccine candidate is comprised of the prM and E structural proteins derived from the African MR766 strain but with the E ectodomain from the Brazilian SPH2015 strain (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). HEK293 cells were transfected with the ZIKV VLP expression plasmid complexed to PEI. Four days following transfection cell supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatant was subsequently purified using column chromatography and cell supernatants pre- and post-purification were evaluated by a SDS-PAGE Coomassie gel (panel b) and Western blot (panel c). As shown in the Coomassie gel (panel b, lane 1), are multiple staining protein bands that when transferred to a Western Blot (panel c, lane 1) a 55 kDa band was detected using an anti-E antibody. Following purification, a highly purified protein migrating at the appropriate size is detected in the coomassie gel (panel b, lane 2) and identity is confirmed in the Western Blot (panel c, lane 2). Positive control, full-length recombinant E protein running at approximately 50 kDa is evident in panels b and c, lane 3. The faster migration of the recombinant E protein, which was generated in insect cells, maybe due to a less complex glycosylation pattern. The particle was further characterized by negative staining using uranyl acetate and visualized by electron microscopy (panel d). The population of particles is predominantly composed of two different sizes, 35 nm and 55 nm. Four random areas of the EM grid were counted and approximately 80% of the VLPs were 35 nm in size.
