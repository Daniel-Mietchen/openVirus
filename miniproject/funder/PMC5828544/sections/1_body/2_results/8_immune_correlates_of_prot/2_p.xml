<p id="p0150">Immune CoP were evaluated based on the capacity of circulating nAb to protect against death and circulating viral RNA following ZIKV challenge in AG129 mice. Shown in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a is the distribution of the individual mice based on their level of circulating nAb titer at 12 hour post-infection vs. survival. There was a significant inverse relationship between level of circulating nAb and mortality (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001). Fifteen of eighteen mice that had a NT
 <sub>50</sub> antibody level of approximately 125 or higher survived, whereas all mice that had a NT
 <sub>50</sub> titer of &lt; 125 succumbed to infection. There was also a strong correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.79) between the level of circulating nAb titer measured at 12 hour post-transfer and level of circulating viral RNA 2 days post-challenge (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>b). The correlation was also conducted without the ZKA 190 mAb group to restrict analysis to polyclonal antibody responses. The correlation was determined to be somewhat higher (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.88).
