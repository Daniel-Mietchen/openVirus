<p id="p0110">Immune sera from ZIKV VLP-immunized CB6F1 mice were passively transferred to AG129 mice prior to challenge with 1000 FFU of ZIKV. Experimental groups and conditions are depicted in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The immune sera test articles were administered neat (undiluted) and diluted 1:5 in a volume of 250 μL. The control groups consisted of: 1) sera from CB6F1 mice immunized with Alum-only; 2) Naïve mice (no transfer of sera); 3); Untreated mice (no transfer of sera and no ZIKV challenge); and 4) Positive control (ZKA190 mAb) transfer.
