<p id="p0105">Immune sera obtained following one and two ZIKV VLP immunizations of CB6F1 mice indicated that the VLP candidate vaccine induced Zika viral particle neutralization in the 100 to 5000 NT
 <sub>50</sub> titer range depending on dose, number of VLP immunizations, and presence of aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel; alum) as adjuvant (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The use of alum to augment the nAb titer is most evident at the lower doses where alum appeared to cause dose-sparing. Following one immunization (Panel a) the 1 μg VLP dose adsorbed to alum increased the immune response by approximately 5-fold, 100 vs. 500 NT
 <sub>50</sub> geometric mean antibody titer (GMT). This is also evident following two VLP immunizations (Panel b) where the 1 μg VLP dose response was increased from 620 to 4200 GMT when the ZIKV VLPs were adsorbed to alum. The benefit of using alum is less evident at the higher antigen doses. It is interesting to note that there was no antigen dose response when the VLPs were adsorbed to alum. Following one immunization, the 5 μg VLP/alum dose was the most immunogenic (500 GMT) whereas following two VLP/alum immunizations, the 1 μg dose (4200 GMT) was the most immunogenic. Considering the extensive overlap of individual immune responses, there are no significant differences in immune responses generated using the 1, 5, and 25 μg doses when adsorbed to alum and a maximum response was achieved at the lowest immunogen dose tested. Alum provides a significant dose-sparing effect insofar as 1 μg on alum was as immunogenic as 25 μg of free VLP. The immune sera from individual mice, 25 μg VLP vaccine alone and adsorbed to alum groups, were pooled for transfer to AG129 mice and the NT
 <sub>50</sub> Titers were evaluated (Panel c). The titers were as expected approximately 3000 (VLP) and 4000 (VLP + alum).
