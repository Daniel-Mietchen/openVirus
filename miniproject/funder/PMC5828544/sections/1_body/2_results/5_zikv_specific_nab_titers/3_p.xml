<p id="p0120">At the 18-day time point (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, Panel b), the nAb titers were significantly increased vs. the 12-hour time point for each test article group, with GMTs achieved of 1699 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002), range 1414 to 2483 (VLP); 3160 (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001), range 3110 to 3210 (VLP 1:5); 1448 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.008), range 1079 to 2201 (VLP + alum); and 2509 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), range 2070 to 3040 (VLP + alum 1:5). It should be noted that only 2 out of the 5 mice that received 1:5 diluted immune sera survived ZIKV challenge. As expected, the Alum only and Naïve mice did not survive to day 18 following ZIKV challenge. No measurable antibody titers on day 18 were detected for the untreated control group. With regard to the ZKA190 mAb group, the day 18 nAb titers significantly dropped to a GMT of 293 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0353), with a range of 146 to 943 compared to the 12-hour time point, likely indicating the transient nature of the transferred mAb. However, it is not known if any de novo synthesis of nAb occurred due to viral replication and contributed to the NT
 <sub>50</sub> value observed at 18 days post virus challenge.
