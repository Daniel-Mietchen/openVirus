<p id="p0115">To evaluate the ZIKV-specific nAb titers achieved in the circulation and to help establish CoP, nAb titers were evaluated in individual mice during the 18-day study. For this purpose, a blood specimen was collected 12 h following antibody transfer as well as 18 days post-challenge in surviving mice. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> depicts the titers measured in the mice following immune sera transfer and ZIKV challenge. It should be noted that prior to passive antibody transfer, the nAb titers measured for pooled immune sera were 2849 (ZIKV VLP-induced) and 3837 (ZIKV VLP + alum-induced). As shown in (Panel a), 12 h after the transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with VLP without alum, the GMT measured was 359 with a range of 293 to 484 (VLP-induced immune sera). The 1:5 diluted VLP sera attained a significantly lower GMT of 80 with a range of 66 to 96. Comparable nAbs titers were reached when the immune sera transferred were generated in mice immunized with ZIKV VLP formulated with alum adjuvant; a GMT of 394 with a range of 258 to 542 (neat) and a significantly lower GMT of 120 with a range of 93 to 141 (1:5 diluted VLP + alum sera). The positive control, ZKA190 mAb attained a GMT of 3870 with a range of 1989 to 11,347. No measurable antibody titers at the 12-hour time point were detected for the Alum, Naïve and Untreated control groups of mice.
