<p id="p0085">As a surrogate measurement for viremia, ZIKV RNA copy levels in serum were determined by RT-qPCR from blood samples collected 2 and 4 days post-ZIKV challenge. ZIKV RNA was extracted from serum samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, MD) and RNA levels were determined by TaqMan one-step RT-qPCR using a standard curve with 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV Nica 2–16 RNA. Primer sets used for this assay were modified from Lanciotti et al. (
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 2008</xref>) as follows: ZIKV_1086_Fwd, 5′-CCGCTGCCCAACACAAG-3′, ZIKV_1162c_Rev, 5′-CCACTAACGTTCTTTTGCAGACAT-3′; Probe ZIKV_1107-FAM_UG&amp;Nica 5′-AGCCTACCTTGACAAGCAATCAGACACTCAA-3′. Viral loads in RT-qPCR assays are expressed on a log10 scale as viral RNA genome equivalents per mL after comparison with a standard curve produced using serial 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA. The detection limit of the qRT-PCR assay was determined by assaying serial dilutions of purified ZIKV RNA in the range of 10
 <sup>8–10</sup> genome equivalents/mL. A value of 100 GE/mL was established as the limit of the detection of the assay as this dilution consistently resulted in detectable PCR amplification above background (no template control) levels.
