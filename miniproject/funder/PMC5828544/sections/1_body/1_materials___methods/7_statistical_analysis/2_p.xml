 <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare differences between experimental groups for resulting nAb titers and viral RNA levels. The Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test was used to compare nAb titer differences between protected and non-protected mice. Mantel-Cox survival curves were analyzed by the log rank test. Results were considered statistically significant if the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value was &lt;Â 0.05. For correlation, the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup>2</sup>) was determined using linear regression analysis. All statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism version 7 software (San Diego, CA).
