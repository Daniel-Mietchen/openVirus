<p id="p0075">Five-to-seven week old AG129 mice on the 129/Sv background and deficient in interferon (IFN)-α/β and IFN-γ receptors, were used for this study and were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in an animal facility of the University of California, Berkeley. Pooled mouse immune sera generated by ZIKV VLP immunization in CB6F1 mice were passively transferred into groups of 5 AG129 mice at 250 μL per mouse using the intravenous (IV) route of administration.</p>
