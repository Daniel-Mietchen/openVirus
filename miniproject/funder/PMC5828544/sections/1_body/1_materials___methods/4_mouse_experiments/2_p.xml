<p id="p0070">Immune sera for passive transfer studies were generated by immunizing CB6F1 mice via the intramuscular (IM) route on days 0 and 32 using a dose of 1, 5, and 25 μg of ZIKV VLP vaccine formulated with or without 100 μg alum (Alhydrogel) adjuvant. For the IM immunization, 100 μL of vaccine was injected into the hind limbs (bilateral quadriceps) at 50 μL per hind limb using a 1 mL tuberculin syringe and 27 gauge needle. On day 68 following the booster ZIKV VLP immunization, 200 μL of blood was collected from the orbital sinus plexus using non-heparinized Natelson tubes and dispensed into serum separation tubes for serum collection. The pooled mouse immune sera were tested for nAb activity against Zika Reporter Virus Particles (RVPs) expressing luciferase (Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA) whereby nAb titers of approximately 3000 to 4000 were measured. The CB6F1 animal procedures were performed at Absorption Systems in San Diego, CA. These facilities are accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and carry appropriate US government assurances (NIH Assurance A4282-01, USDA 93-R-0444). Absorption Systems conducts an IACUC review for all proposed animal studies and approved the mouse study. Mice were allowed to acclimate to the environment for 3 days prior to initiation of the study. The CB6F1 mouse experiments comply with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978).</p>
