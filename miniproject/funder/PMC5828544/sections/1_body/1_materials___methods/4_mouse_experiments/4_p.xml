<p id="p0080">Within 1 h post-transfer of immune sera, mice were challenged with 1000 focus-forming units (FFU) of ZIKV strain Nica 2-16 in 50 μL of PBS by subcutaneous (SC) injection in the left hind foot pad. Control animals included naïve (ZIKV challenge only), untreated, and mice treated with ZKA190 human mAb (1 mg/kg) previously shown to be protective against ZIKV challenge (
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Blood specimens were collected at 12-hour, 2-day, and 4-day time-points, post-infection, via the facial (submandibular) vein and allowed to clot at room temperature prior to collection of sera by centrifugation. Terminal bleeds on surviving animals were performed at 18 days post-challenge. Following virus challenge, mouse weight, morbidity, and mortality were monitored daily. A 1-to-5 morbidity scale was adapted from (
 <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Orozco et al., 2012</xref>): 1) Healthy; 2) Displaying mild signs of lethargy, some fur ruffling, and no hunched posture; 3) Fur ruffling, mild signs of lethargy, early signs of hind leg paralysis possible; 4) Fur ruffling, increased lethargy and limited mobility, and signs of paralysis common; and 5) Moribund, minimal mobility consistent with inability to reach food or water, neurological signs evident (paralysis/seizures). Mice were euthanized if weight loss was equal to or &gt; 20% of their original weight and/or if they scored “5” on the morbidity scale. All animal experiments comply with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1978) and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Berkeley.
