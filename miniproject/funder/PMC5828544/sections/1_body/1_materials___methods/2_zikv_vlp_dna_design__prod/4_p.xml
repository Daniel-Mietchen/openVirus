<p id="p0050">The ZIKV VLPs were purified using a two-column chromatography process. ZIKV VLPs from the initial tangential flow filtration process were loaded onto single-step, tandem chromatography columns comprised of mix-mode chromatography resin, Capto Core 700 (GE, PA), and a Sartobind salt-tolerant interaction chromatography resin (STIC-PA). This process used both columns in a negative capture mode by using 25 mM Tris and 100 mM Sodium Citrate at pH 8.3. Chromatography experiments were performed using AKTA Start, operated with the UNICORN software (GE Healthcare, PA).</p>
