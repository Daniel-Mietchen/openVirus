<p id="p0040">The ZIKV cassette used to generate the VLP consisted of: 1) the human IL2 signal sequence (SS) (MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNS); 2) the prM sequence contains 93 amino acids (aa), starting with AEI and ending with AYS from the African MR766 strain (accession #KU955594); 3) the E ectodomain from the Brazilian SPH2015 strain (accession #KU321639) contains 405 aa, starting with IRC and ending with SGS; and 4) the stem-anchor from the African MR766 strain (accession #KU955594) contains 99 aa starting with TIG and ending with VSA. This construct was designed based on an assumption that the antibody response should be directed towards the more recent Brazilian E ectodomain. The other consideration for vaccine design was VLP expression level. We evaluated African MR766, Brazilian SPH2015, and the chimeric construct and found that the chimeric DNA construct, upon transfection of HEK293 cells, generated the highest levels of VLP expression (data not shown). The cassette containing the structural genes was inserted downstream from a human CMV IE enhancer/promoter in the CMV/R plasmid described by 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Akahata et al. (2010)</xref>. This plasmid was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, and the ZIKV VLPs were concentrated and purified from media supernatant for C57Bl/6 x Balb/c (CB6F1) mouse immunogenicity studies.
