<p id="p0060">ZIKV VLP morphology was analyzed by negative stained electron microscopy at The Scripps Research Institute Microscopy Core Facility (La Jolla, CA). Briefly, purified ZIKV VLPs were absorbed on to the glow-discharged carbon-coated 200Â mesh copper grid. The grid was washed and stained with 1% uranyl acetate and visualized by a Philips CM100 Transmission Electron Microscope with Soft Imaging Systems MegaView III CCD camera.</p>
