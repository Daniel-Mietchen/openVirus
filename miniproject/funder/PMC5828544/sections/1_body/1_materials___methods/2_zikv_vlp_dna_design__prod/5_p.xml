<p id="p0055">Harvest supernatant containing VLPs or column purified VLPs were resolved by NuPAGE 4â€“12% Bis-Tris precast protein gels (Invitrogen, CA) and stained with InstantBlue Coomassie stain reagent (Expedeon) or transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen, CA). The nitrocellulose membrane with transferred protein was blocked with 5% milk (Labscientific, Inc., NJ) in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody (MyBioSource, CA) to recombinant (generated in insect cells) E protein (MyBiosource) at 1:1000 dilution. The membrane was washed three times with PBS-T and probed with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:10,000 dilution. The western image was developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate kit SuperSignal West Femto (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p>
