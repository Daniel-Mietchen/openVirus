<p id="p0045">Briefly, HEK293 cells in serum-free suspension culture were transfected with 25 mg/L of DNA in a 1:2 ratio (by weight) of plasmid to polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences, PA). At 96 hour post-transfection, cell supernatant was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×
 <italic> g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature, then pooled and filtered through a Sartopore 2 XL 0.8 μm/0.2 μm filter (Sartorius, Germany) to produce a clarified harvest. The clarified harvest was concentrated and diafiltered into load buffer (25 mM Tris and 100 mM Sodium Citrate at pH 8.3) using a 500 kDa hollow fiber (Spectrum Labs, CA) prior to column chromatography.
