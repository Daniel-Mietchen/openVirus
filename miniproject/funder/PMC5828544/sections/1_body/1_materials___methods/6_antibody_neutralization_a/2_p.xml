<p id="p0090">ZIKV-specific nAb titers in mouse serum samples were determined using a Zika RVP neutralization assay with methodology similar to that previously described for dengue RVPs (
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Mattia et al., 2011</xref>). The assay is based on the capacity of Zika RVPs (Integral Molecular, Philadelphia, PA) to infect host Vero cells and express 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. The RVPs incorporate prME structural proteins of the Brazilian SPH2015 strain. Reductions in luciferase activity in the presence of serially diluted immune serum indicate nAb activity. A ZIKV RVP titration was performed to determine the dynamic range of luminescence detected from Vero infected cells. A maximum RLU of approximately 40,000 was achieved and assay background was ~ 130 RLU as measured in wells containing cells alone without virus infection. A dilution of virus in the upper end of the linear portion of the titration curve corresponding to a signal of ~ 30,000 was selected for performing the neutralization assays. This dose of virus and dynamic range were determined to be enough to permit the evaluation of the reduction of luminescence following neutralization. Since the starting dilution of test serum is 1:10 and antibody titers below this dilution cannot be quantified, the 1:10 titer is considered the limit of detection of the assay. To assess circulating ZIKV-specific nAb titers, blood samples were collected at 12 h after transfer of immune sera and viral challenge, and from surviving animals, at 18 days after challenge. The Zika RVP neutralization assay was performed on serum from individual mice using 96-well plates. All test sera were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 35 min prior to the assay. Serial 3-fold dilutions of serum (1:5 starting dilution) were prepared in assay medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0) and incubated with an equal volume of Zika RVPs previously determined to yield sufficiently high luciferase activity. Each sample was run in triplicate in a single experiment. Assays were repeated only if positive serum and virus only control values were out of range based on historical data. Final assay dilutions ranged from 1:10 to 1:590,490. Following a 1-hour incubation at 37 °C, Vero cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well) were added to the RVP-serum mixture. Assay plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI), and plates were read on a Spectramax M3 plate luminometer (Molecular Devices, CA). NT
 <sub>50</sub> nAb titers were determined using non-linear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism 7, defined as the reciprocal of the dilution that neutralizes 50% of Zika RVP infection.
