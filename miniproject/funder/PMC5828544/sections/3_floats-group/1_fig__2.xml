  <p>ZIKV nAb titers. Symbols depict NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers in individual mice. (a) ZIKV neutralizing NT
   <sub>50</sub> antibody titers are shown 4 weeks following prime immunization of CB6F1 mice. (b) NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers 2 weeks following boost immunization. Red bars indicate geometric means. (c) NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers in pooled serum used for passive transfer into AG129 mice. Serum was pooled from individual mice approximately 68 days following boost immunization. Immune sera were evaluated for capacity to neutralize Zika luciferase reporter particles. Each data point is the result of a single experiment and in which assay samples were run in triplicate. The * symbol indicates a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.05, ** a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.01, and *** a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.001 as determined using the Student's 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
