  <p>Design, production, purification, and characterization of ZIKV VLP vaccine candidate. (a) Schematic of ZIKV genome and plasmid DNA encoding ZIKV structural genes: 1) prM derived from the MR766 African strain (light blue); 2) E ectodomain derived from the SPH2015 Brazilian strain (dark blue), and 3) E stem-anchor from MR766 (light blue). (b) SDS PAGE Coomassie gel, lane 1 cell harvest supernatant, lane 2 purified VLP, and lane 3 full-length recombinant E protein generated in insect cells, approximately 50 kDa. (c) Western blot, lane 1 cell harvest supernatant, lane 2 purified VLP, and lane 3 full-length recombinant E protein generated in insect cells, approximately 50 kDa. (d) Purified ZIKV VLPs were subjected to negative staining by uranyl acetate and visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two predominant particle sizes, 35 nm and 55 nm, are indicated by arrows.</p>
