  <p>Correlates of protection. Circulating NT
   <sub>50</sub> antibody titers following antibody transfer in protected and not protected mice are shown in (a). The geomean is indicated by a horizontal bar. The dotted line represents a NT
   <sub>50</sub> titer of 125. The *** symbol indicates a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;Â 0.001 as determined using the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. Panel (b) shows the correlation relationship between NT
   <sub>50</sub> antibody titer and circulating viral RNA at 2 post-infection. In 
   <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a and b, the protected mice are indicated by red circles and the mice succumbing to infection are indicated by black circles. The coefficient of determination (R
   <sup>2</sup>) was determined using linear regression analysis.
