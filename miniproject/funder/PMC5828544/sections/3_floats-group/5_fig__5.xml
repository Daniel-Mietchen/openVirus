  <p>Body weight, morbidity, and mortality following ZIKV challenge. Body weight, morbidity, and mortality were monitored each day for the duration of the study. For each study group, average daily percent body weights are shown in (a), morbidity scores based on severity of disease shown in (b), and mortality measured as percent survival in (c). Error bars in panels (a) and (b) depict standard error of the mean (SEM). The *** symbol indicates a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.0001 using the Mann-Whitney test in panel (a) where VLP, VLP + alum, Untreated, and ZKA190 mAb is compared to VLP + alum 1:5 (***) and VLP 1:5, Alum only, and Naïve (***). The ** symbol indicates a 
   <italic>p</italic> value of &lt; 0.01 as determined using the Mantel-Cox log rank test in panel (c) where VLP, VLP + alum, Untreated, and ZKA190 mAb is compared to Alum only and Naïve (**).
