 <p>Zika virus, transmitted by mosquito to humans, poses a serious health threat due to its association with birth defects in developing fetuses and neurological disorders in adults. We sought to develop a Zika vaccine based on virus-like particles (VLPs), which are structurally the same as the parent virus but don't contain genetic material. The Zika VLP vaccine, when administered to mice, induced antibodies. These antibodies, when transferred to a mouse susceptible to Zika virus infection, protected the animals against Zika virus challenge and death. Our results will support continued development of the Zika VLP vaccine and testing in human subjects.</p>
