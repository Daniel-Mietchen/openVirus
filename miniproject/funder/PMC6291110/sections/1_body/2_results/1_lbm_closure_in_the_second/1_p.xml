 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208884.g001">Fig 1</xref>, each action was colored differently, according to the magnitude of impact: the bigger the impact, the darker the color. For example, Jiangsu province commenced a LBM closure policy from December 2013, while the neighboring Anhui province and Shanghai city took actions after February 2014. In Hunan province, actions were taken much later because the first human infection did not occur until late January 2014.
