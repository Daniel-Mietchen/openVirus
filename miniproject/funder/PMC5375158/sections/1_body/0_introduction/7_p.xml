<p>The global distribution and population dynamics of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are highly influenced by environmental variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; temperature significantly affects the mosquito developmental and metabolic rates, while it is thought to also influence egg production and the frequency of blood meals, with extreme temperatures (&gt;40Â°C) having damaging effects. Rainfall is tightly associated to breeding sites of aquatic immature mosquito stages, with heavy rainfall compromising breeding sites or sweep away the immature stages. Reviews of how climatic variables affect 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> biology have been previously published [
