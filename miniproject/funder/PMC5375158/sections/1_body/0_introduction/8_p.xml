 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, relatively few validated CHIKV transmission models have been developed to date and even fewer based on validated 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population dynamics models [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], making reliable predictions about transmission and the potential impacts of different intervention programs at local and global scales challenging. We have previously developed an environmentally-driven model of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population dynamics and used a Bayesian approach to assess model fit to vector surveillance data from Emilia-Romagna, Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our model has demonstrated encouraging predictive capacity over the region and beyond. In the current study, we aimed to use this model as the basis for developing a stochastic spatiotemporal model of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-driven CHIKV transmission using large-scale gridded environmental datasets. Next, we sought to use this integrated model to investigate the CHIKV outbreaks in Italy [
