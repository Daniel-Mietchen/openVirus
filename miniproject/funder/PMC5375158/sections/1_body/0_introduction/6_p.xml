 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> can successfully inhabit both tropical and temperate climates [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with its wide geographic distribution arising from its ability to inhabit both rural and urban settings and display both anthropophilic and zoophilic behaviour [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is known as a container breeder due to the variety of natural and artificial environments used as breeding sites [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Adults are generally active during the day, but can also feed at night; in addition, although they prefer to feed outdoors, they do bite indoors, making prevention more problematic. Trading of car tires and timber from Asia was the probable route of introduction into countries where its presence would otherwise have been unlikely [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; eggs are resistant to desiccation and are thus likely to survive the travelling time. In addition, the temperate strain of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, in contrast to the tropical strain, can lay diapausing eggs with elevated cold-resistance contributing further to the reproductive success in colder climate zones [
