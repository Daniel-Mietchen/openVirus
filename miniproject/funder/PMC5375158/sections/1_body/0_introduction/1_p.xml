<p>Chikungunya is an incapacitating disease caused by the recently re-emerging Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus. Since its first identification in Tanzania in 1952, CHIKV has been detected in both low- and high-income countries, causing social and economic burdens. As the disease appears not to be directly associated with poverty or wealth, the recent rapid spread is thought to be the result of increased global travel, trading across international borders, and climate change, allowing known vectors to be transported quickly to new habitats [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in early 2005, outbreaks occurred in Mayotte, Mauritius, and the Comoro islands. By late April, Reunion Island had also been affected and a year later, approximately 244,000 cases and 203 reported deaths had occurred [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemics regularly occur in India, with an estimated one million cases reported during the 2006 epidemic, while repeated smaller-scale epidemics have occurred since 2005 in many other Asian and African countries [
