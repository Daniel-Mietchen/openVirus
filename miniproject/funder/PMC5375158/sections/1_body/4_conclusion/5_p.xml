<p>We identified two strategies of vector control, targeting adults and immature stages/breeding sites, as effective vector control measures only when applied in combination. We found that targeting adult vectors has a short-term impact, but is also highly effective in reducing the transmission rate. Without effective control of the immature stages and removal of breeding sites, this suppression tends to quickly lose effectiveness and restore the initially fast transmission rate in the long run. We reassert the importance of rapid implementation of management strategies, especially quarantining to improve the overall effectiveness. We suggest that unspecific restrictions on human travel to and from affected areas should be considered as an effective strategy, especially in large-scale epidemics.</p>
