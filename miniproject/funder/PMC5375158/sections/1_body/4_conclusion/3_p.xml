<p>On account of the evolutionary proximity of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations on Reunion Island and in Italy, we examined the two outbreaks that took place in these areas during 2005-2006 and in 2007, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine the two outbreaks in a unified environmentally-driven modelling framework.
