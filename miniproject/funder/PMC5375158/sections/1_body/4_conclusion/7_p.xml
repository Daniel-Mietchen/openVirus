<p>Although it has been reported that temperate strains of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> inhabit both Italy and Reunion Island, our analysis suggests that the environmental dependence captured by our vector dynamics model, assuming identical environmental dependencies in the two locations, might not be applicable to the islandâ€™s vector population. As an alternative explanation, we argue that multiple viral strains might have resulted in a two-stage outbreak with considerable epidemiological differences, such as human susceptibility to the infection.
