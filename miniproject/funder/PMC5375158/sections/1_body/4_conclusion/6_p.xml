<p>When applied to the two-stage chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island, the model demonstrates that a single parameter configuration, or a single posterior mode, is not sufficient to fit to the bimodal nature of the outbreak. While the posterior mode best explaining the first peak is characterised by low human susceptibility and high vector activity, the posterior mode for the second peak is characterised by high human susceptibility and low vector activity. An alternative posterior mode imposing a slow localised spread is also insufficient in describing the timing and distribution of the infected cases.</p>
