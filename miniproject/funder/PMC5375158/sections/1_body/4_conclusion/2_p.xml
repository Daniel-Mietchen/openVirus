<p>We aimed to improve model structure and relax some of the simplifying assumptions in traditional modelling approaches, such as deterministic dynamics, unrealistic biting rates, and the omission of infection relapses. We modified the dynamics of human-vector interactions by introducing vector activity as an additional influence. We presented numerically-estimated outbreak risk and impact as preferable means of risk assessment, and demonstrated that the approach makes better use of the known biology to the extent that it is incorporated into the model. Instead of imposing previously identified restrictions and estimates on certain parameter values, we sought to have the values informed by surveillance datasets. Although proving the validity of these improvements is not a trivial task, we believe that the model we have developed can be a useful tool to help improve understanding of the underlying biology especially when more detailed vector and disease surveillance data are available.</p>
