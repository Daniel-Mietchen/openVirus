<p>We argue that the model is useful in identifying gaps in our knowledge on global outbreaks. Discrepancies between data and predictions point to biologically relevant assumptions, which could be improved upon closer investigation of the case and accumulation of data. As we improve the model, we develop a better understanding of the insect biology, its environmental dependence, and the global dynamics of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-borne chikungunya outbreaks. The current study is a step towards a global outbreak model for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-borne chikungunya, and a foundation for developing widely applicable disease transmission models for other vector-borne diseases.
