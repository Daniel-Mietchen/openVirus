<p>We argue that the performance of the model in Italy promotes its applicability in Europe; however, more data are required to validate its applicability on Reunion Island. An island-specific model requires vector surveillance data from across the island to calibrate the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population dynamics model. In combination with a higher resolution of environmental variables, or direct use of local meteorological data, this will improve vector abundance predictions and reduce the systematic error propagating to the disease transmission model. Subsequently, geo-referenced incidence data, marking the times and locations of the cases, are needed, along with a detailed assessment of the impact of vector control measures, to improve parameter inference for the disease transmission model.
