<p>As a result, the model successfully replicates the case reports from Italy, and also informs about the possible effects of various outbreak management strategies. Although the model demonstrates high variability, which should be expected in such relatively small-scale outbreaks, it suggests a non-zero outbreak probability for outside the mosquito season by taking into account possible infection relapses. We identified that the outbreak risk increases gradually, peaks around July, and decreases rapidly during October when the temperatures are favourable for adult vector survival, but not for frequent ovipositioning. By assessing both the potential impact and probability of an outbreak, we suggest that the highest threat to public health from
