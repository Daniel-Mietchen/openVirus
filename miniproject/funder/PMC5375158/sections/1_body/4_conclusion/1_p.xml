<p>We developed a stochastic spatiotemporal disease transmission model for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-borne chikungunya, and adopted a large-scale modelling approach whereby globally available gridded environmental datasets drive the dynamics of vector populations. This permits a unified framework to examine outbreaks in territories with reasonably comparable environmental features. The ability to use general circulation models as a source of climate data permits prediction of disease epidemiology in the recent past, present, and future. We developed a generic modelling strategy where surveillance datasets inform the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-borne disease tranmission model in the absence of costly and laborious experimental studies. Our analyses suggest that the strategy is applicable over the areas where the albopictus model is applicable, and it can be used to compare and contrast different outbreak scenarios.
