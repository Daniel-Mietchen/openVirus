<p>Predictions could improve with a finer resolution of environmental variables, or with data from local weather stations; however, vector surveillance data comprising adult abundance from various parts of the island are required to accurately calibrate the model for the island. With such data, it could be possible to assess the rainfall dependence of the islandâ€™s vector population in comparison to Italy. Developing an island-specific outbreak model is beyond the scope of this research, but we argue that the observed performance forms a strong foundation for future development of such a model.</p>
