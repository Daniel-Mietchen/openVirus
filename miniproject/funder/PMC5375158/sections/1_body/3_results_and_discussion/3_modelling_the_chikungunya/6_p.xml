<p>We note that some previous modelling approaches, by assuming no environmental dependence in vector populations, fitted only to the first [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or second peak [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The bimodal nature of the outbreak was captured by two studies: BacaÃ«r, by assuming a hypothetical periodic vector abundance [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], and Dommar 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, although only a qualitative fit was reported, by assuming rainfall dependence [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].
