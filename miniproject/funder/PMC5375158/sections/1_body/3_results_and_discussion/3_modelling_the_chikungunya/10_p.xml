<p>As an alternative, a low reporting rate and the lack of a posterior mode fitting both peaks at the same time might be an indication of the involvement of more than one viral strain, and thus multiple outbreaks with overlapping time frames in the region. We countenance the potential scenario where a weak strain of chikungunya virus spreads across the island in accordance with

 </sub>, and acquires one or more adaptations to initiate a secondary wave of infection, which manifests itself as the second larger peak of the outbreak. Experimental evidence reported by Vazeille 
 <italic>et al.</italic> supports this scenario with the identification of two CHIKV strains, at different times, with considerably different transmission capabilities [
