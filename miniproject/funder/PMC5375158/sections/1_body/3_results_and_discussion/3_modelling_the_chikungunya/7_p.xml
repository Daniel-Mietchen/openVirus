<p>Although a posterior mode to explain both peaks and the spread of the virus accurately could be hidden in the parameter space, according to the identified posterior modes, it is likely that one or more of the assumptions with the albopictus model or epidemiological model requires refinement. A possible issue is the assumption of rapid mixing by the human population. The impact of intricate local interactions between the human and vector populations on Reunion Island might be too complex to be represented by a set of 9 km
 <sup>2</sup> patches separated by Euclidean distances. By incorporating traffic routes and demographic information, such as large corporate hubs where people from different parts of the island meet regularly, might improve prediction of the rate and routes of the spread.
