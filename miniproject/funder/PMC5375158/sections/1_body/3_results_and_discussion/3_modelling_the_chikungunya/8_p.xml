<p>While we adopted a large-scale modelling approach and assumed that the distribution of the vector population is uniform throughout the island, it is highly unlikely that the microclimatic conditions are similar throughout. In addition, the bimodal nature of the outbreak suggests that either vector abundance or activity might overlap with the two peaks. The albopictus model predicted that vector activity agrees with the peaks, but abundance is more erratic (
