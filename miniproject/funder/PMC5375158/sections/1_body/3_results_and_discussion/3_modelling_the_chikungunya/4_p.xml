 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] argued that the outbreak disseminated as clusters affecting one town after another during the progression of the initial peak. Although posterior mode

  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub> predicted a localised spread, which started from the north of the island and progressed towards south along the east and west coasts, the spread took place during both the small and large peaks (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174293.s006">S3 Fig</xref>). Conversely, posterior modes

 </sub> and 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>L</italic>
 </sub> suggest that the virus quickly spread over the island. In the case of 
 <italic>Q</italic>

 </sub>, the outbreak affected almost half the population in 2005 (95% CI: 20%-75%) and the rest in 2006 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g011">Fig 11(b)</xref>), while in the case of 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>L</italic>
 </sub>, the outbreak affected almost the entire human population of the island (95% CI: 95%-100%) during the large peak (see
