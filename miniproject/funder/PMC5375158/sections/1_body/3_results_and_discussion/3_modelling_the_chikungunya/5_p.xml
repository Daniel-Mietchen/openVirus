 </sub>, was lower than 40%, and eventually, almost everyone on the island was eventually infected. High attack rate necessitates that the fraction of asymptomatic cases is much larger than previously estimated. Seroprevalence studies estimated that about 40% of the population developed antibodies against chikungunya virus [

According to this, the virus spread across the entire island as early as the first peak, but affected only a small fraction of the population before it escalated.
