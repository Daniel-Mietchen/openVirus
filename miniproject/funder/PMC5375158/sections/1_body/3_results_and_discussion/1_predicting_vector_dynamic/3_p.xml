<p>Although it is possible to improve accuracy by employing high-resolution climate datasets, or meteorological data from local stations, temporally resolved vector surveillance data from the region is not available to improve model calibration. Furthermore, dependence on such extensive resources might render the model highly specific for a given study area and cast limited applicability elsewhere unless such data are available. Therefore, we believe that the level of match in
