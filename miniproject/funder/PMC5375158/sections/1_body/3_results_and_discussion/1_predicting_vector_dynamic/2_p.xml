<p>Although vector abundance data directly from the two regions of the outbreak were not available, we tested the applicability of the albopictus model over a preliminary surveillance dataset comprising ovitrap samplings in four towns, Ravenna, Forli, Cesena, and Rimini, during the period of the chikungunya outbreak in Italy [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g005">Fig 5(a)</xref>, we plot model prediction against the average number of eggs collected per ovitrap for each town. The prediction is in agreement with the data with a certain proportionality constant (0.75). Scaling with a proportionality constant was necessary due to the model output being normalised with respect to the number of ovitraps as placed in the Carrieri
