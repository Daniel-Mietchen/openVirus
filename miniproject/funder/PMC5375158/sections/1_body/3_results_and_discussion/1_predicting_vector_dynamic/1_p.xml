<p>Predicting vector abundance is an essential part of modelling vector-borne disease spread. Most of the previous approaches combined vector dynamics and disease spread modelling [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], where model validation was performed for both in a single step. We argue that, in terms of fitting to outbreak data, this approach gives a greater flexibility to the model and thus might result in overfitting. Unfortunately, vector abundance data are limited or restricted for most parts of the world due to the cost and effort required to collect such data. Here, we employed our environmentally-driven population dynamics model of
