<p>Prompted by this, we used the albopictus model in conjunction with ClimEurope dataset for Italy and ClimGlobe dataset for Reunion Island (see Environmental data sets) to predict adult female vector abundance in the two regions. The expected number of adult female vector per ovitrap (ovitraps as placed in the original surveillance study) and the predicted daily fecundity are given in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g005">Fig 5(b) and 5(c)</xref>. As shown, seasonality in vector abundance and activity are more evident in Italy where the model predicted no significant presence during winter. However, abundance and egg-laying activity fluctuate at high levels all year round on Reunion Island. Uninterrupted annual activity is also supported by the incidence data from the island during the time between the two outbreaks when around 100 infections continued to be observed weekly (
