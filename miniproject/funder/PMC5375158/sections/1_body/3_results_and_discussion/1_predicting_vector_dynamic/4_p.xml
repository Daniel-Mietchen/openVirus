<p>While the introduction of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to Italy has been traced to Georgia (USA) through used tyre trade in the early â€™90s [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], its establishment on Reunion Island has been known for centuries [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Further study by Paupy 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] demonstrated a stratified 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population structure on the island along the east and west coasts. Nevertheless, Kamgang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] reported close evolutionary relationships between the European and Reunion Island populations. Evolutionary clustering of the Reunion Island 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> with the temperate strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] suggests the applicability of the albopictus model on both regions. Although it is highly unlikely that the same parameterisation will accurately represent both populations, in the absence of vector surveillance data, we believe that the model will be able to capture the essence of environmental dependency of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> on the island.
