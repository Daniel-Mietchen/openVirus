<p>For large populations scattered over large areas, the assumption of rapid mixing might not be valid. We tested the effect of population stratification by partitioning both the human and the vector populations into 10 identical interconnected patches. We rendered the patches equidistant from each other, and tuned human mobility using 
 <italic>q</italic>, the daily probability of residing in a patch (
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that the outbreak risk is insensitive to 
 <italic>q</italic>, as the vector to human ratio is the same in both a single patch or all of them combined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g009">Fig 9(b)</xref>). However, the impact, more specifically the possible range of the impact, decreases substantially when the human population is confined to reside in patches (when 
 <italic>q</italic> is close to 1).
