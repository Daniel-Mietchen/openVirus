<p>A notable exception is that human susceptibility is about four times more likely to be below 50% according to the dataset. We found that a higher biting rate could alleviate this restriction and allow for higher susceptibility; however, the typical ovipositioning interval of four days [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] does not permit high biting rates. Low human susceptibility might be an inherent characteristic of the human population in the region, or a phenotype of the specific CHIKV strain that infected the area. In addition, it is likely that factors other than what we have accounted for in the model could play significant roles. For instance, the frequency of human-vector encounters depends on the time of the day and whether a person is indoors or outdoors, and this might reduce the estimated number of daily bites through the reduction of
