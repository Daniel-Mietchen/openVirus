<p>Since there is a high outbreak risk in the area and the impact of a possible outbreak can be very high, the importance of vector control measures in containing large-scale epidemics is evident. According to the mission report of ECDC/WHO [

 <italic>et al.</italic> 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a series of vector control measures, including egg/breeding site removal and larvicide/adulticide treatment, was applied in the region for 3 consecutive days commencing on the 18

 </sup> of August. The estimated impact was more than 90% reduction in adult mosquitoes, about 60% reduction in eggs and breeding sites, and about 95% reduction in larvae and pupae [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We mimicked the potential effects of this intervention by applying 60% daily reduction in adult survival for 3 days, 25% daily reduction in eggs and breeding sites for 3 days, and 10% daily reduction in larvae and pupae for 30 days, the expected duration of larvicide activity [
