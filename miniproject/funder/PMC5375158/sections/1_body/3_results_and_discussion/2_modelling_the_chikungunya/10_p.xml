<p>The model predicts that the outbreak could have lasted longer if not for the administration of effective vector control measures [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to the model, the probability for a secondary infection resulting from the imported (index) case was as high as 0.43. In addition, between the time of virus introduction and the predicted end of the outbreak, towards the end of November, the model predicted that the median number of human infections, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, was 1700 (95% CI: 100â€”3900). These predictions correspond to a high outbreak risk for the combination of location and time of virus introduction. We estimated both the probability and impact of the outbreak to be in agreement with the data and the previous study of Poletti 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We note that our inference procedure employed no prior information on parameter values, but benefitted only from the observed epidemic trajectory. The degree of uncertainty can be reduced if previously reported restrictions on parameters were imposed; however, we aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the described methodology for developing reliable and predictive models of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-borne diseases for which little or no experimental studies are available.
