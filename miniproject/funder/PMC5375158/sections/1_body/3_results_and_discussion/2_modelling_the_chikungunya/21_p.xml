<p>Following the analysis of model predictions, we investigated the information acquired from the surveillance dataset as a result of the inference process. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g010">Fig 10</xref>, we present the marginal probability distributions of posterior mode 
 <italic>Q</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub> for a subset of parameters (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174293.s004">S1 Fig</xref> for the full list of parameters). As evident from the figure, vector biting rate, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>vec</sub>, and human susceptibility, 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>scpH</sub>, are likely to be low, but vector counts, imposed by 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>ovt</sub>, and reporting rate, 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>η</italic>
 </sub>, tend to be high with regards to their respective search domains. Interdependencies between parameters, evident in the posterior mode, indicate that parameter variability allows maintaining a reservoir of infected vectors and a non-zero biting rate for the duration of the outbreak. Strong negative correlation (Pearsons’ 
 <italic>ρ</italic> &lt; −0.25 and 
 <italic>ρ</italic> &gt; 0.25 with 
 <italic>p</italic> ≪ 0.001) between 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>vec</sub> and 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>scpH</sub> and between 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>ovt</sub> and 
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>scpV</sub> suggests that a surge of biting rate, or equivalently vector count, is counterbalanced by a reduction of susceptibility in order to match the observed epidemic trajectory. We observed that it is almost twice as likely for a chronic infection to relapse as to transcend to the recovered stage, evident from the joint distribution of 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CI</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>CR</italic>
 </sub>. However, the variability in 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub> indicates that the chronic stage has only a minor impact on the course of an outbreak according to the model and 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>. We detected a significant positive correlation between reporting rate and latent period in humans, 
 <italic>ω</italic>, which indicates that a reduction in the fraction of asymptomatic cases would be counterbalanced with a rapid incubation period to match the observed number of cases.
