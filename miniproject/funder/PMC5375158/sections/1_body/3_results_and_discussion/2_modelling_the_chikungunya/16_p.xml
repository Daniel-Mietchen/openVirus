<p>As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g008">Fig 8(a)</xref>, the intervention drastically reduced the number of adult vectors and maintained a low transmission rate up to the end of November (470 cases instead of 1700). The initial decline due to the effective reduction of adult vectors provided a short-term high-efficiency control, while breeding site removal and control of the immature stages maintained the long-term effectiveness of the intervention. Despite high parametric and intrinsic variability, the model agrees well with the previous study of Poletti 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in terms of the effects of vector control. Further to the applied control measures, we investigated the possible impacts of alternative strategies. For instance, rapid recovery of high transmission rate is evident in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g008">Fig 8(b)</xref> where only adulticides were applied (900 cases instead of 1700). The strong suppression due to complete eradication of breeding sites and the immature stages is apparent in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g008">Fig 8(c)</xref>; assuming 100% reduction achieved during the time frames of the vector control measures (310 cases instead of 1700).
