<p>In addition to quarantining, which focuses only on detectable symptomatic cases, we investigated the effect of isolating a part of the human population from the vector population. Potential means of isolation could include using mosquito repellants or imposing travel restrictions. We assessed the outbreak risk and impact by varying the human population size for the Italian CHIKV outbreak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g009">Fig 9(a)</xref>). We found that increasing population size decreases the outbreak risk as it is less likely for an infectious person to be bitten in a large population. The impact of an outbreak is small, but less variable, in small populations. Although almost everyone will get infected, isolation effectively prevents transmission to a larger population where the impact would be greater. We observed that the impact does not follow population size linearly, but tends to decrease as size increases. This is due to the speed of transmission: as the progression is slower in large populations, it takes multiple mosquito seasons for the infection to spread through the population. Here, we followed transmission for a year following the last reported case.
