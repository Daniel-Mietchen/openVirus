<p>We note that, here, 
 <italic>τ</italic> is a variable for increasing or decreasing the acceptance probability. It is equivalent to the annealing temperature of simulated annealing [

 <monospace>hoppMCMC</monospace> algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], or to the acceptance threshold of approximate Bayesian computation. The equation generates an energy gradient, with a minimum at 
 <italic>y</italic> = 
 <italic>δ</italic>, which could be traversed with an MCMC algorithm. When compared with traditional ABC, the gradient distance function yields better posterior samples by assigning more weight to samples from the vicinity of 
 <italic>δ</italic> [
