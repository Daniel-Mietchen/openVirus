<p>When posterior modes are sufficiently distant from one another, low-probability regions of the posterior distribution prevent efficient sampling. Here, instead of sampling from the entire posterior distribution, we opted to sample from the posterior modes with the highest average probabilities. Our inference procedure comprised of two distinct steps: (i) identifying a high-probability region in the posterior distribution with an optimisation step, and (ii) obtaining posterior samples within this region with a sampling step.</p>
