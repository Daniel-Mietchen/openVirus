 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], Bayesian methods are inherently limited in capacity when large systems with many parameters are of concern [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In order to circumvent this limitation, we assumed that the posterior distribution can be approximated as a combination of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with modes corresponding to each of its local maxima. Following the previous definition of this concept in Erguler 
 <italic>et al.</italic> 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we refer to the locality of each of these Gaussians as a posterior mode.
