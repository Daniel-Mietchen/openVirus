<p>We adopted a large-scale modelling approach by focusing on the cells of gridded environmental datasets. We used the gridded climate dataset (E-OBS) of the EU-FP6 project ENSEMBLES with 0.25Â° resolution [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] (about 25 km along the equator) and the UN-adjusted Gridded Population of the World Version 3 (GPWv3) with matching resolution for 2005 [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as the source of temperature, precipitation and human population density for simulations over Europe. Throughout the text, we refer to this environmental dataset as ClimEurope.
