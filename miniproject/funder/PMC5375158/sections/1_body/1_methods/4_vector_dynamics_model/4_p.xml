<p>Overall, we observed that the model with Θ4 suggests elevated cold resistance for diapausing eggs and the involvement of both temperature and photoperiod in the process of diapause (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174293.s002">S2 Text</xref> for a detailed account of the results). The threshold for cold resistance in adult vectors is around -2°C, while diapausing eggs can be expected to have 50% daily survival probability at -10°C or lower. While the data are not restrictive on the lower bound of cold resistance, they necessitate that diapausing eggs should resist very low temperatures. We note, however, that these temperatures are daily averages and they represent an entire grid cell of the environmental datasets. According to Θ4, diapause entry is triggered by a drop in temperature (below 11.59 ± 0.003°C), while exit from diapause is mainly initiated by the duration of daylight exceeding 11.78 ± 0.001 hours. We found that, with regards to its biological implications, Θ4 closely resembles the posterior mode Θ1 in Erguler
