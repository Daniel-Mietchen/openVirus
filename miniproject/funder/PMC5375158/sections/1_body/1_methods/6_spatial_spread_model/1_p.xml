<p>In order to model spread, we implemented a metapopulation model [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] by allocating vector and human populations in patches (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174293.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Each patch resides in a distinct location and has a size comparable to the maximum flight span of a vector population. We assumed that vector movement between patches due to wind and human activities is negligible; thus, vectors can move within a patch but not between patches. Since only humans are mobile between patches, they are responsible from spreading disease spatially.
