<p>In order to improve efficiency in numerical simulations, we approximated the daily number of interactions with a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation 
 <italic>λ</italic> when 
 <italic>λ</italic> is large enough (more than 1000 interactions per day). In this case, the number of interactions to the next successful transmission can be approximated with an exponential distribution with rate
