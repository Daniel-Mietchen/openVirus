<p>Although

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (fecundity) is independent of human population density [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In accordance with this, here, we assumed that fecundity and the number of human-vector interactions are independent quantities; 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will always find the blood meal it needs even if there are no humans around.
