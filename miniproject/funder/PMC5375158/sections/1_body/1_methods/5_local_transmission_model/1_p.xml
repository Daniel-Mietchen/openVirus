<p>Chikungunya virus is transmitted from one person to another via the bites of infectious vectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Here, we modelled the initiation of disease transmission with a susceptible vector becoming infected upon receiving a blood meal from an infectious human. When infected, we assumed that the vector passes to the exposed stage, 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>E</italic>
 </sub>, where it spends an incubation period of approximately 
 <italic>ω</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ν</italic>
 </sub> days. Following the incubation period, the vector becomes infectious, 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>I</italic>
 </sub>, and spends the rest of its life in this stage [
