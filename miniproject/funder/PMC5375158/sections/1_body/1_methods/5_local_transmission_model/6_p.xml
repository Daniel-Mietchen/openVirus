<p>The rate of viral transmission between human and vector populations depends on the number of interactions between the two species. The assumption of rapid mixing, where human and vector populations freely and randomly interact with each other, is implicit in canonical deterministic outbreak models and their stochastic derivatives [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], humans can quickly move over large distances and give rise to rapid mixing [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. By relying mainly on human mobility, we explicitly assumed rapid mixing and regarded human-vector interactions as a Poisson process where, on average, 
 <italic>λ</italic> interactions—successful blood meals—take place between the two species every day. The average number of interactions is independent of their respective disease states and transmission occurs only whenever either vector or human are infectious.
