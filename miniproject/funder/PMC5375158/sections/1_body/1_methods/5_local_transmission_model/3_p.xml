<p>Upon recovery or entrance to the chronic stage, we assumed that a patient is no longer infectious; however, in the chronic stage, which could last for several years, spontaneous remission of the infectious stage might occur [

 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. We modelled such sporadic relapses by allowing transformations to an alternative infectious stage,

  <italic>C</italic>
 </sub>. Unlike the initial infectious stage, this alternative stage transforms back to the chronic stage, and the chronic stage transforms to the recovered stage with a small but fixed daily probability,

 <sub>
  <italic>CR</italic>
 </sub>. Due to the lack of detailed accounts of environmental dependence of relapses from the chronic stage, we adopted a fixed daily probability of relapse,
