<p>The surface area of the island is approximately 2,500 km
 <sup>2</sup>, which is close to the size of one grid cell of the ClimGlobe dataset (see Environmental data sets). Therefore, we simulated the expected adult female abundance using the environmental variables from the grid cell centered at 55.625°E and -21.125°N.
