<p>We obtained the number of people in each patch from the INSEE gridded population estimate of 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Although the resolution of this dataset is 1 km
 <sup>2</sup>, we note that the simulation time increases exponentially with the number of patches prohibiting efficient inference and posterior sampling. Therefore, we re-grouped grid cells to yield a computationally feasible number of patches where rapid mixing of humans can still be expected.
