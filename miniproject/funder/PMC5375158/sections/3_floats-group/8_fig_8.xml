A stronger control strategy on the immature stages and breeding sites was implemented in (c). The effect of perfectly isolating the symptomatic cases is shown in (d) with a black line, median, and a grey shade, 95% range. The red dashed horizontal line indicate the median outbreak impact (1700 human infections) without intervention.
