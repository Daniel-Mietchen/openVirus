  <title>Prediction of adult vector abundance and activity in Italy and on Reunion Island.</title>
  <p>(a) The predicted number of eggs per ovitrap per week in Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna villages is shown with the surveillance data from four neighbouring towns [
   <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]: Cesena (circle), Forli (triangle), Ravenna (square), and Rimini (diamond). The beginning and end of the outbreak and the time of application of vector control measures [
   <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
   <xref rid="pone.0174293.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are marked in the figure. The predicted vector abundance is scaled down to 75% in the plot. (b) Predicted adult female vector abundance per ovitrap in the two regions for a time frame covering both the Italian and the Reunion Island outbreaks. (c) Predicted daily fecundity during the same time frame in the two regions. The pale grey shades in (a, b, c) indicate the 95% credible interval of the mean.
