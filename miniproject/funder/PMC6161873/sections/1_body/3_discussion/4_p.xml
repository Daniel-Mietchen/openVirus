 <italic>aegypti</italic> (see

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Africa. These factors include: vector densities, trophic preference of vectors for humans, proportion of immunologically na√Øve humans, and environmental conditions favorable to transmission. Surveillance of travelers coming from YFV-endemic regions of Africa or South America able to initiate a local transmission in the Caribbean should be reinforced. Likewise, vaccination coverage should be reexamined as the live-attenuated 17D is one of the most effective vaccines available against this arbovirus.
