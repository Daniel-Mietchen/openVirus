The ongoing YFV circulation in Brazil raises concern regarding viral importation into the Caribbean. However, the requirement of YF vaccination is not mandatory in many Caribbean islands (e.g. Haiti, Cuba), but restricted to the travelers coming from YF-epidemic countries (

The disease control relies only on the check of vaccination card, which is insufficient for YF prevention. Thus, YF is still a threat for this region where
