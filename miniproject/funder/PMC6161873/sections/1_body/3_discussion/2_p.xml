<p>Viral infection, dissemination and transmission increased along with dpi. Infection and dissemination reached a peak at 14 dpi (70% and 57% for IR and DR, respectively), suggesting that the midgut has a limited role as barrier to the viral dissemination in the mosquito general cavity. Transmission was only detected from 14 dpi suggesting an extrinsic incubation period (i.e. period between the ingestion of infectious blood meal and the excretion of virus in saliva) is between 7 and 14 days as shown for

At 21 days post-infection, transmission was more efficient with 12% of mosquitoes presenting disseminated infection and delivering virus in saliva.
