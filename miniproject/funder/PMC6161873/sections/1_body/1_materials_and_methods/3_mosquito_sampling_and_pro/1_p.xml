<p>Mosquitoes were examined at 7, 14, and 21 days post-infection (dpi). After removing mosquito wings and legs, the proboscis was inserted into a P20 tip filled with 5 μL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) [

After 30 min, saliva was expelled from the tip to 45 μL of L-15 medium (Invitrogen, California, USA) and then processed for viral titration to estimate transmission. Then, mosquito head and body were collected and ground individually in 300 μL of L-15 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, for respectively, viral infection and dissemination analysis. 200 μL of homogenates were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min at +4°C before viral titration. To estimate the vector competence, three parameters were calculated: (i) infection rate (IR) referring to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected body among engorged mosquitoes, (ii) dissemination rate (DR) corresponding to the proportion of mosquitoes with infected head among mosquitoes with infected body, and (iii) transmission rate (TR) representing the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious saliva among mosquitoes with infected head.
