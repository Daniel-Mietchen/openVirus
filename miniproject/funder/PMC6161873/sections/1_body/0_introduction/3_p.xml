<p>Yellow fever virus (YFV; 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, Flaviviridae) is primarily transmitted by the mosquitoes 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. (e.g. 
 <italic>Aedes africanus)</italic> in Africa and 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> (e.g. 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys)</italic> in South America [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Brazil, the anthropophilic mosquitoes 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> as well as the YFV-enzootic mosquitoes 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes albiprivus</italic> are highly susceptible to YFV [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the widely distributed 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in American countries raises the concern of a re-urbanization of YF if the virus is introduced via viremic vertebrate hosts. In the Caribbean, Guadeloupe Island has experienced several outbreaks caused by arboviruses such as dengue [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], chikungunya [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and zika [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], all three viruses only be transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is absent from the island [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To be considered as an epidemic vector of YFV, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> should be experimentally susceptible to the virus (i.e. a competent vector) in addition of being an anthropophilic mosquito [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in close contacts with humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0204710.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this report, we evaluate the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Guadeloupe to YFV. These results will help the local health authorities and the decision-makers to anticipate the arrival of YF in the Caribbean.
