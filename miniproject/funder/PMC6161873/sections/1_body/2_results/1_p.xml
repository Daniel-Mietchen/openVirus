<p>Mosquitoes were analyzed at three time points following infection: 7, 14 and 21 days post infection (dpi). At 7 dpi, 56.7% (17/30) of mosquitoes examined had infected bodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204710.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Among them, 29.4% (5/17) of mosquitoes were able to ensure a viral dissemination beyond the midgut barrier in the hemocele. No mosquitoes were able to transmit the virus with no viral particles detected in mosquito saliva. Later, at 14 dpi, a higher proportion, 70% (21/30) of mosquitoes had an infected body and among them, 57.1% (12/21) presented a positive viral dissemination into the hemocele. Then, 8.3% (1/12) had virus in saliva, indicative of viral transmission; one mosquito had 20 viral particles. At 21 dpi, the proportion of mosquitoes with infected body decreased to 50% (15/30) and among them, more than half (53.3%; 8/15) could ensure a viral dissemination. A slightly higher proportion of mosquitoes (12.5%; 1/8) with disseminated infection presented virus in saliva; one mosquito had 200 viral particles. Rates did not significantly vary according to dpi: 7 dpi (Chi-square test: χ2 = 2.57, df = 2, p = 0.27), 14 dpi (Chi-square test: χ2 = 3.21, df = 2, p = 0.20), and 21 dpi (Chi-square test: χ2 = 0.65, df = 2, p = 0.72).
