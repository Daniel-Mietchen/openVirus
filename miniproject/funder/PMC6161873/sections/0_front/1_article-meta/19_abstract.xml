 <p>The recent yellow fever epidemic in Brazil has raised the concern of outbreaks in neighboring countries, particularly in the Caribbean region where the vector 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is predominant. This threat comes from the past when in the Americas, this disease caused devastating urban epidemics. We report the vector competence of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> from Guadeloupe for yellow fever virus by determining different parameters describing virus infection, dissemination, and transmission. The results indicate that 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> Guadeloupe are susceptible to yellow fever virus with viral particles detected in mosquito saliva at 14 and 21 days post-infection. Local authorities and more broadly, international organizations should maintain the active surveillance of 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and the spreading of human cases from South America.
