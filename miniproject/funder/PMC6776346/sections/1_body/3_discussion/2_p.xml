<p>The live birth information system is an attractive source of information on congenital anomalies. Before the circulation of Zika in Brazil the prevalence of congenital anomalies recorded in SINASC was less than 1%, however, it was estimated that the prevalence of congenital anomalies among live births in Brazil was about 2%- 3%[

The variation observed across Brazilian regions in the reporting of congenital anomalies rate is possibly due to the heterogeneity of the quality of the notification system, and higher rate of sub registration occurring in the poorest regions of the country. The level of underreporting can also vary by diagnosing groups. A high rate of underreported anomalies has been observed for hydrops, microcephaly, cleft palate, congenital heart disease and Down syndrome[

Therefore, after the Zika epidemic the live birth information system began to reflect closer to expected levels of notification of birth abnormalities as the reporting system improved.
