<p>This study showed that immediately post the Zika event in Brazil, there was a considerable increase in the notification rate of congenital anomalies, mainly malformations of the brain and eye that were reported as a complication of the infection. This growth was reported in all region of the country except in the South, especially in the Northeast, where the majority of Zika cases were concentrated
 <sup>1</sup>. When the frequency of Zika cases, and consequently risk of maternal infection decreased, the malformations related to its complications also went down significantly, as expected. However, the increased observed (compared with the pre-Zika trends) in the rate of congenital malformations not related to the brain or eye remained at the same level suggesting an overall improvement in the registration of birth malformations. A natural conjecture arises, that such an increase in the registration of cases was in part due to surveillance actions and overall growing awareness of health professionals at the time of the Zika epidemic.
