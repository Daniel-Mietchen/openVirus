<p>Our findings have several limitations. First, there is a lack of knowledge on the spectrum of Congenital Zika Syndrome, therefore in part the excess of cases registered in the no brain or eye ICD-10 group could be explained by unknown Zika complications. Although studies to better understand the spectrum of outcomes associated with maternal ZIKV infection have been developed, and knowledge about the syndrome is improving, the full spectrum of CZS has yet to be defined[

Finally, our study uses routine data that were not specifically created to answer this research question. However, we use the data in high-level aggregate analysis and only use final, rather than provisional data, which are regarded as complete. Despite these limitations this study has provided evidence of improvements in the live birth notification system in registering congenital anomalies triggered by the Zika epidemic.
