<p>The North, Northeast, Midwest and Southeast regions showed similar patterns of change. Immediately after the interruption point, the notification rate rose significantly, followed by a significant decrease in the monthly trend (relative to the pre-Zika trend).The most dramatic change occurred in the Northeast region, where the notification rate of brain and eye anomalies immediately post the Zika event went up by 37.1/10,000 live births (95% CI 12.9â€“61.3) per month, over four times higher than observed in other regions. In the South region, where the circulation of Zika was low, there were no significant changes neither immediately nor over time post the Zika event.</p>
