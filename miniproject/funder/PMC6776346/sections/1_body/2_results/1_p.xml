<p>A total of 141,969 (0.6% of 23,359,499 live births) congenital abnormalities were registered in SINASC from 2010 to 2017. In Brazil, the starting rate of overall congenital malformations was estimated at 77.2/10,000 live births varying from 56/10,000 live births in the North to 89.3/10,000 live births in Southeast. The distribution of congenital anomalies by ICD-10 group varied over the years, mainly in the number of malformations of the nervous system that peaked in 2016; rates of malformations of the eye, ear, face and neck and malformations of the circulatory system increased over the years from 6.5% in 2010 to 9.2% and 7.2% in 2010 to 11.1% in 2017 respectively. Reporting of other congenital malformations has slowly decreased over time from 6.8% in 2010 to 5.3% in 2017. Maternal age and newborn sex distributions remained similar over the years, although the proportion of babies with congenital anomalies who were born to women over the age of 35 increased from 13.4% to 16.9%.
