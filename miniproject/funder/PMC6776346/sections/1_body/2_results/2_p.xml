 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007721.g001">Fig 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007721.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In Brazil, the starting level of congenital malformation rate of the brain and eye was estimated at 8.2/10,000 live births. It was decreasing slowly monthly in the baseline, but it was not significant. Immediately after the interruption point (Sept 2015), the notification rate rose significantly, by 14.9/10,000 live births (CI 95% 6.7–23.2) per month, followed by a significant decrease in the monthly trend (relative to the pre-Zika trend) of 0.6/10,000 (CI 95% -1.1–0.2).
