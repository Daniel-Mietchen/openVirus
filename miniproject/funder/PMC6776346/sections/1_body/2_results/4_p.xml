 <xref rid="pntd.0007721.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the starting rate of congenital malformations, not coded as brain or eye related, were estimated at 69.6/10,000 live births, and this rate decreased every month prior to Zika by 0.03/10,000 live births (CI 95%-0.08–0.01). However, this was not significant. Right after the interruption point (September 2015), the notification rate of non brain or eye congenital anomalies increased significantly to 5.2/10,000 live births (CI 95% 2.3–8.1), three times lower than observed in the brain and eye group. A slow but significant increase of 0.2/10,000 (CI 95% 0.1–0.4) was observed (relative to the pre-Zika trend) in the monthly notification rates of no brain or eye anomalies.
