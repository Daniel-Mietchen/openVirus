<p>In 2015, a series of events, triggered by the Zika epidemic, had great potential to change the practices that impact the registration of congenital anomalies. These events were: the alarming growth in suspected cases of a rare condition (microcephaly); measures adopted to strengthen surveillance systems of congenital anomalies in regions where Zika cases had been reported; and finally the massive media coverage on the birth of babies with small heads[

Despite the well-known rise in the rate of congenital anomalies related with Zika complications during the epidemic, little has been described on whether some changes in the patterns of recording congenital anomalies not related to Zika have occurred over time. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of Zika epidemic on the registration of congenital anomalies in infants in Brazil.
