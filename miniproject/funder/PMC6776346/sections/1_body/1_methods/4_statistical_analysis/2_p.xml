<p>Where y
 <sub>t</sub> is the number of cases of malformation divided by the number of births multiplied by 100000 (rate) in each month; T
 <sub>t</sub> is the time since the start of the study; X
 <sub>t</sub> is a dummy variable that was 0 if the birth date was before Sept 2015 or 1 otherwise; X
 <sub>t</sub>T
 <sub>t</sub> is the interaction between the time and the dummy variable[

 <italic>β</italic>

  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> that is the rate of malformation at T
 <sub>0</sub> (“Pre-zika starting level”), (ii) 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub> the mean increase in the malformation rate monthly before Sept 2015 (“Pre Zika event”), (iii) 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub> is a change in the slope after Sept 2015 (immediately change) and (iv) 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>3</italic>
 </sub> the mean increase in malformation rate after Sept 2015 (“Post Zika event”). Furthermore, for each β estimated in our model a t-test is performed to check the parameter values is equal to 0. We assumed that any time-varying unmeasured confounder is relatively slowly changing so that it would be distinguishable from the sharp jump of the event indicator (Zika epidemic).
