<p>In this study we used the data from Brazilian live birth information system (SINASC). This system is updated with the registration of a live birth. The system uses a legal document, created in 1990 and compulsorily used throughout the country. The forms are pre-numbered and in three copies are identified by colours (white—the form kept by the local health council that digitizes the information and sends it to the Brazilian Information System headquarters; yellow—kept by the local registry office that generates a birth certificate; pink—kept with the health records of the pregnant women or the neonate in the facility). Mothers do not have to consent to the registration. Data available on this system are collected in a standard form which is completed by the health professional who assisted the delivery, mostly physicians as more than 98% of deliveries take place in hospital. SINASC includes information on the newborn (sex; birth weight, presence of abnormality), the mother (name, place of residence, age, marital status, education) and the pregnancy (length of gestation, type of delivery). Congenital anomalies observed at birth must be described using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) 10th revision. In case of doubt about the condition, paediatricians or neonatologists should be contacted. If none of these professionals were available in the institution the SINASC headquarters must be contacted. These data have a high completeness rate, with missing data not exceeding 10% of most variables[

An evaluation of the birth registration system in Brazil found that 98% of Brazilian live births are registered in the system, although some difference are found within regions. However, it should be noted that all regions reach percentages of coverage over 90%[
