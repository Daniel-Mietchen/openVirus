<p>The event analysed in this study was the Zika epidemic in Brazil. The design of this study is an interrupted time series because the “event analysed” is expected to “interrupt” the level and/or trend of the outcome variable after its introduction. However, because we are analysing events occurring at birth, we expected a delay in the outcome after maternal exposure during pregnancy. Therefore we considered that: at the beginning of the Zika epidemic, cases were not compulsorily notifiable (the Brazilian surveillance system was not able to record all the disease cases systematically), and there was a delay of about six months between exposure (maternal infection) and outcome (live birth with congenital abnormalities). We therefore used the following approach to select the interruption point in the time series. Firstly we searched in the literature, and considered published studies that estimated the rise of Zika infections cases or exanthematous illness related to Zika. The rise in cases was reported to have started in March 2015 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007721.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We implemented a delay of six months from the month when the number of cases started to increase and therefore used September 2015 as the interruption point in the time series. For the purposes of this analysis, we considered the period from January 2010 to September 2015 to be “pre-Zika event,” and the period from just after September 2015 to December 2017 to be “post-Zika event.”
