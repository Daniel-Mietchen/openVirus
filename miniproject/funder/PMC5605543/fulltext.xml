However, the epidemiology and diversity of swine IAVs is not completely understood. In this cohort study, we sampled on a weekly basis 132 3-week old pigs for 15 weeks. We found two overlapping epidemic events of infection in which most pigs (98.4%) tested PCR positive for IAVs. The prevalence rate of infection ranged between 0 and 86% per week and the incidence density ranged between 0 and 71 cases per 100 pigs-week. Three distinct influenza viral groups (VGs) replicating as a &#x0201c;swarm&#x0201d; of viruses were identified (swine H1-gamma, H1-beta, and H3-cluster-IV IAVs) and co-circulated at different proportions over time suggesting differential allele fitness. Furthermore, using deep genome sequencing 13 distinct viral genome constellations were differentiated. Moreover, 78% of the pigs had recurrent infections with IAVs closely related to each other or IAVs clearly distinct. Our results demonstrated the molecular complexity of swine IAVs during natural infection of pigs in which novel strains of IAVs with zoonotic and pandemic potential can emerge. These are key findings to design better health interventions to reduce the transmission of swine IAVs and minimize the public health risk.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Influenza virus</kwd><kwd>Viral epidemiology</kwd><kwd>Viral evolution</kwd><kwd>Viral transmission</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Influenza A viruses (IAVs) can infect many animal species including humans and pigs, and are considered a major public health risk because zoonotic infections can cause human pandemics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

However, the epidemiology, diversity and molecular evolution of IAVs during natural infection of pigs are not clearly understood. Understanding the mechanisms that allow IAVs to evolve and persist in swine populations is crucial to design health interventions that minimize viral transmission between pigs and from pigs to people.</p><p id="Par3">IAVs are Orthomyxoviruses that contain eight single stranded negative sense RNA gene segments namely polymerase B2 (PB2, segment 1), polymerase B1 (PB1, segment 2), polymerase A (PA, segment 3), hemagglutinin (HA, segment 4), nucleoprotein (NP, segment 5), neuraminidase (NA, segment 6), matrix (M, segment 7), and non-structural protein (NS, segment 8). The main antigenic proteins (HA and NA) are used in a dual classification system to differentiate viruses into seventeen HAs (H1-H17) and nine NAs (N1-N9)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Aquatic birds are considered the natural reservoir for most IAVs and at least 116 HA-NA IAV combinations have been isolated from avian species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, only few IAV subtypes are endemic in humans and pigs.</p><p id="Par4">A reassortant IAV caused the 2009 IAV pandemic and highlighted the risk of swine IAVs for public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In North America, the diversity of swine IAVs has increased due to multiple reassortment events and the introduction of human IAVs including the 2009 pandemic virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

In the USA H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 IAVs are endemic in pigs and cluster in six H1 clades (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;1, &#x003b3;2, &#x003b4;1, and &#x003b4;2) and four H3 clusters (I, II, III and IV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the diversity and evolution of IAVs at the herd level in the contemporary swine industry are not clearly understood.</p><p id="Par5">According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS), in the USA there are almost 72 million pigs and approximately 9 to 10 million are slaughtered every month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which illustrates the high turnover rate of swine populations. The majority of these pigs are weaned at 3 weeks of age from farrow-to-wean herds and moved to growing pig production sites (i.e wean to finish farms) where they are reared until market (~24 weeks of age). Additionally, pig farms can be managed as continuous or all-in/all-out flows. In a continuous flow, pig batches are moved in and out of production sites on a continuous basis with pigs present on-site all the time. In contrast, in all-in/all-out flows, a batch of pigs is used to fill the production site and no more pigs are added until all pigs from the previous batch are removed. Since production flows and sites might influence the evolution of swine IAVs it is crucial to study the dynamics of the virus at the herd level.</p><p id="Par6">We hypothesize that the persistence of swine IAVs in pigs after weaning is associated to the plasticity of IAV genome and the continuous influx of infected and susceptible individuals. Therefore, we designed a prospective cohort study and used next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the complete genome of the IAV population during natural infection of pigs after weaning. We found that three different influenza viral groups (VG) co-circulated at different proportions over time and produced two overlapping epidemic events in which the majority of the pigs had recurrent infections &#x0feff;with&#x0feff; IAV. These results are important because they unraveled a deeper layer of the epidemiology and molecular diversity of swine IAVs at the herd level and will help to design better health interventions to reduce the transmission of IAVs between pigs and from pigs to humans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Epidemiological findings</title><p id="Par7">One hundred and thirty-two 3-week old pigs were randomly selected and identified from a group of weaned pigs (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2200) at arrival (week 0 (W0)) to a commercial wean-to-finish-farm.

Using intensive sampling events and deep genome sequencing we were able to characterize with high resolution the epidemiological patterns of IAV infection, and the genetic and antigenic diversity of the viral population during infection of pigs. Strikingly we found the occurrence of two contiguous epidemic events of infection within a short period of time in which three different viral populations (viral groups) coexisted as a dynamic &#x0201c;swarm&#x0201d; of IAV gene alleles over time. Based on the study design and definitions, we demonstrated that pigs could have recurrent infections with IAVs that were closely related to each other or IAVs that were clearly distinct. Our findings unraveled a layer of IAV epidemiology and diversity not described previously. Understanding the genetic diversity and dynamics of IAV infections in pigs is crucial to design better health interventions to prevent and control the disease in pigs and to minimize the risk of transmission to people.</p><p id="Par18">To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study that evaluated the complete genome of IAVs during infection of a large population of pigs under field conditions.

Additionally, the plasticity of swine IAVs at the individual level has been documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and supports our findings at the population level. However, we demonstrated that this &#x0201c;swarm&#x0201d; of IAV alleles in pigs could include both, closely related and clearly distinct genetic variants and subtypes. Furthermore, we found that this &#x0201c;swarm&#x0201d; of viruses could change dynamically over time and that the different gene segments could be detected at different proportions during epidemic events. The dynamic diversity of IAV genome over time may play a central role in the appearance of continuous infection and re-infection and should be further investigated to determine the mechanisms that allow one viral population to take over during epidemics.</p><p id="Par19">In this study each epidemic event of infection was dominated by a single VG. Since pigs originated from a single farrow-to-wean source farm we speculate that all viruses originated from the same farm and finding positive pigs at arrival proved that the farrow-to-wean farm was a source of IAVs. However, we cannot rule out lateral introductions of IAVs to the cohort studied from other sources. While VG1 dominated the first epidemic event VG3 dominated the second one. However, we documented that certain gene segments of VG3 were detected earlier than others, and before than complete genomes could be recovered. Furthermore, we found a third VG (VG2) co-circulating with VG1 and VG3 without dominating any of the epidemic events. Surprisingly the complete genome of VG2 was only recovered when the prevalence of IAV infection was low (&#x0003c;4%) at W4 and W10. Interestingly VG2 belongs to the swine H1-beta viruses. The circulation of H1-beta viruses in swine has decreased significantly since the introduction of human IAVs into US swine populations in 2003. Overall, these findings indicate that some IAV alleles, might replicate hidden underneath a dominant cloud of IAV alleles, and can only be recovered when the epidemic event of dominant IAVs have ended and when high throughput genome sequencing technologies are used. We speculate that differential viral fitness of IAV alleles could be determined by virus competition from other co-circulating viruses or gene segments. A recent study in North America illustrated how new genetic lineages of swine IAVs have emerged without being noticed for several years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> while others that were commonly found before (e.g. H1 beta IAVs) now circulate unnoticed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore IAV fitness and even allele viral fitness of swine IAVs should be further investigated because they could determine the dynamics, emergence, and persistence of IAVs in swine populations.</p><p id="Par20">IAVs are considered endemic in swine populations given their commonality and co-circulation of different subtypes. In the Midwestern USA, 90% of pig-production herds (with growing pigs) tested positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and in Europe IAVs are widely distributed in pig farms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, we speculate that the diversity and evolution of swine IAVs might be greatly underestimated or biased towards those genotypes that are over-represented during IAV epidemics or those that are selected during virus isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Our approach to evaluate the complete genome of IAVs directly from the nasal swab samples using NGS technologies provided a greater resolution to characterize IAVs circulating in pigs. This approach could help to understand the mechanisms that allow IAVs to persist at the population level.</p><p id="Par21">The segmented genome of IAV allows two or more viruses to exchange gene segments during infection (genetic reassortment)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> which is an important mechanism of virus diversification and emergence of novel IAV with zoonotic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and pandemic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In pigs, the antigenic genes are swapped between IAVs at different rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> which indicates that IAV reassortment in pigs is not a random event. However, it is unknown whether reassortment is more likely to happen in certain stages of the IAV epidemics. Based on our results, it is possible that if a single VG dominates an epidemic, reassortment might be less likely to happen. However, if two epidemics overlap or co-infections happen when prevalence is low reassortment might be more likely because the proportion of each parental strain could determine reassortment rates. In other species, the frequency of genetic reassortment among IAVs closely related to each other is random<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> while viruses evolving from very distinct genetic lineages are more restrictive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Hence the reassortment rate of IAVs based on the proportion of different VGs should be further investigated. Virus diversification by reassortment has changed the genetic makeup of swine IAVs during the past three decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and allowed the emergence of the first human IAV pandemic of the 21<sup>st</sup> century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Most pigs at weaning have some level of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) to different IAVs because IAVs are commonly found in farrow-to-wean herds. Hence, it is expected that the HA and NA will be under higher immune pressure after weaning compared to other viral gene segments given that HA and NA are the main antigenic proteins of the virus. In our study, the highest genetic diversity within IAV gene segments from the same VG was found for gene segment 7 (matrix) and 8 (non-structural) and not for segments 4 (HA) and 6 (NA). Furthermore, the distance matrix for the percent pairwise sequence identity of all IAV gene segments allowed us to differentiate the same three VGs identified using HA sequences. One previous study showed that all IAV gene segments, and not only HA and NA, present a dynamic distribution during infection of pigs with immunity to different IAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Another study, demonstrated that the substitution rate for HA1 was not different between pigs with or without active immunity to IAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Although, immune selection could depend on the affinity of antibodies to a given virus, IAV antigenic selection due to existing immunity is poorly understood and should be further investigated, especially to understand IAV immune evasion and re-infection in pigs after weaning.</p><p id="Par23">For the purposes of this study we defined recurrent infection when IAV was detected twice in non-consecutive weeks given that duration of influenza infection in pigs lasts a maximum of 5 to 7 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Since only nasal swabs were collected and IAV isolation was not attempted, we cannot rule out the possibility of physical deposition of environmental IAVs rather than infection or re-infection. However, the epidemic events identified indicated that most pigs were indeed infected at least twice. Additionally, most cases of IAV recurrence happened with IAVs containing different antigenic subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) suggesting that pigs were indeed re-infected, which is expected given the antigenic differences between H1 and H3 IAVs. Nevertheless, under our definition of recurrent infection we demonstrated that IAV recurrence could happen with viruses that differ at the HA level in only one or two amino acids. Whether these amino acid differences changed or not the antigenic properties of the virus and were responsible for IAV re-infection needs to be further investigated. One single amino acid difference within HA can change the antigenicity and receptor binding avidity of IAVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

The number of prevalent cases in each epidemic peak at week 2 (W2) and 7 (W7) was not statistically different suggesting that the threshold point at which swine IAV epidemics subside was similar. In our study the transmission pattern for two distinct IAVs (VG1 and VG3) followed the same trend. This information is valuable because if transmission patterns of distinct IAVs are predictable then perhaps there could be similar interventions to prevent them.</p><p id="Par25">We acknowledge the limitations of our study design. Our results might only represent the population of pigs from which the cohort was selected. However, the pig farm selected for this study represented a common commercial wean-to-finish farm in the USA and the epidemiological findings of this study are similar to prior studies in the USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and field reports by veterinarians in the USA. Since there was limited information from the farrow-to-wean herd prior to the start of the study, we cannot rule out that VG2 or VG3 originated from the farrow-to-wean &#x0feff;herd&#x0feff;. Overall, we found VG1 IAVs at the arrival of pigs and proved that pigs at weaning can be the source of IAVs to wean-to-finish farms. Additionally, our random sample selection and large sample size minimized the random error and allowed us to make conclusions at the population level. Moreover, the detection of IAV by RRT-PCR might not represent true infections, as it cannot differentiate the stage of IAV infection or whether replicating virus was present, which needs to be taken into consideration for all data interpretation. Additionally, it is possible that the estimated genetic diversity of IAVs during this study is biased because we only selected a set of positive samples and for certain weeks the proportion of samples sequenced might appear low. However, we sequenced 25% of all positive samples and performed the genome amplification directly from nasal swabs, which avoided genotype selection during virus isolation. The number of samples tested and sequenced in this study is probably the largest in any cohort study done to date in pigs. Finally, prospective cohort studies in pigs could also serve as an excellent animal model to study IAV transmission and evolution in humans, or to test the efficacy of health interventions given the physiological and immunological similarities between humans and pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, the homology between human and swine IAV subtypes, and the similarity on IAV transmission routes among humans and pigs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">In conclusion, we demonstrated the complexity of IAV infections in pigs after weaning under field conditions. We illustrated the dynamic diversity of the IAV genome during infection of pigs and characterized the hypothetical antigenic proteins of the virus&#x000a0;HA and NA.

PCR products were purified using QIAquick Spin Kit (QIAGEN, USA), and eluted in 20&#x02009;&#x003bc;l of DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA). Samples were then submitted to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (UMGC) for library preparation (TruSeq DNA HT sample prep kit, Illumina, USA) and sequenced using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (MiSeq paired end 250 cycles, Illumina, USA).</p><p id="Par32">Sequencing quality control was first verified with FastQC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Then Trimmomatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> was used to trim low quality reads using the pair-end mode of the software. Sequencing assembly was performed using Bowtie2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> and SAMTools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> on a reference template containing 6 IAV internal gene references and 4 antigenic gene references (PB2 (CY099076.1), PB1 (CY099309.1), PA (CY045233.1), NP (CY009919.1), M (DQ150436.1), and NS (CY050162.1), H1 (FJ789832.1), H3 (KC992248.1), N1 (GU236519.1), N2 (KC866483.1)). If more than one IAV genotype was found, then different genome templates, obtained from the samples sequenced, were used to re-map the reads of all samples. The proportion of Illumina reads that were mapped to each IAV template was estimated by gene segment and week. Consensus sequences were established using the most common base at each nucleotide position (lower number of ambiguities) for each IAV gene segment and then trimmed to coding regions. Sequence functionality was verified using the NCBI FLu Annotation web-service (FLAN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Complete functional sequences from this final assembly were used to estimate IAV diversity during the study period. Furthermore, complete genomes were called when the eight complete gene segments were assembled. Mixed IAV infections were defined as samples where two or more complete consensus sequences for the same gene segment were obtained after mapping the Illumina reads to multiple IAV gene templates.</p><p id="Par33">The main antigenic gene segments (HA and NA) were analyzed first and the antigenic subtype determined. Then, HA sequences were used to classify IAV into different viral groups (VG) based on the phylogenetic origins of H1 (gamma 1, gamma 2, delta 1, delta 2, alpha, or beta)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or H3 (clusters I to IV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> subtypes using the web-based tools available at the Influenza Research Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The number of virus variants for each VG was determined, and the persistence of the same VG at the population level was estimated over time. Then, all other gene segments were classified based on the HA designated VGs, and the genome constellation for each sample sequenced was inferred. Additionally, each set of IAV gene sequences (gene segments 1 to 8) was aligned using ClustalW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> and the pairwise distance identity was used to compare the viral diversity across gene segments using heat maps. Sequence assembly and analysis was done using the resources available at the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). Statistical analysis and heat maps were performed using tabular methods and ggplots 2.17.0 in R.</p><p id="Par34">Hypothetical HA and NA proteins were translated and amino acid sequences compared using median-joining network analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. First, all protein sequences were aligned to the most frequent sequence found during the study period using DNA-Alignment (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Germany). Then, polymorphic sites among antigenic proteins were estimated, polymorphic amino acids per site inferred and median-joining networks constructed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Protein networks were drawn and annotated using Network 4.613, Network Publisher (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Germany), and Adobe Illustrator CC 2014 18.1.1 (Adobe Systems Incorporated, USA).</p><p id="Par35">Finally, the patterns of recurrent &#x0feff;IAV detections were compared among those pigs of which we sequenced more than one positive sample during the study period. The percent sequence identity of HA at the nucleotide level was used to estimate virus divergence within pigs over time and the findings compared to the different HA amino acid sequences found during the network analysis for HA proteins.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher's note:</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Change history</bold></p><p>1/16/2020</p><p>
