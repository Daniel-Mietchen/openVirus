  <p>Influenza A virus (IAV) gene constellations distributed by week and sample. The first four columns indicate the week (W0 to W14), number of samples for each genome constellation found, number of complete IAV gene segment recovered per sample, and total number of complete gene sequences obtained. The remaining columns illustrate IAV gene segments assembled based on viral group one (VG1, blue), two (VG2, yellow), and three (VG3, green). White boxes indicate that it was not possible to assemble a complete IAV gene segment.</p>
