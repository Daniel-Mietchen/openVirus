 <caption>
  <p>Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) pairwise sequence identity. Each heat map illustrates the percent sequence identity (ClustalW) among HA (
   <bold>a</bold>) and NA (
   <bold>b</bold>) sequences. The color key and histogram (x axis: percent identity; y axis: count) for each distance matrix is illustrated at the top left of each plot. Pairwise comparisons among virus group one (VG1, H1 gamma), two (VG2, H1 beta) and three (VG3, H3 cluster IV) are highlighted within black boxes. Dendrograms are distance based and do not illustrate the phylogenetic relationships between sequences. The bar side color at the left of each heat map indicates the sampling week (week 0 (W0) to week 14 (W14)) for each sample. The HA and NA pairwise comparison within and between groups is shown at the bottom of each plot.
