  <p>Percent distribution of Illumina sequencing reads for each influenza A virus (IAV) gene segment over time. Each bar represents a sample. Bars are color coded based on the percentage of Illumina sequencing reads (y-axis) mapped to IAV gene segments templates (1 to 8) of viral groups one (VG1), two (VG2) and three (VG3), and are distributed by week (x-axis).</p>
