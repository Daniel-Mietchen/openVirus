 <caption>
  <p>Pairwise sequence identity (ClustalW) among influenza A virus (IAV) internal genes. The color key and histogram (x axis: percent identity; y axis: count) for each distance matrix is illustrated at the top left of each plot. Pairwise comparisons among virus group one (VG1), two (VG2), and three (VG3) are highlighted within black boxes. Dendrograms are distance based and do not illustrate the phylogenetic relationships between sequences. The bar side color at the left of each heat map indicates the sampling week for each sample (week 0 (W0) to week 14 (W14)). The pairwise comparison within and between virus groups is shown at the bottom of each plot.</p>
