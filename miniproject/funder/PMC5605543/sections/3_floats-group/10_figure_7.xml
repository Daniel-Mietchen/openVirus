 <caption>
  <p>Network analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) protein sequences of virus group one (VG1, H1 gamma) and three (VG3, H3 cluster IV). Network plots represent the relationships among HA and NA protein sequences for VG1 (panels a and b) and VG3 (panels c and d). Each node (circles) represents an amino acid sequence variant and its size is proportional to the frequency per node. Red numbers indicate the node number and sequence frequency (n). Nodes are color coded to indicate the week were each sequence variant was found. The distance between nodes is proportional to the number of amino acid differences between sequences (larger distances are indicated as “-//-“to fit the plot) and polymorphic sites between nodes are indicated (position and amino acid variant).</p>
