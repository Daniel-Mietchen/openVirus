  <p>Patterns of influenza A virus (IAV) occurrence and recurrence. Fifty-six hemagglutinin (HA) nucleotide and amino acid sequences obtained from 26 pigs over time (week 0 to week 15) are illustrated based on virus group one (VG1, H1 gamma, blue), two (VG2, H1 beta, yellow), and three (VG3, H3 cluster-IV, green). Three different patterns of IAVs are shown: 1) HA sequences from the same IAV virus group found within a pig in consecutive weeks; 2) HA sequences from the same IAV virus group found within a pig in non-consecutive weeks; and 3) HA sequences from different IAV virus groups found within a pig in consecutive or non-consecutive weeks. White numbers within colored boxes indicate the HA node in which this sequence clustered at the amino acid level as indicated in Fig.Â
