  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. First, all protein sequences were aligned to the most frequent sequence found during the study period using DNA-Alignment (Fluxus Technology Ltd, Germany). Then, polymorphic sites among antigenic proteins were estimated, polymorphic amino acids per site inferred and median-joining networks constructed
