Swabs were refrigerated and transported to the laboratory within 6 hours of collection on the manufacture’s swab transport media. Within 24 hours of collection, swabs were placed into 1.8 ml micro centrifuge tubes with sample storing media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 5% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA containing 10000 IU/ml of penicillin, 10000 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 25 μg /ml of Fungizone), and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V 7.5% solution (Gibco, Life technologies, USA). Once in storage media, swabs were vortexed for 10 seconds and stored at −80 °C until IAV testing.</p>
