 </sup>. A sample was considered positive for IAV if the RRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value was ≤35. The weekly prevalence rate (number of positive cases per week among pigs tested) and the period prevalence (number of pigs testing positive at least once during the 15-week study period) were estimated. The number of prevalent cases was compared between weeks and considered significantly different if the McNemars test p value was lower than 0.05. Additionally, the weekly incidence density (number of newly positive pigs at risk during a week) was estimated. Additionally, we estimated the number of weeks that the same pig tested positive for IAV and for the purposes of this study, we defined “recurrent infection” when IAV was detected in a pig two or more times during non-consecutive weeks.
