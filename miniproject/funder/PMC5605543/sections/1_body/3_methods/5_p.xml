<p id="Par31">A set of 92 RT-PCR positive swabs was selected for PCR amplification and deep genome sequencing. Swab sample selection targeted pigs with 2 or more positive swabs during the study period and the samples with the lowest Ct value because we expected to find in these samples a higher content of viral RNA. At least one positive sample per week was included. IAV genome was amplified directly from the nasal swabs in a single reaction using methods previously described

 </sup>. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from positive swabs using MagMax Viral RNA isolation kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, USA). One step RRT-PCR was performed using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, USA). A 100 μl PCR mix was prepared containing 20 μl DNase/RNase-Free distilled water (Gibco, USA), 50 μl 2x reaction mix, 2 μl SuperScript III RT mix, 2 μl (10 μM) of each primer (MBtuni12(M): ACGCGTGATCAGCRAAAGCAGG and MBtuni13: ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG), and 24 μl of RNA template. Gel electrophoresis was used to verify visually PCR amplicons. PCR products were purified using QIAquick Spin Kit (QIAGEN, USA), and eluted in 20 μl of DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA). Samples were then submitted to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center (UMGC) for library preparation (TruSeq DNA HT sample prep kit, Illumina, USA) and sequenced using next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (MiSeq paired end 250 cycles, Illumina, USA).
