<p id="Par28">A prospective pig cohort study was designed in a wean-to-finish site that receives pigs from a single farrow-to-wean farm. The source farm had history of endemic IAV infection but there was limited information on what viruses may have been in the herd prior to the beginning of the study. In the wean-to-finish site, pigs were raised in eight different barns from weaning (3 weeks of age) to market (24 weeks of age). Barns were filled within a week in three different arrivals and were managed all in/all out. 132 piglets were randomly selected at the first arrival of pigs to one of the barns. A total of 2200 piglets filled the barn and the selected cohort of pigs was maintained comingled with the other pigs in the barn (as distributed by the pig farmer after arrival). Sample size was estimated to be 95% confident to detect at least one IAV positive pig if the prevalence of infection was 2.5% or higher. Pigs were selected randomly by assigning a random number to all pigs in the first arrival and choosing those 132 pigs with the lowest random number assigned.</p>
