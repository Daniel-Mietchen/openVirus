<p id="Par33">The main antigenic gene segments (HA and NA) were analyzed first and the antigenic subtype determined. Then, HA sequences were used to classify IAV into different viral groups (VG) based on the phylogenetic origins of H1 (gamma 1, gamma 2, delta 1, delta 2, alpha, or beta)

 </sup>. The number of virus variants for each VG was determined, and the persistence of the same VG at the population level was estimated over time. Then, all other gene segments were classified based on the HA designated VGs, and the genome constellation for each sample sequenced was inferred. Additionally, each set of IAV gene sequences (gene segments 1 to 8) was aligned using ClustalW

 </sup> and the pairwise distance identity was used to compare the viral diversity across gene segments using heat maps. Sequence assembly and analysis was done using the resources available at the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute (MSI). Statistical analysis and heat maps were performed using tabular methods and ggplots 2.17.0 in R.
