 </sup> on a reference template containing 6 IAV internal gene references and 4 antigenic gene references (PB2 (CY099076.1), PB1 (CY099309.1), PA (CY045233.1), NP (CY009919.1), M (DQ150436.1), and NS (CY050162.1), H1 (FJ789832.1), H3 (KC992248.1), N1 (GU236519.1), N2 (KC866483.1)). If more than one IAV genotype was found, then different genome templates, obtained from the samples sequenced, were used to re-map the reads of all samples. The proportion of Illumina reads that were mapped to each IAV template was estimated by gene segment and week. Consensus sequences were established using the most common base at each nucleotide position (lower number of ambiguities) for each IAV gene segment and then trimmed to coding regions. Sequence functionality was verified using the NCBI FLu Annotation web-service (FLAN)

 </sup>. Complete functional sequences from this final assembly were used to estimate IAV diversity during the study period. Furthermore, complete genomes were called when the eight complete gene segments were assembled. Mixed IAV infections were defined as samples where two or more complete consensus sequences for the same gene segment were obtained after mapping the Illumina reads to multiple IAV gene templates.
