 </sup>, which illustrates the high turnover rate of swine populations. The majority of these pigs are weaned at 3 weeks of age from farrow-to-wean herds and moved to growing pig production sites (i.e wean to finish farms) where they are reared until market (~24 weeks of age). Additionally, pig farms can be managed as continuous or all-in/all-out flows. In a continuous flow, pig batches are moved in and out of production sites on a continuous basis with pigs present on-site all the time. In contrast, in all-in/all-out flows, a batch of pigs is used to fill the production site and no more pigs are added until all pigs from the previous batch are removed. Since production flows and sites might influence the evolution of swine IAVs it is crucial to study the dynamics of the virus at the herd level.
