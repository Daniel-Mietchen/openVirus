<p id="Par3">IAVs are Orthomyxoviruses that contain eight single stranded negative sense RNA gene segments namely polymerase B2 (PB2, segment 1), polymerase B1 (PB1, segment 2), polymerase A (PA, segment 3), hemagglutinin (HA, segment 4), nucleoprotein (NP, segment 5), neuraminidase (NA, segment 6), matrix (M, segment 7), and non-structural protein (NS, segment 8). The main antigenic proteins (HA and NA) are used in a dual classification system to differentiate viruses into seventeen HAs (H1-H17) and nine NAs (N1-N9)
