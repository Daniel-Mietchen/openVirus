<p id="Par6">We hypothesize that the persistence of swine IAVs in pigs after weaning is associated to the plasticity of IAV genome and the continuous influx of infected and susceptible individuals. Therefore, we designed a prospective cohort study and used next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the complete genome of the IAV population during natural infection of pigs after weaning. We found that three different influenza viral groups (VG) co-circulated at different proportions over time and produced two overlapping epidemic events in which the majority of the pigs had recurrent infections ﻿with﻿ IAV. These results are important because they unraveled a deeper layer of the epidemiology and molecular diversity of swine IAVs at the herd level and will help to design better health interventions to reduce the transmission of IAVs between pigs and from pigs to humans.</p>
