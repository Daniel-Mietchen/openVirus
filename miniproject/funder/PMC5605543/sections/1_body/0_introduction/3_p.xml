 </sup>. During infection of pigs or humans the IAV genome replicates as a dynamic “swarm” of genotypes closely related to each other

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, different IAV subtypes can coexist in pig populations, and the same IAV subtype can persist for prolonged periods of time

 </sup>. In the USA H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 IAVs are endemic in pigs and cluster in six H1 clades (α, β, γ1, γ2, δ1, and δ2) and four H3 clusters (I, II, III and IV)
