<p id="Par17">To understand the persistence of IAVs in pigs we designed a prospective cohort study and followed 132 3-week old weaned pigs for 15 weeks. Using intensive sampling events and deep genome sequencing we were able to characterize with high resolution the epidemiological patterns of IAV infection, and the genetic and antigenic diversity of the viral population during infection of pigs. Strikingly we found the occurrence of two contiguous epidemic events of infection within a short period of time in which three different viral populations (viral groups) coexisted as a dynamic “swarm” of IAV gene alleles over time. Based on the study design and definitions, we demonstrated that pigs could have recurrent infections with IAVs that were closely related to each other or IAVs that were clearly distinct. Our findings unraveled a layer of IAV epidemiology and diversity not described previously. Understanding the genetic diversity and dynamics of IAV infections in pigs is crucial to design better health interventions to prevent and control the disease in pigs and to minimize the risk of transmission to people.</p>
