<p id="Par26">In conclusion, we demonstrated the complexity of IAV infections in pigs after weaning under field conditions. We illustrated the dynamic diversity of the IAV genome during infection of pigs and characterized the hypothetical antigenic proteins of the virusÂ HA and NA. We showed that the prolonged persistence of IAVs in pigs could be the result of multiple IAV epidemic events that take place repeatedly over time or the re-infection with IAVs that are closely related to each other. These findings are important to control IAVs in pigs and to better understand virus diversity and emergence of IAVs in endemically infected swine populations.</p>
