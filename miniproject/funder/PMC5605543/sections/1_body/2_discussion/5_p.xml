 </sup> which indicates that IAV reassortment in pigs is not a random event. However, it is unknown whether reassortment is more likely to happen in certain stages of the IAV epidemics. Based on our results, it is possible that if a single VG dominates an epidemic, reassortment might be less likely to happen. However, if two epidemics overlap or co-infections happen when prevalence is low reassortment might be more likely because the proportion of each parental strain could determine reassortment rates. In other species, the frequency of genetic reassortment among IAVs closely related to each other is random

 </sup>. Hence the reassortment rate of IAVs based on the proportion of different VGs should be further investigated. Virus diversification by reassortment has changed the genetic makeup of swine IAVs during the past three decades
