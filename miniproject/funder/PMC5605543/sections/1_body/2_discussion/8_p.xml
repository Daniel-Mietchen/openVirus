<p id="Par24">This study also provides information on epidemiological findings relevant to what happens during IAV outbreaks in large swine populations. The number of prevalent cases in each epidemic peak at week 2 (W2) and 7 (W7) was not statistically different suggesting that the threshold point at which swine IAV epidemics subside was similar. In our study the transmission pattern for two distinct IAVs (VG1 and VG3) followed the same trend. This information is valuable because if transmission patterns of distinct IAVs are predictable then perhaps there could be similar interventions to prevent them.</p>
