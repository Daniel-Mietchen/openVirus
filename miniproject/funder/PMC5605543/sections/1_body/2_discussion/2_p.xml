<p id="Par18">To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study that evaluated the complete genome of IAVs during infection of a large population of pigs under field conditions. RNA viruses have higher mutation rates compared to many other microorganisms in nature

 </sup> and supports our findings at the population level. However, we demonstrated that this “swarm” of IAV alleles in pigs could include both, closely related and clearly distinct genetic variants and subtypes. Furthermore, we found that this “swarm” of viruses could change dynamically over time and that the different gene segments could be detected at different proportions during epidemic events. The dynamic diversity of IAV genome over time may play a central role in the appearance of continuous infection and re-infection and should be further investigated to determine the mechanisms that allow one viral population to take over during epidemics.
