<p id="Par22">Most pigs at weaning have some level of maternally derived antibodies (MDA) to different IAVs because IAVs are commonly found in farrow-to-wean herds. Hence, it is expected that the HA and NA will be under higher immune pressure after weaning compared to other viral gene segments given that HA and NA are the main antigenic proteins of the virus. In our study, the highest genetic diversity within IAV gene segments from the same VG was found for gene segment 7 (matrix) and 8 (non-structural) and not for segments 4 (HA) and 6 (NA). Furthermore, the distance matrix for the percent pairwise sequence identity of all IAV gene segments allowed us to differentiate the same three VGs identified using HA sequences. One previous study showed that all IAV gene segments, and not only HA and NA, present a dynamic distribution during infection of pigs with immunity to different IAVs
