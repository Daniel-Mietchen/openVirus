<p id="Par19">In this study each epidemic event of infection was dominated by a single VG. Since pigs originated from a single farrow-to-wean source farm we speculate that all viruses originated from the same farm and finding positive pigs at arrival proved that the farrow-to-wean farm was a source of IAVs. However, we cannot rule out lateral introductions of IAVs to the cohort studied from other sources. While VG1 dominated the first epidemic event VG3 dominated the second one. However, we documented that certain gene segments of VG3 were detected earlier than others, and before than complete genomes could be recovered. Furthermore, we found a third VG (VG2) co-circulating with VG1 and VG3 without dominating any of the epidemic events. Surprisingly the complete genome of VG2 was only recovered when the prevalence of IAV infection was low (&lt;4%) at W4 and W10. Interestingly VG2 belongs to the swine H1-beta viruses. The circulation of H1-beta viruses in swine has decreased significantly since the introduction of human IAVs into US swine populations in 2003. Overall, these findings indicate that some IAV alleles, might replicate hidden underneath a dominant cloud of IAV alleles, and can only be recovered when the epidemic event of dominant IAVs have ended and when high throughput genome sequencing technologies are used. We speculate that differential viral fitness of IAV alleles could be determined by virus competition from other co-circulating viruses or gene segments. A recent study in North America illustrated how new genetic lineages of swine IAVs have emerged without being noticed for several years
