<p id="Par23">For the purposes of this study we defined recurrent infection when IAV was detected twice in non-consecutive weeks given that duration of influenza infection in pigs lasts a maximum of 5 to 7 days

 </sup>. Since only nasal swabs were collected and IAV isolation was not attempted, we cannot rule out the possibility of physical deposition of environmental IAVs rather than infection or re-infection. However, the epidemic events identified indicated that most pigs were indeed infected at least twice. Additionally, most cases of IAV recurrence happened with IAVs containing different antigenic subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) suggesting that pigs were indeed re-infected, which is expected given the antigenic differences between H1 and H3 IAVs. Nevertheless, under our definition of recurrent infection we demonstrated that IAV recurrence could happen with viruses that differ at the HA level in only one or two amino acids. Whether these amino acid differences changed or not the antigenic properties of the virus and were responsible for IAV re-infection needs to be further investigated. One single amino acid difference within HA can change the antigenicity and receptor binding avidity of IAVs
