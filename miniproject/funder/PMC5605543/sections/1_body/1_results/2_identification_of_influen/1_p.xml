<p id="Par9">Ninety-two out of 369 positive swabs (25%) were selected for IAV genome amplification and deep genome sequencing using Illumina MiSeq as the next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. After the first template-assembly, three different influenza A virus groups (VG) were identified (VG1, VG2, and VG3). At the HA level VG1, VG2, and VG3 clustered within swine H1-gamma, H1-beta and H3-cluster-IV IAVs respectively. At the NA level, VG1 and VG2 were N1 viruses while VG3 were N2 viruses. The pairwise percent identity (ClustalW) between the consensus sequences of all gene segments of three representative samples (n = 24) of these three VGs is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. These 24 templates were used to re-assemble all samples sequenced.
