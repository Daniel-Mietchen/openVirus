<p id="Par10">After quality control, nine samples (10.8%) yielded only partial IAV gene contigs and were excluded from the analysis. From the remaining samples (n = 83), 13,559,009 Illumina sequencing reads were successfully mapped to the reference templates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Overall, the majority of Illumina reads obtained from the first epidemic event of IAV infection mapped to the reference templates of VG1 (H1 gamma virus) while the majority of reads obtained after week 6 mapped to the reference templates of VG3 (H3 cluster IV virus). However, in most weeks we detected reads that mapped to at least two different VGs. Illumina reads mapping to the reference templates of VG2 only predominated in samples sequenced in W4 and W14 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Overall, the sequencing assembling process yielded 649 complete IAV genes that were classified as VG1, VG2 or VG3 based on the sequence template mapped (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and had a mean coverage per position that ranged between 184X and 14,746X (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) (GenBank accession numbers MF919672 - MF920318. There were no complete IAV gene segments obtained from W9 to W13 and W15.
