<p id="Par11">Thirteen distinct IAV genome constellations were recovered and demonstrated co-circulation (at the population level) and co-infection (at the individual level) of three clearly distinct VGs over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Complete IAV gene segments from a single VG were recovered at W0, W3 and W5, from two different VGs at W1, W4 and W8, and from all three VGs at W2, W6 and W7. Additionally, 68 samples (81.9%) contained complete gene segments from a single VG and 15 (18.1%) contained complete gene segments from more than one VG (VG1 and VG2, n = 2; VG1 and VG3, n = 11; and VG1, VG2, and VG3, n = 2). Furthermore, six samples contained more than one antigenic subtype (H1 gamma and H1 beta, n = 1; H1 gamma and H3 cluster IV, n = 2; and N1 and N2, n = 5).
