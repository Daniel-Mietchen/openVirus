<p id="Par12">Out of all complete IAV gene segments obtained (n = 649), 78 (12%) and 83 (12.7%) were HA and NA sequences, respectively. The HA and NA pairwise sequence identity is illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. HA VG1 (subtype H1 gamma) sequences (n = 48) were obtained between W0 and W7 and their percent sequence identity ranged between 98.2 and 100%. In contrast, HA VG2 (subtype H1 beta) sequences (n = 2) were only obtained at W4 and W14 and were 100% identical. Additionally, HA VG3 (subtype H3 cluster-IV) sequences (n = 28) were obtained only between W6 and W8 and their percent sequence identity ranged between 99.9% and 100%. Moreover, NA sequences (n = 83) included 50 sequences from VG1 (subtype N1), two from VG2 (subtype N1) and 31 from VG3 (subtype N2). NA sequences from VG1 were found between W0 and W7 while NA sequences from VG3 were assembled only at W1, W6, W7 and W8. The pairwise percent identity among NA sequences ranged between 99.6% and 100% for VG1 and between 98.8% and 100% for VG3. In contrast, NA sequences from VG2 (n = 2) were only assembled from W4 and W14 and were 100% identical. All sequences of each internal gene segment (genes 1,2,3,5,7 and 8) were aligned using ClustalW and also showed a clear distinction between VG1, VG2, and VG3 (Fig.
