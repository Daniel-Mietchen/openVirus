<p id="Par8">One hundred and sixteen pigs (87.9%) tested positive to IAV more than once (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and 103 pigs (78%) had recurrent infections based on the study definition for recurrence (testing IAV positive in two non-consecutive weeks). There were two overlapping epidemic events of IAV infection during the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) with no statistical difference between the number of prevalent cases at the epidemic peaks in W2 and W7 (p = 0.24). During the 15-week period, the weekly prevalence of IAV infection ranged between 0% and 65.2% and the incidence density of IAV infection of pigs after weaning ranged between 0 and 71 cases per 100 pig-week (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
