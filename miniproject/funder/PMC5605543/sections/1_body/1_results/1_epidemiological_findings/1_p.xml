<p id="Par7">One hundred and thirty-two 3-week old pigs were randomly selected and identified from a group of weaned pigs (N = 2200) at arrival (week 0 (W0)) to a commercial wean-to-finish-farm. Pigs were weaned from a single IAV positive farrow-to-wean farm, kept together with the remaining pigs in the batch, and sampled weekly for 15 weeks (W1 to W15). Five pigs (3.4%) died at weeks 3, 7, 8, 11 and 14 and their cause of death was not determined. A total of 2,080 individual nasal swabs were collected over 15 weeks, and 369 (17.7%) tested positive for IAV by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR). At weaning (W0), 27 pigs (20.5%) tested IAV positive by RRT- PCR and the 15-week period prevalence of IAVs infection was 98.4% (n = 130). Only two pigs (1.6%) tested IAV negative throughout the study period, although one of them died in W3.</p>
