<p id="Par16">Complete HA sequences representing VG1 and VG3 were assembled from pig 41 at W6 and W7 respectively, and therefore animal 41 had also a recurrent IAV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Most IAV recurrence (19 out of 24, 79.2%) happened with IAVs from different VGs (VG1 and VG3, n = 18; and VG1 and VG2, n = 1). However, five pigs (20.8%) had recurrent infections with VG1 IAVs. In these recurrent cases the percent of sequence identity within pig ranged between 99.6 and 99.9% and HA proteins between sampling events had at least one amino acid difference (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).
