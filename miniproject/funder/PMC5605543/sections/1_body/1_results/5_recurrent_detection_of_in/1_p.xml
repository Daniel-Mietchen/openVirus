<p id="Par15">To understand IAV occurrence and recurrence in pigs after weaning we compared the nucleotide and amino acid HA sequences of those samples sequenced from the same pig over time. For the purpose of this study, we defined occurrence as the detection of IAVs in a pig by RT-PCR in one or more consecutive weeks and recurrence as the detection of IAV in two or more non-consecutive weeks. Fifty-six samples collected from 26 pigs were used for this analysis (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Five out of these 26 pigs (19.2%) had IAVs from the same VG (VG1 or VG3) in consecutive weeks and the HA pairwise nucleotide sequence identity within pig ranged between 98.2% and 100%. Additionally, 23 out of these 26 pigs (88.5%) tested PCR positive twice in non-consecutive weeks meeting our definition of recurrent infection.
