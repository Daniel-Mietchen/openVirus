<p id="Par13">The hypothetical HA and NA proteins for VG1 and VG3 were translated to deduce the polymorphic amino acid sites within viral groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). For VG2, the two HA and NA sequences identified at week four and 10 were 100% identical; thus, no further protein sequence analysis was performed. At W0 we only identified one VG1 HA variant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, node 1). However, there were eight additional VG1 HA variants recovered during the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>, nodes 2 to 9). The majority of VG1 HA sequences (n = 36) corresponded to two specific amino acid variants (T287A) that are illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> as node 1 (n = 21) and 2 (n = 15). The additional HA variants from VG1 differed in one to nine amino acids and were not found for more than 2 consecutive weeks. Additionally, nine VG1 NA variants were also identified. However, only two VG1 NA variants were recovered from more than two consecutive weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>, node 1 and 8).
