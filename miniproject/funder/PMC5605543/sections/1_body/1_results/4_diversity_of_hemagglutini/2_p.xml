<p id="Par14">In addition, four VG3 HA variants were identified (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>) during the study period. The first and most common VG3 HA variant was first recovered at W6 and persisted until W8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> node 1). The other three VG3 HA variants were only identified once during W7 and W8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>, nodes 2 and 3). Moreover, the first NA protein from VG3 was identified at W1 and was not recovered again throughout the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>, node 1). The most frequent VG3 NA variant was first identified at W6 and proceeded for two additional weeks while the remaining two variants were found only at W7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>).
