<p>Furthermore, pandemic influenza and seasonal influenza are undoubtedly linked, in ways also yet unascertained. Examining past influenza pandemics throughout history, it has been observed that strains of pandemic influenza also led to succeeding seasonal waves, albeit with decidedly different patterns. For example, while the 1889–1893 pandemic made three or more successive annual and largely seasonal reappearances, the 1918 pandemic spread in two or three rapidly recurring waves within a short period of time in many parts of the world (e.g., [

On the other hand, the virus strains causing the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) influenza pandemics, unlike their 1918 H1N1 virus predecessor, did not immediately produce rapidly successive waves of infections or multiple annual recurrences of high mortality, but settled more quickly into familiar patterns of annual seasonal endemic circulation [
