<p>There are 3 main types of circulating influenza viruses in the world: A, B, and C. Influenza viruses (of the family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses with segmented genomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of its two genera, one includes influenza A and B viruses, and the other influenza C virus. Type A influenza viruses are subtyped based on 16 known hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) subtypes that exist in wild birds and provide a source of viral HA and NA subtypes antigenically novel to humans. The subtypes are further classified according to the combinations of virus surface proteins, abbreviated as H1–H16 and N1–N9 [

 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], starting with the 1918 swine H1N1 influenza which led to the 1918–1920 influenza pandemic. Its descendants include an H2N2 pandemic strain in 1957, which circulated until 1968 when it was replaced by H3N2 pandemic viruses. Among many subtypes of influenza A viruses (IAV), influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes are currently circulating yearly among humans. Type C influenza cases occur much less frequently than that of A and B. Therefore, only influenza A and B viruses are included in seasonal influenza vaccines recommended every year by the WHO.
