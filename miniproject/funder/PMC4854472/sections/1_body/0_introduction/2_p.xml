<p>Seasonal influenza typically occurs with annual regularity in temperate regions in autumn and winter, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere from October to March and in the Southern Hemisphere from April to September. However, influenza cases are reported almost year-round in tropical regions. Taiwan is located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, split north-south near the middle of the island by the Tropic of Cancer. Influenza cases are reported throughout the year with some summer influenza epidemics, but with peak number of reported cases occurring annually in autumn and winter from late October to March [

Moreover, past studies on sequence comparison of seasonal influenza strains A(H1N1) in Taiwan versus vaccine strains have showed that many vaccine-like Taiwanese strains in 1995–2003 were circulating at least 2 years before the vaccine strains were introduced [
