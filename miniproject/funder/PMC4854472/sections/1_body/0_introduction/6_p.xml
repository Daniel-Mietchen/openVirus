<p>In this work, we will focus on circulating influenza strains for influenza epidemics that have occurred in Taiwan shortly before and after the 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, namely between 2008â€“2014, by using Taiwan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (TCDC) Influenza Surveillance Data on laboratory-confirmed circulating strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aim is to use mathematical modeling to pinpoint the temporal circulation and/or co-circulation of different strains in order to gauge the difference in their transmissibility, if any, and how they interact or compete for the human host population, with hope to provide some insights on how the 2009 pandemic impacts the circulation of seasonal influenza in the years following the pandemic.
