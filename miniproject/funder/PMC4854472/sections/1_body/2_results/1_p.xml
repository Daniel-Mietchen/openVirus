<p>We fit the weekly TCDC lab-confirmed case data by strain to the Richards model to pinpoint waves of circulating influenza strains in Taiwan during 2008â€“2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The list of waves that are found to be statistically significant for each set of the influenza subtype data, along with the estimated turning point and effective reproduction number R with 95% confidence intervals (CI) obtained for each wave, are given in chronological order in 
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. For computation of the reproduction number, we use a generation time of T = 1.9/7 (95% CI: 1.30/7~2.71/7) which was obtained for the 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] since the 2009 pH1N1 virus was found to be not significantly different from seasonal influenza in its transmissibility, although longer generation time has also been reported (see, e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Note that the 95% CIs for r and t
 <sub>i</sub>, taken from SAS output, are measures of uncertainty for the nonlinear least-squared estimation, while the 95% CI for R
 <sub>0</sub> is computed, via the variances of r, also given in SAS output, and of T.
