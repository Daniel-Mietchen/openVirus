<p>To further elucidate the temporally varying nature of the waves of circulating influenza strains, we illustrate the timeline of the waves in

To illustrate the temporal changes in transmissibility of the strains, we provide the reproduction numbers of circulating influenza strains in timelines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g004">Fig 4</xref> provides the percentage of each influenza strain among all lab-confirmed positive tests reported to Taiwan CDC by the contracted laboratories each week, which brings to light the dominating strain(s) during any time period.
