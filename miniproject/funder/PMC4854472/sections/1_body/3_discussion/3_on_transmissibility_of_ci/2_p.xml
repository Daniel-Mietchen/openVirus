<p>The estimates for R are consistently within range of other estimates for seasonal influenza in tropical-subtropical (e.g., Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]) and temperate regions (e.g., the United States and France [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). However, the estimate of R during 2009 pandemic period is lower than that of many studies from other countries (see, e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), but it is more similar to estimates obtained for Southern Hemisphere countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa) [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as for Taiwan [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and for Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All of these countries and territory have most of its territory in the tropical-subtropical region, which might be an indication of regional differences in transmissibility of influenza virus that exists only for pandemic influenza.
