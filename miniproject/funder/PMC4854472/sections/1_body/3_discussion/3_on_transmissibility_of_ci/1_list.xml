  <p>Interestingly, while the estimated per capita weekly growth rates of cumulative case number seem to be lower for most of the influenza B waves (0.06~0.26; range of 95% CIs: 0.05~0.32) when compared to those of influenza A, the wave of influenza B from week 8 to week 38 of 2010 immediately following the fall/winter wave of 2009 A(H1N1) pdm09 was substantially higher (at 0.89; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.28), in fact highest among all the waves detected in this study.</p>

  <p>Although the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus caused significant increase in prevalence in Taiwan in 2009–2010 and for several years after, its transmissibility, as quantified by its reproduction number R, was relatively low when compared with past pandemics and actually not significantly greater than seasonal influenza virus strains in other years [

   <xref rid="pone.0154695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This observation corroborates previous studies reported in literature on the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic in other countries (e.g., [

  <p>Most of the waves yielded reproduction number R between 1.0–1.2. Only two waves resulted in R great than 1.2; AH1 during weeks 1–6 2008 and B during weeks 8–38 2010 (
   <xref rid="pone.0154695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Both waves exhibit wider 95% CI range, indicating greater uncertainty in model fit. We note that the former wave (AH1 in 2008) was in fact part of a wave that started in late 2007 (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g001">Fig 1a</xref>) which likely affected the fitting, and the latter wave (B in 2010) was occurring in the summer after the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic and co-circulating with a smaller wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The three waves with R between 1.1–1.2 occurred during and shortly after the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic, all co-circulated with other strain, and also exhibited wide 95% CI range.

  <p>Co-circulation of AH3 viruses with other strains is also of interest, in particular the circulation of AH3 virus almost in synchrony during the first (summer) wave of A(H1N1)pdm0 in July-September of 2009 (weeks 28–41, see 
   <xref rid="pone.0154695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and two waves of H3N2 from 2013 to early 2014 that co-circulated with both B and A(H1N1)pdm09.

  <p>Another event that might have affected the transmissibility we observed was the mass immunization program initiated in Taiwan in late 2009 where more than five million of the 23 million Taiwanese were immunized with AdimFlu-S (unadjuvanted H1N1v from Adimmune) or Focetria
   <sup>®</sup> (MF59
   <sup>®</sup> adjuvanted H1N1v from Novartis) within five months [

   <xref rid="pone.0154695.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Perhaps also indicative of the impact of herd immunity, the transmissibility of 2009 autumn/winter wave of pH1N1 was lower than that of the previous summer wave. Similarly in 2010, when R for the autumn/winter wave (when mass immunization program was again in place) was again lower than that of earlier summer wave. It is also interesting to note that the summer waves in 2009 and 2010 had almost identical transmissibility (R = 1.17 with very similar 95% CI ranges, 
   <xref rid="pone.0154695.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) while R for autumn/winter waves in 2009 and 2010 were also comparable (1.02 in 2009 and 1.05 in 2010).
