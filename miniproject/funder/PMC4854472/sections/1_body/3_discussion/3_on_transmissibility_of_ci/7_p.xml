<p>In summary, our modeling study, using available government influenza subtyping data from routine influenza surveillance system, yields qualitative results on comparing circulation of different influenza strains which may shed some lights on the possible interaction between circulating influenza strains, in particular during and after a pandemic. There are many questions regarding the temporal patterns of circulation of influenza strains, in particular during and after a pandemic, and the 2009 pandemic offers us a great opportunity to learn, even with these hard to ignore biases in the subtype data. More importantly, it demonstrate the possibility that, with potential future advances in laboratory subtyping techniques that would enable us to be more easily accessible to more comprehensive information on the circulating influenza strains in a population, one can more readily ascertain the relationship, if any, between the evolution of influenza strains quantitatively such as we do in this study.</p>
