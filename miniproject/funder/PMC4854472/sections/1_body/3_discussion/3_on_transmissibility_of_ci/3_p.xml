<p>A study found that the hemagglutinin (HA) genetic and antigenic relatedness between H3N2 viruses circulating at the end of 2010 in Ontario, Canada, and A/Perth/16/2009 was likely the H3N2 component of the 2010–2011 [

This co-circulation of variants distinguished by specific AA substitutions was witnessed among H3N2 strains observed in Ontario, which are found to be related to the Victoria clade by using phylogenetic analysis. Due to the emergence of the Victoria 208 clade of A/Perth/16/2009 strain, WHO recommended a change to the H3N2 strain component of the 2012–2013 influenza vaccine, to A/Victoria/361/2011-like virus [

In this study, we present quantitative evidence of different values of R for different epidemic waves of the same influenza subtype (
