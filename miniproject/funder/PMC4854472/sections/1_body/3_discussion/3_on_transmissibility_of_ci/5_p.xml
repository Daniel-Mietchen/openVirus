<p>This data issue is even more glaring during summers, when there are typically less clinical cases and hence less number of samples being collected for laboratory testing. During the second half of 2012, no significant wave can be detected via the Richards model. However, we note that most of the samples tested during that time was determined to be H3N2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0154695.g004">Fig 4b</xref>), although the typically low weekly number of samples being tested during summer, due to more mild and subclinical cases in summers, became an obstacle for good model fitting. Nevertheless, the study, designed to qualitatively compare the temporal patterns and transmissibility of the waves of different strains, illustrates how influenza subtyping data can be utilized to explore the mechanism for various influenza strains to compete or to circulate, despite obvious data limitations.
