<p>The study contains several obvious limitations, the foremost being the scarcity and incompleteness of full virology data. The data used came from TCDC influenza surveillance system data, where the samples were collected from patients with ILI from 255 contracted healthcare facilities and laboratories in Taiwan, which is not a random sampling of influenza cases in Taiwan. Unfortunately, the proportion of ILI cases tested is not known, and the proportion of positive tests varies from year to year (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0154695.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the subtype-specific proportion of positive tests is not available from Taiwan CDC database. Hence we are unable to suitably adjust for the differences in the sampling rate, which results in unavoidable bias. This common but severe limitation in virology data size leads to uncertainty in our result. Since the proportion of asymptomatic cases might also be affected by specific subtype, this issue can only be satisfactorily resolved with comprehensive serotesting on the population level, which is not feasible given the limitation in laboratory testing today.
