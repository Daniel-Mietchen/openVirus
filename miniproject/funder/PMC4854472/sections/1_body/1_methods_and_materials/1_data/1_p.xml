<p>The laboratory confirmed influenza surveillance data used in this study was obtained from TCDC weekly Influenza Express, which is publicly available from TCDC website [

Unavoidably, the number of samples taken varies greatly in time due to temporal changes in disease surveillance, in particular during a pandemic. For example, substantially larger number of samples was taken in the fall influenza season in 2009, and subsequently during similar seasons in 2010 and 2011, in an effort to ascertain the impact of A(H1N1)pdm09 infections in Taiwan inn post-pandemic years. These samples were tested for virus subtype with RT-PCR or virus isolation, and with HA or NA genes of the isolated virus sequenced. The samples were determined to be one of the five influenza virus strain: B, AH1, A(H1N1)pdm09, AH3, and H3N2, with A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated only after week 26 of 2009 and H3N2 only after week 33 of 2011.
