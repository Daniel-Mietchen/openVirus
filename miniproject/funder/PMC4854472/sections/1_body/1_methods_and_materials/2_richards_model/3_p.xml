<p>The basic reproduction number R
 <sub>0</sub> for the Richards model is 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>exp</italic>(
 <italic>rT</italic>), where 
 <italic>T</italic> is the generation time or the average time period from onset of one individual to the onset of his/her contacts. Mathematically, given a growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic>, this formula provides an upper bound for the basic reproduction number over all assumed distributions of the generation time T [

 <sub>0</sub>, since all circulating influenza strains are descendants of some previously circulating virus and hence some level of pre-immunity in the population is already in place [
