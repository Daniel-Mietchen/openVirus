<p>HFRS is epidemic in many provinces in mainland China, and it is worth noting that the prevalence is on the rise in the large and medium-sized cities, such as Guangzhou. Transmission of hantaviruses from rodents to humans is believed to occur through inhalation of aerosols contaminated by virus shed in excreta, saliva, and urine of infected animals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The number of HFRS cases is influenced by the density and hantavirus infection rate of host rodents, as well as the contact rate between rodents and human beings [

Meteorological factors may influence the incidence of HFRS via affecting infection rates and population dynamics of hosts, the regeneration of mites, and the contact rate between rodents and human beings. Vector-borne viral diseases including HFRS are amongst the most sensitive of all diseases to climate change [
