<p>The results of this study show that there is a 1 month lagged effect of average temperature to the incidence of HFRS. The lag would capture the period of rodents growth, virus development time within the rodents and the virus incubation period within the human body [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This lead time is of practical importance in predicting epidemics of HFRS and giving health authorities sufficient time to formulate plans, disseminate warnings, and implement public health interventions, such as vaccinating high-risk populations, killing the rodent hosts, and managing environments for the prevention and control of the disease (Ministry of Health 1998) [

While the lag effects for associations of the climatic variables were inconsistent, for example the study of Elunchun and Molidawahaner showed that land surface temperature, rainfall and relative humidity were significantly correlated with the monthly reports of HFRS with lags of 3–5 months [
