<p>The present study is first to investigate the effect of meteorological factors on HFRS incidence in southern China, to the best of our knowledge. However, some limitations should be noted when interpreting findings from this study. Firstly, the study design was an ecological study; it did not allow us to explore individual-based association and limited the capacity for causal inference. Secondly, the occurrence of HFRS cases in each region may not be caused by climate alone. Other factors such as human activities and movement, socioeconomics status, land use and population immunity may contribute to the transmission of HFRS. However, data are limited on many of these variables. Thus we could not exclude these potential confounding factors. Therefore, further studies of the associations between meteorological factors and occurrence of HFRS are warranted.</p>
