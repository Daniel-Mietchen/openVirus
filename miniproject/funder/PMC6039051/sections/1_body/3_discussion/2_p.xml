<p>The results of this study show that average temperature was negatively associated with the incidence of HFRS, which is in agreement with the results at Shandong [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, inconsistent findings have also been reported in other studies. The results of a study in Junan County showed that extremes of weather (too cold or too hot) do not favor HFRS prevalence, and the most appropriate mean temperature was between 10°C and 25°C [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Lin et al. applied a generalized additive model to examine the effect of meteorological factors on the occurrence of HFRS in Jiaonan county, China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. They found that a daily mean temperature at about 17°C was associated with highest HFRS occurrence, a positive association between temperature and HFRS occurrence was observed when the daily mean temperature was below 17°C, while when the daily mean temperature was higher than 17°C, an inverse association was observed. Temperature could affect the breeding and survival of rodents as well as infectivity of hantavirus; it could also affect the activities of both rodents and the human population. In cooler climates, warmer temperatures may allow reservoirs to survive more easily in winters that normally would have limited their populations and to cause rodents to reach maturity much faster than lower temperatures [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The discrepancy might be due to the difference in the characteristics of climate of the study regions and different models applied in the studies. In Guangzhou, the mean temperature is 22.11°C, which is close to the highest suitable temperature for outside activities of both rats and human (25°C), so in this area, when the temperature increases further, there is less interaction between rodents and humans, leading to the decrease of the disease.
