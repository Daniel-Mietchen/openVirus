<p>The epidemiological characteristics of HFRS are affected by various factors, including meteorological factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], rodent density [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Meteorological factors may influence the incidence of HFRS via affecting infection rates and population dynamics of hosts, the regeneration of mites, and the contact rate between rodents and human beings. Infection rates and population dynamics of hosts are thought to be influenced by climatic factors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, a longitudinal study in Qingdao, China found that precipitation and relative humidity were positively correlated to the densities of hosts and/or hantavirus-positive hosts and the densities of hosts or hantavirus positive hosts were positively correlated to the incidence of HFRS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The data were quite consistent with other reports [
