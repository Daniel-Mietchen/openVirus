<p>Although several studies have explored the associations between meteorological factors and HFRS epidemic risk [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], there has been inconsistency between the results due to different models and regions. The most appropriate model for HFRS still remains unclear. One of the critical reasons may be that the variability in meteorological factors in different degrees can produce different effects. The climate of Guangzhou is humid subtropical, where the summer is wet with high temperatures and a high humidity index. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the associations between meteorological factors and HFRS epidemic risk in Guangzhou which can help to establish an early warning system for HFRS.
