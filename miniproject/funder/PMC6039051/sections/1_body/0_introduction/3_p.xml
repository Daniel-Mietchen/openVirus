<p>In China, HFRS is caused mainly by two types of hantavirus, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), previous studies showed that HTNV could be isolated from gamasid and trombiculid mites collected from the nests of field hosts and from laboratory-reared offspring of these mites and that both trombiculid and gamasid mites could transmit HTNV by biting susceptible mammals [

Previous studies indicated that the densities of hosts’ mites could be influenced by humidity, humid environment facilitates the survival or breeding of mites, might be important in mediating host-to-host and possibly host-to-human transmission of hantaviruses [
