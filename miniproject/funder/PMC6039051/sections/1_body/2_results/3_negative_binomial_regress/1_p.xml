<p>In this study, lags of meteorological variables from one to four months were included to build different models, and to avoid the collinearity of average temperature and average atmospheric pressure, we put them into two different models when exploring the relationship between meteorological variables and HFRS. There were significant lag effects between meteorological variables and monthly cases of HFRS (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Average temperature and aggregate rainfall in the same month, lags of average temperature from one to three months, aggregate rainfall of two months and average relative humidity of four months all have significant association with the incidence of HFRS. The final negative binomial regression model (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006604.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) suggests that the monthly number of HFRS cases decreased by 5.543% (95%CI -5.564% to -5.523%) each time the temperature was increased by 1Â°C, and the number of cases decreased by 0.075% (95%CI -0.076% to -0.074%) each time the aggregate rainfall was increased by 1 mm. The comparison of fitted and cases in the final model is shown in
