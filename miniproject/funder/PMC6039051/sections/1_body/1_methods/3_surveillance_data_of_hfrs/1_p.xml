<p>We obtained data of HFRS cases in Guangzhou from the National Notifiable Disease Report System (NNDRS) during the period of 2006â€“2015 in this study. All cases of HFRS were diagnosed according to the unified diagnosed criteria issued by Chinese Ministry of Health. The diagnostic principles include epidemiological exposure histories, clinical manifestations and laboratory test. The criteria for probable cases of HFRS include epidemiological exposure histories (traveled to an endemic area or contact with rodents or the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents within 2 months before onset of the disease), clinical manifestations (such as fever, chills, nausea, flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash, low blood pressure and acute kidney failure) and serologic test results positive for hantavirus infection, evidence of hantavirus antigen in tissue by immunohistochemically staining and microscope examination, or evidence of hantavirus RNA sequences in blood or tissue. All the laboratory tests were completed by GZCDC using the same method and same kits. All hospitals and clinics in Guangzhou city are obliged to report HFRS cases through NNDRS within 24 hours.</p>
