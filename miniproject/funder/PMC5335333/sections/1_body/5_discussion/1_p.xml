<p>According to previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, LBMs are a potential source of human infections with avian influenza. Therefore, it was not surprising that more than 80% of the LBMs, including over half the samples, were contaminated by influenza A in our study. This finding reinforces the fact that the environmental hygiene of LBMs in Zhejiang province needs to be improved substantially. In our study, the H9 subtype had a higher prevalence than the H5 and H7 subtypes, which indicates that H9 is the predominant subtype in LBMs in Zhejiang province during the human influenza season. Wu 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> found, similarly, that H9 was the primary subtype, accounting for 31.8% of viruses isolated during January 2013 to December 2014 in Zhejiang. To date, although human infections with the H9 subtype have rarely been reported in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, there is also a high risk of human infection with avian influenza caused by the H9 subtype. Another study, from Shantou city, China, also showed that the H9 subtype was the most prevalent, while the H5 subtype was rare
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. However, the prevalence of the H9 subtype (8.1%) isolated from LBMs in Korea was far lower than that (32.2%) in our study
