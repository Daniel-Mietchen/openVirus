<p>Univariate and logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there were several factors associated with environmental contamination, including the duration of sales per day, the market trading area, types of live poultry, LBM location, rest days, disinfection and cleaning, LBM hygiene and the number of live poultry. The reasons for this may be as follows: First, a longer duration of sales increases the likelihood of virus spread. Fournie

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Second, large LBMs such as wholesale markets are generally loaded with different types and high densities of live poultry. Several studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> have shown that a large quantity and high densities of live poultry may increase virus activity and thus strengthen the risk of infection, which would be beneficial to dissemination and genetic reassortment

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. It is noteworthy that traders often do not clearly divide poultry holding, slaughtering and selling into different zones, which would facilitate cross-contamination, especially in the LBMs with many types of live poultry

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Third, the terrible sanitary conditions and lack of management in certain LBMs aggravates the risk of contamination
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Fourth, in contrast to previous studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> which have indicated that regular rest days, disinfection and cleaning minimize the contaminants in LBMs, our study found that regular rest days, disinfection and cleaning were risk factors associated with H5 subtype contamination. The contradiction may derive from: 1) recall bias and reporting bias, 2) more serious contamination may have driven the administration section of the LBMs to disinfect and clean more frequently. Further surveys and cohort studies are needed to investigate the direction of causality between regular rest days, disinfection, cleaning and H5 prevalence. Other studies have shown that two groups among poultry-related workers, including rural people and those with lower educational level, were less likely to follow the rules strictly owing to their lack of knowledge related to avian influenza virus
