 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> have found that the slaughter zone and sale zone in LBMs were the most seriously contaminated areas. In our study, we found that the drinking water samples had the highest prevalence of A, H5, and H9 subtypes. This is not unexpected, because drinking water shared by different live birds may preserve secretions such as saliva which are loaded with many influenza viruses and serve as the viral vector
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. In addition, during the process of slaughter, droplets containing viral particles may be produced and spread within the narrow and poorly ventilated space
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, so that the A, H5, H7 and H9 subtypes were detected in swabs taken from chopping boards and in sewage samples. Kang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> reported a similar result: they found many H7N9-positive samples in chopping tools. In contrast, lower detection rates for A, H5, H7 and H9 were found in the fecal dropping swabs. One study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> showed that the way cages were arranged was an important factor in contamination by influenza virus. Vertical stacking was able to control the distribution of fecal matter effectively, which could reduce the rate of contamination in LBMs. In general, tools related to poultry should be considered as the main objects to be cleaned and disinfected.
