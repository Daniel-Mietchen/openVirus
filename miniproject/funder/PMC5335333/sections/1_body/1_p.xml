<p>During the twentieth century, influenza epidemics occurred four times. Other than the Spanish influenza pandemic from 1918 to 1920
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, all the epidemics, Asian flu (H2N2) in 1957, Hong-Kong flu (H3N2) in 1968, and Russian flu (H1N1) in 1977, occurred in Asian and originated in China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. In 1997, 18 humans were infected by H5N1 in Hong Kong and six of them died, which was the first indication that the influenza virus could jump the species barrier and thus pose an enormous threat to people
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Over recent decades, human infections have been caused by various subtypes of avian influenza virus, including H10N8, H5N6, and H9N2. Most of them were first reported in China. In early 2013, a novel avian-origin reassortant influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged in Shanghai and Anhui, and then rapidly swept across other provinces of China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. As of 29th September, 2016, 755 cases of avian influenza A (H7N9), which causes high mortality in humans (41.9%), had been identified in 19 provinces of mainland China
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. However, it has low or even no pathogenicity in other animals
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Therefore, H7N9 virus may be more of a challenge than highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza at some levels.
