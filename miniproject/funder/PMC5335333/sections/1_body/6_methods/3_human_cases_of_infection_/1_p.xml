<p>A clear case definition for use in the diagnosis and treatment protocol for human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) (2014)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> was formulated by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Twenty-eight human cases of H7N9 were confirmed in 10 districts of Zhejiang from 1st October, 2015 to 31st March, 2016. The cases of H7N9 were from Hangzhou (11), Ningbo (2), Shaoxing (5), Huzhou (4), Jiaxing (5) and Jinhua (1), respectively. In our study, correlation between human H7N9 cases and environmental contamination with the H7 subtype in LBMs was analyzed to explore the relationship between human infection and LBM contamination.
