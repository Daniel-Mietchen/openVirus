The correlation between two variables was analyzed using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Normality was tested using the one-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The chi-squared test was used to analyze the categorical variables. Rank tests and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze single factors and multiple factors, respectively. All statistical analysis followed the standard that a P value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. In addition, continuous variables were transformed into categorical variables in the univariate analysis of risk factors and cut-off values for the sub-groups were set as follows: first, “running days” should be no more than 10 days according to government regulations in Zhejiang. So sub-groups of “running days” were set as “0-” and “11-”. Second, in order to explore whether the multiple types of live poultry were risk factors for avian influenza virus, we divided the variable “type of live poultry” into two groups which were “type 1” and “type 2-”(there were more than two types). Third, sub-groups of “market trading area” and “number of live poultry” were divided according to median and quartile range of the variables.
