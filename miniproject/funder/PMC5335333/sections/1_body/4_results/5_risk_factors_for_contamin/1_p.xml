<p>Univariate analysis showed that the factors associated with the prevalence of subtype A virus were the duration of sales per day (
 <italic>Z</italic> = −2.075, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.038) and the sanitary conditions of the LBM (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 7.448, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.024). The more time available to sell live poultry per day, the worse sanitary conditions were found to be, which was associated with a higher prevalence of A subtype in the LBMs. Sales days of less than 10 hours (
 <italic>Z</italic> = −2.677, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.007), a large market trading area (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 11.983, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003), multiple types of live poultry (
 <italic>Z</italic> = −2.305, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.021) and disinfection and cleaning (
 <italic>Z</italic> = −2.963, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003) were the risk factors associated with H5 prevalence. However, LBMs located in urban areas (
 <italic>Z</italic> = −2.727, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) with better sanitary conditions (
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 6.139, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.046) had lower H7 prevalence (
