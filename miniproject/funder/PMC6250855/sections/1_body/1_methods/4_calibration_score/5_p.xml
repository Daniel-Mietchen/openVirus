<p>We considered three alternative methods of calculating the calibration score. This was to explore the implications of favouring different data items within the score; the rationale for each alternative score is described in 
 <xref rid="jia225205-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S3</xref>. When describing the trends between 2017 and 2020, we assumed no change in national ART regimens and a constant rate of testing (which entailed 20% men and 30% women tested in the last year in 2017 (see Data 
 <xref rid="jia225205-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>: Description of Model Calibration, page 32)). We also assumed all people were eligible for ART at HIV diagnosis during this time, as per current guidelines 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Finally, we assumed that eligibility for, and rate of, circumcision remained unchanged (all men aged 15 to 49 were eligible for circumcision determined by age‚Äêspecific probability of being circumcised, if not previously diagnosed with HIV). Details of specific rates can be found in Data 
 <xref rid="jia225205-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> (Material: Calibration to Zimbabwe, Interventions and populations, page 43). We do not explicitly model transactional sex within the model. However, we hypothesize that both the number and epidemic trends among women with greater than three condomless sex partners in the model will be similar to the number and epidemic trends among women engaged in sex work in Zimbabwe. We are aware of the complexities in explicitly modelling sex work but feel our approach allows a useful comparison between modelled phenomena and observed data.
