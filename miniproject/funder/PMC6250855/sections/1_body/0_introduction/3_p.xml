<p>Prevalence rates (henceforth referred to as ‘prevalence’) and incidence estimates are crucial to understand the current status of the HIV epidemic and, in particular, to identify whether trends suggest an improving epidemic, as was intended to be achieved by the 2020 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) targets. Estimates from UNAIDS suggests that adult HIV prevalence and HIV incidence in Zimbabwe have decreased considerably since 1998 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, although for HIV prevalence, the level now appears to be stable at around 14% in 2016, as reported by nationally representative surveys (DHS 2015/6 (13.8%), ZIMPHIA 2016 (14.0%))

 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. Estimates based on the Spectrum model also suggest that HIV incidence has continued to fall since 1998 
 <xref rid="jia225205-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> and, in 2017, the ZIMPHIA reported an HIV incidence of 0.45 per 100 person‐years among 15 to 64 year olds.
