<p>The fitness landscape is a helpful concept to metaphorically visualize evolution and to uncover how genotype relates to phenotype, a central goal in evolutionary biology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We can consider fitness landscapes as a sort of Global Positioning System (GPS) device, whereby knowing the coordinates of an individual (genotype) allows us to predict how well an organism is positioned in its current environment (fitness, phenotype) and where it is likely to go next. Usually, fitness is represented by the “height” of the landscape, which is grounded on a plane that denotes the genotypic space: Peaks are good places to be (higher fitness), whereas valleys are not (lower fitness). This metaphor has been inching towards reality thanks to multidisciplinary approaches that combine computer science and applied maths with high throughput, highly quantitative biological data [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, more than 70,000 HIV-1 samples were used to measure the reverse transcriptase and protease fitness in the presence and absence of different antiviral drugs. Fitness measurements were then coupled with sequencing data and fitted to different mathematical models. This work provided a predictive model based on a biologically relevant fitness landscape, which predicted more than 50% of the fitness values obtained [

Such adaptive walks could be further investigated by reconstructing ancestral genotypes and submitting them to experimental evolution. Indeed, this was the case in recapitulating the evolutionary pathway to virulence of the oral polio vaccine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Knowing the ancestral virus and sequences from vaccine-derived poliovirus infections from different outbreaks, Stern and colleagues combined mathematical models and experimental evolution to retrace each mutation and recombination back to the virulent form [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although the trade-off between fitness and pathogenesis is not always reciprocal, a better understanding of genotype–phenotype maps would help monitor evolution and potentially predict future trajectories towards virulence.
