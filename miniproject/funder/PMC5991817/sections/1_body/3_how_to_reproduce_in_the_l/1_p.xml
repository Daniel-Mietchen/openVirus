<p>Experimental evolution tries to recreate the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the emergence of a new adaptive mutation in a controlled environment and within a specific time frame. By testing different host environments or viral genotypes, one tries to determine why some mutations occur and others do not. In our own lab, we showed that the chikungunya virus E1-A226V adaptive mutation, mentioned above, arises readily in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes in only seven days, and we identified potentially newly emerging mutations in the same gene [

In studying the emergence of canine parvovirus by experimental evolution in vitro, Allison and colleagues recapitulated several mutations observed in natural isolates that were specific to host and virus genetic background and confirmed their fitness advantages over the parental virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or decrease virulence, which has been used in live-vaccine attenuation for decades [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These approaches thus require special consideration before, during, and after the experiments, since experimental evolution in specialized environments could lead to gain-of-function mutations. While powerful in approach, experimental evolution does have limitations, including stochasticity, population size, limited environments, and resources, and although we cannot be sure these mutations will appear in nature, their identification does give us an advantage as chess masters by providing a short list of ‘next moves’ available to a virus.
