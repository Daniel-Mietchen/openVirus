<p>Viral pandemics can kill more people than war. From biblical plagues to modern-day outbreaks, the ensuing devastation is in part driven by the extreme genetic diversity of these pathogens, which allows them to rapidly evolve to escape immunity, jump to new species, and enter new ecological niches. The quote above, penned by a central figure who helped shape the modern-day synthesis of evolutionary science, is oft encountered today as a reminder that evolution remains relevant to all biology and certainly to infectious diseases. Indeed, throughout our history, whether deliberately or unintentionally, we humans have tried to control this very force responsible for our existence. And more recently, as microbiologists, advances in computer science and sequencing technology have moved our field to the next level. We can now follow, almost in real time, the molecular epidemiology of emerging outbreaks, allowing us to directly test field observations in the lab. What methods are available to follow viral evolution? Is it possible to predict virus evolution? Can we use this knowledge to drive deadly pathogens towards evolution's dead end, to extinction? These questions will guide the reader through this review.</p>
