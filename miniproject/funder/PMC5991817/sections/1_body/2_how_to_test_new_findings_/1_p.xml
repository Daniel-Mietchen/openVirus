<p>After phylogenetic characterization, newly identified mutations or viral strains can be tested in the lab in what is known as functional genomics. These approaches, which attempt to mimic what is happening in the wild, reveal how new mutations impact viral phenotype. There are many examples of newly identified mutations associated with antiviral resistance, higher pathogenicity, increased transmission, and cross-species transmission that were confirmed by these means [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, a single mutation (A188V) in a nonstructural protein (NS1) of Zika virus was first identified by phylogenetics and then shown to increase infectivity in laboratory mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] that increased viral pathogenesis in vivo [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, new phenotypes can also result from a constellation of mutations at the viral population level. Although these observations have been only seen in tissue culture, they are still significant and could be the starting point to test it in vivo [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006979.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, to better achieve mechanistic understandings, we still need to focus on a few mutations and their immediate effect on fitness. Thus, once a mutation of interest is identified and its impact on phenotype confirmed, one can set out to determine under what conditions this emergence event occurred. To do so, experimental evolution can be performed in vitro or in vivo.
