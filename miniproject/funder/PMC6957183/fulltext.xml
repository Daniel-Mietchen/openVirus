Sociodemographic correlates of HBsAg-positivity were identified with multivariable regression. HBsAg-positive individuals were referred to a central hospital for physical examination, elastography, and phlebotomy for HBV DNA, hepatitis B e antigen, serum transaminases, platelet count, and HIV-1/2 antibody. We determined the proportion of HBV monoinfected adults eligible for antiviral therapy (AVT) based on European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 2017 guidelines. We also evaluated the performance of two alternative criteria developed for use in sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Treat-B guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Across 12 urban and 4 rural communities, 4,961 adults (62.9% female) were tested and 182 (3.7%) were HBsAg-positive, 80% of whom attended hospital follow-up. HBsAg-positivity was higher among men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99&#x02013;1.87) and with decreasing income (AOR, 0.89 per household asset; 95% CI, 0.81&#x02013;0.98). Trends toward higher HBsAg-positivity were also seen at ages 30&#x02013;39 years (AOR, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.96&#x02013;4.63) and among pregnant women (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.93&#x02013;3.25). Among HBV monoinfected individuals (i.e., HIV-negative) evaluated for AVT, median age was 31 years, 24.6% were HBeAg-positive, and 27.9% had HBV DNA &#x0003e;2,000 IU/ml. AVT-eligibility was 17.0% by EASL, 10.2% by WHO, and 31.1% by Treat-B. Men had increased odds of eligibility. WHO (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], 0.68) and Treat-B criteria (AUROC, 0.76) had modest accuracy. Fourteen percent of HBsAg-positive individuals were HIV coinfection, and most coinfected individuals were taking tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Approximately 1 in 6 HBV monoinfected adults in the general population in Zambia may be AVT-eligible. Men should be a major focus of hepatitis B diagnosis and treatment. Further development and evaluation of HBV treatment criteria for resource-limited settings is needed. In settings with overlapping HIV and HBV epidemics, scale-up of ART has contributed towards hepatitis B elimination.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000061</institution-id><institution>Fogarty International Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01TW009998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3862-7795</contrib-id><name><surname>Vinikoor</surname><given-names>Michael J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005564</institution-id><institution>Gilead Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IN-US-174-3939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3862-7795</contrib-id><name><surname>Vinikoor</surname><given-names>Michael J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MJV received research support from Gilead Sciences (IN-US-174-3939; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gilead.com">https://www.gilead.com</ext-link>) and the Fogarty International Center at US National Institutes of Health (K01TW009998; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fic.nih.gov">https://www.fic.nih.gov</ext-link>).

Ambitious global targets have been established to eliminate hepatitis, including a 30% reduction in HBV incidence and treatment of 5 million HBV-infected individuals with antiviral therapy (AVT) by 2020 [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Along with Asia, Africa has a large burden of HBV, with an estimated 60 million individuals with chronic HBV infection, &#x0003e;95% of whom are undiagnosed [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Major efforts are underway in Africa to raise awareness and encourage governments to adopt and implement policies that will contribute to global hepatitis elimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed and published HBV treatment [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], testing [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and surveillance guidelines for low and middle-income countries (LMIC). The most common AVT for HBV in Africa is tenofovir, an antiretroviral agent used for millions of HIV-positive individuals, which also has high potency against HBV. There is also a rapidly expanding pipeline of new therapeutic agents to achieve HBV functional or virological cure [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In Africa, addressing the gap in high-quality data on HBV has been identified as a major priority [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This dearth of data is exemplified in a recent systematic review that identified only 1 recent study from Africa on mother-to-child HBV transmission, the main mode of transmission [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Data on AVT for HBV in Africa are particularly scarce and needed because differences in HBV genotypes [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and host genetics may influence when and who to treat with AVT and treatment outcomes. Young men of African descent may have increased risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; however, the effect of AVT on HCC risk has not been studied in this population and is inferred from data related to prevention of mother to child transmission, most of which was from Asia.</p><p>Several important projects in Africa have helped to address gaps in HBV data and validate international recommendations. In the Gambia, PROLIFICA demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of community-based screening, linkage to liver evaluation, and provision of AVT [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With a convenience sample of men who have sex with men and prisoners in West Africa and a hospital-based cohort in Ethiopia, investigators demonstrated comprehensive evaluation of HBV monoinfection based using the WHO-recommended approach [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

As HBsAg screening becomes more widespread, new questions are emerging around what proportion of newly diagnosed HBV patients will need AVT. In the only large community-based study to assess this, only 4.4% met criteria for AVT [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is also need to develop and evaluate criteria for AVT in Africa. Recently, the WHO criteria failed to detect around half of Ethiopians with HBV monoinfected patients who were eligible by European guidelines. We performed a population-level survey to evaluate AVT eligibility among HBsAg-positive adults in the general population in Zambia and to assess sociodemographic risk factors for HBsAg-positivity. We also compared the performance of several AVT eligibility guidelines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Survey sampling frame</title><p>We performed a population-based survey, adapted from methods used in the 2013&#x02013;14 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In Lusaka Province, using Ministry of Health records, we enumerated primary health centers, which have unique and well-defined catchment areas and populations. Among 67 facilities (40 rural and 27 urban), 18 (27%) were selected with probability of selection according to catchment population. Four facilities were rural and twelve were urban, two of which were chosen twice. After sensitizing facility and community leadership, we selected one health facility zone per area at random (each facility has 5&#x02013;10 defined zones with approximately equal population). From a central landmark, we spun a bottle to choose a direction and in a linear approach from that landmark traveling outward, we conducted door-to-door sampling. Every 3<sup>rd</sup> household encountered, defined as a dwelling where people currently lived, was eligible for inclusion in the survey, until 100 households per zone were included.</p><p>At each participating household, all adult residents (&#x02265;18 years) were eligible to participate. We excluded children because Zambian data suggested that HBV immunization, introduced in 2006 for infants aged 6, 10, and 14 weeks, has reduced HBsAg-positivity to 1.3% at ages 0&#x02013;14 and to 0.7% among those for aged 0&#x02013;5 [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HBV immunization is extremely rare among adults. If no adult was home, 2 additional attempts were made to contact inhabitants, after which another house was added in accordance with the systematic sampling scheme. Written informed consent was obtained before any study-related procedures. This study received ethical approval from the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee at University of Zambia (Lusaka, Zambia) and the Institutional Review Board at University of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, USA), as well authorization from the National Health Research Authority.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study measures</title><p>All participants had a finger prick point-of-care (POC) hepatitis B surface antigen test (Determine HBsAg, Alere) and completed a brief sociodemographic questionnaire. The questionnaire included a 10-item household possession index that we used to assess income. HBV infection was assumed to be chronic based on a single positive HBsAg result. HIV testing was available upon request but was not a mandatory part of the community survey as there was concern that it would diminish interest in participation. HBsAg (and HIV antibody) results were provided immediately to participants and HBsAg-positives were referred to University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in central Lusaka. To augment the sample with evaluation for AVT, we also included data from 18 HBV monoinfected adults who were diagnosed during the recent ZamPHIA survey in Lusaka. ZamPHIA had similar sampling and recruitment methods. At UTH, additional consent was obtained. HIV-1/2 rapid testing was performed. Among HIV-positives, we documented self-reported current use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A clinician performed a physical examination and we collected data on comorbid conditions including diabetes, cancer, and hazardous alcohol use, based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

HBV genotyping was not performed. AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) was calculated [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Transient elastography (Fibroscan 402, Echosens, France) was used to measure liver stiffness, a non-invasive test for fibrosis/cirrhosis. In HIV-HBV coinfected individuals, we also measured HIV RNA using an automated platform (Roche COBAS Ampliprep/Taqman) and defined HIV RNA suppression as &#x0003c;1,000 copies/ml. Bus fare was reimbursed for HBsAg-positives who attended the hospital evaluation.

Male sex and lower income were associated with HBsAg-positivity, with trends towards increased HBV among those in their 4<sup>th</sup> decade and among pregnant women. Based on a hospital-based assessment, 17.0% met EASL 2017 criteria for antiviral therapy. Regardless of the AVT criterion used, men appeared to have increased odds of requiring therapy compared to women. These data can guide implementation of hepatitis elimination activities in Africa.</p><p>Our main finding that 1 in 6 HBV monoinfected adults met EASL criteria for HBV AVT at the time of diagnosis was substantially higher than the 4.4% reported from a community sample of adults in the landmark Gambian study PROLIFICA [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This difference could be in part due to the change in EASL guidelines from 2015 (used by PROLIFICA) to 2017. However, we also noted that our HBV monoinfected sample had higher proportions with ALT &#x0003e;40 U/L and HBV DNA &#x0003e;2,000 IU/ml than the Gambian sample. Differences in the proportion needing therapy may be due to the sample age, as PROLIFICA recruited a slightly older population (median age of 38 years) or due to HBV genotype, since A1 is more common in Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] than the Gambia where E predominates, and genotype A1 was linked with more severe disease compared to E [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Treatment of HBV in those who need it is one of the 2030 global hepatitis targets [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; therefore, estimates around the proportion who need therapy are critical to inform global strategies to diagnose and link individuals to care and AVT.</p><p>Our study also provides evidence on the limitations of the WHO guidelines for HBV treatment. Compared to EASL 2017, WHO had very low sensitivity to identify HBV monoinfected patients who needed AVT. Among the 25 who met EASL criteria, only 10 (40%) met WHO criteria, similar to a recent study in Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Unlike the Ethiopian study, where many patients had complications of HBV at baseline, including decompensated or compensated cirrhosis, our sample was population-based and importantly no patient had decompensated cirrhosis, one of the WHO criterion. We also evaluated the recently developed Treat-B criteria, which rely on ALT, which is widely available in Africa, and HBeAg, which is feasible and could become more available through rapid tests. Treat-B, which had good accuracy during initial validation (AUROC of 0.88), had moderate performance in our sample (AUROC of 0.76), similar to a report from Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>These data also demonstrate the intersection of the HBV and HIV epidemics in Zambia. Although not assessed in our survey, the ZamPHIA study reported 1.31 times increased odds of HBsAg-positivity among HIV-infected adults [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HIV infection accelerates the natural history of HBV infection [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but in our survey HIV-HBV coinfected patients had similar degree of ALT elevation and HBeAg-positivity to those with HBV monoinfection, likely because of prior/current ART use in coinfected patients. In fact, ART scale-up has already begun to address the HBV treatment gap in Zambia. Per ZamPHIA, there are ~540,000 HBsAg-positive Zambians, including 72,000 with HIV coinfection and 468,000 with HBV monoinfection. Assuming 100% eligibility among coinfected and 17% eligibility among monoinfected individuals (based on EASL), we estimated that ~150,000 need HBV therapy. At present ~60% of HIV-positive Zambian adults are on ART [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and &#x0003e;90% take a tenofovir-based regimen. Therefore, perhaps half of the 72,000 (i.e., 36,000) HIV-HBV patients may already be on appropriate HBV therapy. This suggests that around 25% of the HBV treatment gap in Zambia has already been addressed by the HIV response. Getting the additional ~120,000 on HBV-active therapy is feasible considering that &#x0003e;800,000 Zambians are currently taking ART for HIV infection.</p><p>As HBV elimination strategies are implemented in Africa, these data suggest that men should be a priority population. Based on our data and those from the ZamPHIA study, men have 1.3&#x02013;1.6 times increased odds of HBsAg-positivity as well as 2&#x02013;5 times increased odds of needing AVT if HBsAg-positive compared to women. Men were also more likely to be HBeAg-positive in our study, which is a marker of infectivity. HBV-related HCC also tends to disproportionately impact young African men, though it was not assessed in this study [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To reach men, alternative approaches to household testing may be needed, since only ~40% of our survey participants were male, similar to other household surveys. When male-oriented health interventions exist in Africa, such as voluntary medical male circumcision [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], integrating HBsAg testing may be an efficient way to identify men and link them to care.</p><p>In our analysis, pregnant women also had a trend toward increased HBsAg compared to non-pregnant women, which could be due to immune suppression that occurs in pregnancy. None of the 8 further evaluated met guidelines for antiviral therapy for PMTCT. Further analysis of this is warranted as our sample size of pregnant women (n = 217) was small.</p><p>In our survey, we noted that HBsAg-positivity peaked in the 4<sup>th</sup> decade of life and there was a trend towards increased odds of HBsAg-positivity among 30- to 39-year-olds compared to 18- to 19-year-olds. This could be due to cohort effects (i.e., changes in behavior or in other public health interventions phased in over time); however, several studies in Africa have suggested that sexual transmission in adulthood may contribute new HBV infections. Sexual risk behavior was linked with HBV infection in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and adults taking HBV-active antiretroviral therapy for HIV had reduced HBV incidence [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In homosexual Kenyan men, recent HIV acquisition and rape were associated with higher HBcAb incidence while circumcision was associated with decreased risk [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although preventing vertical and early childhood transmission, when the risk for chronic infection is highest, remains the priority, a better understanding of sexual transmission of HBV in Africa is needed.</p><p>Data from this survey have broad relevance to global hepatitis policy. First, these data fill a gap in knowledge around what proportion of adults with chronic HBV infection may need AVT. Secondly, we demonstrated that policymakers and programs need to carefully select the treatment eligibility criteria to be used for HBV monoinfected patients as some criteria are more stringent and require HBV virological testing, something that is rarely available and technically challenging, while others may be low cost but result in over-treatment. In its first national hepatitis guidelines, Zambia has adopted WHO recommendations, and where HBV DNA is not available the decision to initiate AVT is based on persistent ALT elevation [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Developing low cost, feasible, and accurate criteria on when to treat chronic HBV in Africa, as well as how long to treat and when to stop, are major priorities. Our study also provides a surveillance approach that could be periodically utilized by governments to assess progress toward hepatitis elimination and to evaluate HBV interventions. These data reinforce that chronic HBV infection in the general population in Africa is usually asymptomatic; none of the HBsAg-positive adults assessed had signs of decompensated cirrhosis. It will be critical for health communication around hepatitis testing to emphasize the indolent nature of the disease, as is done for high blood pressure. Finally, these data can be used to advocate for further integration of HBV and HIV activities in African countries in East and Southern Africa where both infections are common. Achieving the HIV epidemic control targets (i.e., UNAIDS 95-95-95) will also contribute toward hepatitis B elimination in countries with intersecting epidemics.</p><p>The major strength of this study was its population-based nature and the inclusion of both urban and rural individuals. This is one of the only population-based studies of its kind for HBV in Africa. Eligibility for AVT is based on the natural history of HBV; therefore, the proportion needing therapy in our sample from Lusaka Province is likely to be a valid estimate throughout Zambia and possibly in other African countries with similar age, sex, and HBV genotype distributions. Our ability to link the majority of community-diagnosed individuals to further evaluation for AVT was another strength. Our study also had weaknesses including lower study uptake by men, which could have created a spurious association between sex and eligibility for antivirals if men who were tested at home were sicker than those not at home. This is unlikely as HBsAg-positive individuals did not report current symptoms of liver disease and similar association between male sex and meeting EASL criteria was reported in another study [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Only a limited number of sociodemographic factors were evaluated. Because of cost and logistical issues, we did not perform HBV genotyping. We did not repeat HBsAg status after 6 months among HBsAg-positives and could have slightly over-estimated the proportion in the population with chronic infection. On the contrary, lack of assessment of occult HBV infection [<xref rid="pone.0227041.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] could have lowered our estimate of active HBV infection. Our data would have been strengthened had we collected reasons for failure to link to the hospital component of the study among newly diagnosed HBV patients.</p><p>In summary, a larger proportion of HBV monoinfected individuals in the general population in Zambia may require AVT than previously thought. Men were significantly more likely to meet criteria for therapy. Due to its intersection with HBV, the strong HIV response in Zambia has already contributed substantially to hepatitis B elimination.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227041.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Stanaway</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flaxman</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Naghavi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fitzmaurice</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Vos</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Abubakar</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

This study provides epidemiology from a well characterized population with chronic hepatitis b (CHB) in Zambia. While the study is similar to other epidemiological studies of CHB, it does highlight regional differences in assessing treatment eligibility and points to the need for further context specific studies to understand regional differences and develop context appropriate treatment criteria. Overall it is well written and uses appropriate statistical methods.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. Use of EASL guidelines is reasonable and comparing a variety of guidelines is helpful. However, this highlights the importance of prospective cohort studies to understand treatment and CHB morbidity risks. While EASL guidelines are reasonable they aren&#x02019;t validated and involve considerable extrapolation in references to Zambia.</p><p>2. Methods: I recommend stating what the African validation was for TREAT-B. That is that is was development of a scoring system to approximate EASL criteria. It was not validated to identify individuals at higher risk for CHB complications.</p><p>3. An important finding of this study is current limitations on CHB research; ie the impact on location and genotype context on scores calculated from biomarkers, age, and fibrosis scores. Whether EASL, WHO, or TREAT-B are the most appropriate for this population is actually unknown. In addition, in all of these settings appropriate treatment duration and criteria for treatment discontinuation remain unclear.</p><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. It is unclear which of the authors is affiliated with 8</p><p>2. Incomplete references (eg Shimakawa et al)</p><p>Reviewer #3: Comments: Manuscript Number PONE-D-19-24241</p><p>The authors have reported on the eligibility for hepatitis B antiviral therapy among adults in the general population in Zambia. The authors may wish to consider the following comments:</p><p>1. The authors report, &#x0201c;No HBsAg-positive individual reported signs or symptoms of acute infection&#x0201d;. Well, many newly HBV infected people have no symptoms at all. So, this is not a very rigorous criterion to exclude acute infections. Why was the HBc antibody (IgM anti-HBc) measured in N = 580? Could you please provide some details in your flow chart?</p><p>2. &#x0201c;HIV coinfection was common, with 26 (14.4%) HBsAg.&#x0201d; I would suggest that the authors tone this down a bit. The description &#x0201c;relatively high&#x0201d; might more fitting.</p><p>3. &#x0201c;Pregnant women were more likely than non-pregnant women to be HBsAg-positivity 5.5% versus 3.0%), but the difference was not statistically significant after adjustment for age (P=0.06)&#x0201d;. The study might be underpowered to make this assessment, (only N = 8 women were pregnant); the result might have been statistically significant with a higher sample size. Besides, P= 0.06 is pretty close to the significance level. I would address this obvious limitation in the text. Moreover, did the authors consider the following covariates: the number of previous deliveries, and hospital stay, which might confound the relationship?</p><p>4. An important limitation of the study regarding correlates of HBsAg is missing confounder bias. This should be adequately addressed in the text.</p><p>5. The authors mention the higher odds of being HBsAg positive and higher odds of infectivity and state that &#x0201c;Men should be a major focus of HBV elimination strategies in Africa&#x0201d;, but what are the consequences of this for women and children? I am not sure how they propose to do this given the reported gender-based disparity in access to healthcare that already exists in developing countries. The authors address correlates of HBV infection but fail to take marital status into account.</p><p>6. The authors state that &#x0201c;The odds of HBsAg-positivity among 30- to 39-year-olds was significantly higher than 18- to 19-year-olds&#x0201d; and give some explanations in this regard including public health interventions etc. But, the birth cohort effect has not been sufficiently addressed here. Sexual transmission and infections including reinfections in adulthood also contribute to this and should be mentioned.</p><p>7. Chronic HBV infections are usually asymptomatic so I am not quite sure if I understand what the authors are trying to say in the following sentence: &#x0201c;HBV infection in the general population in Africa is usually asymptomatic as none of the HBsAg positive adults assessed had signs of decompensated cirrhosis&#x0201d;. It is because chronic HBV infection is symptomless, that it is also referred to as a silent epidemic.</p><p>8. The authors state, &#x0201c;Income and location (urban versus rural) were not associated with HBsAg&#x0201d;. The authors have not addressed (internal and external) migration patterns in their analysis, specifically in their interpretation. Could this have influenced the recorded prevalence?</p><p>9. The authors report &#x0201c;Sociodemographic correlates of HBsAg-positivity were identified&#x0201d;. However, the risk factors that have been considered in the analysis are not comprehensive. This should be addressed in the limitations of the study.</p><p>10. I am missing a detailed description of the statistical analysis, including model fit statistics in the methods section. Were interactions looked for?</p><p>11. Was multiple-comparison testing done in the adjusted regression models shown in Table 1?</p><p>12. What was the R2 of the fully adjusted logistic regression model? How much variation was explained by the fully adjusted logistic regression model?</p><p>13. The authors report that &#x0201c;HIV coinfection was noted in 14% of HBsAg-positive individuals and the majority were taking tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#x0201d; If this is indeed the case, then what are the ramifications for HBV treatment programs in Africa? In resource-poor settings with overlapping HIV and HBV epidemics one could embed HBV elimination programs in running HIV programs. This should be addressed in brief in the discussion.</p><p>14. What are the authors&#x02019; recommendations in terms of the available guidelines that should be use in Africa based on their analysis/findings? Some comment in this regard would be helpful.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Figure 1: In the flowchart the abbreviation &#x0201c;DBS&#x0201d; has been used without the full phrase being used anywhere in the text.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
