<p>Among the 4,962 with results (4 results were missing), 182 tested HBsAg-positive (prevalence, 3.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2–4.2%). No HBsAg-positive individual reported signs or symptoms of acute infection. HBsAg-positivity ranged from 0.3% to 6.1% across the 16 communities and varied somewhat with age category. For example, HBsAg-positivity was 2.6% at ages 18–19 years, 5.4% at 30–39 years, and 0.7% at 60+ years (

In bivariable analysis, HBsAg-positivity was slightly higher in men compared to women (4.2% versus 3.3%; P = 0.12) and among pregnant versus non-pregnant women (5.5% versus 3.0%; P = 0.04). Interactions between age and sex and sex and income were not statistically significant. In multivariable analysis, male sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.37; 95% CI, 0.99–1.89) was associated with increased HBsAg-positivity and increasing income (AOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) was associated with reduced HBsAg-positivity. Also, trends towards increased HBsAg-positivity were seen at ages 30–39 (2.11 times the odds of HBsAg-positivity (95% CI, 0.96–4.63) and among pregnant women (AOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 0.93–3.25). Location (urban versus rural) and marital status were not associated with HBsAg-positivity.
