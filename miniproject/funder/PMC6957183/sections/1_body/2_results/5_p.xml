<p>The proportion eligible for AVT was 17.0% by EASL 2017 criteria, 10.2% by WHO, and 31.1% by Treat-B (

 <xref rid="pone.0227041.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Among HBV monoinfected individuals, 8 pregnant women were assessed. Of these, none had evidence of cirrhosis, 1 had ALT elevation, 2 met EASL criteria for AVT for their own infection, and none of the remaining 6 would have met criteria for tenofovir therapy for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (i.e., HBV DNA &lt;200,000 IU/ml and HBeAg-negative). Considering EASL 2017 as the standard, the accuracy of WHO was poor (AUROC of 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58–0.78). While WHO criteria had relatively high specificity at 95.6%, sensitivity was very low at 40.0%. Treat-B was slightly better than WHO with an AUROC of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.86;
