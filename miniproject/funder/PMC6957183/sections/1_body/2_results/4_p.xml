<p>Among HBV monoinfected adults (n = 147; 19 others were HBV-HIV coinfected), 71 (48.2%) were men, median BMI was 22.2 (interquartile range, 19.7–25.9), and 48 (32.9%) were current hazardous drinkers (
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Elevated ALT was noted in 75 (52.1%) at WHO thresholds, 32 (22.2%) at &gt;40 U/L, and 9 (6.2%) at &gt;80 U/L. On physical examination, no patient had signs (i.e., ascites) of decompensated cirrhosis; however, 8 (5.4%) had cirrhosis by TE (n = 5) or APRI (n = 3). HBeAg-positivity was seen in 34 (24.6%) overall and appeared to be more common in men versus women (31.3% versus 18.3%; P = 0.08). Median HBV DNA was 1,392 IU/ml (IQR, 159–75,416), and 62 (44.3%) had HBV VL &gt;2,000 IU/ml. The percentage with ALT elevation was similar between those who did and did not report hazardous alcohol use (56.2 versus 49.5%; P = 0.44).
