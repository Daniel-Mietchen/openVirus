<p>All participants had a finger prick point-of-care (POC) hepatitis B surface antigen test (Determine HBsAg, Alere) and completed a brief sociodemographic questionnaire. The questionnaire included a 10-item household possession index that we used to assess income. HBV infection was assumed to be chronic based on a single positive HBsAg result. HIV testing was available upon request but was not a mandatory part of the community survey as there was concern that it would diminish interest in participation. HBsAg (and HIV antibody) results were provided immediately to participants and HBsAg-positives were referred to University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in central Lusaka. To augment the sample with evaluation for AVT, we also included data from 18 HBV monoinfected adults who were diagnosed during the recent ZamPHIA survey in Lusaka. ZamPHIA had similar sampling and recruitment methods. At UTH, additional consent was obtained. HIV-1/2 rapid testing was performed. Among HIV-positives, we documented self-reported current use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). A clinician performed a physical examination and we collected data on comorbid conditions including diabetes, cancer, and hazardous alcohol use, based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) [

In HIV-HBV coinfected individuals, we also measured HIV RNA using an automated platform (Roche COBAS Ampliprep/Taqman) and defined HIV RNA suppression as &lt;1,000 copies/ml. Bus fare was reimbursed for HBsAg-positives who attended the hospital evaluation. After receiving results, patients were referred to the appropriate clinics at either UTH or closer to the participantâ€™s home.
