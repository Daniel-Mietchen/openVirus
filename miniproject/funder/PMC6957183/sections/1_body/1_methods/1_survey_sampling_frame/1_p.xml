<p>We performed a population-based survey, adapted from methods used in the 2013–14 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In Lusaka Province, using Ministry of Health records, we enumerated primary health centers, which have unique and well-defined catchment areas and populations. Among 67 facilities (40 rural and 27 urban), 18 (27%) were selected with probability of selection according to catchment population. Four facilities were rural and twelve were urban, two of which were chosen twice. After sensitizing facility and community leadership, we selected one health facility zone per area at random (each facility has 5–10 defined zones with approximately equal population). From a central landmark, we spun a bottle to choose a direction and in a linear approach from that landmark traveling outward, we conducted door-to-door sampling. Every 3
 <sup>rd</sup> household encountered, defined as a dwelling where people currently lived, was eligible for inclusion in the survey, until 100 households per zone were included.
