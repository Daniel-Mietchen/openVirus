<p>In each HBV monoinfected individual we applied the EASL 2017 guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which we considered the reference standard in this evaluation, and two other HBV guidelines that were specifically developed for LMIC settings: the WHO 2015 guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which are largely based on non-African data, and TREAT-B [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a scoring system developed and validated with African data. EASL 2017 criteria were as follows: cirrhosis based on LSM &gt;9.5 kPa, significant fibrosis based on LSM ≥7.9 kPa and HBV DNA ≥2,000 IU/ml, ALT &gt;80 U/L and HBV DNA &gt;20,000 IU/ml, Metavir ≥A2 on liver biopsy and HBV DNA &gt; 2,000 IU/ml, HBeAg-positivity and age ≥30 years, or family history of HCC or cirrhosis.[
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] WHO 2015 criteria were one of the following: clinical cirrhosis (defined as signs of decompensated cirrhosis on physical examination), APRI ≥2.0, or the combination of HBV DNA ≥20,000 IU/ml, ALT elevation, and age ≥30 years. [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The TREAT-B criterion is based on categorized ALT level (&lt;20, 20–39, 40–79, and 80+ U/L) and HBeAg status and was validated against EASL [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The diagnostic performance of WHO and Treat-B in our patients were compared to EASL 2017, including the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). All statistical analyses were performed using Stata (Statacorp, USA).
