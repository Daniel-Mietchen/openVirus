<p>We described the proportion of eligible households that participated and the number of individuals tested for HBV. Using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression, we assessed the demographic correlates of HBsAg-positivity including age (categorized as 18–19, 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, and 60+ years), sex, pregnancy (pregnant versus not pregnant), income (per asset), marital status (ever versus never married), and location (urban versus rural). Confounders included in the final model were identified 
 <italic>a priori</italic>. Interaction between age and sex, and sex and income were considered for inclusion using a cutoff value of 0.2 in bivarable analysis. We defined linkage to care as the proportion of HBsAg-positives diagnosed in the community survey who attended the clinical evaluation at UTH divided by the total diagnosed in the community. We described the proportion of those assessed at UTH with cirrhosis, based on either ascites on physical examination, liver stiffness measurement (based on transient elastography) ≥9.5 kPa [
