<p>Several important projects in Africa have helped to address gaps in HBV data and validate international recommendations. In the Gambia, PROLIFICA demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of community-based screening, linkage to liver evaluation, and provision of AVT [

With a convenience sample of men who have sex with men and prisoners in West Africa and a hospital-based cohort in Ethiopia, investigators demonstrated comprehensive evaluation of HBV monoinfection based using the WHO-recommended approach [

As HBsAg screening becomes more widespread, new questions are emerging around what proportion of newly diagnosed HBV patients will need AVT. In the only large community-based study to assess this, only 4.4% met criteria for AVT [

Recently, the WHO criteria failed to detect around half of Ethiopians with HBV monoinfected patients who were eligible by European guidelines. We performed a population-level survey to evaluate AVT eligibility among HBsAg-positive adults in the general population in Zambia and to assess sociodemographic risk factors for HBsAg-positivity. We also compared the performance of several AVT eligibility guidelines.
