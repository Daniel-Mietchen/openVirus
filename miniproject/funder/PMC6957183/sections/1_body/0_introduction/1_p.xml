<p>Globally viral hepatitis is a leading cause of mortality, with most of the deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) [

Major efforts are underway in Africa to raise awareness and encourage governments to adopt and implement policies that will contribute to global hepatitis elimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed and published HBV treatment [

The most common AVT for HBV in Africa is tenofovir, an antiretroviral agent used for millions of HIV-positive individuals, which also has high potency against HBV. There is also a rapidly expanding pipeline of new therapeutic agents to achieve HBV functional or virological cure [
