<p>In Africa, addressing the gap in high-quality data on HBV has been identified as a major priority [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This dearth of data is exemplified in a recent systematic review that identified only 1 recent study from Africa on mother-to-child HBV transmission, the main mode of transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Data on AVT for HBV in Africa are particularly scarce and needed because differences in HBV genotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and host genetics may influence when and who to treat with AVT and treatment outcomes. Young men of African descent may have increased risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; however, the effect of AVT on HCC risk has not been studied in this population and is inferred from data related to prevention of mother to child transmission, most of which was from Asia.
