<p>In a general population sample of Zambian adults born prior to availability of HBV immunization, 3.7% were HBsAg-positive and none had prior awareness of their HBV status. Male sex and lower income were associated with HBsAg-positivity, with trends towards increased HBV among those in their 4
 <sup>th</sup> decade and among pregnant women. Based on a hospital-based assessment, 17.0% met EASL 2017 criteria for antiviral therapy. Regardless of the AVT criterion used, men appeared to have increased odds of requiring therapy compared to women. These data can guide implementation of hepatitis elimination activities in Africa.
