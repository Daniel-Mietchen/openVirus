<p>The major strength of this study was its population-based nature and the inclusion of both urban and rural individuals. This is one of the only population-based studies of its kind for HBV in Africa. Eligibility for AVT is based on the natural history of HBV; therefore, the proportion needing therapy in our sample from Lusaka Province is likely to be a valid estimate throughout Zambia and possibly in other African countries with similar age, sex, and HBV genotype distributions. Our ability to link the majority of community-diagnosed individuals to further evaluation for AVT was another strength. Our study also had weaknesses including lower study uptake by men, which could have created a spurious association between sex and eligibility for antivirals if men who were tested at home were sicker than those not at home. This is unlikely as HBsAg-positive individuals did not report current symptoms of liver disease and similar association between male sex and meeting EASL criteria was reported in another study [

Because of cost and logistical issues, we did not perform HBV genotyping. We did not repeat HBsAg status after 6 months among HBsAg-positives and could have slightly over-estimated the proportion in the population with chronic infection. On the contrary, lack of assessment of occult HBV infection [
