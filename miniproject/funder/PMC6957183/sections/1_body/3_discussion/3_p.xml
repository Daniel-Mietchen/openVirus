<p>Our study also provides evidence on the limitations of the WHO guidelines for HBV treatment. Compared to EASL 2017, WHO had very low sensitivity to identify HBV monoinfected patients who needed AVT. Among the 25 who met EASL criteria, only 10 (40%) met WHO criteria, similar to a recent study in Ethiopia [

Unlike the Ethiopian study, where many patients had complications of HBV at baseline, including decompensated or compensated cirrhosis, our sample was population-based and importantly no patient had decompensated cirrhosis, one of the WHO criterion. We also evaluated the recently developed Treat-B criteria, which rely on ALT, which is widely available in Africa, and HBeAg, which is feasible and could become more available through rapid tests. Treat-B, which had good accuracy during initial validation (AUROC of 0.88), had moderate performance in our sample (AUROC of 0.76), similar to a report from Ethiopia [
