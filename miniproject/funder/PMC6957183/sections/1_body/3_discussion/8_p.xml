<p>Data from this survey have broad relevance to global hepatitis policy. First, these data fill a gap in knowledge around what proportion of adults with chronic HBV infection may need AVT. Secondly, we demonstrated that policymakers and programs need to carefully select the treatment eligibility criteria to be used for HBV monoinfected patients as some criteria are more stringent and require HBV virological testing, something that is rarely available and technically challenging, while others may be low cost but result in over-treatment. In its first national hepatitis guidelines, Zambia has adopted WHO recommendations, and where HBV DNA is not available the decision to initiate AVT is based on persistent ALT elevation [

Developing low cost, feasible, and accurate criteria on when to treat chronic HBV in Africa, as well as how long to treat and when to stop, are major priorities. Our study also provides a surveillance approach that could be periodically utilized by governments to assess progress toward hepatitis elimination and to evaluate HBV interventions. These data reinforce that chronic HBV infection in the general population in Africa is usually asymptomatic; none of the HBsAg-positive adults assessed had signs of decompensated cirrhosis. It will be critical for health communication around hepatitis testing to emphasize the indolent nature of the disease, as is done for high blood pressure. Finally, these data can be used to advocate for further integration of HBV and HIV activities in African countries in East and Southern Africa where both infections are common. Achieving the HIV epidemic control targets (i.e., UNAIDS 95-95-95) will also contribute toward hepatitis B elimination in countries with intersecting epidemics.
