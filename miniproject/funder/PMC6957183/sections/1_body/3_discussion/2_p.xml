<p>Our main finding that 1 in 6 HBV monoinfected adults met EASL criteria for HBV AVT at the time of diagnosis was substantially higher than the 4.4% reported from a community sample of adults in the landmark Gambian study PROLIFICA [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This difference could be in part due to the change in EASL guidelines from 2015 (used by PROLIFICA) to 2017. However, we also noted that our HBV monoinfected sample had higher proportions with ALT &gt;40 U/L and HBV DNA &gt;2,000 IU/ml than the Gambian sample. Differences in the proportion needing therapy may be due to the sample age, as PROLIFICA recruited a slightly older population (median age of 38 years) or due to HBV genotype, since A1 is more common in Zambia [

 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] than the Gambia where E predominates, and genotype A1 was linked with more severe disease compared to E [
