<p>In our survey, we noted that HBsAg-positivity peaked in the 4
 <sup>th</sup> decade of life and there was a trend towards increased odds of HBsAg-positivity among 30- to 39-year-olds compared to 18- to 19-year-olds. This could be due to cohort effects (i.e., changes in behavior or in other public health interventions phased in over time); however, several studies in Africa have suggested that sexual transmission in adulthood may contribute new HBV infections. Sexual risk behavior was linked with HBV infection in Uganda [

 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In homosexual Kenyan men, recent HIV acquisition and rape were associated with higher HBcAb incidence while circumcision was associated with decreased risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although preventing vertical and early childhood transmission, when the risk for chronic infection is highest, remains the priority, a better understanding of sexual transmission of HBV in Africa is needed.
