<p>As HBV elimination strategies are implemented in Africa, these data suggest that men should be a priority population. Based on our data and those from the ZamPHIA study, men have 1.3–1.6 times increased odds of HBsAg-positivity as well as 2–5 times increased odds of needing AVT if HBsAg-positive compared to women. Men were also more likely to be HBeAg-positive in our study, which is a marker of infectivity. HBV-related HCC also tends to disproportionately impact young African men, though it was not assessed in this study [

When male-oriented health interventions exist in Africa, such as voluntary medical male circumcision [
