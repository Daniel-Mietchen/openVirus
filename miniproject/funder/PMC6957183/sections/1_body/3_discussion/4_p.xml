<p>These data also demonstrate the intersection of the HBV and HIV epidemics in Zambia. Although not assessed in our survey, the ZamPHIA study reported 1.31 times increased odds of HBsAg-positivity among HIV-infected adults [

 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but in our survey HIV-HBV coinfected patients had similar degree of ALT elevation and HBeAg-positivity to those with HBV monoinfection, likely because of prior/current ART use in coinfected patients. In fact, ART scale-up has already begun to address the HBV treatment gap in Zambia. Per ZamPHIA, there are ~540,000 HBsAg-positive Zambians, including 72,000 with HIV coinfection and 468,000 with HBV monoinfection. Assuming 100% eligibility among coinfected and 17% eligibility among monoinfected individuals (based on EASL), we estimated that ~150,000 need HBV therapy. At present ~60% of HIV-positive Zambian adults are on ART [
 <xref rid="pone.0227041.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and &gt;90% take a tenofovir-based regimen. Therefore, perhaps half of the 72,000 (i.e., 36,000) HIV-HBV patients may already be on appropriate HBV therapy. This suggests that around 25% of the HBV treatment gap in Zambia has already been addressed by the HIV response. Getting the additional ~120,000 on HBV-active therapy is feasible considering that &gt;800,000 Zambians are currently taking ART for HIV infection.
