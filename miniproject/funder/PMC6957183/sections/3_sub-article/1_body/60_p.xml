<p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review “Eligibility for hepatitis B antiviral therapy among adults in the general population in Zambia.” This manuscript addresses in interesting question about selection of individuals with chronic hepatitis B who are expected to most benefit from HBV treatment. This study provides epidemiology from a well characterized population with chronic hepatitis b (CHB) in Zambia. While the study is similar to other epidemiological studies of CHB, it does highlight regional differences in assessing treatment eligibility and points to the need for further context specific studies to understand regional differences and develop context appropriate treatment criteria. Overall it is well written and uses appropriate statistical methods.</p>
