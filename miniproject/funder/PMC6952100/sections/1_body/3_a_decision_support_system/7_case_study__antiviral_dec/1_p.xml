<p>In order to demonstrate that outputs from situational and intervention analyses, when combined using a statistical decision model, can provide recommendations on response options (including uncertainty), we present a realistic example of an antiviral decision problem for pandemic influenza in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003018.g002">Fig 2</xref> (full details are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1003018.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). For the intervention analysis component, we have used our previously published intervention model of targeted antiviral distribution strategies [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This model and its findings form the basis for Australia’s current pandemic response plan [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The model allows for the use of antivirals for treatment of cases and postexposure prophylaxis of contacts, differential risks of severe disease outcomes and differential benefits of treatment across population subgroups, and health system capacity constraints. The most recent version of this model is described by Moss and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and it builds on a larger body of work, conducted over a 15-year period, which has focused on developing pandemic antiviral policy for the Australian context [
