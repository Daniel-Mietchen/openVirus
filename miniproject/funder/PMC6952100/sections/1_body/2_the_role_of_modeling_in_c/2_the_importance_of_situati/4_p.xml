<p>To this end, advances have recently been made in the design of early outbreak surveillance methods such as First Few Hundred (FF100) household transmission studies [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the development of novel algorithms for analyzing the resulting data [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. FF100 studies involve the collection of data from confirmed infections and their household contacts, including the date of symptom onset and final outcome, until a satisfactory characterization of the pathogen is achieved [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The use of these protocols is recommended as part of enhanced early surveillance activities in the current pandemic plans of the United Kingdom [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Australia [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and WHO recommends a detailed investigation of at least the first 100 confirmed cases of any nascent pandemic [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These rapid, enhanced surveillance activities can be resource intensive but provide rich epidemiological data and overcome many quality, timeliness, and bias issues often associated with routine surveillance practices [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further, when these data are analyzed with FF100-specific algorithms [
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pmed.1003018.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], estimates of pathogen transmissibility and severity are obtained, enabling timely identification of the pandemic scenario that best characterizes an actual outbreak.
