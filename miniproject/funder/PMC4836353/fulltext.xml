In humans and mice, members of the type II transmembrane protease family (TTSP), e.g., TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11d (HAT), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HA for viral activation and infectivity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Recently, we reported that inactivation of a single HA-activating protease gene, <italic>Tmprss2</italic>, in knockout mice inhibits the spread of H1N1 influenza viruses. However, after infection of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> knockout mice with an H3N2 influenza virus, only a slight increase in survival was observed, and mice still lost body weight. In this study, we investigated an additional trypsin-like protease, TMPRSS4. Both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are expressed in the same cell types of the mouse lung. Deletion of <italic>Tmprss4</italic> alone in knockout mice does not protect them from body weight loss and death upon infection with H3N2 influenza virus. In contrast, <italic>Tmprss2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>
<italic>Tmprss4</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double-knockout mice showed a remarkably reduced virus spread and lung pathology, in addition to reduced body weight loss and mortality. Thus, our results identified TMPRSS4 as a second host cell protease that, in addition to TMPRSS2, is able to activate the HA of H3N2 influenza virus <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p><bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Influenza epidemics and recurring pandemics are responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. Due to high variability of the virus genome, resistance to available antiviral drugs is frequently observed, and new targets for treatment of influenza are needed. Host cell factors essential for processing of the virus hemagglutinin represent very suitable drug targets because the virus is dependent on these host factors for replication. We reported previously that <italic>Tmprss2</italic>-deficient mice are protected against H1N1 virus infections, but only marginal protection against H3N2 virus infections was observed. Here we show that deletion of two host protease genes, <italic>Tmprss2</italic> and <italic>Tmprss4</italic>, strongly reduced viral spread as well as lung pathology and resulted in increased survival after H3N2 virus infection. Thus, TMPRSS4 represents another host cell factor that is involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 influenza viruses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source id="gs1">Swiss National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id rid="gs1">FNSF 31003A-127147/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Edith Hummler</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source id="gs2">Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft (Helmholtz Association)

Several pandemics, such as the Spanish flu (1918), Asian flu (1957), and Hong Kong flu (1968), caused millions of deaths in the last century (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Currently, only two therapies, targeting the viral proteins neuraminidase and M2, are approved to treat influenza. Therefore, novel viral or host targets for antiviral strategies to block viral replication or inhibit cellular proteins necessary for the virus life cycle are urgently needed (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In this context, host proteases are a group of very promising antiviral targets, because proteolytic cleavage of the precursor hemagglutinin (HA<sub>0</sub>) into HA<sub>1</sub> and HA<sub>2</sub> subunits by host proteases is essential for fusion of HA with the endosomal membrane and thus represents an essential step for infectivity of the virus (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Due to the potential risk of side effects after application of broadband protease inhibitors, the specific inhibition of a single enzyme would convey a huge therapeutic benefit.</p><p>The majority of influenza viruses, including low pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses, carry a single arginine (R) residue at the cleavage site. These HAs are cleaved by host trypsin-like proteases (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with cultured human respiratory epithelial cells demonstrated the involvement of several membrane-associated proteases (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cell culture studies further identified, among others, the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D as enzymes able to cleave the HAs of influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3 (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We previously showed that deletion of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> in knockout mice strongly limits viral spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). An essential role for TMPRSS2 in cleavage activation and viral spread was also reported for H7N9 influenza A virus (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We also demonstrated that deletion of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> slightly reduced body weight loss and mortality in mice after H3N2 virus infection compared to those for wild-type mice but did not protect mice from lethal infections (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that in addition to TMPRSS2, other trypsin-like proteases of the respiratory tract are able to cleave the hemagglutinin of H3 influenza viruses.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in the context of influenza A virus replication and pathogenesis in experimentally infected mice.

Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Biozol) and counterstained with hematoxylin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Semiquantitative assessment of influenza virus antigen expression in the lungs was performed as reported earlier (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with the following minor modifications. For the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen 20&#x000d7; objective fields of lung parenchyma per lung slide were examined by light microscopy for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein, without the knowledge of the identities of the animals. The score for each animal was presented as the percentage of positive fields. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated for every slide to provide the score per animal, as follows: 0, 0% staining; 1, 1 to 25% staining; 2, 25 to 50% staining; and 3, &#x0003e;50% staining.

Influenza viruses are dependent on host cell factors for cell entry and replication. The identification of such host factors and an understanding of their role during the influenza virus life cycle are of great importance for the development of novel therapeutic targets. In particular, host proteases that exhibit trypsin-like activity, such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D (HAT), ST14 (matriptase), KLK5, KLK12, TMPRSS11E (DESC1), and TMPRSS13 (MSPL), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HAs with a monobasic cleavage site and to support multicycle virus replication in cell culture (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).

On the other hand, the trypsin-like proteases prostasin, hepsin, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS6, TMPRSS9, TMPRSS10, TMPRSS11B, and TMPRSS11F did not activate HA upon coexpression in mammalian cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>We showed previously that TMPRSS2 is required for H1 cleavage activation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). <italic>Tmprss2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mutant mice are completely protected from mortality after infection with several H1N1 and H7N9 viruses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In addition, infection with 10 FFU of A/HK/01/68 (H3N2) virus, which also carries a monobasic cleavage site in HA, resulted in less body weight loss and lower mortality for <italic>Tmprss2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than for wild-type mice. However, this difference was less pronounced after infection with an increased virus dose. Therefore, we investigated whether a further protease may be involved in cleavage activation of H3N2 viruses.</p><p>Here we showed for the first time that H3 hemagglutinin can recruit different host proteases for cleavage activation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Deletion of <italic>Tmprss4</italic> alone in single-knockout mice did not have a measurable effect with respect to body weight loss, survival, or pathology. However, deletion of both <italic>Tmprss2</italic> and <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in double-knockout mice significantly improved morbidity and survival after H3N2 virus infection. Nevertheless, the mice still showed limited body weight loss, indicating residual activity and spreading of viral particles.</p><p>Wild-type mice exhibited a higher mortality than that of the double-knockout mice and showed increased viral loads at days 2 and 4 p.i. In addition, wild-type mice exhibited higher levels of chemokines and higher lung weights at days 2, 4, and 6 p.i., which are indicative of higher rates of cellular infiltration and lung edema. Furthermore, bronchiolar damage was more severe in wild-type mice than in double-knockout mice on all days. Thus, the increased mortality rate for wild-type mice is most likely caused by a higher degree of tissue destruction by the virus at early time points. In addition, more immunopathology as a result of increased infiltration of immune cells and elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines may further contribute to increased pathology in and reduced survival of wild-type mice.</p><p>Several studies have addressed the physiological role of TMPRSS4, and three specific substrates have been identified: HA of influenza virus (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU) (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1A) (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). An increased expression of TMPRSS4 was associated with increased progression and metastatic potential of several cancers (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). TMPRSS4 transcripts have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon), the urogenital tract (kidney and bladder), mouse bronchiolar-alveolar epithelial cells, and human lung tissue (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Nevertheless, the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of this protein is still unclear. A recent study showed that the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel is not affected by deletion of <italic>Tmprss4</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). For lung tissue, TMPRSS2 expression has been described for human bronchial epithelium, AECII, and alveolar macrophages (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). We confirmed the expression of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> and <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in the alveolar region and the bronchial epithelial cells of murine lungs and showed that both proteases were coexpressed in granular and roughly cuboidal cells, representing AECII. In other studies, influenza A virus antigens were detected almost exclusively in AECII and, to a lesser degree, in alveolar macrophages (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This colocalization of host proteases and virus strongly suggests that both proteases can be recruited for HA maturation.</p><p>The protease cleavage site (PEKQTR) of the mouse-adapted H3N2 variant (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) which was used in our studies is identical to the cleavage site in the original human isolate (A/Hong Kong/01/68 H3N2). In general, seasonal influenza viruses of the H3 subtype cause more severe symptoms in humans than H1 viruses. One may thus hypothesize that the increased accessibility of the H3 HA to more than two proteases allows for more efficient replication of H3N2 viruses, which may be associated with more severe pathology. The more proteases are able to cleave the hemagglutinin, the faster the virus can replicate and cause illness. It has been shown that increased expression of TMPRSS2 leads to more severe outcomes of human disease caused by the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus or the novel avian H7N9 virus (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the H1 (PSIQSR) and H3 (PEKQTR) cleavage sites shows three differences (also see Fig. 9 in reference <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, it is likely that specificity and efficiency for protease cleavage are determined not only by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site but also by the overall tertiary or quaternary structure. The HA cleavage site of the H7N9 virus, which is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), supports this view, as it consists of the amino acids EIPKGR, which are quite different from both the H1 and H3 cleavage sites. Therefore, it will be important to investigate the structures of both proteases and hemagglutinins to determine the molecular mechanisms of HA cleavage susceptibility and efficiency.</p><p>It should be noted that deletion of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> did not change the tropism of H3N2 virus infection in mice (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that both proteases are expressed in the same cell types. Thus, after removal of <italic>Tmprss2</italic> alone, <italic>Tmprss4</italic> is still able to activate the HAs of H3N2 viruses, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Survival rate was increased only after deletion of both proteases due to reduced viral loads in the lungs. Although virus replication was decreased, we still detected processed HA protein, viral spreading, and pathology. From these data, we conclude that in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, further proteases are able to cleave and activate the hemagglutinin of H3N2 viruses. Different proteases have been shown to activate H3 viruses <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). TMPRSS11D (HAT) is expressed mainly in the murine trachea and bronchi and is thought to cleave HA mainly in the upper regions of the lower respiratory tract (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) was described to cleave H1 and H3 HAs (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), tryptase Clara (TPSB2) was reported to cleave H3 HA (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and matriptase (ST14) cleaves H3 HA to a certain degree (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A recent study also reported that the host proteases TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) are capable of cleaving H1, H2, and H3 HAs <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses provide further important insights into the involvement of host proteases for influenza virus HA processing. Our studies suggest that an inhibitor targeting TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 would be well suitable to block replication of H1N1 and, to a major degree, H3N2 influenza virus infections, which represent the current seasonal subtypes in humans. It should be noted, however, that our results were obtained with a mouse model and that the development or use of any potential inhibitor will require validation studies in humans.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the animal caretakers at the Central Animal Facilities of the HZI for maintaining the mice for this study and Karin Lammert and Heike Petrat for excellent technical assistance.
