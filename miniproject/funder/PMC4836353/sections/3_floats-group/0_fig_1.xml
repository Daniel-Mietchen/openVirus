   <italic>Tmprss2</italic> and

   <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization of lung slides from noninfected C57BL/6J lungs with probes specific for AECI (
   <italic>Aqp5</italic>) and AECII (
   <italic>Sftpc</italic>) (left, bright-field image; right, fluorescence image). Magnification, ×20. In both images, AECI (
   <italic>Aqp5</italic>) are stained red and AECII (
   <italic>Sftpc</italic>) are stained blue. (B and C) Cryo-sections of lungs from noninfected C57BL/6J mice were immunostained for TMPRSS2 (red) and TMPRSS4 (blue). Magnification, ×40. TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 were coexpressed in round, granular, and roughly cuboidal cells in the alveolar region (B) and in bronchial epithelial cells (C). No cross-reactivity of the antibodies was observed in appropriate knockout controls (data not shown).
