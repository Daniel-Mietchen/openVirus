   <sup>−/−</sup> double-knockout mice show reduced body weight loss and mortality after infection with H3N2 influenza A virus. (A) Eight- to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application, and body weight and survival were monitored until day 14 p.i. In addition to mice that were found dead, mice with a weight loss of &gt;30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. (B) Numbers of infectious particles in lung homogenates were determined. Individual values, means and SEM are presented. (C) Relative lung weights were determined by weighing freshly prepared lungs and determining the percent ratio of lung weight to body weight. Individual values, means, and SEM are shown. (D) Hematological parameters were measured with a VetScan HM5 system, and the kinetics of relative numbers of lymphocytes (Lym), monocytes (Mon), and granulocytes (Gr) were determined. Homozygous

   <sup>−/−</sup> knockout mice lost significantly less body weight than wild-type mice (e.g., 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 at day 2 and

   <sup>−/−</sup> mice showed significantly reduced mortality compared to that of wild-type mice (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; log rank test) as well as single-knockout mice. Viral loads were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected homozygous mutant mice at days 2, 4, and 6 p.i. (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Mann-Whitney U test). Furthermore, lung weights were significantly higher in infected wild-type mice than in infected
