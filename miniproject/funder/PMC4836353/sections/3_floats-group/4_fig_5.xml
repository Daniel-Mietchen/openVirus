   <sup>−/−</sup> (red symbols) mice were infected with 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of H3N2 influenza virus, and BAL fluid was collected on day 3 p.i. PBS-treated mice were used as mock controls (open symbols). Five biological replicates were analyzed at each time point. Individual values, means, and SEM are presented. Detection limits of the individual proteins are indicated by blue lines. Samples below the detection threshold were set to the respective detection limit. Significances were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test. *,
