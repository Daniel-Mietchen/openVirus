   <sup>−/−</sup> lungs exhibits reduced infectivity in the absence of trypsin. Eight- to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application. On day 2 p.i., the ratio of processed to nonprocessed virus (HA cleavage or not) in lung homogenates was determined using a modified FFU assay without exogenous trypsin. The total number of virus particles (mature or not) was determined in the presence of trypsin. Samples from mutant mice showed significantly lower levels of matured viruses than the total number of virus particles (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). No difference was detectable in samples from infected wild-type mice. Data shown are means ± SEM for 7 replicates from two independent experiments.
