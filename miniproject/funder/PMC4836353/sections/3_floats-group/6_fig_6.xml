   <sup>−/−</sup> double-knockout mice exhibit milder lung pathology and reduced viral spread into alveolar regions after infection with H3N2 virus. Eight- to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application. Serial lung sections were stained on days 2, 4, and 6 p.i. with anti-influenza virus antibody and hematoxylin (A to F) or with hematoxylin and eosin (G and H). Magnification, ×10 for panels A, B, and E to H and ×40 for panels C and D. (A to D) On day 2 p.i., virus-infected cells were observed mainly in bronchiolar regions of knockout mice and in bronchiolar as well as alveolar regions of wild type mice. (E to H) Both wild-type and mutant mice showed viral spreading into alveolar regions on day 6 p.i. However, in wild-type lungs, the tissue was more densely consolidated, with larger numbers of infiltrating immune cells, than the case for

   <sup>−/−</sup> knockout mice. Furthermore, hemorrhages as well as edema (G and H) were observed in infected C57BL/6J mouse lungs, indicating a more severe pathology.
