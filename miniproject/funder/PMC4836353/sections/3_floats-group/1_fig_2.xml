   <sup>−/−</sup> mice are not resistant to H1N1 and H3N2 virus infection. Eight- to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted PR8M virus (A/PuertoRico/8/34) (A), 2 × 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 virus (A/HongKong/01/68) (B), or 10 FFU of H3N2 influenza virus (C) by intranasal application. Body weight loss was monitored until day 14 p.i. Mice with a weight loss of &gt;30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. Weight loss data represent mean values ± standard errors of the means (SEM). No significant differences in body weight loss and survival were observed between knockout and wild-type mice. Significances were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test (body weight loss) and the log rank test (survival).
