   <italic>Tmprss4</italic> knockout mice show lung viral loads similar to those of wild-type mice after H3N2 influenza A virus infection. Eight- to 11-week-old female mice were infected with 2 Ã— 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intranasal application, and numbers of infectious particles in lung homogenates were determined. Individual values, means, and SEM are presented. Viral loads were not significantly different in infected wild-type and infected homozygous mutant mice at days 2 to 4 p.i.
