<p>Total RNA was prepared from lungs by use of an RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the Bioscript system (Bioline GmbH, Germany). Subsequently, 
 <italic>Taq</italic> polymerase (REDTaq; Sigma-Aldrich) and gene-specific primers (for exon 4, primer P1 [5′CAG TTG TGT GAC GGC CAC3′]; and for exon 11, primer P2 [5′CAC AGC ATC TCA GCG GTC A3′]) were used for PCR amplification of the 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic>-specific gene fragment.
