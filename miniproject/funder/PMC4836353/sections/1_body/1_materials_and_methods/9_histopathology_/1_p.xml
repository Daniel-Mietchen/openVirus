<p>Semiquantitative histopathological assessment of influenza virus-associated inflammation in the lung was performed as reported earlier (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with the following modifications. For the extent of alveolitis, we scored the total number of alveoli affected in the lung slide as follows: 0, 0%; 1, 1 to 25%; 2, 25 to 50%; and 3, &gt;50%. For the severity of alveolitis, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis, we scored the slides as follows: 0, no inflammatory cells; 1, few inflammatory cells; 2, moderate numbers of inflammatory cells; and 3, many inflammatory cells in all alveoli, bronchioles, and bronchi of the lung slide. For the presence of alveolar edema and the presence of alveolar epithelial necrosis, we reported scores as follows: 0, not present; and 1, present in the lung slide. For the overall score for pathological changes in the alveoli, the total score (scores for extent of alveolitis plus severity of alveolitis plus presence of alveolar edema plus presence of alveolar epithelial necrosis) was used. Slides were examined without knowledge of the identities of animals.
