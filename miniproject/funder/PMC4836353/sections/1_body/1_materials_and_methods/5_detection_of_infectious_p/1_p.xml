<p>Viral loads in infected lungs were determined by use of MDCK II (Madin-Darby canine kidney II) cells for assay of the number of focus-forming units (FFU), as described earlier (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Briefly, a 10-fold dilution series of homogenized lung tissue was incubated with preseeded MDCK II cells for 1 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5 μg/ml N-acetylated trypsin (NAT) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After incubation, a 1% Avicell overlay prepared in DMEM containing NAT and BSA was added and incubated for an additional 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin, and viral particles were detected with an anti-influenza virus antibody (Virostat). For detection of nonprocessed viral particles, lung homogenates were diluted in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA without NAT. After washing of MDCK II cells, homogenates were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Afterwards, the inoculants were removed and the cells were washed twice with PBS. A 1% Avicell overlay containing BSA and NAT was added, and the assay was processed according to the above protocol.
