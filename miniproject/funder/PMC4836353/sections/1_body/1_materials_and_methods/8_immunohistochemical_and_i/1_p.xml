<p>Lungs were prepared and immersion fixed for 24 h in 4% buffered formaldehyde solution (pH 7.4), dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (0.5 μm) were cut from three evenly distributed levels of paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical studies, sections were stained overnight at 4°C with a primary antibody against influenza A virus nucleoprotein (clone hb65; ATCC, Wessel, Germany). Subsequently, tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Biozol) and counterstained with hematoxylin (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with the following minor modifications. For the alveoli, 25 arbitrarily chosen 20× objective fields of lung parenchyma per lung slide were examined by light microscopy for the presence of influenza virus nucleoprotein, without the knowledge of the identities of the animals. The score for each animal was presented as the percentage of positive fields. For the bronchi and bronchioles, the percentage of positively staining epithelium was estimated for every slide to provide the score per animal, as follows: 0, 0% staining; 1, 1 to 25% staining; 2, 25 to 50% staining; and 3, &gt;50% staining. For immunofluorescence analyses, 12-μm-thick cryo-sections were air dried, fixed in acetone at −20°C, and rehydrated in PBS. Slides were blocked with anti-FCR (1:500; purified rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32). Primary antibodies used were AF350-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS4 polyclonal antibody (Bioss) and Cy5-conjugated rabbit anti-TMPRSS2 antibody (Antikoerper-Online). Both antibodies were checked on appropriate knockout slides to exclude potential cross-reactivity. After staining, the slides were washed with PBS, dried, and mounted with Neo-Mount (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Analyses were performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective. For 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) studies of type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECI) and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII), 5-μm-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections were used with a QuantiGene ViewRNA ISH tissue assay kit (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH) following the manufacturer's instructions. Type 6 (
 <italic>Sftpc</italic>; for AECII) and type 1 (
 <italic>Aqp5</italic>; for AECI) QuantiGene ViewRNA probes were generated based on Affymetrix probe sets. The GenBank accession numbers for the probe sequences are as follows: for type 6 probes (
 <italic>Sftpc</italic>), 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_011359" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NM_011359</ext-link> (region 2–784); and for type 1 probes (
 <italic>Aqp5</italic>), 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_009701" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NM_009701</ext-link> (region 239–1533). Pretreatment was performed for 10 min at 90 to 95°C, and protease digestion was performed for 20 min at 40°C. Slides were stained with Fast red for type 1 probes. Type 6 probes were detected with Fast blue. Slides were then counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin. Negative controls (antisense) were run in parallel and showed no hybridization signals (not shown) (type 6 [
 <italic>Sftpc</italic>-neg] negative control [region 23–803], covered by probe set NM_011359-N; and type 1 [
 <italic>Aqp5</italic>-neg] negative control [region 172–1122], covered by probe set NM_009701-N). Bright-field images were recorded using Aperio Scanscope and analyzed with Aperio Imagescope software. For detection of fluorescence images, a Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning microscope with a 20× objective was used.
