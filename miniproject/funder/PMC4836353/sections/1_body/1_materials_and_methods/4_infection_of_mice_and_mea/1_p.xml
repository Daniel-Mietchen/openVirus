<p>For infection experiments, female mice at the age of 8 to 11 weeks were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine-xylazine solution (85% NaCl [0.9%], 10% ketamine, 5% xylazine; 200 μl per 20 g body weight). Infection was performed by intranasal application of virus solution in 20 μl of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, survival and body weight loss were monitored until day 14 postinfection (p.i.). In addition to mice that were found dead, mice with a weight loss of &gt;30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead.</p>
