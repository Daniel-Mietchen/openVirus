<p>Original stocks of viruses were obtained from Stefan Ludwig, University of Münster (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, Münster variant [PR8M], and A/WSN/33 H1N1), from Peter Stäheli, University of Freiburg (A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, Freiburg variant [PR8F], and A/Seal/Massachusetts/1/80 H7N7 [SC35M]) (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The low-virulence mouse-adapted H1N1 virus PR8M and the high-virulence mouse-adapted H1N1 virus PR8F have been described previously (

Homozygous mutant mice were genotyped by PCR analysis, using a three-primer strategy (P1, 5′GGT CAG ATG TAA AAG GTA GAC3′; P2, 5′GCT AGG TTC CTT GTT CCT G3′; and P3, 5′CAT GGA TGT GAC CAT TGT GC3′) that allowed us to distinguish between wild-type (250-bp product) and knockout (500-bp product) alleles.
