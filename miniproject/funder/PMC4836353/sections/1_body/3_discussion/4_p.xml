<p>Wild-type mice exhibited a higher mortality than that of the double-knockout mice and showed increased viral loads at days 2 and 4 p.i. In addition, wild-type mice exhibited higher levels of chemokines and higher lung weights at days 2, 4, and 6 p.i., which are indicative of higher rates of cellular infiltration and lung edema. Furthermore, bronchiolar damage was more severe in wild-type mice than in double-knockout mice on all days. Thus, the increased mortality rate for wild-type mice is most likely caused by a higher degree of tissue destruction by the virus at early time points. In addition, more immunopathology as a result of increased infiltration of immune cells and elevated levels of inflammatory chemokines may further contribute to increased pathology in and reduced survival of wild-type mice.</p>
