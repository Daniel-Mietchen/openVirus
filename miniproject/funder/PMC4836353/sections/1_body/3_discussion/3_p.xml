<p>Here we showed for the first time that H3 hemagglutinin can recruit different host proteases for cleavage activation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Deletion of 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> alone in single-knockout mice did not have a measurable effect with respect to body weight loss, survival, or pathology. However, deletion of both 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> and 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in double-knockout mice significantly improved morbidity and survival after H3N2 virus infection. Nevertheless, the mice still showed limited body weight loss, indicating residual activity and spreading of viral particles.
