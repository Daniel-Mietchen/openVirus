<p>Seasonal influenza viruses as well as newly emerging subtypes pose a major threat to human health. Influenza viruses are dependent on host cell factors for cell entry and replication. The identification of such host factors and an understanding of their role during the influenza virus life cycle are of great importance for the development of novel therapeutic targets. In particular, host proteases that exhibit trypsin-like activity, such as TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS11D (HAT), ST14 (matriptase), KLK5, KLK12, TMPRSS11E (DESC1), and TMPRSS13 (MSPL), have been shown to cleave influenza virus HAs with a monobasic cleavage site and to support multicycle virus replication in cell culture (
