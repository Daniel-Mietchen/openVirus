<p>The protease cleavage site (PEKQTR) of the mouse-adapted H3N2 variant (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) which was used in our studies is identical to the cleavage site in the original human isolate (A/Hong Kong/01/68 H3N2). In general, seasonal influenza viruses of the H3 subtype cause more severe symptoms in humans than H1 viruses. One may thus hypothesize that the increased accessibility of the H3 HA to more than two proteases allows for more efficient replication of H3N2 viruses, which may be associated with more severe pathology. The more proteases are able to cleave the hemagglutinin, the faster the virus can replicate and cause illness. It has been shown that increased expression of TMPRSS2 leads to more severe outcomes of human disease caused by the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus or the novel avian H7N9 virus (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the H1 (PSIQSR) and H3 (PEKQTR) cleavage sites shows three differences (also see Fig. 9 in reference 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, it is likely that specificity and efficiency for protease cleavage are determined not only by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site but also by the overall tertiary or quaternary structure. The HA cleavage site of the H7N9 virus, which is also cleaved by TMPRSS2 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), supports this view, as it consists of the amino acids EIPKGR, which are quite different from both the H1 and H3 cleavage sites. Therefore, it will be important to investigate the structures of both proteases and hemagglutinins to determine the molecular mechanisms of HA cleavage susceptibility and efficiency.
