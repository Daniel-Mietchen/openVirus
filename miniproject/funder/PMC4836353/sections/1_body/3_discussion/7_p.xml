<p>It should be noted that deletion of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> did not change the tropism of H3N2 virus infection in mice (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that both proteases are expressed in the same cell types. Thus, after removal of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> alone, 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> is still able to activate the HAs of H3N2 viruses, and 
 <italic>vice versa</italic>. Survival rate was increased only after deletion of both proteases due to reduced viral loads in the lungs. Although virus replication was decreased, we still detected processed HA protein, viral spreading, and pathology. From these data, we conclude that in addition to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, further proteases are able to cleave and activate the hemagglutinin of H3N2 viruses. Different proteases have been shown to activate H3 viruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). TMPRSS11D (HAT) is expressed mainly in the murine trachea and bronchi and is thought to cleave HA mainly in the upper regions of the lower respiratory tract (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, kallikrein-related peptidase 5 (KLK5) was described to cleave H1 and H3 HAs (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), tryptase Clara (TPSB2) was reported to cleave H3 HA (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and matriptase (ST14) cleaves H3 HA to a certain degree (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). A recent study also reported that the host proteases TMPRSS11E (DESC1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) are capable of cleaving H1, H2, and H3 HAs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).
