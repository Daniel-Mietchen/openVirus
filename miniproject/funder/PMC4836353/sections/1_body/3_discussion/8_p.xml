<p>In summary, our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses provide further important insights into the involvement of host proteases for influenza virus HA processing. Our studies suggest that an inhibitor targeting TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 would be well suitable to block replication of H1N1 and, to a major degree, H3N2 influenza virus infections, which represent the current seasonal subtypes in humans. It should be noted, however, that our results were obtained with a mouse model and that the development or use of any potential inhibitor will require validation studies in humans.
