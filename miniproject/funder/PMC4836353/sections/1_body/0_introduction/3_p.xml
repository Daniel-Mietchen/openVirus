<p>In this study, we investigated the role of 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in the context of influenza A virus replication and pathogenesis in experimentally infected mice. We showed that knockout of 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> alone did not protect mice from lethal H3N2 influenza A virus infections. In contrast,

 <sup>−/−</sup>
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> double-knockout mice showed massively reduced viral spread and lung pathology and also had reduced body weight loss and mortality.
