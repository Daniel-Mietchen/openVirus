<p>The majority of influenza viruses, including low pathogenic avian and human influenza viruses, carry a single arginine (R) residue at the cleavage site. These HAs are cleaved by host trypsin-like proteases (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with cultured human respiratory epithelial cells demonstrated the involvement of several membrane-associated proteases (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Cell culture studies further identified, among others, the transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and TMPRSS11D as enzymes able to cleave the HAs of influenza virus subtypes H1 and H3 (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We previously showed that deletion of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> in knockout mice strongly limits viral spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). An essential role for TMPRSS2 in cleavage activation and viral spread was also reported for H7N9 influenza A virus (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We also demonstrated that deletion of 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> slightly reduced body weight loss and mortality in mice after H3N2 virus infection compared to those for wild-type mice but did not protect mice from lethal infections (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that in addition to TMPRSS2, other trypsin-like proteases of the respiratory tract are able to cleave the hemagglutinin of H3 influenza viruses.
