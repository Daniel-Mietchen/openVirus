<p>Furthermore, we measured the protein levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in BAL fluid. Three days after infection, increases of the levels of 13 chemokines were observed in C57BL/6 mice compared to mock-infected mice. Most importantly, we observed significantly less expression of IP10, KC, MCP1, MIP1α, RANTES, VEGF, and TNF-α in knockout mice than in wild-type mice (
