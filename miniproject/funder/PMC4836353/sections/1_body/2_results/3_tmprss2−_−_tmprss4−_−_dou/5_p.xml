<p>Finally, to examine whether the reduced viral replication in the lungs of mutant mice is also reflected in reduced HA activation, we performed a modified FFU assay of lung homogenates. To prevent artificial HA cleavage and following viral entry into MDCK II cells by addition of exogenous trypsin, the homogenates were incubated on the cells without additional proteinase in the medium. Under these conditions, only completely matured virus particles will enter cells and form foci. We were able to detect a significant smaller amount of matured virus than the total amount of virus in samples from double-knockout mice (

Taken together, these data show that TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 mediate activation of H3N2 influenza A viruses by cleavage maturation of viral hemagglutinin progeny and that deletion of these host factors results in reduced viral replication, spreading, and pathogenesis.
