<p>Both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 are able to cleave H3 hemagglutinin

 <sup>−/−</sup> double-knockout mice and infected them with 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU H3N2 virus. Indeed, infected double-mutant mice showed a delayed and significantly reduced loss of body weight compared to wild-type mice or

 <sup>−/−</sup> single-knockout mice (

 <sup>3</sup> FFU H3N2 virus at days 2 to 6 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). In addition, the relative weight of wild-type lungs increased considerably more from days 2 to 6 postinfection than that of knockout lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>), indicating less infiltration of immune cells and accumulation of fluid. In agreement with these observations, the relative number of granulocytes in peripheral blood increased to higher levels in wild-type mice than in double-knockout mice after infection with H3N2 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>), which represents an indicator of severe influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, both wild-type and knockout mice showed similar degrees of lymphopenia during the first 2 days p.i., followed by an increase of lymphocytes in both knockout and wild-type mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4D</xref>). Similar granulocytosis was observed in both strains on days 2 to 6 p.i.
