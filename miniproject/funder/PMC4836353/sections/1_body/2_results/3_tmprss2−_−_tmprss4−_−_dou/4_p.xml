<p>By immunohistochemistry, influenza virus antigen was present in respiratory epithelial cells, with stronger expression in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. For the wild-type mice at 2 days p.i., multifocally, few type II alveolar epithelial cells and many bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells were expressing virus antigen (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">C</xref>). At 4 days p.i., more alveolar cells were positive and fewer bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells were positive than at 2 days p.i. At 6 days p.i., there were more positive alveolar epithelial cells and comparable numbers of positive bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells compared to those at 4 days p.i. (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">D</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">F</xref>). The number of positive alveolar epithelial cells increased from 2 to 6 days p.i., while the number of bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells decreased from 2 to 4 and 6 days p.i.
