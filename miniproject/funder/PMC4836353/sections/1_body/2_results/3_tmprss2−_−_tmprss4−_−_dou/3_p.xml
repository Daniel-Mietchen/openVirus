<p>By histopathology, both wild-type and knockout mice developed a multifocal mild to severe necrotizing and suppurative broncho-interstitial pneumonia (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). For the wild-type mice at day 2 p.i., the alveolar septa were multifocally mildly thickened, with infiltration of few neutrophils. The alveolar, bronchiolar, and bronchial lumina contained scant to moderate amounts of inflammatory exudate, consisting of viable and degenerate neutrophils, increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, and mild accumulation of proteinaceous fluid (edema) and hemorrhage. Multifocally, there was moderate necrosis of the bronchiolar and bronchial epithelia. Around bronchioles, bronchi, and pulmonary blood vessels, there was an infiltration of moderate numbers of viable and degenerate neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. At 4 days p.i., the lesions were more severe and extended over a larger area of the lungs than at 2 days p.i., and they consisted of more severe infiltration by inflammatory cells, mild alveolar and moderate bronchiolar epithelial necrosis, and more intra-alveolar edema (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). At 6 days p.i., the lesions were more severe and extended over a larger area than at 4 days p.i. Also, there was mild type II alveolar epithelial cell hyperplasia. For the knockout mice, the overall pathological scores in the alveoli were comparable to those for the wild-type mice at 2, 4, and 6 days p.i. However, the bronchiolar damage was less severe than that in the wild-type mice on all days.
