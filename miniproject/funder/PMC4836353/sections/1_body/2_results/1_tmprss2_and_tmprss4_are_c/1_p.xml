<p>It was described previously that 
 <italic>Tmprss2</italic> is expressed in type 2 pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), the main target cells for influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). TMPRSS4 is an additional protease with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> HA cleavage potential (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, we examined the expression profile of 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in mouse lung tissues. We performed 
 <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) analyses to differentiate between type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECI and AECII, respectively) in noninfected mouse lungs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, round and mostly cuboidal AECII were detected by expression of the cell type-specific marker surfactant-associated protein C (
 <italic>Sftpc</italic>; stained blue). Thin and flat AECI could be identified by expression of the cell type-specific marker aquaporin 5 (
 <italic>Aqp5</italic>; stained red). In addition, we used immunohistochemical staining to detect expression of both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. Staining could be observed in cuboidal and granular cells of alveolar tissue, representing AECII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref>), as well as in the bronchiolar epithelium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>).
