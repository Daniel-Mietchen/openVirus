<p>We used mice carrying a deletion in the 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> gene to study the role of TMPRSS4 during influenza virus infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. RT-PCR analysis of knockout lung tissue confirmed the absence of the full-length 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> transcript (data not shown). No protein was detected in knockout mice by immunohistochemical staining (data not shown). 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic>-deficient mice showed normal reproduction rates and development and growth patterns and had no obvious abnormal phenotype (
