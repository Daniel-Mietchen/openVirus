 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with mouse-adapted PR8M virus (A/PuertoRico/8/34; H1N1). Both wild-type and 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice lost weight after infection, with comparable kinetics, and showed similar survival rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Analogous results were obtained after infection with two additional H1N1 virus variants (PR8F and A/WSN/33) (data not shown) and after infection with a multibasic, mouse-adapted H7N7 virus (A/Seal/Massachusetts/1/80) (data not shown). After infection with 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of mouse-adapted H3N2 virus (A/HongKong/01/68) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), body weight loss and survival were not different between the two mouse strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Also, no statistically significant difference was observed after infection with a lower dose (10 FFU) of H3N2 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>). Measurement of viral loads in lungs of infected mice revealed equal viral loads in wild-type and 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> knockout mice at days 2, 3, and 4 p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). These results indicated that loss of 
 <italic>Tmprss4</italic> in knockout mice does not protect mice from virus replication, spreading, or pathogenesis after infection with H3N2 or H1N1 influenza virus in comparison to wild-type mice.
