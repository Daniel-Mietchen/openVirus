  <p>Estimates of HIV incidence and log ratio-residuals for the seven study triplets.</p>
  <p>The plots show estimates of HIV incidence (plotted per 100 person-years upper panels) and log ratio-residuals (observed/expected HIV infections adjusted for age, sex and baseline HIV prevalence, lower panels) for Arm A vs. Arm C and Arm B vs. Arm C. Data are shown for the study period included in the primary endpoint analysis (PC12 to PC36). Colored lines represent each of the seven triplets (numbered 1 to 7). For HIV incidence, the size of the colored dot at the end of each line represents the number of events contributing to the incidence estimate for each community.</p>
