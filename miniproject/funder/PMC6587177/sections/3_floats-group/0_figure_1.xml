  <p>CONSORT diagram showing enrollment and follow-up of the Population Cohort.</p>
  <p>HPTN 071 (PopART) included 21 communities that were matched in seven sets of three communities each; the three communities in each triplet were randomized to Study Arms A, B, and C. The purpose of the Population Cohort (PC) was to enrol and follow a representative sample of residents to assess the impact of the PopART intervention on HIV incidence and viral suppression. Participants in the PC were enrolled from randomly selected households in the community; with one member aged 18-44 selected at random for eligibility assessment. The diagram shows the number of participants enrolled at the start of the study (PC0). Additional participants were enrolled in PC12N in communities with fewer than 2000 PC0 participants; additional participants were enrolled in Arms A and C in PC24N to preserve power for this comparison. The status of participants at each survey year (PC12, PC24, PC36) is reported. Individuals who missed yearly follow-up visits were eligible for subsequent annual surveys, individuals who were terminated were not. The percentage retained is the proportion of participants who completed a visit amongst those eligible for the visit.</p>
