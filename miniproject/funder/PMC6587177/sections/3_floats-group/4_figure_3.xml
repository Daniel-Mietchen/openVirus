  <p>Estimated ART coverage at the end of the study, by age and sex and study arm; estimated from the CHiPs data and extrapolated to total population aged ≥15 years</p>
  <p>The plot shows estimated ART coverage among the total population aged ≥15 years in Arm A and B communities at the end of the study, by sex, age-group and study arm. Coverage estimates are shown in black solid lines for Arm A and in blue dashed lines for Arm B. Lines for men are shown with a square symbol, and for women with a circle symbol. The UNAIDS 90-90-90 target for ART coverage (81%) is shown in red. The estimated number of HIV-positive men who were resident in the community at the time that CHIPs first visited their household during the third (and last) annual round of intervention, and remained resident in the study community at the end of the study, was 8,388 in Arm A and 8,948 in Arm B, and the estimated number of HIV-positive women was 15,936 in Arm A and 17,586 in Arm B. The estimated number of HIV-positive men on ART was 6,286 in Arm A and 6,378 in Arm B, and the estimated number of HIV-positive women on ART was 13,600 in Arm A and 14,481 in Arm B.</p>
