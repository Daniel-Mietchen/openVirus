<p>Between PC12 and PC36 (primary outcome), 553 incident HIV infections were observed during 39,702py follow-up (1.4/100py; women: 1.7/100py; men: 0.8/100py). Incidence in Arm C (geometric mean across communities) was 1.6/100py overall (

Incidence in Arm B was 1.1/100py; the AdjRR compared with Arm C was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.55-0.88, p=0.006). HIV incidence was lower in Arm B vs. Arm C in all seven matched triplets, while incidence was lower in Arm A vs. Arm C in only four triplets (

A permutation test based on the restricted randomization scheme showed even stronger evidence of an effect in Arm B vs. Arm C (p=0.001), but not in Arm A vs. Arm C (p=0.48). The findings were essentially similar when the analysis was restricted to PC participants enrolled at PC0 (Table S6).
