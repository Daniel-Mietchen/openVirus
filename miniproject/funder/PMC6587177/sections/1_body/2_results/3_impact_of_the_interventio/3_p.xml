<p>In Arm B vs. Arm C, subgroup analyses by sex (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and age and sex (Table S3) showed a greater effect on HIV incidence in men (AdjRR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.24-1.12) than women (AdjRR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.55-0.97), although this difference in effect could have occurred by chance (p for interaction = 0.40); there was also evidence of a greater effect in older participants (aged 25+; AdjRR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.43-0.76) than younger participants (18-24y; AdjRR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.70-1.20; p for interaction = 0.044). HIV incidence and estimated effects for individual years of follow-up, and for the entire study period (PC0-PC36) are shown in Tables S4 and S5. HIV incidence decreased in Arm C by 12% (95%CI:0%-23%) per year (Figure S5).
