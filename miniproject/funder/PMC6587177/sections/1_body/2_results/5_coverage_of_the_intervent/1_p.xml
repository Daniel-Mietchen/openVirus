<p>Based on CHiPs data, the estimated proportions of all HIV-positive adults who were on ART at the end of the study were 81% in Arm A and 80% in Arm B (Table S10). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref> shows estimated ART coverage by age and sex, indicating similar coverage in Arms A and B, lower coverage in men than women, and lower coverage among younger compared with older individuals. ART coverage was also similar in Arms A and B in most triplets (Figure S6).
