 </sup> The HPTN 052 trial showed that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation dramatically reduced HIV transmission among couples

 </sup>, and the PARTNER study showed that viral suppression (&lt;200 copies/ml) prevented HIV sexual transmission.

 </sup> Mathematical modeling predicted that HIV incidence would fall steeply if HIV testing were delivered throughout a population and ART initiated immediately after diagnosis.

 </sup> In 2015, the World Health Organization updated its guidelines recommending immediate ART for all HIV-positive individuals

 </sup>, and UNAIDS proposed 90-90-90 HIV testing and treatment targets (by 2020: 90% of HIV-positive individuals should know their status; 90% of those individuals should be on ART; and 90% of those on ART should be virally suppressed).
