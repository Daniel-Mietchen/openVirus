<p>The Arm B effect was consistent with pre-study model projections and was observed in both countries.

 </sup> Reduction in incidence was seen in all seven matched triplets in Arm B; this effect was very unlikely to have occurred by chance. UTT is hypothesized to reduce HIV transmission by increasing the proportion of HIV-positive community members who know their HIV status, the proportion of those individuals who are on ART, and the proportion of those on ART who are virally suppressed. Data from this study indicate that the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets were achieved by the end of the 3-year intervention in both Arm A and B communities. High levels of VS were observed among HIV-positive PC participants after 24m (~72%, increased from the baseline level of ~55%). This corresponds to a ~35% drop in the proportion of HIV-positive participants not virally suppressed, from ~45% to ~28%, consistent with the observed 30% reduction in HIV incidence in Arm B. The greater reduction in HIV incidence among men likely reflects greater uptake of the intervention and higher VS in women (thus protecting their male partners); a similar explanation applies for higher effectiveness in those aged over 25 years.
