<p>A limitation of the study was the relatively small number of randomized communities (seven/arm). The difference in observed effects in Arm A vs C and B vs C may thus be a chance finding, given the similar levels of ART coverage and VS in Arms A and B, and the similar nature of the Arm A and B interventions during most of the primary analysis period. To evaluate the overall effect of the PopART intervention vs standard of care, we therefore conducted a 
 <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis combining Arms A and B and found an estimated rate ratio of 0.81 (95%CI:0.66-0.99) compared with Arm C, consistent with a 20% reduction in incidence. Another limitation is that data on uptake of interventions among HIV-positive participants in the PC may be subject to a Hawthorne effect, because participants had regular contact with research staff offering HIV testing and providing referral to care. We would expect the Hawthorne effect to be greatest in Arm C, where PC participants did not have access to CHiP services for testing and referral. Thus, for uptake estimates we rely mainly on intervention data, which were only available from Arm A and B communities. Lastly, men were under-represented in the PC, and a substantial number of PC participants moved out of the community during follow-up and were censored from further observation. Thus, we cannot rule out selection bias although there was no evidence that these factors differed between study arms. Since men were under-represented in the PC, and a greater effect of the intervention was observed in men, the population-level effect may have been underestimated.
