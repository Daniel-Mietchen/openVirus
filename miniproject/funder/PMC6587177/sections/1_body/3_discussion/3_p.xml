<p>There are several possible explanations for the lack of an effect on HIV incidence when the PopART intervention was combined with universal ART (Arm A vs. Arm C). First, written informed consent was required for initiation of ART outside local guidelines from the start of the trial until 2016 (see supplementary text). This requirement for “research consent” may inadvertently have discouraged ART initiation, although this is not supported by data that show similar ART coverage and VS in Arms A and B. Second, wide-scale ART delivery in Arm A may have led to sexual disinhibition or de-emphasis of primary prevention messaging by CHiPs, offsetting the observed increase in VS. Data on self-reported risk behaviors do not support this hypothesis; further analyses are planned once data on HSV-2 seroconversion (a proxy for sexual risk behavior) become available. Third, while the three study arms appeared well matched with respect to baseline data, there may have been unrecognized differences across triplets in socio-demographic or other factors, such as mobility and migration resulting in exposure to HIV-positive partners from other communities.</p>
