 </sup>, and should be considered alongside those of the other three trials that measured the effect of UTT on HIV incidence in Africa, all of which were smaller and undertaken in largely rural communities. The TasP trial
 <sup>
  <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 </sup> found no effect on HIV incidence, which may have reflected the similar HIV testing services provided in the intervention and control arms, with low levels of ART coverage in both arms. The SEARCH trial
 <sup>
  <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
 </sup> also found no effect on HIV incidence, which may have reflected intensive baseline community-based HIV testing in both intervention and control arms. The Ya Tsie trial
 <sup>
  <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> observed a 30% reduction in incidence, which was of borderline statistical significance given the relatively small numbers of HIV seroconversion events.
