<p>Our finding of a 20-30% reduction in HIV incidence at population level was measured against a background of decreasing incidence in Arm C, possibly attributable to gradually increasing coverage of ART in the general population. This indicates that combination prevention including UTT can make a substantial contribution to HIV epidemic control. Importantly, the effects seen in our study, Ya Tsie study and others

 </sup> were achieved by delivering intensive household-based HIV-testing services; this may have played a more important role than changes in ART guidelines. The universal “test” component of a “test-and-treat” strategy is vital, as is continued attention to primary HIV prevention interventions.

 </sup> Results from planned cost-effectiveness and modeling studies will provide information on the value-for-money and long-term impact of such strategies which will help to inform policy and practice. ART coverage data from HPTN 071 (PopART), like data from other studies, draws special attention to the challenges in achieving ART coverage targets in young people, men, and communities with high mobility.

 </sup> If HIV transmission is concentrated in these subgroups, impact of UTT on HIV transmission may be compromised. Special efforts will be needed to address these coverage gaps to realize the full impact of UTT on HIV epidemic control.
