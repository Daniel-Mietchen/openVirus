<p>Strengths of the study included the large sample size, enrollment of a randomly-sampled cohort to measure HIV incidence and VS at community level, delivery of ART through routine services at government clinics, the availability of extensive process data used to improve and refine delivery of the intervention, and strong community engagement. While our study communities were not chosen to be representative of Zambia or South Africa as a whole, conduct of the study in large urban communities with high rates of mobility should increase the generalizability of the findings to other urban areas of Southern Africa with generalized HIV epidemics.</p>
