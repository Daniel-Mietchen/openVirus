<p>HPTN 071 (PopART) was conducted between 2013-2018, in 21 urban/peri-urban communities in Zambia and Western Cape Province, South Africa (total population ~1 million; average ~50,000/community). Each community was the catchment population of a government clinic. Communities were arranged in seven triplets matched on geographical location and estimated HIV prevalence. Communities in each triplet were randomly allocated to three study arms in simultaneous public ceremonies. Restricted randomization was used to ensure balance across study arms on population size, baseline ART coverage and HIV prevalence.
