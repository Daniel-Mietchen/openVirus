<p>The PopART intervention, delivered to Arm A and B communities only, was a combination prevention package (Figure S2). Specially trained community health workers (Community HIV-care Providers, CHiPs) delivered services at annual household visits (see supplementary text). CHiPs worked in pairs, each pair responsible for ~500 households. Data collected by CHiPs were used primarily to support service delivery but also to evaluate intervention coverage.</p>
