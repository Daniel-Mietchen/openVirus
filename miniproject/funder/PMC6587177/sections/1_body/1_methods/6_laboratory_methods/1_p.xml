<p>Laboratory-based HIV testing was performed for all PC participants at all visits. Central laboratories in South Africa and Zambia performed a single 4
 <sup>th</sup> generation HIV test. The HPTN Laboratory Center (LC, Baltimore, MD USA) performed additional testing to determine HIV status (see supplementary text). If seroconversion was confirmed, testing was performed to determine if the participant had acute infection at the prior visit. HIV viral load testing was performed at the HPTN LC for selected samples: all HIV-positive participants at PC24, and a random subset of ~75 HIV-positive participants per community at PC0, PC12 and PC36. HIV Viral load testing was performed using the Abbott Realtime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular Inc, Des Plaines, Il) utilizing a &lt;400 HIV RNA/ml threshold.
