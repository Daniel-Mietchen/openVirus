 </sup> Briefly, HIV incidence was measured in PC participants who were HIV-negative at enrollment; HIV infection was assumed to occur at the mid-point between the last HIV-negative and the first HIV-positive sample, or at a visit where acute infection was identified. When timing of infection was unclear because of missed visits, the time of infection was estimated by imputation (see supplementary text and Table S1). For the primary outcome, statistical inference used a two-stage approach recommended for CRTs with &lt;15 clusters/arm.

 </sup> At the first stage, Poisson regression on data from all three study arms was used to compute E, the expected number of events (incident HIV infections) in each community, after adjusting for age, sex and baseline HIV prevalence, assuming a null intervention effect. At the second stage, two-way analysis of variance was carried out on log(O/E) (log ratio-residuals), where O was the observed number of events in each community, with matched triplet and study arm as factors. The test statistic is the estimated difference in means of log(O/E) between study arms, with two-sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed using the t-distribution. The corresponding rate ratios and 95%CI for the comparison of Arms A and C, and Arms B and C, were calculated with exponentiation. Similar methods were used for the analysis of viral suppression, except that logistic regression was used at the first stage without adjustment for HIV prevalence. The robustness of the above analyses was assessed using a permutation test based on the restricted randomization scheme.
