 </sup> which suggested that HIV incidence might be reduced by up to 60% in Arm A and 25% in Arm B, compared with Arm C. Assuming HIV incidence in Arm C of 1.0 to 1.5 per 100 person-years (py), a between-community coefficient of variation (k) within matched triplets of 0.15-0.20, 2,500 PC participants/community with 85% HIV-negative at baseline, and 25% loss to follow-up over three years, study power would exceed 75% or 85% for effects of 35% or 40%, respectively.
