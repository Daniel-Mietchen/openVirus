<p id="Par10">Even though low-credibility and fact-checking sources show similar popularity distributions, we observe some distinctive patterns in the spread of low-credibility content. First, most articles by low-credibility sources spread through original tweets and retweets, while few are shared in replies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>); this is different from articles by fact-checking sources, which are shared mainly via retweets but also replies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In other words, the spreading patterns of low-credibility content are less “conversational.” Second, the more a story was tweeted, the more the tweets were concentrated in the hands of few accounts, who act as “super-spreaders” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This goes against the intuition that, as a story reaches a broader audience organically, the contribution of any individual account or group of accounts should matter less. In fact, a single account can post the same low-credibility article hundreds or even thousands of times (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). This could suggest that the spread is amplified through automated means.
