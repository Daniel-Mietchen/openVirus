<p id="Par19">Our results are robust with respect to various choices. First, using a more restrictive criterion for selecting low-credibility sources, based on a consensus among several news and fact-checking organizations (see Methods), yields qualitatively similar results, leading to the same conclusions. In addition, the findings are not driven by any single source associated with a large portion of the tweet volume. Second, our analysis about active spreaders of low-credibility content being likely bots is robust with respect to the activity threshold used to identify the most active spreaders. Furthermore, bot scores are uncorrelated with account activity volume. Third, the conclusions are not affected by the use of different bot score thresholds to separate social bots and human accounts. Details about all of these robustness analyses can be found in the Supplementary Discussion (Supplementary Figs.
