  <p>Popularity and bot support for the top sources. Satire websites are shown in orange, fact-checking sites in blue, and low-credibility sources in red. Popularity is measured by total tweet volume (horizontal axis) and median number of tweets per article (circle area). Bot support is gauged by the median bot score of the 100 most active accounts posting links to articles from each source (vertical axis). Low-credibility sources have greater support by bots, as well as greater median and/or total volume in many cases</p>
