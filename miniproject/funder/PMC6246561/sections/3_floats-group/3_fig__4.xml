   <bold>a</bold> Joint distribution of bot scores of accounts that retweeted links to low-credibility articles and accounts that had originally posted the links. Color represents the number of retweeted messages in each bin, on a log scale. 
   <bold>b</bold> The top projection shows the distribution of bot scores for retweeters, who are mostly human. 
   <bold>c</bold> The left projection shows the distribution of bot scores for accounts retweeted by likely humans who are identified by scores below a threshold of 0.4 (black crosses), 0.5 (purple stars), or 0.6 (orange circles). Irrespective of the threshold, we observe a significant portion of likely bots retweeted by likely humans
