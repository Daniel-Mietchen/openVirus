<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer about having a lower number of gaps when using longer reads, however it is most of the time true for de novo assembly. We used 2 x 75 just because that was the flowcell we had at the time of sequencing. Moreover, since we reference assembled a compact viral genome with no repetitive regions the small reads does not affected the assembly considerably. It can be observed on the high coverage breadth we obtained in our genomes. Lastly, the gaps were restricted to the 5’ and 3’ UTR regions that are more difficult to amplify and consequently to assembly, showing that the existing gaps was not due to the assembly problems because of the use of 75bp reads.</p>
