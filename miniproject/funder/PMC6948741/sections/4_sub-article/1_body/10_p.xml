<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer and we have carefully revised the English used. We’ve made changes, specially converting British English to American English in order to meet journal requirements. This include a small change on “neighbourhood” word in the title which now is "Persistence of Chikungunya ECSA genotype and local outbreak in an upper medium class neighborhood in Northeast, Brazil” </p>
