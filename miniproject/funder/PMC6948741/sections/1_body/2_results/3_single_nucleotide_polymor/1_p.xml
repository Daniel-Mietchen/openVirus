<p>We found a small number of SNPs per sample varying from 16 to 21 (b_29L and e_45SR = 16 SNPs, c_29SR = 29 and d_45PL and f_45FL = 21 SNPs). 71 out of 93 SNPs found are synonymous, 21 are non-synonymous and one generate a stop codon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226098.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly, 41 of all 93 SNPs detected are minor variants, that are supported by a substantial amount of reads but in a lower proportion compared with the reference nucleotide (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226098.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Eight of these correspond to non-synonymous changes.
