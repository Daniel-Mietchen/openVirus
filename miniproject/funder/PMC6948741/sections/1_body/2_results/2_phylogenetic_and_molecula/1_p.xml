<p>To investigate and to better understand the diversity of CHIKV in some of most affected municipalities in Bahia state, we generated 5 CHIKV near-complete genomes (coverage range 88.90%-99.82%, mean = 97,4%) (
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) using next-generation sequencing technologies. A regression of genetic divergence from root to tip against sampling dates confirmed sufficient temporal signal (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.80). Phylogenetic analysis indicates that new generated sequences belong to the ECSA genotype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0226098.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) which was detected for the first time in 2014 in Feira de Santana in the Bahia state. ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ECSA sequences from Serraria Brasil neighbourhood form a single well supported clade (bootstrap support = 1.0; posterior probability support = 1.0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0226098.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We estimated the date of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the Feira de Santana Clade to be around Mid-May 2016 (95% Bayesian credible intervals, BCI: June 2015 â€“February 2016,
