<p>All positive samples were submitted to a cDNA synthesis protocol using Protoscript II First Strand Sequencing kit (New England Biolabsâ€”NEB). Then, a multiplex PCR was conducted using Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and a sequencing primer scheme (divided into two separated pools) designed using Primal Scheme online tool to amplify 400 bp overlapping amplicons of the CHIKV complete genome (
