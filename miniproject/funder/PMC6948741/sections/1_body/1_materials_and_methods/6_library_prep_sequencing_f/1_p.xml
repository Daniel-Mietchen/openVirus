<p>Nextera XT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc) was used to construct a DNA library for each sample using dual barcodes. After library preparation each samples was quantified using NebnextÂ® library quant (Illumina Inc) following the manufacturer's instructions and normalized in equimolar quantities before loading the flow cell. The library was deep-sequenced using the MiSeq Illumina platform with 2 x 75 bp paired ends, which allow us to sequence both ends of a fragment and generate high-quality alignable sequence. Paired-end reads were demultiplexed using the vendor software from Illumina. Demultiplexed Illumina reads were mapped on the KP164568 reference genome using Bowtie2 program with default parameters (

Final consensus sequences were generated by the consensus module of Integrate Genome Viewer (

Any nucleotide variants on the primer regions were removed from the final consensus sequence.
