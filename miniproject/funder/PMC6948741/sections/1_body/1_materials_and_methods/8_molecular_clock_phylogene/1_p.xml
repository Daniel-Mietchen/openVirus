<p>In order to investigate the temporal signal in our CHIKV-ECSA dataset, we regressed root-to-tip genetic distances from this ML tree against sample collection dates using TempEst v 1.5.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ML phylogeny was used as a starting tree for Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using BEAST 1.10.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the Bayesian analyses, we used an HKY+4G substitution model with a Bayesian skygrid coalescent model with 20 grid points [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We computed MCMC duplicate runs of 50 million states each, sampling every 5.000 steps for the ECSA-BR dataset. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer v.1.7.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Maximum clade trees were summarized from the MCMC samples using TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in.
