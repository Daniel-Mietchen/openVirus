<p>Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed on samples using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System (PROMEGA) on an ABI7500 Real Time PCR Systems or a QuantStudio® Systems (Applied Biosystems). The CHIKV non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) was targeted using the primers CHIKV-F (5’ to 3’: 
 <monospace>AAAGGGCAAACTCAGCTTCAC</monospace>), CHIKV-R (5’ to 3’: 
 <monospace>GCCCTGGGCTCATCGTTATTC</monospace>) and the CHIKV Probe (5’ to 3’: FAM-
 <monospace>CGCTGTGATACAGTGGTTTCGTGTG</monospace>), based on an assay previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thermocycler conditions consisted of reverse transcription at 45°C for 15 mins followed by RT inactivation at 95° C for 2 mins, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 sec and annealing at 60° C for 1min.
