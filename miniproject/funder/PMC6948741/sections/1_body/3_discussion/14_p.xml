<p>Together, our results indicate the persistence of CHIKV ECSA lineage in the municipality of Feira de Santana and shed light to the risk of rise of a new localized outbreak. Our findings reinforce the needing of continuous genomic surveillance strategies and further studies on minor variants to track viral adaptations and to improve our understanding about CHIKV circulation in FS and to prevent new epidemics.</p>
