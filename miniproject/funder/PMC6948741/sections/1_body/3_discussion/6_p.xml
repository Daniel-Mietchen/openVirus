<p>Localized outbreaks have been reported in other locations like the two small villages from Ravenna in Italy in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and more recently in Coutos neighbourhood of the city of Salvador, Bahia state, Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These outbreaks were related to high density of the mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in the first study and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in the second, although no CHIKV infected mosquito was reported. According to epidemiological surveillance data from 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Rapid Index Survey (LIRAa), the house index (HI) in FS was 2.27% in 2016 and 1.39% in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The HI related to the infestation rates of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and provides qualified information for the municipalities to deploy arbovirus prevention and control strategies. According to Ministry of Health, HI values above 1% indicates risk of epidemics, thus, in 2016 FS was at risk of transmission of dengue and other arbovirus infections such as CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pone.0226098.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and may have had in impact on this outbreak.
