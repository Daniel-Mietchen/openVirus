<p>In addition, genomic surveillance is a powerful tool to monitor virus adaptation to mosquitoes vectors, making possible the study of CHIKV fitness and evolution in mosquito populations, foretelling increase in viral infectivity and the risk of its emergence [

Also, by using complete or near complete viral genomes, spatial-temporal analysis can be performed to infer viruses introduction and dispersion events in the past. This approach was employed in previous studies and have shown evidences of cryptic transmission of arboviruses such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya before the first case detection [
