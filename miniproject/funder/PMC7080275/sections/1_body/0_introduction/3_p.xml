<p>In contrast to such mainland hyperendemic settings, French Polynesia has a small population size (275 918 inhabitants, 2017 census) distributed on 72 isolated islands with a climate permissive for perennial mosquito-borne virus transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since 1944, French Polynesia Public Health authorities have reported 14 monotypic dengue epidemics often followed by long periods of low-level transmission and one recent heterotypic epidemic in 2013/4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Such a scenario offers a unique opportunity to address questions of viral persistence, turnover and the importance of spatial sub-structure in determining dengue epidemiology in small sized geographically isolated populations. Implicit in this first description of the data is the question as to whether French Polynesia is effectively a meta-population whereby DENV is maintained by island-hopping or whether there is a single major source of infection on the main island of Tahiti that subsequently feeds DENV into the smaller islands. We provide here the first collation, description and analysis of dengue dynamics in French Polynesia over a 35-year period, from 1978 to 2014.
