<p>Statistical analyses of the distribution of dengue cases were performed by fitting generalised linear models (GLM) to count data (loglinear regression) and proportion positive data (logistic regression). A dispersion parameter was estimated to account for any overdispersion of the data. Cross-correlation functions (CCF) for monthly dengue incidence (per 1000 individuals) across the entire 435 month period (August 1978 to October 2014) were calculated pairwise between the “capital” and the minor islands within each subdivision. Capital islands of each subdivision are defined as those being both highly inhabited and most connected to the other islands by air and boat. Only islands with six months or more incidence of dengue were analysed; thus 21 islands were included. In all cases, the capital islands of each subdivision were taken as the lead island. Then, because islands may be indirectly connected, we repeated the analysis with Tahiti and all other islands. We first examined whether there significant autocorrelation within each island that might generate spurious results. There was no significant autocorrelation within any island within the selected lag month period of 20 months used in the correlation analysis. CCFs were then plotted against log10 population migration between island pairs, using the 2010 air travel data. Absolute air travel volume has altered across the 35-year period but not relatively so across islands.</p>
