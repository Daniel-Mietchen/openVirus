<p>We next addressed the duration of viral transmission following at least two consecutive dengue incident months (when local viral transmission was presumed to be occurring) within an island as a function of population size, cumulative number of cases and DENV serotype. Local transmission was presumed to have stopped when there were three consecutive zero case months. The duration of viral circulation until three consecutive zero case months increased with island population size (RR = 1.7, 95%CI 1.39–2.07, P&lt;0.001) and the cumulative number of dengue cases (RR = 2.49, 95%CI 2.13–2.91, P&lt;0.001) (

DENV circulation was also longer for DENV-1 as compared to DENV-2, DENV-4 and the mixed DENV-1/3 epidemic (DENV-2: RR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.53–0.96, P = 0.025; DENV-4: RR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.51–0.79, P&lt;0.001; DENV-1/3: RR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.41–0.85, P = 0.004), but not DENV-3 (RR = 0.77, 95%CI 0.57–1.03, P = 0.076) (
