<p>From August 1978 until October 2014 (435 months) the dengue database registered 48 261 geolocated results from laboratory analyses of which 14 382 were recorded as positive for DENV. Thirty-five islands (Windward– 3; Leeward– 5; Australs– 5; Marquesas– 6; Tuamotu-Gambier– 16) had at least one confirmed dengue case (

The proportion of the population consulting for laboratory analyses from 1978 varied considerably among subdivisions, most notably being much lower in Tuamotu-Gambier (0.22%) compared to the other subdivisions (range 0.73% in the Australs to 1.31% in the Leeward islands). The age distribution of clinical presentations compared to the overall population was skewed by a higher percentage of children 0–1 years old presenting samples for testing (3.7% of this age group) and children aged 1–14 (1.7% of this age group) compared with 1% for older individuals. The age distribution of samples sent to the laboratory for analysis and those found positive was strongly correlated for both genders (Male r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.91; female r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.85; P&lt;0.001).
