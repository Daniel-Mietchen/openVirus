<p>During the 35-year study period, dengue epidemiology was characterized by intermittent mono-serotype epidemics followed by inter-epidemic low circulation periods. With exception of Tahiti, the most populated island of French Polynesia, viral die-out at an island level was frequent and the majority of the less populated islands had few cases and rarely for more than 2 consecutive months. Indeed, according to our analyses, there was a reduced probability of islands smaller than 10 000 individuals having even two consecutive dengue positive months and a strong impact of population size on the duration of viral circulation once initiated. This would suggest that the virus is unable to take hold in these conditions, whether due to previously acquired immunity or human or mosquito population density [

Implicit in this study was an assessment of whether there is evidence that a metapopulation approach to understanding the dynamics of dengue in French Polynesia is useful, based on classical concepts of synchrony and persistence. Dengue incidence was largely asynchronous across subdivisions, but partially synchronous within subdivision with correlations in dengue incidence occurring at zero or small lag times. It was also notable that correlations in incidence increased with inter-island population migration, irrespective of sub-division. These observations would support a meta-population structure to transmission within French Polynesia, where the virus hops from island to island, especially given that the critical community size to maintain virus was only achieved in Tahiti in 2002. However, the contribution of inapparent, subclinical infections cannot be underestimated and may be sufficient for Tahiti alone to maintain a source of transmission [
