  <p>Pattern of inter-annual variability of the monthly time-series of dengue incidence of (
   <bold>a</bold>) Aragua and (
   <bold>b</bold>) Carabobo regions. Main central panels: wavelet power spectrums (WPS) of dengue incidence. Right panels: Global spectrum (GS). Top panel over each WPS: Original time-series of dengue incidence data. The 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis of the WPS and GS describe the periods in years (e.g., period 1: annual cycles; period 2,3,4: inter-annual cycles). The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis of the GS shows the power at a given frequency (continuous line) with its significant threshold value of 5% (dashed line). In the WPS, the color code for power values ranges from dark blue for low values, to dark red for high ones. The areas surrounded by dotted-dashed lines are those including significant results (p &lt; 0.05). The area within the cone of influence (continuous line) in the WPS indicates the region not influenced by edge effects.
