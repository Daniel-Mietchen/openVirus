  <p>Wavelet coherence spectrum (WCS) of dengue incidence with sea surface temperature (SSTs) time-series for (
   <bold>a</bold>) Aragua and (
   <bold>b</bold>) Carabobo. The colors are coded as dark blue, for low coherence and dark red for high coherence between SST and dengue incidence time series. The 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis of the WCS describe the periods in years (e.g., period 1: variables cohered at annual cycles); period 2,3,4: variables cohered at inter-annual cycles). The areas surrounded by dotted-dashed lines are those including significant results (p &lt; 0.05). The cone of influence (continuous line) in the WCS indicates the region not influenced by edge effects.
