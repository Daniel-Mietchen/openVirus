<p id="Par29">We present evidence suggesting that ENSO and its related local climatic changes (above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall) have been important drivers of the biennial and triennial cycles of dengue in the northern part of Venezuela during the last 16-years. The significant upward trend observed in dengue incidence in Venezuela raises the question of its potential relationship with the concomitant increase in local temperatures in the main urban settings. Thus, future research should investigate how regional and local climate interact with viral transmission and with behavioural and other socio-economic factors to determine the population dynamics of dengue in Venezuela. Finally, our findings provide significant evidence of the relevant effect of climate on dengue dynamics and suggest that the local and regional climatic factors here studied should be included in an early-warning system for dengue and other
