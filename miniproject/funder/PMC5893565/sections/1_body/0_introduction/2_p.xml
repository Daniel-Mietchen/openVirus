 </sup>. At a seasonal scale, disease incidence is characterized by annual regular cycles. The strongest external drivers of this variation are the corresponding annual changes in rainfall and temperature, the main factors that affect the ecology of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and the virus. Both variables influence mosquito reproduction and mortality rates, the blood feeding frequency of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> female and the extrinsic incubation period of the virus which in turn, determines the degree and shape of human exposure to that infection

 </sup>. Some studies have associated these periodic outbreaks with global inter-annual climatic variations such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, since ENSO determines periodic changes in local climatic variables. Intrinsic factors like host immunity and host susceptibility have also been identified as explanatory factors of these periodic epidemics

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, a more comprehensive approach appeals to combine both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms to account for these inter-annual epidemic cycles
