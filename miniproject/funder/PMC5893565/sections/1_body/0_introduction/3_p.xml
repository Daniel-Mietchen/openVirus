<p id="Par4">Dengue is one of the NTDs of major public health importance in Venezuela, showing an increment in incidence, magnitude and frequency of outbreaks during the last years. The four DENV serotypes circulate in the country. Additionally, between 2014 and 2016, the country witnessed the explosive epidemic pattern of the two most recent (re)emergent arboviral diseases, chikungunya and Zika

 </sup>. Since dengue has become a serious burden in public health in Venezuela, year-to-year variation in the size of epidemics, are of particular concern. Therefore, two questions deserve attention: (i) Is there evidence for particular inter-annual (long-term) cycles in the temporal dynamics of dengue? (ii) If so, is the long-term pattern of dengue associated with climate variability? Understanding the inter-annual variability in the population dynamics of DENV can provide useful insights for disease programs and allow the development of more effective surveillance and early warning systems to predict disease risk in response to changes in climate.
