<p id="Par5">This study attempts, first, to search for confirmation of inter-annual cycles of dengue incidence in a time-series of disease data (2001â€“2016) from two highly endemic regions of northern Venezuela. Then, following the climate hypothesis, to address whether the local and regional climate variability may account for the observed inter-annual variation patterns of dengue incidence in this tropical epidemiological setting.</p>
