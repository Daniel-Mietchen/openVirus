<p id="Par26">How the El Niño event and related temperature and rainfall patterns affect disease transmission is a matter of conjecture. It is known that the relationship between local climate variables (e.g. precipitation and temperature) and dengue transmission can be complex, affecting both the dengue vector and the virus

 </sup> suggested that the relationship between climate and dengue might be clearer with temperature than with precipitation. Higher temperatures affect the growth rate of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, accelerate the rate of viral replication within the vector and decrease the length of the reproductive cycle, resulting in more infected female mosquitoes over a shorter period of time

 </sup> with the risk of major inter-annual dengue outbreaks. Particularly, it has been documented that higher temperatures (i.e. &gt;32 °C) decrease the length of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> oviposition cycles and egg laying; as a result, the female gonotrophic cycle is shorter whereas blood-feeding frequency is greater
