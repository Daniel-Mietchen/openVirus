<p id="Par25">Although several studies have tried to disentangle the effects of ENSO on dengue and other vector-borne diseases, this topic is still an area of active investigation together with the impact of climate change on infectious diseases

 </sup>. By analysing this pathway, we found that temperatures and rainfall periodicities corresponded to the interval of observed periodicity in ENSO (2–6 year periods). Likewise dengue inter-annual cycles corresponded roughly to those of temperature (especially maximum temperature) and rainfall within each region. Likewise, dengue epidemics coincided with positive anomalies of maximum temperatures, and negative anomalies of precipitation. Additionally, positive anomalies of maximum temperatures overlapped with an El Niño event, except for those anomalies that were registered between 2011 and early 2014. Our data is in agreement with that of Gagnon

 </sup> who reported that most of the dengue epidemic peaks happening in Colombia between 1981–1988 were associated with El Niño episodes and warmer temperatures. Interestingly, the local temperature records analysed here showed a significant upward trend. This phenomenon could be linked to an urban heat island effect (UHI), which generally occurs in urban settlements
