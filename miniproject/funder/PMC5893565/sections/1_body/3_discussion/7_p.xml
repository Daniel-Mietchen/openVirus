<p id="Par27">The complexity of the relationship between dengue dynamics and a local climatic factor such as rainfall is exemplified in our study by the positive correlations of dengue with rains in the seasonal period and the negative correlations in the 2–3-y periodic cycle. Differently, precipitation has a crucial influence on mosquito development, because it provides a suitable habitat for the stages of the mosquito life cycle that are water-dependent

 </sup>. Here, we found a significant coherence between dengue and precipitation at 1-year periods confirming that precipitation is an important driver of dengue occurrence at a seasonal scale as it has been extensively reported

 </sup>. Indeed, the appearance/increase of dengue cases commonly coincides with both an intensification of rain as observed in our study area and with vector abundance as reported elsewhere

 </sup>. In Venezuela, the occurrence of household-related potential breeding sites (used car tires, litter outdoors) are a risk factor for dengue transmission during the rainy season. Moreover, the lack of reliable piped water supply has prompted an ever more common behaviour of water storage both indoors and outdoors
