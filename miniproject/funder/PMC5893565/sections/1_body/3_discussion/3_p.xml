 </sup>. Here, however, we focused on characterizing the degree of influence of the ENSO regional event and local meteorological conditions on the temporal disease dynamics. We found a strong and significant coherence between the temporal pattern of dengue and that of these variables showing the role that climate plays in driving disease periodicity. Specifically, we identified a relationship between dengue incidence and SSTs at 2- to 3-year cycles across the two studied regions indicating the significant influence of El Ni√±o in shaping the cycle of dengue epidemics in northern Venezuela. A similar association was also detected between dengue and local climate variables such as minimum and maximum temperatures, with a less clear link observed between dengue and precipitation.
