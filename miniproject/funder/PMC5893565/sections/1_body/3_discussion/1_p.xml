<p id="Par21">We identified long-term (inter-annual) and short-term (seasonal) cycles of dengue incidence in two highly-endemic regions of Venezuela. A strong and significant association was found between dengue inter-annual cycles and ENSO, suggesting that El Niño events have been partly responsible for the periodic outbreaks of dengue in northern Venezuela. We propose that the mechanism of ENSO in driving dengue inter-annual cycles is via warmer local temperatures and lower precipitation. In the studied period, these results were evident in relevant epidemic years, including epidemics of great magnitude, such as the one of 2009–2010, the largest dengue epidemic ever recorded in Venezuela.</p>
