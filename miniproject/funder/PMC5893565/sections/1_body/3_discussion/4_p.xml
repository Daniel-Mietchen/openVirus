 </sup>. In Venezuela, temperatures tend to increase by an average of 0.5 °C during El Niño, and severe droughts and negative anomalies of soil moisture, river discharges and rainfall are registered during this climatic episode, the warm phase of the ENSO event. Consequently, warmer and dryer years occur compared with no-Niño years
