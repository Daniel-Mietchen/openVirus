<p id="Par16">Oscillations of dengue incidence at 3–4-years and 1-year scales (cycles) were identified and dominated the disease dynamics in the analysed time-series (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, these cycles were transient and varied in power. Strong and significant inter-annual cycles peaking around the 3–4-year frequency in Aragua and Carabobo were more pronounced after 2006–2007 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>) coinciding with the major dengue outbreaks of that period in the two regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The seasonal cycle had less power showing its highest intensity from 2008–2009 onwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>).
