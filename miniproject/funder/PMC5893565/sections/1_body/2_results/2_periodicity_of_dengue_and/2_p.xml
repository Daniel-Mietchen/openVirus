<p id="Par17">The wavelet power spectrum (WPS) of local rainfall and temperature exhibited strong significant power at a 1-year scale (seasonal) as expected. Moreover, inter-annual cycles at 3–6-years and 6-years were also detected for minimum and maximum temperatures, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Interestingly, a significant upward trend over time of the minimum and maximum temperatures was observed in both of the regions under study (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b–e</xref>). The periodicity of ENSO is depicted across monthly SST records in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. This time-series exhibited inter-annual variability at 2–3 and 5-years cycles during the time period of our study.
