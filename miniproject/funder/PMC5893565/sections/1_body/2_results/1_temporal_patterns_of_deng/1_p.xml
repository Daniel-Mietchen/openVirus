<p id="Par14">Overall, dengue incidence in Venezuela has exhibited a steady average increase of approximately 9.5% annually between 1991 and 2016 with an average of 39.5 cases x 100,000 inhabitants in the early 1990’s to a 10-fold higher mean incidence of 368 cases × 100,000 inhabitants in the last 6 years (2010–2016). An average national incidence of 157 cases × 100,000 inhabitants (range 13–438 cases × 100,000 inhabitants) was observed during these 26 years (Fig.

Moreover, from 2007 onwards, a total of six epidemic years (years 2007, 2009–2010, 2013, 2014, 2015) were recorded nationally with an intensification in the frequency and magnitude of these outbreaks in comparison with only 4 epidemic years in the previous 16 years (years 1995, 1997–1998, 2001). Overall, most of these epidemic years coincided with an El Niño event (Fig.

Six major outbreaks encompassing eight epidemic years (2001, 2007, 2009–2010, 2012–2013, 2014 and 2015) were observed in Aragua (Fig.
