<p id="Par18">We evaluated the correspondence of the WPS of dengue and SSTs through WC analysis. As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows, there was a significant but non-continuous coherence between both variables at 1-year and 2- to 3-year scales across the two studied regions. In Aragua state, dengue incidence mainly cohered with SST from 2007 to 2012 at 2- to 3-year cycles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). In this region, the 1-year coupling between both signals was stronger than in Carabobo region where instead, the link between dengue and ENSO showed a longer (2005–2013) and significant result at the 2- to 3-year scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). There were significant but transient coherences between dengue incidence and rainfall (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a,b</xref>), and dengue incidence with minimum (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2c,d</xref>) and maximum temperatures (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2e,f</xref>) at the annual (1 year) and 2- to 3-year scales across the two regions. In order to explore the role of inter-annual variations of ENSO on the local climate, WC analysis of these variables were performed tackling the regions under study (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). All climatic variables signals cohered with SST-time series at the seasonal (annual) scale. Furthermore, local climate variables transiently coincided with SSTs signals at the 2- to 6-year scale.
