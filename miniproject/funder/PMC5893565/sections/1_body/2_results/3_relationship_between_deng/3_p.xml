<p id="Par20">Cross Correlation Functions (CCF) were calculated to identify relevant associations between dengue incidence and climatic variables at a finer temporal scale (monthly). There was no difference in time lags between both Aragua and Carabobo regions for all CCF. Significant correlations between dengue and SSTs were found at similar lags of 4–5 months for both regions, with highest correlation values at lag 4 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.14) and lag 5 (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.25) for Aragua and Carabobo, respectively. Likewise, dengue had a significant and positive association with rainfall taking place two months earlier than dengue in Aragua and Carabobo (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.23 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.32, respectively). Finally, high frequencies of dengue incidence were positively correlated with high values of maximum temperatures occurring six months previously for Aragua (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.15, p &lt; 0.05) and 6–7 months previously for Carabobo (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.36; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas similar associations were found between dengue incidence and the minimum temperature at lags of 3 (range 3–5) and 5 (range 3–6) months (Aragua: 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.26 and Carabobo: 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.29; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
