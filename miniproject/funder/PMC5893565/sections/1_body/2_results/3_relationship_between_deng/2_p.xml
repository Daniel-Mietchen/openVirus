 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows the plots for standardized anomalies of maximum temperature, SST and dengue cases in the regions of interest. Accordingly, five El Niño events took place during our study period: 2002–2003 (moderate), 2004–2005 (weak), 2006–2007 (weak), 2009–2010 (moderate) and 2014–16 (strong, Mega Niño). The 2014–2016 El Niño event is one of the strongest ever recorded. Likewise, five La Niña events occurred during the following periods: 2000–2001 (weak), 2007–2008 (moderate), 2010–2011 (moderate), 2011–2012 (weak), 2016–2017 (weak). We found for both nation-wide and Aragua region that four out of seven disease epidemics coincided with an El Niño episode from 2007 to 2015 (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). This association was found specifically on the dengue epidemic years of 2007 (El Niño 2006–2007), 2009–2010 (El Niño 2009–2010), and 2015 (El Niño 2014–2016). Similarly, for Carabobo region, five out of seven epidemics co-occurred with an El Niño episode. Here, the relationship was detected specifically for the dengue epidemic years of 2005 (local dengue epidemic year, El Niño 2004–2005), 2007 (El Niño 2006–2007), 2009–2010 (El Niño 2009–2010) and 2015 (El Niño 2014–2016) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>). Positive anomalies of maximum temperature corresponded with anomalies of ENSO. We also found that positive anomalies of dengue cases (epidemic years) coincided with maximum temperature anomalies. The previous is noteworthy, since some epidemics that did not coincide with ENSO, concurred with positive anomalies of maximum temperatures. This correspondence between dengue and maximum temperatures occurred in almost all epidemic years. In Aragua region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>) this relationship was present for the epidemic years of 2001, 2007, 2009–2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015; while in Carabobo region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b</xref>), this association occurred on the epidemic years of 2005, 2009–2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015–2016.
