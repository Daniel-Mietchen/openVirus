<p id="Par10">Because disease and climatic time-series, as well as their associations, can be strongly non-stationary (varying in time), a specialized time series analysis method known as wavelet analyses (WA) was applied to detect the periodic cycles and dominant components (i.e. the most frequently repeated signal) of the time series and how they change over time

 </sup>. In addition, wavelet coherency (WC) methodology was used to compare the frequency components of dengue and climate time-series in order to quantify the statistical (linear) association between variables in a time span
