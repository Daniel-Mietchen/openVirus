<p id="Par11">Additionally, the linear relationship of monthly dengue incidence with monthly observations of climatic variables were also explored through cross-correlation functions (CCF). Finally, we calculated the standardized anomalies of dengue incidence, precipitation and temperatures of our study period by subtracting from each seasonal observation (e.g., 
 <bold>D</bold>ec
 <bold>J</bold>an
 <bold>F</bold>eb, 
 <bold>M</bold>ar
 <bold>A</bold>p
 <bold>M</bold>ay, 
 <bold>J</bold>un
 <bold>J</bold>ul
 <bold>A</bold>ug, 
 <bold>S</bold>ep
 <bold>O</bold>ct
 <bold>N</bold>ov) the long-term (16years) mean value of each particular season and dividing this by the long-term seasonal standard deviation.
