<p id="Par9">The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the strongest inter-annual climate cycle on Earth

 </sup>. It is an atmosphere-ocean coupled system that produces quasi-periodic short-term climate and sea surface temperature (SST) changes over the Pacific region with an impact on weather patterns in several countries of the Americas, Africa, and Asia

 </sup>. SSTs are used as an index of ENSO. This climate system oscillation occurs approximately every 3–7 years

 </sup>, fluctuating between two extremes known as El Niño corresponding to the warm phase (positive SST anomaly), and La Niña, the cooling phase (negative SST anomaly). El Niño, in fact, refers to the unusual warming of SST. ENSO can be characterized using the Niño 3.4 index, the SST anomaly in the Niño 3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific. El Niño event in turn can be classified according to the SST anomaly index into three categories: weak (0.5 to 0.9 SST anomaly), moderate (1.0 to 1.4 SST anomaly) or strong (&gt;1.5 SST anomaly)
 <sup>

 </sup>. The onset of El Niño events occurs during spring in the Northern Hemisphere, encompassing two calendar years
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. The events are generally characterized by positive anomalies of SSTs that increase during the Northern Hemisphere’s spring, summer and fall of the first year (Year 0), with the maximum SST anomalies occurring during the winter months (December-January-February) of the following year (Year + 1) and SST anomalies decreasing during the spring and summer of the year + 1. El Niño is the main cause of the inter-annual variability of local climate in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean including the northern coast of South America

 </sup>. In Venezuela, El Niño is related with negative anomalies of precipitation, soil moisture and river flows, along with positive (warmer) air temperature anomalies

 </sup> while La Niña has the opposite effect, with cooler temperatures and positive anomalies of precipitation. Here, we used the monthly SST of the eastern and central tropical Pacific as an index of ENSO-region 3.4 (Niño 3.4 index). The SST time-series were obtained from the Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
