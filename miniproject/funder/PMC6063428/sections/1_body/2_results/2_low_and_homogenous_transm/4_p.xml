<p>Finally, when comparing both results obtained for each population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, we observed significant differences between the population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Samoa and both 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> populations after 9 dpi for ZIKV infection. Concerning the ZIKV dissemination, few significant differences were observed for the last analysis point (21 dpi) between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from New Caledonia and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis (p = 0.044) and between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from French Polynesia (p = 0.041). However, no significant difference was found between the two mosquito species for ZIKV transmission.
