<p>Our results confirmed that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from New Caledonia, Samoa and French Polynesia can transmit ZIKV but with low transmission efficiencies (&lt; 17% until 21 dpi). In addition, even if the infection rates seemed to indicate a better infection of the New Caledonian and the French Polynesian 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations, the transmission efficiency was similar for all populations tested according to our tests. Similar results were obtained in the present study for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> with infectious viral particles found in the two populations tested, thus demonstrating the potential role of this mosquito species in transmitting ZIKV (&lt; 3% until 21 dpi). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the infection rates seemed to indicate heterogeneous profiles, this profile was more homogeneous for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic>. The Samoan population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and the French Polynesian population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> seemed to be less susceptible to the infection than the populations from the other study sites. A previous study performed in French Polynesia with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> showed higher ZIKV transmission rates (3, 8, 36 and 73% at 6, 9, 14 and 21 dpi) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Such discrepancies may be explained by differences in the experimental protocol: the previous competence work was performed using F16 to F18 generation mosquitoes; moreover, the detection of infectious particles in mosquito saliva was performed on C6/36 instead of Vero cells. The fact that previous experiments were conducted using the French Polynesian instead of New Caledonian ZIKV strain may also be another possible explanation to such dissimilarity, but in both studies the vector competency for ZIKV was confirmed. In contrast to DENV that was previously found as highly disseminating in the New Caledonian and French Polynesian 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the dissemination rates for ZIKV indicated limited escape from the midgut barrier [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Finally, Australian 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> has been recently tested for ZIKV transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The results showed high prevalence of virus in the saliva. However, the ZIKV strains used although belonging to the Asian lineage was isolated in Cambodia in 2010 (before ZIKV outbreak) thus not harboring the specific amino acids substitution of the Asian American or Pacific sublineage [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Differences in the susceptibilities to ZIKV depending on the mosquito species and population, suggest that the outcome of mosquito infection may vary depending on virus-mosquito pairing described as genotype-by-genotype interaction [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, the efficiency of ZIKV in overcoming the midgut infection and escape barrier may be influenced by several factors, notably the microbiome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and innate immunity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] which could be both related to the breeding site environment [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The role of the salivary glands as a barrier seemed to be observed for all the populations tested.
