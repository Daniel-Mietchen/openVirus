<p>The Pacific landscape promotes specific environmental conditions that have influenced the genetic of the main arboviruses vector

 <italic>Aedes</italic> species from the Pacific region with an Asian/Pacific ZIKV strain that circulated in this region. As the Pacific was at the origin of the ZIKV pandemic, there is a real interest in investigating the interactions between arbovirus and Pacific vectors at a regional scale.
