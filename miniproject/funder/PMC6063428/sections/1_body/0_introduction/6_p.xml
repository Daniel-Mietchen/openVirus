<p>For this purpose, we collected three field populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in New Caledonia (West Pacific), Samoa (Center) and French Polynesia (East) in order to evaluate and compare the vector competence of several populations of the main Pacific vector. Additionally, we collected two field populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> in Wallis (from the Territory of Wallis and Futuna Islands) (Center) and Tahiti (French Polynesia) (East) to evaluate the vector competence of this potential regional vector and to compare the results obtained for these two 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors. We performed these vector competence studies with the ZIKV Pacific strain which circulated in New Caledonia in 2014 and belongs to the Asian/Pacific clade.
