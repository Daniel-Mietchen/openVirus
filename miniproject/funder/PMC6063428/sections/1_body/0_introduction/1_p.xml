<p>Zika fever is an emerging vector borne disease caused by a single stranded RNA virus, Zika virus (ZIKV) belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ZIKV is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected vectors mainly 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since its first isolation in Uganda in 1947, ZIKV has been detected occasionally in Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first human outbreak was declared in Yap state in Federated States of Micronesia in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ZIKV reemerged in the Pacific region in 2013 in French Polynesia and then spread across the region and to the Americas between 2014 and 2016 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This recent outbreak was associated with neurological disorders as Guillain-Barré syndrome [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006637.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The 2013–2016 outbreak was due to the emergence of ZIKV belonging to Asian lineage, and genetic analysis revealed divergence between the Pacific and the American clades [
