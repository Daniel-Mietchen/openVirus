<p>The Trachoma Amelioration in Northern Amhara (TANA) study was a four-arm community-randomized trial of azithromycin MDA strategies for trachoma control, including annual (ages ≥ 1 year), biannual (ages ≥ 1 year), quarterly (ages 1–9 years), and delayed treatment.

 </sup> Trachoma Amelioration in Northern Amhara took place in Amhara, Ethiopia, and mortality results were reported for the period from 2006 to 2007. Mortality was measured via a door-to-door census annually before the annual treatment phase. Communities were followed for 12 months, and all-cause child mortality was a prespecified secondary outcome. In this analysis, we restricted mortality data only to children aged 12–59 months for consistency with other studies. Children less than 12 months of age were not treated in TANA and, thus, were not included in this analysis.
