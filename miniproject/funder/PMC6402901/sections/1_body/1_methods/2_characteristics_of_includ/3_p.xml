<p>The Partnership for the Rapid Elimination of Trachoma (PRET) study was a three-country study of annual azithromycin MDA (ages ≥ 6 months) compared with only biannual treatment of children (ages 6 months–12 years). Mortality data were available and prespecified as a secondary outcome for the Niger study.

 </sup> In Niger, communities were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to annual azithromycin MDA with an 80% coverage target, annual azithromycin MDA with a 90% coverage target, biannual azithromycin MDA with 80% coverage, or biannual azithromycin MDA with 90% coverage. Mortality was determined by a door-to-door census conducted before each annual treatment phase. The communities were followed for 36 months. Children aged 6–59 months were included in the mortality analysis.
