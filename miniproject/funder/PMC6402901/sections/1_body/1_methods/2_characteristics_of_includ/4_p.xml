 </sup> The communities were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to biannual azithromycin MDA or biannual placebo distribution to preschool children (ages 1–59 months). Mortality was measured via a door-to-door census conducted before each treatment phase. Communities were followed for a 24-month period, and the primary prespecified outcome was all-cause mortality as determined by the census. Children aged 1–59 months were included in the mortality analysis.
