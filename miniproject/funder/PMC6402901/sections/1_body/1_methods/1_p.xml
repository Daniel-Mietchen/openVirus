<p>To identify trials, we searched Medline using the key words “mortality” and “azithromycin or zithromax” from inception through November 22, 2018. Titles and abstracts were reviewed by the C. E. O., and studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the pooled analysis. Trials were eligible for inclusion in the pooled analysis if they randomized communities to azithromycin MDA strategies and reported all-cause child mortality as a prespecified outcome. Individually randomized studies were excluded as the research question was focused on community-level mass azithromycin distribution for prevention of child mortality. Studies reporting any azithromycin indication (e.g., for trachoma control or not) were eligible for inclusion. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they prespecified the mortality outcome and the statistical analysis plan a priori. The outcome of interest was all-cause mortality in children aged less than 5 years. We used individual data from each trial to estimate the effect of azithromycin on all-cause mortality in children up to 59 months of age, even if the original study reported a wider age range. Only children in an age range that was eligible for treatment were included in the analysis.</p>
