<p>We conducted a two-stage individual community data meta-analysis using community-level data from each study. All analyses were conducted at the community level (the level of randomization) to account for the cluster-randomized nature of the studies and were intention-to-treat. For the first stage, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for each country from each study separately using a negative binomial model. We then used the individual study IRRs and their variances and pooled the estimates into a single summary measure using a random effects model, with a separate random effect for each country from each study (five random effects total) using the 
 <italic>metafor</italic> package in R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator was used to estimate Ï„2. We estimated heterogeneity across trials with the 
 <italic>I</italic>2 statistic. The primary analysis considered each country and each trial separately to assess heterogeneity by country (e.g., including both geography and background mortality rates at the time the study was conducted). To estimate the pooled risk difference, we calculated study-specific incidence rates in the azithromycin and control arms and used random effects meta-analysis with an REML estimator to calculate the pooled estimate. We assessed heterogeneity of effect estimates by country of origin and the background under-5 child mortality rate (U5MR) as determined by the mortality rate in the control arm of the study. We built separate random effects models for each moderator of interest using the 
 <italic>metafor</italic> command in R. As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the primary analysis excluding one study in which all communities received at least annual azithromycin MDA (e.g., excluding the PRET-Niger study).
