<p>Some heterogeneity in study-specific effects is likely because of the design of individual studies included in this analysis. The cluster-randomized trials that were designed for trachoma endpoints included in this analysis did not include a placebo control group.

 </sup> This could cause bias in outcome assessment, given that census activities were tied to treatment activities. The biggest anticipated threat would be that fewer deaths would be discovered in untreated communities because census/treatment teams would not have contact with these communities during the study. Such bias does not seem to have been present, however, because a protective effect of azithromycin MDA on mortality was observed even in studies with an untreated control group. However, if deaths were missed in the untreated arm of these studies, these results could be an underestimate of the true effect of azithromycin MDA.
