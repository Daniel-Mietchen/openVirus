<p>The results of this study must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. As previously described, not all studies included a placebo arm. Treatment and control strategies differed across studies, which likely introduced additional heterogeneity. Detection of heterogeneity in treatment effects (effect modification) with rare outcomes is difficult even in large trials.

 </sup> Although individual study results differed qualitatively across space and time, there were no statistically significant effect modifiers. To date, only a limited number of studies have evaluated the efficacy of azithromycin for child mortality. All studies included in this pooled analysis were conducted by the same group of investigators. If azithromycin MDA is scaled up in the context of child mortality reduction programs, continual evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention will be essential to determine when to stop.
