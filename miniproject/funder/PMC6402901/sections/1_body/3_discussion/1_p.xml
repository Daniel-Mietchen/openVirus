<p>Across three studies in four countries that met our inclusion criteria, under-5 child mortality (U5M) was 14% lower in communities receiving azithromycin MDA than in control communities, although effect estimates between studies showed some degree of heterogeneity. It is tempting to hypothesize that heterogeneity was driven primarily by the background mortality rate, but there was no significant difference by child mortality rate or country of the study site. However, detection of effect modification is difficult in studies of rare outcomes such as child mortality.

 </sup> Even in this large pooled analysis, detection of statistically significant effect modification may not be possible. The potential absolute number of lives saved with azithromycin MDA will be greater in scenarios with more child mortality events (higher baseline U5MR, or areas with an outbreak or epidemic of disease amenable to treatment with azithromycin), even if the proportion is similar between settings overall. In general, studies conducted in communities with higher baseline mortality had larger effect sizes, indicating that azithromycin MDA may be the most efficacious in high child mortality burden settings. Child mortality continues to decline over time in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa.

 </sup> It is possible that geographic indication of azithromycin for child mortality reduction could differ across space and time.
