<p>Programmatic use of azithromycin MDA for the prevention of child mortality could introduce additional macrolide selection pressure if it were not similarly time limited. Therefore, understanding the drivers of heterogeneity in treatment effects in time and space is essential for targeting azithromycin interventions to regions that would benefit the most to minimize resistance. The results of the present analysis suggest that consideration of baseline child mortality rates (which differ over time and with geography), the size of the population targeted, and the anticipated coverage rate may be important when deciding where to implement azithromycin MDA to reduce U5M.</p>
