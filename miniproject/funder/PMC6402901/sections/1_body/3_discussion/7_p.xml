<p>The results of this analysis demonstrate a significant protective effect of azithromycin MDA to preschool children on all-cause mortality in studies reported over a nearly 10-year period. There was some heterogeneity in effect estimates, likely reflecting both changes over time and space, and differences in study design. Although the precise mechanism of action of azithromycin for prevention of child mortality remains unknown, these results indicate a potentially important role of azithromycin MDA for mortality reduction in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
