<p>Although the reason for the differences in efficacy of azithromycin MDA in each study setting is unclear, there are several potential reasons why efficacy may differ. Under-5 child mortality is not normally distributed and the underlying causality may vary greatly in time and space. If the underlying mortality driver is periodic outbreaks or epidemics of viral meningitis or rotavirus, for example, the effect of azithromycin MDA is likely to be far less than in a setting in which bacterial respiratory tract infection, bacterial diarrhea, and/or malaria is the driver of high mortality. In general, the largest effect sizes were seen in countries with larger mortality rates in the placebo arm and higher country-level mortality rates, larger samples, and higher coverage with azithromycin MDA. Child mortality is a rare event even in high-burden settings. In low- and medium-burden settings where child mortality is a very rare event, absolute effect sizes will necessarily be small, and there will be limited power to detect relative differences. Differences in causes of death by study site or time point may affect the efficacy of azithromycin, for example, if causes of death in one location are more often an infectious agent that is susceptible to azithromycin than others. Differences in background antibiotic use and susceptibility to macrolides of bacterial pathogens may also contribute to heterogeneity. Azithromycin distribution may have reduced efficacy for prevention of mortality in areas that have increased macrolide resistance. It is possible that underlying pathogens that contributed to mortality and morbidity or their antibiotic susceptibilities differed across geography and time in the included studies.</p>
