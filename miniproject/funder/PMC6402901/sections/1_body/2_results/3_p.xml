<p>We explored several sources of heterogeneity, including country and background child mortality rate. Study sites with a higher mortality rate in the placebo arm tended to have greater absolute differences in the rate of child mortality between the azithromycin and the placebo arm (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06).
