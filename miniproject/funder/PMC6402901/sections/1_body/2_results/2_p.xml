<p>Across all studies and countries, in a random effects model taking into account between-study heterogeneity, there was a 14.4% reduction in mortality in communities that received azithromycin MDA versus control communities (pooled IRR: 0.856, 95% CI: 0.783–0.937, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0007; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). There was moderate heterogeneity across studies (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 22.6%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.11). The pooled incidence rate difference was 2.9 fewer deaths per 1,000 person-years in azithromycin-treated communities than in placebo communities (95% CI: −5.6 to −0.3 deaths per 1,000 person-years, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). The results were robust to exclusion of the PRET-Niger study, in which the control arm included annual mass azithromycin distribution (pooled IRR: 0.865, 95% CI: 0.770–0.972, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02).
