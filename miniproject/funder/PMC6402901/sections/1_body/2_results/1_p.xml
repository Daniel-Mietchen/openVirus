<p>A total of 449 unique titles and abstracts were identified and reviewed. Reasons for exclusion included that the study did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g., was nonrandomized or individuals randomized, in adults; did not evaluate azithromycin; or did not report mortality, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 194); was an editorial, review, case report, or other non-empirical report (
 <italic>N</italic> = 190); or was a nonhuman study (
 <italic>N</italic> = 62). We identified three cluster-randomized trials undertaken in 1,608 communities from four countries (e.g., Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania) that met the inclusion criteria.

 </sup> Azithromycin interventions included annual, biannual, and quarterly MDA to the whole community or to children only (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Control communities included distribution of matching placebo (MORDOR), delayed azithromycin MDA (TANA), and annual azithromycin MDA (standard of care for trachoma-endemic communities, PRET). Across all studies and all sites, a total of 5,486 deaths were observed over 344,905 person-years (mortality rate 15.9 per 1,000 person-years, 95% CI: 15.3–16.1). In azithromycin-treated communities, the mortality rate was 14.4 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 13.9–15.0), compared with 17.0 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI: 16.4–17.6) in untreated communities.
