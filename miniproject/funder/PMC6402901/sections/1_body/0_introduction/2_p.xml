<p>In a cluster-randomized trial of azithromycin MDA for trachoma control, communities receiving azithromycin had significantly decreased all-cause child mortality compared with communities receiving no treatment.

 </sup> In a subsequent three-country study designed specifically to assess the efficacy of azithromycin MDA for reduction in child mortality, biannual azithromycin MDA to preschool children decreased all-cause child mortality by 13.5% compared with communities receiving placebo.

 </sup> However, the efficacy of mass azithromycin for the reduction in mortality differed substantially across the sites included in the trial, although there was no statistically significant difference between the countries. The strongest effect by far was seen in the Niger site, which had the highest baseline child mortality rate, the greatest number of child-years of observations, the lowest loss to follow-up, and the highest coverage with MDA. As such, the greatest number of events to report on arose from Niger.
