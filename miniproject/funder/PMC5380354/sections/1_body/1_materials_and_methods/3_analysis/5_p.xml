  <label>(Eq 1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>λ</italic> is the growth rate of the epidemic curve and 
 <italic>t</italic> is time. A regression with negative binomial errors was fitted to the weekly occurrence of dog rabies cases to estimate 
 <italic>λ</italic>, for the epidemics from 1914 to 1921 and from 1922 to 1933, respectively. The start and end points used for the estimation of 
 <italic>λ</italic> for these time series were from the week when the first case was reported after 4 weeks without any detected cases until the week with the most cases. The 4 weeks gap was used to avoid data from the last epidemic. For a partially immunized population, an effective reproductive number 
 <italic>R</italic>, defined as the number of secondary infections that arise from a typical primary case when control measures are in place, could also be calculated. However when these outbreaks started, vaccination was thought to be very rare (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">discussion</xref>). 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was therefore estimated using 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0005435.e001">Eq 1</xref>, sampling 5,000 times from the values between the 90% CIs of 
 <italic>λ</italic> under equal probability, and from the gamma distribution of 
 <italic>Ts</italic>.
