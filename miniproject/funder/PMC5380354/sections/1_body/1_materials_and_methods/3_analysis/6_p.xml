<p>The relationship between annual rabies cases in dogs and dog-bite injuries was tested using negative binomial regression, with annual cases of dog-bite injuries as the outcome variable. Negative binomial regression was chosen because the residual deviance in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with Poisson errors showed overdispersion (residual deviance: degree of freedom ratio was 2.2 &gt; 1.5 [

The relationship between one year lagged annual dog rabies cases and dog-bite injuries was also examined, as was the relationship between annual cases of hydrophobia and dog rabies cases. We tested for temporal trends in the probability of a bite victim developing hydrophobia using GLMs with binomial errors. The sex ratio of bite victims was compared using the chi-square test based on the one-sample proportion test with continuity correction.
