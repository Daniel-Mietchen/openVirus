<p>We investigated how the occurrence of dog rabies cases was affected by human population density using Mixed-effects models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the first model, the logged number of dog rabies cases per km
 <sup>2</sup> in each administrative unit was the response variable, with logged human population per km
 <sup>2</sup> in each administrative unit a fixed effect, and year and administrative units random effects. In the second model, the logged number of dog rabies cases per capita was the response variable, with the same fixed and random effects as the first model. No dog population records were available for these administrative units.
