<p>Several dates relating to animal rabies cases were recorded in the prefectural reports including the dates of disease onset, the bite, the diagnosis, and when the animal was killed or died. The earliest date reported was used as the date of notification for analysis in this study. For available data mainly from prefectural reports, supplemented by newspaper reports, the distributions for the periods between notification and death, due to disease or being killed, were estimated by fitting gamma distributions to these intervals. Distributions of the incubation period, and the period between symptom onset and death in humans were also estimated by fitting a gamma distribution to these data extracted from newspapers using the fitdist function in R version 3.0.2 [
