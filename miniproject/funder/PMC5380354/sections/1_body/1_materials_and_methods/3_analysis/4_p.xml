<p>Serial intervals (
 <italic>Ts</italic>s), the periods between the date of disease onset in an index case and the disease onset in the subsequent secondary case [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], were estimated. Records of direct transmission between dogs were not available. We therefore defined an index case as the first case observed in an administrative unit where no previous rabies cases had been recorded for the preceding six months in the focal unit and surrounding units that lie within or overlap with areas of one-kilometer distance from the boundary of the focal administrative unit. Secondary cases were defined as the second case recorded in the area defined above. We considered a six-month interval without detected cases and a 1km radius, sufficient to isolate an index case as very few incubation periods are thought to exceed this interval [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and because most distances moved by rabid dogs are thought to be less than 1 km [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A gamma distribution was fitted to these serial intervals. As the number of serial intervals calculated was limited, and there was no obvious temporal trend by observation, single 
 <italic>Ts</italic> distribution was fitted using data between 1914 and 1933.
