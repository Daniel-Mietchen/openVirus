<p>The annual number of human rabies cases (hydrophobia) in Osaka Prefecture in 1920, and between 1924 and 1928 were extracted from 1920 population census data which included infectious disease information [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and Tokyo Metropolitan Police reports, respectively. About 50–80% of rabies patients develop hydrophobia, which is a characteristic and the most specific manifestation of the disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Rabies patients who develop hydrophobia may initially experience pain in the throat or difficulty swallowing, and particularly later in the course, hydrophobic spasms of the inspiratory muscles occur, associated with terror in attempting to swallow water [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the archival reports in Japan, only ‘hydrophobia’ was recorded, and the physicians that diagnosed them, under the infectious disease prevention law, reported cases to prefectures. At that time, Tokyo Metropolitan Police received all reports of human rabies cases from throughout Japan. For the other years (1914 to 1919, 1921 to 1923, and 1929 to 1933), human cases recorded in newspapers were collected and the age and sex of victims, and the dates of exposure, symptom onset, and death were extracted.
