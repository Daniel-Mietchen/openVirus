<p>A ban of inter-prefectural dog movement in limited areas in 1919 seemed ineffective for rabies control, and the nation-wide epidemic grew from 1921. The second epidemic was widespread and appeared to involve neighboring prefectures. In 1922, the animal infectious disease prevention law was established [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and dog vaccination became available for inter-prefectural movement of dogs. However, this still did not slow the epidemic, probably because it was already widespread, there were large numbers of stray dogs with high rates of turn-over, and low compliance with registration and tethering dogs. A newspaper on 1922 June 29th estimated that there were 10,000 unregistered and 20,000 stray dogs in Osaka Prefecture. Comparing descriptions in newspapers between 1914 and 1916, with those between 1919 and 1922, mass culling of stray dogs appeared more frequently in the former years, but not in the latter. This may have reflected the expectation towards efficacy of vaccine for dogs. Mass vaccination in Osaka Prefecture started in 1923, at the peak of the epidemic, and annual dog rabies cases declined sharply as a result. However, dog rabies cases increased again in 1926. With the restart of capturing stray dogs, rabies was finally eliminated from Osaka in 1933, suggesting mass vaccination alone as applied during this epidemic may not have been sufficient to eliminate dog rabies. Information on the dog population in 1920sâ€™ is unfortunately not available, and vaccination coverage may not have exceeded the immunity threshold.
