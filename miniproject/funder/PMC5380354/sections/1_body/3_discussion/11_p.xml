<p>Such views on strict stray dog population control may not be accepted, in terms of culture and animal welfare, in current rabies endemic countries. However, the effective control options recommended nowadays–vaccination and improvements in dog husbandry—have not been changed since almost a century ago, especially after dog vaccine came in to use. Although socioeconomic conditions may be challenging in some rabies endemic countries and regions, and the findings in past Osaka Prefecture may not be directly comparable with these places, the elimination of rabies is surely possible, by well-coordinated implementation of control programs with participation of all stakeholders from local communities to global partners. Finally, our experience of rabies in Japan suggests that the media can play an important role in reporting the dangers of rabies and promoting participation in rabies control activities to ensure progress towards elimination.</p>
