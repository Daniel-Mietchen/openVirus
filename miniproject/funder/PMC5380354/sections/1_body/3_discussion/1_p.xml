<p>Here we describe the epidemiology of rabies in Osaka Prefecture, during a period when nationwide epidemics were occurring in Japan. For the analyses, the most reliable data were collected, as far as possible. However, there is a limitation in data accuracy. The biggest challenge of data collection was the lack of human rabies records in the years without special attention to rabies. By law, human cases with hydrophobia were reported to Osaka Prefecture, but unfortunately, prefectural annual hygiene reports during the period were lost, according to our archive survey. The records were not stored in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare as well. Moreover, as mentioned in the materials and methods, hydrophobia is seen in 50â€“80% of rabies patients, and other types of illness such as paralysis (about 20% of the patients) [

Also, a report of hydrophobia was based on the notification by a physician, and it may not have involved biological confirmation. Nevertheless, newspapers not only reported each single case, but also presented summary reports from time to time, which contributed greatly in filling data gaps. On the other hand, although there might be underreporting, dog rabies cases were confirmed by the inoculation of brain tissue emulsion to rabbits [
