<p>In conclusion, this paper provides a useful example of the elimination of canine rabies. Authorities raised awareness of rabies and encouraged victims of dog bite injuries to receive PEP, saving many lives. Mass vaccination of dogs undoubtedly played a critical role in controlling and ultimately eliminating rabies. Authorities also aimed to reduce the number of stray dogs using a reward scheme, and enforced the tethering of pet dogs, even while walking, which was not common in Japan at that time. Strict legislation was important in dramatically changing the behavior of dog owners.</p>
