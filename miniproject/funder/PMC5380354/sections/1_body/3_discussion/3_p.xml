<p>Of the two major epidemics in Osaka Prefecture, the second was more severe than the first, in terms of both geographic spread and numbers of dog rabies cases. However,

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is potentially conservative, since we used the serial interval from Osaka, which was longer than that reported from Tanzania [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (45.0, 90%CI: 4.7–118.8 vs 24.9, 95%CI: 23.7–26.2, and our method of estimating the serial interval may have been biased towards longer intervals because direct transmission was not observed). The first case of dog rabies in Osaka Prefecture in 1914 occurred in the West Ward of Osaka City, which shares a boundary with Hyogo Prefecture, and dog rabies was considered to be introduced from this neighboring prefecture. Since this was the first large-scale rabies epidemic in the history of Osaka Prefecture, lack of awareness about rabies may have resulted in such a large number of cases. The high growth rate in the first epidemic in 1914 might be also due to fewer case reports during the initial phase because of a lack of awareness. There was a one-month period between the dog-bite injury and the onset of hydrophobia in the first victim in Osaka Prefecture. During this time considerable undetected transmission likely occurred leading to rapid spread in this entirely susceptible population. Furthermore, as shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, an estimated population of 50,000 unconstrained stray dogs at that time likely exacerbated spread.
