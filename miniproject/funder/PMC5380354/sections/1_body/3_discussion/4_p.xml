<p>As shown in

The longest time between illness onset until a rabid dog was killed was 8 days. However, the mean infectious period of dogs that were killed was short (2.4 days). This rapid response may explain the long serial interval and moderate

Dog owners seemed not to have had a habit of keeping dogs chained before the epidemic, because Osaka Prefecture repeatedly communicated this message to the public through prefecture notices and media. Strict enforcement with a punishment, in case pet dogs were not kept chained, in 1915 may have been effective. The number of dog rabies cases sharply declined in 1916, which suggests that human responses to encounters with rabid dogs may have reduced epidemic growth, as has been previously noted [
