<p>A newspaper described the first case on July 26, 1914 vividly; ‘
 <italic>his wife dropped a coin on the floor and it slipped off through mats and floor woods</italic>. 
 <italic>When he raised up the mat and was trying to pulling the coin with a bamboo stick</italic>, 
 <italic>suddenly a dog rushed from the floor space</italic>, 
 <italic>and bit his left finger strongly</italic>. 
 <italic>The stray dog hid in the floor space during the day time</italic>, 
 <italic>and strayed and bit anything in front of him during nights</italic>.’ And the article ends with this; ‘
 <italic>we strongly request police to make efforts in killing stray dogs</italic>, 
 <italic>and advise people to assume any dogs to be rabid</italic>’.
