<p>Time series of dog rabies cases, dog-bite injuries, and hydrophobia in Osaka Prefecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005435.g005">Fig 5</xref>) showed similar temporal patterns of increase and decrease, but dog-bite injuries and hydrophobia were lagged during the second epidemic. Annual cases of dog-bite injuries had significant positive relationships with dog rabies cases that year (slope = 0.003, se = 0.001, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and the previous year (slope = 0.004, se = 0.001, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Annual cases of hydrophobia also had a significant positive relationship with dog rabies cases (slope = 0.003, se = 0.0002, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). There were less human rabies deaths during the second epidemic, with no reports of hydrophobia between 1916 and 1919. The mean number of deaths during years when deaths occurred was 8.1 (range: 3–14), and the mean incidence was 0.31 deaths per 100,000 persons (range: 0.11–0.54). The most deaths, 14, were recorded in 1924. The proportion of dog-bite victims that developed hydrophobia each year significantly declined over time (slope of logit = -0.29, se = 0.03, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). There were no reports of hydrophobia or the number of dog-bite injuries in newspapers between 1929 and 1933. The mean incubation period and infectious period in humans was 76.4 days (90%CI: 2.5–242.9, estimated from 13 cases, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005435.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and 2.7 days (90%CI: 1.0–5.1, estimated from nine cases, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005435.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), respectively (
