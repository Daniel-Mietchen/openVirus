 <sup>th</sup> 1914, police started culling stray dogs, and 150 stray dogs were culled by July 31
 <sup>st</sup>. Police organized health checks of dogs by veterinarians examining for rabies based on clinical signs, and marking checked dogs with a red color. Victims of dog-bite injuries by suspected rabid dogs were encouraged to receive PEP for free. On January 4
 <sup>th</sup> 1915, Osaka Prefecture Rule for regulation of pet dogs was revised, and registration of dogs over three months old, attachment of dog collars with a name and address, and chaining or application of muzzles to dogs with biting tendencies became the duty of dog owners. The rule also stated that dogs must be chained when the authority orders during dog rabies epidemics, and otherwise free roaming dogs would be regarded as unowned stray dogs [

As rabies vaccine for dogs was not available in this epidemic, rabies control was based on keeping pet dogs chained, and on mass culling of stray dogs. According to Osaka Prefecture Notices and newspaper articles, Osaka Prefecture government announced dog chaining orders several times during the epidemics.
