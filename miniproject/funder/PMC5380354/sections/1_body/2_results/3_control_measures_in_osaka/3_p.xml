 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the numbers of dogs vaccinated, captured stray dogs, dog-bite injuries by rabid dogs to humans, and PEP administered in Osaka Prefecture between 1924 and 1928. The number of PEP and the rate of PEP delivered to dog-bite injuries was high, particularly in 1928. No records of PEP use were available for other years. If the ratio of human deaths to dog rabies cases in 1914 (13 deaths: 236 dog rabies cases = 1: 18.2) had continued, the epidemic between 1914 and 1933 could have caused around 252 deaths (252: 4,584 dog rabies cases), compared with 75 recorded deaths.
