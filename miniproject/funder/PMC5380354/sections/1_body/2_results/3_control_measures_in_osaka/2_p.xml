<p>In 1919, when dog rabies cases began increasing, a ban of dog movement from prefectures with rabies cases was applied. In 1922, the Act on domestic animal infectious disease control (a current act with the same name was established in 1951) was established, and dog vaccination became compulsory for inter-prefectural dog movement. Mass vaccination started in 1923, and a certificate of vaccination effective for one year was provided to owners. In 1923, the order of chaining dogs, and leashing for walking was announced again. If not, dogs were regarded as strays, and were killed. In 1925 and 1926, a reward for capturing stray dogs was announced. Until 1933, a combination of dog vaccination and restriction of free movement of dogs continued.</p>
