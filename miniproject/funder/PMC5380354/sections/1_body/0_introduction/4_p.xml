<p>The world’s first rabies vaccine for dogs was developed using rabbit nerve tissue in 1915, and the quantity of vaccine production and its safety were improved in 1920 by using dog nerve tissue vaccine [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The most dog rabies cases (3,205) and human deaths due to rabies (235) in Japan were recorded in 1924 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Shortly thereafter, vaccine began to be used for mass vaccination, and in total 254,067 dogs were vaccinated in 1925 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dog vaccination was maintained at a similar scale over the following years; 210,515, 227,607, and 243,582 dogs were vaccinated in 1926, 1927, and 1928, respectively. This was accompanied by large-scale capture of stray dogs with 156,844, 297,396, 200,129, and 201,959 captured in 1925, 1926, 1927, and 1928, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, as seen in the Osaka Prefecture Rule for regulation of pet dogs, registration and attachment of collars became the responsibility of dog owners, and prefectures could order chaining of dogs during rabies epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and thus most of the captured dogs were unowned. Dog rabies cases were still high with 1,799 recorded in 1926, but continued to decline thereafter [

Although dog rabies was covered in the animal infectious disease prevention law, the responsibility of dog rabies control was transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to the Ministry of Home Affairs under the cabinet decision in 1928 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], because of its public health importance. Dog cases declined further, and there were fewer than ten cases annually from 1936 to 1940.
