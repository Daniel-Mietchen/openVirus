<p>Rabies has been one of the most feared diseases throughout human history and has the highest known case-fatality rate [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This zoonosis is mainly maintained in domestic dog populations, and continues to cause approximately 59,000 human deaths every year globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More than 99% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, where rabies is endemic in domestic dog populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005435.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, rabies can be controlled and even eliminated from domestic dog populations using existing tools, as seen from mass vaccination programmes in Western Europe and North America [
