<p id="Par48">Enhanced surveillance in Mozambique is needed to evaluate the presence and distribution of the diverse NTDs in the country, to assess possible increase or re-emergence of NTD infection in the country, and to inform policy makers to target control and elimination strategies. For a reliable surveillance, to map risk areas where NTD data is unavailable is essential, especially if elimination is not certified. We recommend the use of remote sensing predictors of disease ecology and accurate mapping to tackle NTDs hotspots, primarily after the last natural disasters recently occurred in the country. In addition, we prompt the need to develop and use simpler field test tools, especially for

On top of that, we also support the integration of NTDs program in one when possible (e.g. MDA or vector control), the partnership among national health programs across countries to control trans-boundering diseases (e.g for HAT), and the integration of animal health – the One Health approach. This could diminish logistical and financial effort, provide data for populations difficult to access and improve NTDs’ surveillance [
