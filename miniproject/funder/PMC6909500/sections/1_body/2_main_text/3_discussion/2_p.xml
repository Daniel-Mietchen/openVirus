<p id="Par44">However, data are missing on both space and time scales. A few regions do not hold data for some NTDs, which does not imply no NTDs transmission. A possible explanation is that resources to generate evidence are allocated to either higher risk regions for NTDs or regions with more technical facilities [

Fortunately, the national program is running specific programs for LF, schistosomiasis and STH at a district level that will provide new data on prevalence and distribution soon. However, for those diseases with no current national program, their epidemiological status is unknown and the reliable epidemiological data is limited. It is the case of cysticercosis or onchocerciasis, which have no data available since 2007 even though both are considered endemic by WHO [

Along these lines, we also observed that during the period of the Mozambican War of Independence the number of publications declined. After this event, data on some diseases was missing for several years: during 20 years for HAT and 30 years for trachoma, until later studies showed that they were still present.
