<p id="Par43">Mozambique has been reported to be endemic for 11 NTDs since 1950. Every NTD has had their own profile in the country: while some are widely spread (e.g. soil-transmitted helminths), others are only localized in some areas of the country (e.g. HAT). Northern provinces (Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Niassa and Tete), the north-central province (Zambezia) and Maputo province and city are the regions with more NTDsâ€™ evidence and might be the most affected areas. Ecological and demographic conditions could partly explain that. The north has higher rainfall and higher temperatures resulting in a sub-humid area and the center has higher number of floods, whereas the south is more arid [
