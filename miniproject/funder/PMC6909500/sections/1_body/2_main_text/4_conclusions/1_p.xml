<p id="Par50">This manuscript reviews the known prevalence and distribution of the most relevant NTDs in Mozambique since 1950 until 2018. All NTDs had very different profile on distribution and data availability along the period and across the country. This review provides key elements to progress towards the control and interruption of transmission of these diseases in the country, as a key contributor to achieving the SGDs and ultimately improving life of millions of people at risk.</p>
