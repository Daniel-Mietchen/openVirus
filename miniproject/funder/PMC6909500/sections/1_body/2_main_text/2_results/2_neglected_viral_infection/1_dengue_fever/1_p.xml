<p id="Par31">The first ever documented case of dengue virus transmission was caused by a serotype 3 in Pemba Province in October 1984. After a peak in December 1984, the outbreak concluded in March 1985. Although there is limited information regarding the extent of the epidemic, it is estimated to have affected 45% of Pemba province population, with no observable differences in gender, age or neighborhood [

A total of 193 clinically suspected dengue cases were detected, of those three were detected with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in sera and 97 tested positive for dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen or anti-DENV IgM antibody. No further cases of dengue have been reported in Mozambique after this outbreak.
