<p id="Par40">The first case of urinary schistosomiasis was reported in Nampula in 1904 as “tropical haematuria” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Nevertheless, the first schistosomiasis national survey was not performed until 1952–1957 by the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Lisbon. 
 <italic>Schistosoma haematobium</italic> was found in all districts and the district rates ranged between 40 and 80%, while the distribution of 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was as extensive but missing in Cabo Delgado [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In fact, settlers with less than a year of residence had schistosome parasite rate of 2.6% in 1956 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In 1961, 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> prevalence rates under 50% were only reported in the districts of Maputo and Tete, whereas in Niassa it was over 70% and in Zambezia and Nampula over 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was determined at the same survey during that period but prevalence was moderate-low (from &lt; 10 to 30%) and not detected in 28 of the 80 districts. 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was only over 12% in Inhambane (19%) and Tete (18.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. In 1985, a study in primary schools showed a prevalence of 23.4% for 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and 4.4% for 
 <italic>S.mansoni</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], and the urinary form was always found far higher than intestinal schistosomiasis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Taking that into consideration, Gama Vaz (1993) observed that 7.5% of urinary schistosomiasis patients in Mozambique develop bladder carcinoma, and 59% of them developed squamous cells’ carcinoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In 1994, Taquinho et al. (1994) conducted a study with 1240 participants from one to 70 years old in Boane, Maputo province, and observed that 40.7% had urinary schistosomiasis, and 74.5% of infected people were between 5 and 19 years old. In 1998, a study of 434 schoolchildren from 6 to 16 years old randomly selected from random selected schools of the city in Maputo showed a lower overall prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis (11.3%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], nevertheless only a sample from each participant was evaluated. In 2005–2007, Augusto et al. (2009) updated the national data available on Schistosomiasis. They observed 47% for 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and 1% 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> overall. The prevalence of 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> increased slightly with age, reaching a peak in the schoolchildren 10–14 years (47.4%) and 45.3% in children &gt; 14 years of age. The highest 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> prevalence was in the northern provinces (Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula, and Zambezia) and in certain provincial capital cities. The lowest 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> prevalences were in Inhambane (19.9%), Gaza (21.4%) and Tete Province (33.4%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. By 2012, Mozambique was considered highly endemic for schistosomiasis (&gt; 50%), with Ghana, Liberia and Sierra Leone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Indeed, the last cross-sectional study in northern Mozambique, in 2014, still reflected a prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis of 59.1% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The diagnostic method used was not described in some of the reviewed studies. In those in which it is described, a wide variety of diagnostic methods is used, including urine filtration for 
 <italic>S. haematobium</italic> and different microscopy techniques such as Ritchie and Kato-Katz techniques for 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> detection.
