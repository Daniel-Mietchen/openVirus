<p id="Par41">The first data available on soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections appears in 1958. De Morais (1958) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] conducted a cross-sectional study in Inhaca island, Maputo, with 80 people aged from 3 to 30 years old and they found very high prevalences for 
 <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> (86.3 and 52.5% respectively). A latter cross-sectional study was performed in Maputo district in 1961 and out of 20 Inhaca participants showed that 18 of them were infected with 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic>, five with 
 <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale</italic> and one with 
 <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> infection. STH prevalence observed in the complete study in Maputo district in 1961 (420 participants) was also headed by 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> (57.61%), followed by 
 <italic>A. duodenale</italic> (16.4%) and 
 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (1.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In Maputo city, a cross-sectional study before conducting an evaluation of a sanitation programme in 97 households (244 people) in 1987 showed 23% of STH infection with a higher infection in 5 to 15 years old (35%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Enosse et al. (1995) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] conducted household feaces collection in 30 clusters of households from Infulene valley (Maputo city rural area) and Maholas (Maputo city semi-urban area) and detected STH prevalence still headed by 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> (17.1%), followed by 
 <italic>T. trichuria</italic> (15.4%), 
 <italic>A. duodenale</italic> (6.4%) and 
 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (1.7%). However, the STH with highest prevalence in Maputo Central Hospital in children between 1.5 and 48.2 months of age in 2009 was 
 <italic>T. trichuria</italic> (6.5%), while the prevalence of 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> was only 2.2% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Three studies were conducted in the city of Beira. The first one, in 2004, disclosed that helminths infections were highly prevalent in the suburban Beira inhabitants of all ages. From 497 people, 95.5% in children aged 2–6 years were infected by STH; 97% in aged 7 to 15 and 76.4% in aged &gt; 15 years old. Concretely, 
 <italic>T. trichuria</italic> was the most common parasite, whereas 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> was less common and hookworms were rare [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The second study examined all samples by direct smear, formal-ether concentration (FEC), Kato-Katz smear, Baermann method, coproculture and real-time PCR and found that 96% of the participants (
 <italic>n</italic> = 303) from an informal settlement, Inhamudima, were infected by at least one STH in 2007, and almost half of them by three STH or more. 
 <italic>T. trichuria</italic> was the most abundant (93%), followed by 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> (56%), 
 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (48%) and hookworm (38%). The third study, conducted in 2013, detected lower specific prevalences by STH ranging between 35 and 53% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In the northern provinces of Mozambique, three cross-sectional studies were performed. Firstly, in contrast to Maputo and Beira, Pinhão (1965) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] observed the highest prevalence for 
 <italic>A. duodenale</italic> (12%), and lower for 
 <italic>A. lumbricoides</italic> (3–5%) and 
 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (0–2%) in Tete. In addition, Casmo et al. (2014) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] during 2005–2007 detected 31.3% of hookworm prevalence in Cabo Delgado, Niassa and Nampula. Moreover, a survey in 3 Nampula schools in 2009, 
 <italic>A. duodenale</italic> was also the STH with main prevalence (18.9%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. All prevalences were determined by different microscopy techniques; while most used Ritchie and Willies techniques, only the study conducted by Meurs et al. (2017) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] in Inhamudina used the Baermann technique to detect 
 <italic>S. stercoralis.</italic>
