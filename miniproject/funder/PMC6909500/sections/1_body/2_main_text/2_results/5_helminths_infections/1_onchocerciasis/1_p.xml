<p id="Par36">The situation of onchocerciasis in Mozambique was unknown until 1996, when the disease was confirmed in Zambezia and Tete. In 1998, Mozambique Ministry of Health in conjunction with the World Health Organization selected 60 villages from Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Tete and Zambezia (provinces closer to the borders with endemic countries) with high presence of risk factors for onchocerciasis: (i) close proximity to rivers and rapids, (ii) isolated village and (iii) first river line communities. Thirty to fifty people from the community older than 20 years old with agricultural activities were selected for screening through nodule inspection. For communities bigger than 800 people they invited to participate the population closer to the river. Thus, 3126 people were enrolled: 1769 men and 1357 women. The prevalence of the four provinces was under 2%, with higher prevalence for men and for Niassa and Zambezia provinces. No other provinces were examined [

In 2007, another REMO survey observed 61 positive cases from Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Zambezia or Tete. Manica, Sofala and Nampula were also surveyed in 2001 but no cases were found and they were not examined in 2007.
