<p id="Par33">Paulo et al. (1984) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] conducted a trachoma survey by clinical examination in both schoolchildren and community population in a village in Mueda, northern Mozambique. The overall prevalence in schoolchildren was 34%. The prevalence in the community, during clinical visits for eye claims in two neighbourhoods of the village was 67 and 50%. Cairncross and Cliff (1987) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] conducted a study in two villages in the same area. One was water supplied and observed a trachoma prevalences of 19%, and the other was non-water supplied, with 38% trachoma prevalence. In both villages, most positive cases were adults (67%) and they detected some clustering of cases by household. Next epidemiological data available on trachoma in Mozambique is not until 2012–2015, when Abdala et al. (2017) evaluate 137 districts. They observed a trachomatous inflammation-follicular prevalence &gt; 10% in children 1–9 years old in 20 districts and a trichiasis prevalence ≥0.2% in &gt; 15 years old in 34 districts [
