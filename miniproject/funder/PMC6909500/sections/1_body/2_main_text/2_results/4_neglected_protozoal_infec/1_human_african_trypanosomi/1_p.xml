<p id="Par35">In Mozambique, only 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The first case in the country was identified in Tete in 1909, confirmed by microscopy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. .In 1945, it was created the Mission to Combat Trypanossomiasis (MCT) and active case finding was implemented. That year, 180 cases were identified in the north and northeast of the country. During 1946 and 1948 the Metangula epidemic occurred in Niassa, with 654 cases detected, a mean of 218 cases per year. After that, the number of national cases decreased to 184 in 1949. However, another epidemic occurred during 1952 to 1954 in Mocímbua da Praia, Cabo Delgado, with 705 cases detected. The MCT responded with a chemoprophylactic campaign in that region, decreasing the endemic index to 0.17 cases per 1000 inhabitants in 1956, compared to 0.4 cases per 1000 inhabitants in 1954. Thus, 1956 was the year with fewer cases (127 cases) since 1945: 89 cases in Cabo Delgado, 30 cases in Tete and eight cases in Nampula. However, in 1957, there was an increase of 94 annual cases detected (221 cases detected), with 141 cases in Cabo Delgado, 52 cases in Tete, 27 cases in Nampula and one case in Niassa [

During 1975–1984, after the Mozambican War of Independence (1964–1974), a total of 739 cases were identified (87% of cases in Tete), and from 1982 onwards there was an increasing number in Niassa and Cabo Delgado [

All suspicious cases had at least one of these symptoms: fever, adenopathy, oedema and loss of weight. In this way, all cases reported from 1953 onwards, were clinically identified and confirmed microscopically with blood smear or thick blood smear and CSF. Eighty per cent of the patients were diagnosed in the second phase of the disease (parasite invaded the central nervous system) and they were identified by trypanosomes in CSF or CSF with more than 25 mg of proteins/100 ml liquor. Regarding treatment, 4% of the patients in Mozambique were identified as resistant to melarsoprol [
