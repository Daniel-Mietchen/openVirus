 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the trends in publications accomplishing the inclusion criteria. Until 2004, the number of articles that provide information on the prevalence or incidence of NTDs in Mozambique was quite low, with a minimum and a maximum of one article and 11 articles in 5 years respectively. The period with lower number of publications coincide with the Mozambican Independence War (1964–1974). The last 13 years, this numbers had steadily increased. In addition, from 2015 onwards, a higher variety of NTDs are studied in the country coinciding with the international recognition of NTDs as a public health priority in low and middle income countries, as was highlighted in the London Declaration of NTD in 2012. The publication trend for each NTD between 1950 and 2018 has its own character, while we can find studies on Human African trypanosomiasis in 1952 and the last published about it was in 1987, no studies on cysticercosis are found until 1990. Conversely, we found schistosomiasis studies from 1957 until nowadays.
