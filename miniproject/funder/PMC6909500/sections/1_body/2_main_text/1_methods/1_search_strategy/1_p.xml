<p id="Par27">This review is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines (Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We conducted an electronic literature search using EndNote X7.8 throughout the following electronic databases: Pubmed/MEDLINE, EmBase and Global Health. We did not apply restrictions to language of publication. The results were limited in the search string to articles published from January 1950 to December 2018. Five NTDs recently considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) (chikungunya, mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, scabies and snakebite) were not included. Chagas was not included in the search due to its geographical distribution limited to Latin America. The search terms used are found in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. We conducted additional search on paper publications and grey literature (conference proceedings, abstracts, masters and doctoral theses) available in Mozambique Ministry of Health library. We also extended the search to the reference lists of ascertained articles to identify more publications that met searching criteria. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be cross-sectional studies, ecological studies, cohorts, reports, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews capturing information related to epidemiology of endemic NTDs in Mozambique. Case reports and case series were considered for inclusion if studies confirmed national case location and they were not imported cases. We excluded case-control studies, letters to editor and case reports and case series of imported cases. Studies with participants based out of the country of Mozambique and studies based on mathematical modelling of epidemiological data were also excluded. No restrictions were made with diagnosis strategy.
