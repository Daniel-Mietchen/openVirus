<p id="Par26">A comprehensive and systematic review of scientific literature on NTDs is a first step to understand where these diseases may be present and what populations are more exposed in the country. This will allow us to identify existing gaps in disease mapping. Thus, we aim at reviewing and assembling published available data about the prevalence and distribution of the different NTDs across Mozambique since 1950. The outcome could guide future Mozambican and international research, and will also support and influence future health policy decisions in this country which may be extrapolated worldwide.</p>
