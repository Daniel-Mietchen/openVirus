<p>The same construct used to generate virus-like particles (see above) was used to construct an alanine mutation library for mapping of antibody epitopes. The first 300 residues in the RRV E2 protein were mutated to alanine, and alanine codons were mutated to serine and synthesized as cDNA (Twist Bioscience). Each mutant was sequence verified and expressed on the surface of 293F cells for screening using an iQue high-throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt). Loss of binding for each mAb was determined by measuring reduction in fluorescent signal as compared to signal in cells expressing WT protein. To differentiate loss of binding from absence of protein expression, at least two control antibodies with binding at greater than 50% were required for each residue. A cutoff value of less than 10% binding when normalized to WT was set to determine a loss of binding at each residue. An untransfected cell control for each antibody also was used to ensure specificity of binding.</p>
