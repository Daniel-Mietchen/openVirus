<p>Clonal cells secreting mAbs were grown in 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks to 70% confluency in hybridoma growth medium (ClonaCell-HY medium E from STEMCELL Technologies, 03805). The cells were expanded equally to four 225 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks for antibody expression in serum-free medium (GIBCO Hybridoma-SFM, Invitrogen, 12045084). The supernatant was harvested after 3 weeks and purified by affinity chromatography using protein G columns (GE Life Sciences, Protein G HP Columns). Purified IgG from hybridoma cell expression was used for all assays.
