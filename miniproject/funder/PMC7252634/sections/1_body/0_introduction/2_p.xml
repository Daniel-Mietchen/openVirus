<p>In a previous clinical trial of an experimental inactivated RRV vaccine, immunized individuals produced neutralizing antibodies in serum that conferred protection in mice during subsequent passive transfer studies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, several murine mAbs that bind to RRV have been reported, although functional characterization of these mAbs generally has been limited [
