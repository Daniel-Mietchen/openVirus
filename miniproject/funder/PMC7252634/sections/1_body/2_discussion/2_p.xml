<p>Through alanine scanning mutagenesis, we discovered multiple epitopes for these mAbs scattered across the A and B domains and the arch region, of the E2 protein. Because our alanine library only consisted of residues within the E2 protein, we did not test whether some mAbs contact the E1 protein. Two main antigenic regions emerged between residues 60–75 in the A domain of E2 and 206–221 of the B domain. A major antigenic region has been suggested previously for RRV using three murine mAbs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These antibodies were localized to the B domain and the adjacent arch region of the E2 protein, between residues 200 and 262, the position of two N-linked glycosylation sites [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, residues 206 and 207 within the B domain appeared important for binding in our alanine scanning mutagenesis study. Residue 244, which is close to a mouse mAb epitope at position 246 within the arch region connecting domains B and C, also emerged as a recognition site for one of our mAbs. Based on competition-binding studies, we assigned neutralizing antibodies into two major groups with similar profiles. Some asymmetry of competition was present in these groups, and the profiles of two mAbs overlapped between the two groups. This asymmetry may be due to the use of VLPs in competition-binding assays, which better mimic the conformation of the virus than recombinant proteins. While these two competition groups did not correlate perfectly with our alanine mutagenesis data, the majority of the mAbs in group 1 corresponded to residues within the B or C domains, whereas those in group 2 mapped mostly to domain A or the arch region between domains A and B. Although the C domain is not surface-exposed, it is probable that residues within this region may stabilize the B domain, since the B domain undergoes a conformational change to uncover the fusion loop on the E1 protein after virus entry into the endosome [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, mutating residues in this “hinge” region of domain C could affect mAb binding to domain B allosterically. Previously, neutralizing CHIKV antibodies have been shown to target analogous sites within the A, B, and arch regions of the E2 protein [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results indicate that both the A and B domains also are important antigenic sites for the human neutralizing antibody response directed against RRV. The knowledge of immunodominant sites on the virus recognized by potent neutralizing antibodies to RRV has implications for immunogen design, as there is currently no licensed vaccine available.
