<p>In addition to attachment/entry inhibition and blockage of binding to Mxra8 receptor, we also observed post-attachment inhibition activity for a subset of mAbs tested, although in most cases, neutralization appeared to be slightly more potent in the pre-attachment assays. During alphavirus infection of a cell under normal conditions, a decrease in pH within the endosome exposes the fusion loop on the E1 protein, which is usually shielded by the B domain of E2 [

While specific alanine scanning mapping data was not obtained for all of our fusion blocking mAbs, it is possible that these antibodies, which are from multiple competition-binding groups, stabilize the B domain to prevent uncovering of the fusion loop.
