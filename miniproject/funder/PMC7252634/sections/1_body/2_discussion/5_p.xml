<p>Therapeutic studies in mice with an acquired deficiency of type I IFN signaling revealed that all mAbs increased survival of the mice to some degree, and administration of each of three mAbs resulted in a greater than 50% survival rate. Importantly, two mAbs chosen for testing in immunocompetent WT mice significantly improved clinical disease symptoms, as demonstrated by dramatically improved hind limb strength and hind paw gripping ability, as well as mitigation of weight loss. Analysis of total amount of viral RNA present in several tissues showed that both mAbs tested reduced viral RNA burden significantly in nearly all tissues examined. A combination mAb therapy has proven efficacious for CHIKV [

Additionally, since these mAbs have therapeutic benefit, they could have a protective effect when administered prophylactically, as was seen with CHIKV mAb studies [
