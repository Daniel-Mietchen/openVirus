<p>These studies provide insight into the antibody response for RRV, using human mAbs isolated from naturally infected donors. The isolated mAbs recognize epitopes within the E2 glycoprotein, potently neutralize the RRV laboratory prototype strain in addition to five clinical isolates, and treat infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse model by reducing viral dissemination. We showed that a subset of mAbs neutralize at both pre-attachment and post-attachment stages, indicating that there are multiple mechanisms of neutralization for these mAbs. Additionally, nearly all neutralizing antibodies blocked binding of the receptor Mxra8 to RRV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and many also inhibited viral fusion with cell membranes. The majority of these mAbs had neutralization IC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 100 ng/mL, and several exhibited highly potent (&lt; 15 ng/mL) neutralizing activity, which is similar in range to the best-in-class human neutralizing antibodies for the related CHIKV [

The molecular basis for this residual fraction of infectious virus remains unclear but could reflect particle heterogeneity due to maturation or incomplete release of the E3 precursor protein [
