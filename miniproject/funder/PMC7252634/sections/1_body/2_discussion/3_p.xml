<p>RRV is thought to have several possible receptors, including α1β1 integrin, which is nearly universally expressed on adherent cells, and Mxra8, a recently discovered receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A candidate receptor binding site could span across surface-exposed regions of both the A and B domains, as is hypothesized for Mxra8 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The fact that mAbs from both competition groups with epitopes in the A and B domains of the E2 protein inhibited binding to Mxra8 protein, supports this hypothesis. Several regions of the E2 protein that resulted in loss of Mxra8 binding to cell-surface-displayed CHIKV proteins are residues 62–64, 71–72, and 74–76 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which are close to loss-of-binding residues 66, 69, and 75, determined for Mxra8-blocking mAbs RRV-92 and RRV-196. Additionally, residues 207, 211, and 221 in the B domain of the E2 protein, which were revealed in our alanine scanning mutagenesis as important for binding of RRV-19, RRV-86, RRV-92, RRV-130, and RRV-221, are in close proximity to residues 212–214 and 221–223 that are additional contact sites for Mxra8 [
