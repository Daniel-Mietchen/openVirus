<p>To identify the antigenic regions recognized by these neutralizing mAbs, we first performed alanine scanning mutagenesis using cell-surface expression of RRV proteins and flow cytometric screening to identify critical binding residues in the E2 glycoprotein. Our library consisted of the first 300 residues of the E2 protein individually mutated to alanine, with alanine residues mutated to serine. We observed a loss of binding for eight mAbs, with residues spread across the A, B, and C domains, as well as arch region of the E2 protein (

 </bold>). RRV-196 had loss-of-binding residues within the A domain alone, whereas RRV-92 and RRV-210 lost binding when residues were changed in the A, B and C domains, as well as arch region, of E2 (

 </bold>). Seven of the eight mAbs targeted regions within the B domain, and of those, three mAbs had loss-of-binding residues within the B domain alone. Within the B domain, residues 189, 206, and 221 showed decreased binding for two mAbs, and mutation of residue 211 resulted in loss-of-binding for six mAbs: RRV-86, RRV-92, RRV-130, RRV-205, RRV-210, and RRV-221 (
