<p>Since RRV infection in humans is rarely fatal, we tested RRV-19 and RRV-86, representing mAbs from different competition-binding groups, in an immunocompetent mouse model of RRV-induced myositis where infection results in high viral burden in muscles and joint-associated tissues [

 <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV. The gastrocnemius (calf muscle), ankle, spleen, and quadriceps were harvested 3 dpi and viral RNA burden was measured by qRT-PCR. Although both mAbs significantly reduced viral RNA in all tissues, RRV-19 was more effective in the ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemius, as well as the ipsilateral ankle and quadriceps (
