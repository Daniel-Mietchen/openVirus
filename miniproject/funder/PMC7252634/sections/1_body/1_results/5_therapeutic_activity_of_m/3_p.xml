<p>In addition to measuring viral RNA burden in select tissues, we also measured severity of RRV disease in the immunocompetent model using a clinical scoring system. In this study, three-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10
 <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV strain T48 before intraperitoneal administration of 100 Î¼g of RRV-19, RRV-86, or an isotype control mAb at 24 hpi. Mice were then weighed and a clinical score was assigned based on grip strength, gait, and righting reflex, as previously described [
