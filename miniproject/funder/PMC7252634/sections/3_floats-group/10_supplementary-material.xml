  <title>Neutralization profiles for five clinical isolate strains of RRV tested against four antibodies using a focus reduction neutralization test.</title>
  <p>RRV strains PW7 and SN11 were isolated from adult patients in 2009. RRV strain 2897601 (QML 2006) was isolated from an adult patient in 2006, and RRV strain Oâ€™Regan was isolated from an EP patient. The P7 and P14 isolates have been sequenced, and four mutations in the E2 protein were uncovered in the P7 strain: I76L, D132N, S182P, and R251K; for the P14 strain, there are two mutations in the E2 protein: I67L and R251K [

Logistic curves are indicated by solid lines, and 95% credible intervals are indicated by dashed lines. Multiple experiments were performed in triplicate, and the best fit curve is shown.
