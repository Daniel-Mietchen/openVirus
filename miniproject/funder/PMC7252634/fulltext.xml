Ross River virus (RRV) belongs to the arthritogenic group of alphaviruses, which largely cause disease characterized by debilitating polyarthritis, rash, and fever. There is no specific treatment or licensed vaccine available, and the mechanisms of protective humoral immunity in humans are poorly understood. Here, we describe naturally occurring human mAbs specific to RRV, isolated from subjects with a prior natural infection. These mAbs potently neutralize RRV infectivity in cell culture and block infection through multiple mechanisms, including prevention of viral attachment, entry, and fusion. Some of the most potently neutralizing mAbs inhibited binding of RRV to Mxra8, a recently discovered alpahvirus receptor. Epitope mapping studies identified the A and B domains of the RRV E2 protein as the major antigenic sites for the human neutralizing antibody response. In experiments in mice, these mAbs were protective against cinical disease and reduced viral burden in multiple tissues, suggesting a potential therapeutic use for humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Ross River virus (RRV) was first identified in Australia in 1959, and has since caused multiple outbreaks, some affecting tens of thousands of individuals throughout the Pacific Islands, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. In addition, a mean of 4,600 cases of RRV disease occur in Australia each year. RRV is transmitted to humans via the bite of a mosquito, and disease symptoms include rash, fever, and debilitating polyarthritis. Currently, the adaptive immune response during RRV infection is poorly understood, and no human moncoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the virus exist. In this study, we generated a panel of human mAbs specific for RRV from two donors who had undergone a natural infection with the virus. We then used these mAbs to elucidate antigenic regions of RRV, and to further study mechanisms by which RRV is neutralized. In addition to potently neutralizing virus <italic>in vitro</italic>, these mAbs significantly reduced mouse death and reducd viral burden in an immunocompromised model. Our study provides new insight into the antibody reponse during a natural infection with RRV, and suggests that therapeutic administration of mAbs may be beneficial in reducing disease burden.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI114816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0049-1079</contrib-id><name><surname>Crowe</surname><given-names>James.

RRV circulates in Australia and Papua New Guinea and is transmitted through the bite of <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitos. Typical signs and symptoms of infection include rash, fever, and most prominently, debilitating muscle and joint pain that persists for 3 to 6 months [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. RRV is an Australian nationally notifiable disease, and since reporting began in 1993, a mean number of 4,600 cases has been reported in Australia each year [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, the economic burden, including diagnosis, treatment and lost wages, has been estimated to be as much as 5 million Australian dollars annually [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. RRV was first isolated from human serum using suckling mice in 1972, but was not connected with symptoms until large epidemics in the South Pacific islands in 1979&#x02013;1980, in which approximately 70,000 people were infected [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Traditionally, reservoirs of RRV were thought to be maruspials endemic to Australia, such as kangaroos and wallabies [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, recent evidence indicates that other mammalian species such as rodents, rabbits, and flying foxes can act as reservoirs for the virus and contribute to its spread [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding suggests that RRV may have the potential to spread to regions outside of Australia and the Pacific Islands and raises concerns about future epidemic transmission. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies targeting RRV.</p><p>In a previous clinical trial of an experimental inactivated RRV vaccine, immunized individuals produced neutralizing antibodies in serum that conferred protection in mice during subsequent passive transfer studies [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, several murine mAbs that bind to RRV have been reported, although functional characterization of these mAbs generally has been limited [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mature alphavirus glycoprotein is composed of the E1 and E2 envelope proteins in a heterodimer, which is expressed as a trimeric spike on the virus surface after cleavage of the E3 protein by furin-like proteases [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Neutralization escape mutants have localized the epitopes of mouse anti-RRV mAbs to the B domain and the flanking region within the E2 glycoprotein [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In comparison, the A and B domains on the E2 glycoprotein and domain II of the E1 glycoprotein of the related alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are important targets of neutralizing antibodies [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for RRV have not been reported.</p><p>Here, we describe human mAbs isolated from individuals who were naturally infected with RRV. These mAbs neutralized RRV infectivity in cell culture, protected mice when administered therapeutically, and reduced viral burden in multiple tissues. Furthermore, these mAbs bind to multiple domains on the E2 protein, as determined through alanine scanning mutagenesis, and roughly fall into two competition-binding groups, revealing that the A and B domains are the major antigenic targets for the human neutralizing antibody response. These mAbs blocked infection by preventing viral attachment and entry to the cell and also blocked at a later step in the virus lifecyle associated with viral fusion. Notably, nearly all of the neutralizing mAbs blocked attachment of RRV to Mxra8, a recently discovered entry receptor for RRV, CHIKV, and other arthritogenic alphaviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Isolation of RRV-reactive human mAbs</title><p>We isolated a panel of mAbs from two subjects, one with a previous laboratory-confirmed case of RRV that was acquired in Australia in 1987, and the other with a clinical history of childhood infection in Australia in the 1990s.

We then added two antibodies sequentially, and the percent binding of the second antibody in the presence of saturating concentrations of the first antibody was determined. Five out of twenty-one mAbs were excluded from the analysis due to undectable or weak binding to VLPs in this format.

The order of antibody addition made a difference in the competition profile, as in some cases the first antibody blocked binding of the second antibody, but the reverse was not true, as in the case of RRV-200 and RRV-34. This effect may be due in part to steric hindrance mediated by Fc regions in the full-length antibody during binding to the VLP. While there was no correlation between whether mAbs were completely neutralizing or not and their competition group, we did observe a correlation between our alanine scanning mutagenesis data and competition data.

The isolated mAbs recognize epitopes within the E2 glycoprotein, potently neutralize the RRV laboratory prototype strain in addition to five clinical isolates, and treat infection <italic>in vivo</italic> in a mouse model by reducing viral dissemination. We showed that a subset of mAbs neutralize at both pre-attachment and post-attachment stages, indicating that there are multiple mechanisms of neutralization for these mAbs. Additionally, nearly all neutralizing antibodies blocked binding of the receptor Mxra8 to RRV <italic>in vitro</italic>, and many also inhibited viral fusion with cell membranes. The majority of these mAbs had neutralization IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 100 ng/mL, and several exhibited highly potent (&#x0003c; 15 ng/mL) neutralizing activity, which is similar in range to the best-in-class human neutralizing antibodies for the related CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For nearly half of these RRV mAbs, a 10 to 40% residual fraction of virus was not inhibited in neutralization assays. The molecular basis for this residual fraction of infectious virus remains unclear but could reflect particle heterogeneity due to maturation or incomplete release of the E3 precursor protein [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Through alanine scanning mutagenesis, we discovered multiple epitopes for these mAbs scattered across the A and B domains and the arch region, of the E2 protein. Because our alanine library only consisted of residues within the E2 protein, we did not test whether some mAbs contact the E1 protein. Two main antigenic regions emerged between residues 60&#x02013;75 in the A domain of E2 and 206&#x02013;221 of the B domain. A major antigenic region has been suggested previously for RRV using three murine mAbs [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These antibodies were localized to the B domain and the adjacent arch region of the E2 protein, between residues 200 and 262, the position of two N-linked glycosylation sites [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The epitope for one of these mouse mAbs is at position 216 of the B domain, which is within five residues of 221 and 211, two residues that were targeted by two or more of our human mAbs [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, residues 206 and 207 within the B domain appeared important for binding in our alanine scanning mutagenesis study. Residue 244, which is close to a mouse mAb epitope at position 246 within the arch region connecting domains B and C, also emerged as a recognition site for one of our mAbs. Based on competition-binding studies, we assigned neutralizing antibodies into two major groups with similar profiles. Some asymmetry of competition was present in these groups, and the profiles of two mAbs overlapped between the two groups. This asymmetry may be due to the use of VLPs in competition-binding assays, which better mimic the conformation of the virus than recombinant proteins. While these two competition groups did not correlate perfectly with our alanine mutagenesis data, the majority of the mAbs in group 1 corresponded to residues within the B or C domains, whereas those in group 2 mapped mostly to domain A or the arch region between domains A and B. Although the C domain is not surface-exposed, it is probable that residues within this region may stabilize the B domain, since the B domain undergoes a conformational change to uncover the fusion loop on the E1 protein after virus entry into the endosome [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, mutating residues in this &#x0201c;hinge&#x0201d; region of domain C could affect mAb binding to domain B allosterically. Previously, neutralizing CHIKV antibodies have been shown to target analogous sites within the A, B, and arch regions of the E2 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results indicate that both the A and B domains also are important antigenic sites for the human neutralizing antibody response directed against RRV. The knowledge of immunodominant sites on the virus recognized by potent neutralizing antibodies to RRV has implications for immunogen design, as there is currently no licensed vaccine available.</p><p>RRV is thought to have several possible receptors, including &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;1 integrin, which is nearly universally expressed on adherent cells, and Mxra8, a recently discovered receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A candidate receptor binding site could span across surface-exposed regions of both the A and B domains, as is hypothesized for Mxra8 [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The fact that mAbs from both competition groups with epitopes in the A and B domains of the E2 protein inhibited binding to Mxra8 protein, supports this hypothesis. Several regions of the E2 protein that resulted in loss of Mxra8 binding to cell-surface-displayed CHIKV proteins are residues 62&#x02013;64, 71&#x02013;72, and 74&#x02013;76 [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which are close to loss-of-binding residues 66, 69, and 75, determined for Mxra8-blocking mAbs RRV-92 and RRV-196. Additionally, residues 207, 211, and 221 in the B domain of the E2 protein, which were revealed in our alanine scanning mutagenesis as important for binding of RRV-19, RRV-86, RRV-92, RRV-130, and RRV-221, are in close proximity to residues 212&#x02013;214 and 221&#x02013;223 that are additional contact sites for Mxra8 [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In addition to attachment/entry inhibition and blockage of binding to Mxra8 receptor, we also observed post-attachment inhibition activity for a subset of mAbs tested, although in most cases, neutralization appeared to be slightly more potent in the pre-attachment assays. During alphavirus infection of a cell under normal conditions, a decrease in pH within the endosome exposes the fusion loop on the E1 protein, which is usually shielded by the B domain of E2 [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While specific alanine scanning mapping data was not obtained for all of our fusion blocking mAbs, it is possible that these antibodies, which are from multiple competition-binding groups, stabilize the B domain to prevent uncovering of the fusion loop.</p><p>Therapeutic studies in mice with an acquired deficiency of type I IFN signaling revealed that all mAbs increased survival of the mice to some degree, and administration of each of three mAbs resulted in a greater than 50% survival rate. Importantly, two mAbs chosen for testing in immunocompetent WT mice significantly improved clinical disease symptoms, as demonstrated by dramatically improved hind limb strength and hind paw gripping ability, as well as mitigation of weight loss. Analysis of total amount of viral RNA present in several tissues showed that both mAbs tested reduced viral RNA burden significantly in nearly all tissues examined. A combination mAb therapy has proven efficacious for CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], so it is possible that pairing antibodies such as RRV-19 and RRV-86, which are from different competition-binding groups, could reduce viral burden to a greater degree and prevent emergence of resistance. Additionally, since these mAbs have therapeutic benefit, they could have a protective effect when administered prophylactically, as was seen with CHIKV mAb studies [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While the market for an RRV prophylactic or therapeutic antibody remains small, recent advances in delivery of mRNA-encoded antibodies have potential to greatly decrease manufacturing costs currently associated with a protein therapy [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Such an mRNA therapy has already shown promise in mice and macaques for CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>A future challenge that must be addressed before clinical use of anti-RRV mAbs is time of administration, since RRV disease currently is diagnosed using paired serology, typically 2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our mouse models have demonstrated efficacy of mAbs during the period of peak viremia; however, administration of mAbs to patients within this time window would necessitate more rapid diagnostic procedures, such as virus identification through qRT-PCR. Reduction of viral load in the early phases of disease might not only reduce disease severity, but also might decrease likelihood of human-mosquito transmission. Outbreaks of polyarthritis caused by RRV have been observed recently among Australian military personnel, in which human-mosquito-human transmission was thought to have occurred without an intermediate host [<xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Such transmission highlights another potential clinical use for an RRV mAb, in which travelers or deployed military personnel returning from an epidemic area could be given mAb therapeutically to reduce likelihood of virus transmission to mosquitoes in their local area or country. Therefore, despite challenges associated with mAb therapy, further study is warranted to understand how these mAbs might best be used for treatment or prevention of RRV disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Source of human B cells</title><p>The first research subject was a 50-year old woman living in the U.S. who had a history of laboratory-confirmed infection in Australia in 1987.
