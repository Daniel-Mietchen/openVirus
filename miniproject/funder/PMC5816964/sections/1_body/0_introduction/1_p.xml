<p>Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that has caused epidemics in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Pacific Islands (

According to the World Health Organization, at least 84 countries, territories, or subnational areas have evidence of ZIKV transmission, of which 61 were reintroductions and newly reported countries with no evidence of the virus before 2015 (

Symptomatic infections are usually self-limiting, causing rash and flu-like symptoms, but have also been associated with more severe complications including microcephaly in newborns and young children and Guillain–Barre syndrome in adults (

To prevent infection, the suggestions are to avoid mosquito bites, control mosquito populations (e.g., source reduction, application of insecticides), and use condoms to prevent possible sexual transmission (
