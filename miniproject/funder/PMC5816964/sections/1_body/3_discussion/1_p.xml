<p>In agreement with several other studies, the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species tested in this study were not competent for ZIKV infection (

 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Dodson &amp; Rasgon, 2017</xref>). Additionally, while we chose an epidemiologically relevant outbreak ZIKV strain to assay, (PRVABC59) it is possible that there are differences in the permissibility of different ZIKV strains to infect mosquitoes (

 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Weger-Lucarelli et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that if enough mosquitoes had bloodfed and survived to later time points, infection/transmission might have occurred. For example, one study reported that Rift Valley fever virus infection was 0% at day 7 and 50% at day 14 in 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> form molestus (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Turell, Dohm &amp; Fonseca, 2014</xref>). However, multiple studies show that 7 days post-infection is generally sufficient time for, at minimum, infection of the midgut epithelium to occur, and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was able to become infected and even transmit at this time point (
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Goddard et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Turell et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Weger-Lucarelli et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Moudy et al., 2007</xref>). Due to low colony size, and difficulty in getting mosquitoes to feed on an artificial blood meal, we only had enough 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> to conduct one infectious feed. However, our results are consistent with other work reporting that 
 <italic>Cx. tarsalis</italic> appear not to be a competent ZIKV vector (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Weger-Lucarelli et al., 2016</xref>); however, further studies should be conducted to confirm this finding.
