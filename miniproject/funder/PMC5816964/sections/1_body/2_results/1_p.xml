<p>ZIKV infectious particles were detected in all blood meals provided to mosquitoes and those blood meal titers were the following: experiment 1, 8.6 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml; experiment 2, 8.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml; and experiment 3: 8.4 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/ml. Additionally, we assayed several positive day 0 mosquitoes and detected infectious ZIKV, indicating that mosquitoes imbibed infectious blood. A summary of sample sizes and transmission assay results for each experiment are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>. Despite feeding on a high ZIKV titer (â‰¥8 logs), only the positive control species 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> became infected with and transmitted ZIKV.
