<p>We tested blood meals and mosquito samples for ZIKV infectious particles by Vero cell plaque assays (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al., 2006</xref>). To identify infected mosquitoes, mosquito bodies were first assayed. If the body of that individual was positive, the legs and saliva were assayed to test for dissemination and transmission. Prior to the start of the assay, samples were thawed briefly at 37 °C. Bodies and legs were homogenized for 30 s with a TissueLyser (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) at 24 cycles/sec, and centrifuged for 1 min. Samples were kept on ice to prevent loss of viral infectivity during the assay, and after the initial infection concluded, samples were returned to −70 °C. Complete media (1 × Dulbecco’s modified-essential media (10566-024; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 100 units/ml penicillin–streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum) was removed from confluent monolayers of Vero cells in 6-well-plates, and monolayers inoculated with 100 µl of each clarified sample. Inoculated plates were placed in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h and were rocked every 30 min to prevent cell desiccation. After the 2 h incubation, a 3 ml overlay was applied to each well that comprised equal amounts of complete media and 1.2% agarose, and plates incubated for 3 days. A secondary 3 ml overlay was then applied that comprised equal amounts of complete media and 1.2% agarose, as well as 1.5% neutral red solution, and plates incubated for one additional day. After incubation, plates were inverted, placed on a white light transilluminator (Hall Productions, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA), and each well assessed as positive or negative for ZIKV by observation of plaques. Plaques were counted if they were present. Positive and negative controls were included with every assay to confirm that the assay worked as expected and to ensure cell viability (positive: diluted ZIKV-infected blood meal and ZIKV stocks; negative: complete cell culture media and MD). Infection rate was defined as the proportion of mosquitoes exposed to virus that had ZIKV-positive bodies. Dissemination and transmission rates were defined as the proportion of mosquitoes infected with ZIKV that had infectious viral particles present in their legs and saliva, respectively.
