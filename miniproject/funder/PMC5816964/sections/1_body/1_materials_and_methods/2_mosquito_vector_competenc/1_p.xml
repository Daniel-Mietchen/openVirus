<p>ZIKV aliquots were thawed briefly at 37 °C and were added to whole human blood in equal volumes. Aliquots were only thawed once to prevent any loss in virulence via multiple freeze–thaw cycles. We exposed adult female mosquitoes (3–7 days old) to ZIKV-infected blood via a glass feeder jacketed with 37 °C distilled water. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed to engorgement for up to 1 h. Mosquitoes were sorted by fed status under CO
 <sub>2</sub> anesthesia. All mosquitoes that took a blood meal were fully engorged and they were retained for transmission experiments; non-blood fed females were discarded. We stored a 200–300 ml aliquot of each blood meal pre-feeding to confirm ZIKV titer by plaque assay on Vero cells, as described below.
