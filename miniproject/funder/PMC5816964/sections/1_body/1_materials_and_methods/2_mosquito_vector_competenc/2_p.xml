<p>We assessed ZIKV infection, dissemination, and transmission at 7 days post-blood feeding (

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) feeding rates on the artificial blood meal were poor and resulted in low numbers; additionally, sufficient numbers of mosquitoes did not survive past 10 days post-feeding. Assayed female mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Legs from each mosquito were removed with forceps and placed in a 2-ml tube filled with 1 ml mosquito diluent (MD: 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS] in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 50 ug/mL gentamicin, and 2.5 µg/mL fungizone) with a single sterile, zinc-plated, steel 4.5 mm ball (Daisy, Rogers, AR). To induce mosquitoes to salivate, the mouthparts of each mosquito were placed in a tapered capillary tube containing approximately 10 µl of 1:1 50% sucrose and FBS (

 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Dodson, Kramer &amp; Rasgon, 2011</xref>). Saliva was collected for 30 min, after which the contents were expelled into 0.3 ml MD. Bodies were placed individually into 2-ml tubes filled with 1 ml MD and a single sterile, zinc-plated, steel 4.5 mm BB. All samples were stored at −70 °C until tested for ZIKV by Vero plaque assay. All mosquito experiments with infectious ZIKV were conducted in the Eva J. Pell ABSL3 Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, according to established biosafety protocols (IRB #45458).
