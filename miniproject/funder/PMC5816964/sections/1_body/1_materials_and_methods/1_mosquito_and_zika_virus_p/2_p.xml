<p>All mosquito species were reared and maintained at the Penn State Millennium Sciences Complex insectary at 27 °C ± 1 °C, 12:12 hr light:dark cycle, and 80% relative humidity in 30 × 30 × 30-cm cages. Mosquitoes were provided with cotton pads soaked with 10% sugar for maintenance and fed anonymous expired human blood (Biological Specialty Corporation, Colmar, PA; anticoagulant = citrate phosphate dextrose adenine) using a glass feeder jacketed with 37 °C distilled water for colony propagation and experimental virus infections.
