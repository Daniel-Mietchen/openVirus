This virus was originally isolated in 2015 from infected human serum in Puerto Rico and passed once in 
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic> kidney epithelial cells (Vero 76, ATCC CRL-1586). Working stocks were made by passing the virus three times in Vero cells (grown in Dulbecco’s modified-essential media (10566-024; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1 × penicillin–streptomycin), harvesting the supernatant, and storing the 300 µl aliquots at −70 °C until used for mosquito infections.
