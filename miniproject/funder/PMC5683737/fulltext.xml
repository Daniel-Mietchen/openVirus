HIV and HCV prevention interventions for PWID include needle and syringe programmes (NSP), opioid substitution therapy (OST), HIV counselling and testing, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom distribution programmes.

Data to estimate NSP coverage were available for 57 countries, and for 60 countries to estimate OST coverage. Coverage varied widely between countries, but was most often low according to WHO indicators (&#x0003c;100 needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year; &#x0003c;20 OST recipients per PWID per year). Data on HIV testing were sparser than for NSP and OST, and very few data were available to estimate ART access among PWID living with HIV. Globally, we estimate that there are 33 (uncertainty interval [UI] 21&#x02013;50) needle-syringes distributed via NSP per PWID annually, and 16 (10&#x02013;24) OST recipients per 100 PWID.

Core interventions include needle and syringe programmes (NSP) to prevent shared use of injecting equipment; opioid substitution therapy (OST) to reduce the frequency of and encourage cessation of opioid injecting; HIV testing and counselling as a gateway to HIV treatment and care; HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce community viral load; and condom distribution programmes to prevent viral transmission to sexual partners.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>The presence of interventions alone is not sufficient; the greatest prevention benefits are reported when NSP and OST are implemented at high coverage and in combination.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> WHO emphasises that in countries where injecting drug use occurs, priority should be given to immediate implementation of NSP and OST,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and recommends that countries aim to distribute in excess of 200 needle-syringes per PWID annually, and to provide OST to more than 40 people per 100 PWID.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In 2010, however, a comprehensive review reported very low coverage of all of the above interventions among PWID globally, noting that there were few countries where coverage was considered sufficient to prevent viral transmission.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>In 2010, a systematic review estimated country, regional, and global coverage of interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID), including needle and syringe programmes (NSP), opioid substitution therapy (OST), HIV testing and counselling, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom distribution programmes. The review reported coverage of services for PWID to be poor across countries, with few exceptions. However, lack of data and poor quality data on injecting prevalence and service provision were notable barriers to accurate ascertainment of service coverage. Since 2010, estimates of intervention coverage have been reported by government and intergovernmental agencies. However, estimates typically come from a limited number of countries (eg, the European Drug Report published by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction) or derive from member state reporting (eg, country progress reports submitted to UNAIDS). Estimates might not always comprise objective measurement of service provision or the size of the population of PWID nor reflect evidence from all available sources. Harm Reduction International produces a biennial report in which harm reduction services are summarised, but no estimates of service coverage are made. No global, systematic review of data to generate estimates of intervention coverage for PWID has been undertaken since the 2010 review.</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>The previous review indicated that the current scale of coverage of the reviewed interventions was unlikely to prevent, halt, or reverse HIV epidemics among this population. In the intervening period, capacity to capture and disseminate information regarding access to services has been enhanced, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, international public health agencies have established goals for reductions in prevalence, and even elimination, of HIV and viral hepatitis. Updated estimates of service coverage are crucial to monitor progress towards these targets. This Article presents updated estimates of national, regional, and global coverage of five interventions (NSP, OST, HIV testing, ART, and condom programmes) for the prevention and treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections among PWID. Estimates were derived from a comprehensive systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, data reported by national and intergovernmental agencies, and expert consultation. It presents the first global picture of combination coverage of the highest priority of these interventions, NSP and OST.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Coverage of these interventions remains poor at the global level, and is insufficient to prevent, halt, or reverse HIV and HCV epidemics among PWID.

The June, 2016, UN High Level meeting on AIDS made only very brief mention of insufficient coverage of services for this population. Funding to UNAIDS is decreasing, and in July, 2016, UNAIDS ceased funding for HIV activities to UNODC, the lead UN agency for HIV services among PWID.

We determined the average number of people receiving OST per 100 PWID in each region, weighted by country PWID population size. We assumed the same level of coverage as in other countries in the region in those countries where OST is known to be implemented but no coverage estimate was available. The global estimate was determined by weighting the regional estimates by the size of the regional population of PWID.</p><p>To determine regional and global estimates of OST coverage among primary opioid injectors, we used data from our review on the epidemiology of injecting drug use.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In that review, we presented results on the estimated proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID in a country. To estimate the number of primary opioid injectors in this review, we multiplied the country population prevalence of injecting drug use by the proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID. We multiplied this by the country population size, then 95% UIs were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation taking 100&#x02008;000 draws. We used a binomial distribution because the parameters of interest were proportions. Sample sizes were derived based on the 95% CIs and SEs of estimates in each country. The simulated UIs incorporated the uncertainty of both the injecting drug use prevalence and opioid injecting proportion estimates. The process of determining regional and global estimates of OST coverage among primary opioid injectors thereafter was as above for OST coverage estimates among PWID.</p><p>Regional estimates for HIV testing coverage among PWID were calculated as for NSP and OST. Where no data were available for a region, we did not calculate a regional estimate. Given the scarcity of data for this indicator, we did not calculate a global estimate. Regional and global estimates of ART and condom distribution programme coverage were not calculated due to the sparseness of the identified data.</p><p>Among countries with a coverage estimate for both NSP and OST, we plotted coverage levels for both interventions to assess the extent to which combination high-level coverage of OST and NSP is being implemented. Low, moderate, and high coverage were defined in accordance with targets recommended by UN agencies.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funders of the study had no role in the study design, conduct, analysis, or interpretation of findings.

Completeness of the available data was often unclear, and estimates ranged from less than one ART recipient per 100 HIV-positive PWID to greater than parity (ie, the number of PWID in ART was greater than the estimated number of current PWID). There were just seven countries with survey data on ART access (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 137&#x02013;43</xref>), ranging from 5% (95% CI 4&#x02013;6) of HIV-positive PWID receiving ART in Malaysia up to 67% (63&#x02013;71) in the USA.

Less than 1% of all PWID live in countries with high coverage of both NSP and OST.

However, where data were available, coverage was typically low in comparison with suggested targets.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>The three regions with the largest populations of PWID&#x02014;east and southeast Asia, eastern Europe, and North America&#x02014;were all estimated to have poor coverage of NSP and OST. These are all regions where injecting drug use is well established. HIV prevalence in these regions is estimated to range from 9% (UI 7&#x02013;11) in North America to 25% (16&#x02013;34) in eastern Europe, and HCV antibody prevalence from 50% (38&#x02013;63) in east and southeast Asia to 65% (57&#x02013;73) in eastern Europe.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Several countries in these regions have experienced recent HIV outbreaks as well as persistently high HCV prevalence among PWID,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> highlighting the need for better access to prevention interventions.

Of the 37 countries in that region where injecting drug use has now been reported, only seven offer NSP, and eight OST. Coverage of these interventions is very low at the regional level: just two needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year (UI &#x0003c;1&#x02013;4), and one person receiving OST per 100 PWID (UI &#x0003c;1&#x02013;2). HIV prevalence among PWID in the region is estimated at 18% (UI 11&#x02013;25), similar to the global estimate of 18% (11&#x02013;25);<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> however, HCV antibody prevalence is 22% (18&#x02013;27), much lower than the global estimate of 52% (42&#x02013;62).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Increased intervention coverage will contribute to reduced HIV transmission and prevent further escalation of the HCV epidemic among PWID in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>There is often considerable uncertainty around estimates of injecting drug use prevalence, which translates into uncertainty in estimates of intervention coverage. Methods and definitions used to calculate estimates of injecting drug use differ across countries and over time. We have avoided directly comparing these estimates to previously derived estimates, as differences in methodology and data sources might explain some apparent changes over time. The estimates reported here might differ from those of some national or regional reporting bodies due to differences in methodology and data sources included. To facilitate transparency in reporting, we have provided references for all datapoints used to generate these estimates in the appendices, as well as online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/resource/global-coverage-review-2017" id="interrefs10">interactive presentations</ext-link> of these data. We encourage feedback regarding the estimates via email.</p><p>Much of the indicator data reported here were derived from reports produced by government, intergovernmental, and non-government organisations. The quality of such data depends largely on existing monitoring systems and capacity within a country to collect data in a timely and representative manner. Establishing and maintaining monitoring systems requires dedicated resources. Without these, reporting against defined indicators can be poor. Some reports provided an estimate of intervention coverage without the data used to inform the estimate (eg, an estimate of the number of needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year, but without the population size and numerator used for this calculation). We did not use such estimates in this review, as we were unable to assess their validity. Lack of transparency in reporting can easily be remedied by providing the data used to generate estimates (ie, denominator and numerator), as well as the estimates themselves.</p><p>Compared with NSP and OST, data for HIV testing, ART, and condom distribution programmes specifically for PWID appear less likely to be systematically and routinely collected and reported. This is in part due to the interventions being applicable to the broader population, but also because HIV testing and treatment programmes might not collect or report data on risk exposure due to concerns regarding stigma or criminal justice implications for PWID. Given the potential for negative consequences for the patient, WHO guidelines on ART programme monitoring recommend against recording data related to patient risk behaviours in ART registers (as distinct from case surveillance data).<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Without such data, though, it is difficult to assess the extent to which particularly vulnerable populations are accessing these interventions.</p><p>Survey data might go some way towards addressing this problem, but to do so, surveys must employ recruitment methods that minimise risk of selection bias in findings. Recruitment of PWID from multiple community settings (not solely treatment or other services), such as through respondent-driven sampling or structured chain referral methods, can minimise selection bias.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In presenting survey data, basic parameters including the precise indicator that was measured, sample size responding to the survey item, and numerator, should be presented in addition to the calculated proportion and associated uncertainty.</p><p>Clinic exit surveys are an alternative approach to estimating coverage of ART and other service use among PWID (and other key populations) being considered. Clients attending clinics providing ART (or other interventions) could complete a short survey via a tablet with results being immediately transmitted to a secure server separate from the clinic. This could involve a small number of questions including services received, viral load, mode of transmission, and current behaviours (including injecting drug use). If undertaken at large clinics across countries, this approach would permit estimates of the percentage of ART clients who inject drugs, which could be used to generate the number of PWID clients at the country level.</p><p>Although we did a comprehensive, multilingual search for relevant data, some data might have been overlooked. Grey literature, such as reports from organisations providing services or by government departments, can be difficult to locate, even when published online. To address this, we worked directly with staff from WHO, UNAIDS, the Global Fund, UNODC, and EMCDDA, and contacted experts around the world for assistance in identifying and verifying data. Uncertainty can occur in interpreting indicator data, as they are sometimes reported without contextual details (eg, the time frame to which data referred), or such details are unclear. All extracted data were checked multiple times by senior team members, and we sought clarification from people familiar with the data or context (eg, local researchers, service providers, and staff of intergovernmental organisations) if needed. Data searching and verification through contact with in-country experts continued until August, 2017, to ensure we included the most recent programme data possible.</p><p>We have provided regional estimates of NSP, OST, and, for some regions, HIV testing coverage. For countries where an intervention was known to be in place, but no programme data were available, we assumed that coverage in that country was the same as in other countries in the same region. For some countries, this might have resulted in overestimation or underestimation of true coverage, affecting the validity of the regional estimates. We suggest caution in interpreting the regional estimates as precise indications of intervention coverage; rather, we provide them to highlight regional differences and areas for particular focus for investment of resources.</p><p>In some cases, estimates for OST, HIV testing, and ART coverage per 100 PWID were greater than parity. This is likely a result of programme data categorising individuals as PWID on the basis of lifetime injecting drug use, whereas our PWID population size data refer to recent injecting drug use. As such, our approach might overestimate service access among recent PWID.</p><p>Prescribing of direct-acting antiviral therapies has recently become an important component of HCV prevention and treatment efforts.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> We did not explicitly search for indicators relating to treatment of HCV infection among PWID, such as HCV testing, treatment uptake, or outcomes of treatment, as we judged that at this time, there would be very limited data available for estimating these indicators at the population level. Future iterations of this work should include indicators such as the number of PWID who have received HCV antibody and diagnostic testing, and the number with chronic HCV infection who have been treated and cured.</p><p>Prisons and other correctional institutions are important settings for HIV and HCV prevention among people who inject drugs. We did not report on intervention coverage in these settings. Previous work has found that few countries permit NSP in prisons.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> OST is provided in prisons in 52 countries, although programmes often exist on a small scale or in a limited number of institutions.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Determining coverage of HIV and HCV prevention interventions in prisons is complicated by a lack of data on the number of PWID in prisons. Further work to determine PWID population sizes and coverage of prevention interventions in prisons is needed to understand where gaps in HIV and HCV prevention might exist.</p><p>Greater investment in HIV and HCV prevention and treatment is urgently needed for the 16 million PWID globally.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Effective interventions for HIV and HCV among PWID are delivered at suboptimal levels in almost all countries. Failure to provide interventions to scale ensures ongoing high prevalence and incidence of HIV and HCV infections among PWID, who are being left behind in efforts to end the HIV and HCV epidemics. Concerted international efforts will be required to ensure high coverage of interventions, particularly NSP and OST, is achieved and maintained.</p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox20"><p><bold>Feedback
