<p>Beginning in March, 2017, country-specific reports were generated listing all extracted data. These reports were emailed to key experts and organisations globally, with a request for any additional, more recent or more complete data (an example email and report is shown in the 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 90</xref>). These emails were frequently forwarded on to additional recipients. Revised or new indicator data provided in response to these requests were reviewed in full, and extracted where decision rules for inclusion were satisfied. New data were accepted for inclusion until Aug 14, 2017.
