<p>Regional estimates for HIV testing coverage among PWID were calculated as for NSP and OST. Where no data were available for a region, we did not calculate a regional estimate. Given the scarcity of data for this indicator, we did not calculate a global estimate. Regional and global estimates of ART and condom distribution programme coverage were not calculated due to the sparseness of the identified data.</p>
