<p>To determine regional and global estimates of OST coverage among primary opioid injectors, we used data from our review on the epidemiology of injecting drug use.

 </xref> In that review, we presented results on the estimated proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID in a country. To estimate the number of primary opioid injectors in this review, we multiplied the country population prevalence of injecting drug use by the proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID. We multiplied this by the country population size, then 95% UIs were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation taking 100â€ˆ000 draws. We used a binomial distribution because the parameters of interest were proportions. Sample sizes were derived based on the 95% CIs and SEs of estimates in each country. The simulated UIs incorporated the uncertainty of both the injecting drug use prevalence and opioid injecting proportion estimates. The process of determining regional and global estimates of OST coverage among primary opioid injectors thereafter was as above for OST coverage estimates among PWID.
