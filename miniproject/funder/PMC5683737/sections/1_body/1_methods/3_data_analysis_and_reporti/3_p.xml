<p>To determine regional estimates of NSP coverage, we calculated the average number of needle-syringes distributed per region, weighted by country PWID population size. Denominators included the estimated population size of PWID for all countries in the region where injecting drug use has been reported.

 </xref> For countries where NSP was known to be implemented, but the number of needle-syringes distributed was not known, we assumed the same level of coverage as in other countries in the region. The global estimate of NSP coverage was developed following a similar approach to the regional estimates, weighting the regional estimates by the size of the regional population of PWID.
