<p>We calculated regional and global OST coverage with reference to two denominators: the number of PWID (as in the endorsed indicators published by WHO/UNAIDS/UNODC),
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>5</sup>
 </xref> and the number of PWID whose main drug injected is opioids (hereafter primary opioid injectors).
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>1</sup>
 </xref> Examining OST coverage specifically among primary opioid injectors provides additional information to contextualise the estimate among PWID.
