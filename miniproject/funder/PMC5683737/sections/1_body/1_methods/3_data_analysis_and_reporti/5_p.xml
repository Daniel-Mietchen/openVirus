<p>The process of determining regional and global estimates of OST coverage among all PWID proceeded as for the regional and global estimates of NSP coverage. We determined the average number of people receiving OST per 100 PWID in each region, weighted by country PWID population size. We assumed the same level of coverage as in other countries in the region in those countries where OST is known to be implemented but no coverage estimate was available. The global estimate was determined by weighting the regional estimates by the size of the regional population of PWID.</p>
