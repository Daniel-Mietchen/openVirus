<p>Despite recognition of the need to monitor coverage, there is no comprehensive, regularly updated system for collating, critiquing, and synthesising data on coverage of PWID populations with these interventions. Harm Reduction International produces a biennial report documenting the existence of NSP, OST, and ART services for PWID;
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref> some data on service provision are presented, but not estimates of service coverage. Annual reporting to UNAIDS on service provision includes data on HIV testing and ART for PWID, but indicators relating to PWID are the most poorly reported of all key population indicators, and missing data are common.

 </xref> meaning that the data informing decisions about country-level responses to HIV and HCV among PWID are in many cases over a decade old.
