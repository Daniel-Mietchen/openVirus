   <bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p>In 2010, a systematic review estimated country, regional, and global coverage of interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID), including needle and syringe programmes (NSP), opioid substitution therapy (OST), HIV testing and counselling, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom distribution programmes. The review reported coverage of services for PWID to be poor across countries, with few exceptions. However, lack of data and poor quality data on injecting prevalence and service provision were notable barriers to accurate ascertainment of service coverage. Since 2010, estimates of intervention coverage have been reported by government and intergovernmental agencies. However, estimates typically come from a limited number of countries (eg, the European Drug Report published by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction) or derive from member state reporting (eg, country progress reports submitted to UNAIDS). Estimates might not always comprise objective measurement of service provision or the size of the population of PWID nor reflect evidence from all available sources. Harm Reduction International produces a biennial report in which harm reduction services are summarised, but no estimates of service coverage are made. No global, systematic review of data to generate estimates of intervention coverage for PWID has been undertaken since the 2010 review.</p>

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p>The previous review indicated that the current scale of coverage of the reviewed interventions was unlikely to prevent, halt, or reverse HIV epidemics among this population. In the intervening period, capacity to capture and disseminate information regarding access to services has been enhanced, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, international public health agencies have established goals for reductions in prevalence, and even elimination, of HIV and viral hepatitis. Updated estimates of service coverage are crucial to monitor progress towards these targets. This Article presents updated estimates of national, regional, and global coverage of five interventions (NSP, OST, HIV testing, ART, and condom programmes) for the prevention and treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus infections among PWID. Estimates were derived from a comprehensive systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature, data reported by national and intergovernmental agencies, and expert consultation. It presents the first global picture of combination coverage of the highest priority of these interventions, NSP and OST.</p>
  <p>
   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p>Coverage of these interventions remains poor at the global level, and is insufficient to prevent, halt, or reverse HIV and HCV epidemics among PWID. Greater investment in HIV and HCV prevention and treatment is urgently needed for the 16 million PWID globally.</p>
