<p>There were 51 countries for which a non-zero estimate of the coverage of both NSP and OST were available (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 154</xref>), 22 of which had low coverage across both interventions. High coverage of both NSP and OST was found in only four countries (Australia, Austria, the Netherlands, and Norway); these countries collectively include just 123 000 (1%) of the estimated global population of PWID (15 648 000). An additional ten countries (Canada, Croatia, France, Luxembourg, Mauritius, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland, and Vietnam) had either moderate or high coverage of both NSP and OST (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 154</xref>). Together, the 14 countries that provide at least moderate coverage of both NSP and OST are home to 752 000 (5%) of the global population of PWID.
