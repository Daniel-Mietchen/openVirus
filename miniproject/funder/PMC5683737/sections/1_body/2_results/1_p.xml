 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> presents an overview of the process of reviewing and selecting data for inclusion in the analysis. We screened 218 510 documents for relevant data (5858 peer-reviewed publications, 212 164 grey literature reports, 379 documents from international agencies, 60 reviews and other documents provided by experts, and 49 additional documents identified during preliminary data extraction). Data for the 17 indicators of interest were extracted from 212 documents to produce country-level reports that were disseminated to experts for verification. An additional 56 reports and personal communications containing data were received following expert consultation; ultimately, 234 documents provided datapoints that were included in the analysis.
