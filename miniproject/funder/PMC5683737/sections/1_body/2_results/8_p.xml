<p>Programme data on the number of PWID accessing ART was missing for most countries, being available for only 17 countries (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 93–102</xref>). Completeness of the available data was often unclear, and estimates ranged from less than one ART recipient per 100 HIV-positive PWID to greater than parity (ie, the number of PWID in ART was greater than the estimated number of current PWID). There were just seven countries with survey data on ART access (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 137–43</xref>), ranging from 5% (95% CI 4–6) of HIV-positive PWID receiving ART in Malaysia up to 67% (63–71) in the USA. For the two countries with both programme and survey data, coverage based on programme data was lower than that based on survey data (12%
