<p>Data on the number of people receiving OST in a country were available for 72 countries, and it was possible to derive coverage estimates for 60 of these countries (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 93–102</xref>). With reference to PWID, 20 countries (814 500 [5%] of the global PWID population) were implementing high-coverage OST (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>). OST coverage was in the moderate range in six countries (806 000 [5%] of the global PWID population), and low in 34 countries (7 389 000 [47%] of the global PWID population).
