<p>Programme data on the number of PWID receiving an HIV test annually were available for 41 countries, and it was possible to estimate HIV testing coverage for 29 of these (
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 93–102</xref>). Coverage was low in 22 of these countries (3 408 000 [22%] of the global PWID population [15 648 000]), and high in only four countries (194 500 [1%] of the global PWID population). Survey data reporting the proportion of PWID being tested for HIV were more common than programme data (49 countries; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 125–31</xref>); however, representativeness of survey samples was often unclear. There were 13 countries where both programme and survey data were available; in eight of these, programme data reported lower (often substantially lower) proportions tested compared with survey data (
