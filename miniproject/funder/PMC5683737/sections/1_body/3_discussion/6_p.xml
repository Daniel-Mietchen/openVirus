<p>Compared with NSP and OST, data for HIV testing, ART, and condom distribution programmes specifically for PWID appear less likely to be systematically and routinely collected and reported. This is in part due to the interventions being applicable to the broader population, but also because HIV testing and treatment programmes might not collect or report data on risk exposure due to concerns regarding stigma or criminal justice implications for PWID. Given the potential for negative consequences for the patient, WHO guidelines on ART programme monitoring recommend against recording data related to patient risk behaviours in ART registers (as distinct from case surveillance data).
