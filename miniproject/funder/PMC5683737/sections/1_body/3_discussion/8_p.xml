<p>Clinic exit surveys are an alternative approach to estimating coverage of ART and other service use among PWID (and other key populations) being considered. Clients attending clinics providing ART (or other interventions) could complete a short survey via a tablet with results being immediately transmitted to a secure server separate from the clinic. This could involve a small number of questions including services received, viral load, mode of transmission, and current behaviours (including injecting drug use). If undertaken at large clinics across countries, this approach would permit estimates of the percentage of ART clients who inject drugs, which could be used to generate the number of PWID clients at the country level.</p>
