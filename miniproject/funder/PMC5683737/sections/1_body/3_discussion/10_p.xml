<p>We have provided regional estimates of NSP, OST, and, for some regions, HIV testing coverage. For countries where an intervention was known to be in place, but no programme data were available, we assumed that coverage in that country was the same as in other countries in the same region. For some countries, this might have resulted in overestimation or underestimation of true coverage, affecting the validity of the regional estimates. We suggest caution in interpreting the regional estimates as precise indications of intervention coverage; rather, we provide them to highlight regional differences and areas for particular focus for investment of resources.</p>
