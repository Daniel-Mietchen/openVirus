 </xref> We did not explicitly search for indicators relating to treatment of HCV infection among PWID, such as HCV testing, treatment uptake, or outcomes of treatment, as we judged that at this time, there would be very limited data available for estimating these indicators at the population level. Future iterations of this work should include indicators such as the number of PWID who have received HCV antibody and diagnostic testing, and the number with chronic HCV infection who have been treated and cured.
