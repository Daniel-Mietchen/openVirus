<p>The three regions with the largest populations of PWID—east and southeast Asia, eastern Europe, and North America—were all estimated to have poor coverage of NSP and OST. These are all regions where injecting drug use is well established. HIV prevalence in these regions is estimated to range from 9% (UI 7–11) in North America to 25% (16–34) in eastern Europe, and HCV antibody prevalence from 50% (38–63) in east and southeast Asia to 65% (57–73) in eastern Europe.
