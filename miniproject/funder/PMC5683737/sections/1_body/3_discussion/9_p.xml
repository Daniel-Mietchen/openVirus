<p>Although we did a comprehensive, multilingual search for relevant data, some data might have been overlooked. Grey literature, such as reports from organisations providing services or by government departments, can be difficult to locate, even when published online. To address this, we worked directly with staff from WHO, UNAIDS, the Global Fund, UNODC, and EMCDDA, and contacted experts around the world for assistance in identifying and verifying data. Uncertainty can occur in interpreting indicator data, as they are sometimes reported without contextual details (eg, the time frame to which data referred), or such details are unclear. All extracted data were checked multiple times by senior team members, and we sought clarification from people familiar with the data or context (eg, local researchers, service providers, and staff of intergovernmental organisations) if needed. Data searching and verification through contact with in-country experts continued until August, 2017, to ensure we included the most recent programme data possible.</p>
