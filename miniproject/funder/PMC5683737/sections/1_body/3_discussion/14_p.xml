<p>Greater investment in HIV and HCV prevention and treatment is urgently needed for the 16 million PWID globally.

 </xref> Effective interventions for HIV and HCV among PWID are delivered at suboptimal levels in almost all countries. Failure to provide interventions to scale ensures ongoing high prevalence and incidence of HIV and HCV infections among PWID, who are being left behind in efforts to end the HIV and HCV epidemics. Concerted international efforts will be required to ensure high coverage of interventions, particularly NSP and OST, is achieved and maintained.
