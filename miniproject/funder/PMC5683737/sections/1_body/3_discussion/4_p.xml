<p>There is often considerable uncertainty around estimates of injecting drug use prevalence, which translates into uncertainty in estimates of intervention coverage. Methods and definitions used to calculate estimates of injecting drug use differ across countries and over time. We have avoided directly comparing these estimates to previously derived estimates, as differences in methodology and data sources might explain some apparent changes over time. The estimates reported here might differ from those of some national or regional reporting bodies due to differences in methodology and data sources included. To facilitate transparency in reporting, we have provided references for all datapoints used to generate these estimates in the appendices, as well as online
