<p>Much of the indicator data reported here were derived from reports produced by government, intergovernmental, and non-government organisations. The quality of such data depends largely on existing monitoring systems and capacity within a country to collect data in a timely and representative manner. Establishing and maintaining monitoring systems requires dedicated resources. Without these, reporting against defined indicators can be poor. Some reports provided an estimate of intervention coverage without the data used to inform the estimate (eg, an estimate of the number of needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year, but without the population size and numerator used for this calculation). We did not use such estimates in this review, as we were unable to assess their validity. Lack of transparency in reporting can easily be remedied by providing the data used to generate estimates (ie, denominator and numerator), as well as the estimates themselves.</p>
