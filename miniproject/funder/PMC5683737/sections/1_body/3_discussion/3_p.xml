<p>Rapid scale-up of NSP and OST is urgently needed in regions where injecting drug use is an emerging issue, such as sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 37 countries in that region where injecting drug use has now been reported, only seven offer NSP, and eight OST. Coverage of these interventions is very low at the regional level: just two needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year (UI &lt;1–4), and one person receiving OST per 100 PWID (UI &lt;1–2). HIV prevalence among PWID in the region is estimated at 18% (UI 11–25), similar to the global estimate of 18% (11–25);

 </xref> however, HCV antibody prevalence is 22% (18–27), much lower than the global estimate of 52% (42–62).

 </xref> Increased intervention coverage will contribute to reduced HIV transmission and prevent further escalation of the HCV epidemic among PWID in sub-Saharan Africa.
