<p>For the TND, virus interference may be important if, by preventing influenza infection through vaccination, nonspecific and influenzavirus-specific immunity is not induced and leaves the vaccinee susceptible to infection by cocirculating viruses he or she might otherwise have been protected from. This would result in higher influenza vaccination coverage among controls with ORVs detected than in controls with no virus detected. Therefore, selection of controls could then lead to biased estimation of VE; that is, the VE estimates derived using the ORV-positive group would be higher than those for the PAN-negative group and the FLU-negative group. Simulation studies have suggested that while this phenomenon can produce biased estimates, that bias is trivial except under extreme conditions (

For example, immunological responses may be less apparent in the elderly than in children or young adults, possibly because of immunosenescence (
