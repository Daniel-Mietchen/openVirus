<p>The purported underlying mechanism behind these phenomena might involve both nonspecific immunity and influenzavirus-specific immunity (

In contrast, the influenzavirus-specific interference may involve T-cell-mediated immunity, which may last for months because of broad heterotypic cross-reactivity. The immune response might vary across different influenza strains and could possibly be more evident during an influenza pandemic wherein specific influenza strains predominate during the season (
