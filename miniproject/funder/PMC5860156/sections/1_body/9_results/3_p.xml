<p>Patients of all ages were investigated in 7 studies (

 <xref rid="kwx251C35" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), children in 4 studies (

 <xref rid="kwx251C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,

 <xref rid="kwx251C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Eight studies were carried out exclusively in outpatient settings (

 <xref rid="kwx251C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="kwx251C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), including 1 in an ED (
 <xref rid="kwx251C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>); 2 were carried out in inpatient settings (
 <xref rid="kwx251C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>); 1 used both inpatients and outpatients, with estimates broken down by setting (
 <xref rid="kwx251C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>); and 1 recruited outpatients (including ED patients), urgent-care patients, and acute-care patients (
 <xref rid="kwx251C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Various case definitions were identified. Some studies used an influenza-like illness definition (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 studies), others an acute respiratory infection definition (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3); one used either an influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection definition, while another required hospitalized pneumonia (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1); and 1 Japanese study required use of rapid influenza detection tests. The case definitions used are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Table 1</xref>. All studies included fever or history of fever in the clinical case definition, with the exception of 1 study which enrolled hospitalized pneumonia patients (
 <xref rid="kwx251C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Various restrictions were applied to the inclusion of patients based on the interval between symptom onset and clinical presentation, including presentation within 4 days, 7 days, and 10 days; 2 studies did not specify such a restriction (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB1">1</xref>).
