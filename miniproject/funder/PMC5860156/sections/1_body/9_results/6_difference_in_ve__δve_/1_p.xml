<p>We extracted 63 VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> estimates, 62 VE
 <sub>ORV+</sub> estimates, and 33 VE
 <sub>PAN−</sub> estimates for further comparison. The distributions of VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> and VE
 <sub>ORV+</sub> estimates are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx251F2">2</xref>A, while the distributions of VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> and VE
 <sub>PAN−</sub> estimates are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kwx251F2">2</xref>B. We observed VE estimates to be correlated and mostly distributed close to the identity lines. Among the 63 VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> estimates, 38 estimates were for persons of all ages, 18 were for children, and 4 were specifically for older adults; 44 were estimates of VE against influenza A or B viruses, while others were calculated for a specific influenza type/subtype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figures 1 and 2</xref>). All studies estimated VE after adjusting for potential confounders, including age, and 9 in 12 adjusted for calendar time as a proxy for changing influenza activity. We calculated ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub>, ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,PAN−</sub>, and ΔVE
 <sub>ORV+,PAN−</sub> from each available estimate. We did not find evidence of publication bias by assessing ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> and its standard error (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.64). No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the ΔVE estimates except those reported by van Doorn et al. (
