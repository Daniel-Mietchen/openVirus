<p>We further conducted meta-analysis on ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> estimates for children (7 ΔVE estimates), adults (3 ΔVE estimates), and elderly (2 ΔVE estimates). The pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> was 0% (95% CI: –9, 8) for children, –4% (95% CI: –21, 14) for young adults, and 1% (95% CI: –20, 22) for older adults. We were not able to identify any trend among age groups. We also performed sensitivity analysis by restricting VE estimates to specific influenza types/subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, and B) and settings (inpatient or outpatient). The pooled estimate was –2% (95% CI: –19, 15) from 3 ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> estimates for inpatient settings and –6% (95% CI: –13, 1) from 17 ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> estimates for outpatient settings. We did not observe a pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> that was statistically different from zero.
