<p>After restriction of the VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> estimates analyzed to those with confidence intervals spanning 100 percentage points or less, 48 VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> estimates, 48 VE
 <sub>ORV+</sub> estimates, and 24 VE
 <sub>PAN−</sub> estimates remained for further analysis (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 1</xref>). The 48 point estimates of ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> ranged from –43% to 18%. Forty of these estimates had an absolute value of less than 10% (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 1</xref>). The VE estimates excluded from meta-analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Web Figure 2</xref>. In the meta-analysis, we removed pooled ΔVE estimates if ΔVE estimates by age stratum/influenza season were available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) and estimated pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> against influenza A or B viruses. 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> and Cochran’s 
 <italic>Q</italic> test implied no concerning heterogeneity (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0, 
 <italic>Q</italic>(20 df) = 8.4, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.99). The pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> was –4% (95% confidence interval (CI): –10, 2) as estimated from 21 pairs of differences in VE estimates (ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> and ΔVE
 <sub>ORV+</sub>), consistent with no substantial difference for VE estimates between the FLU-negative and ORV-positive groups. Similarly, the pooled estimate for ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,PAN−</sub> was –1% (95% CI: –8, 5) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13), and that for ΔVE
 <sub>ORV+,PAN−</sub> was 5% (95% CI: –2, 12) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13).
