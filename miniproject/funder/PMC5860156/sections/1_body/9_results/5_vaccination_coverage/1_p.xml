<p>Vaccine coverage was reported by all studies for the various control groups considered. In addition, vaccine coverage by age group and control group was calculated for each study, where sufficient detail was provided. Because Pierse et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) reported results by study setting (inpatient and outpatient), Feng et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and Levy et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) reported results by season, and Sundaram et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) reported results by age group, we were able to calculate estimates for a total of 18 triplets from 12 studies (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB2">2</xref>). The vaccination coverage estimated from the FLU-negative group ranged from 9.0% among inpatient children aged 6 months–17 years in Hong Kong, China, in 2009–2013 (
 <xref rid="kwx251C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) to 68.3% among outpatient children aged 6 months–5 years in Australia in 2008 (
 <xref rid="kwx251C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The differences in vaccination coverage between the ORV-positive and PAN-negative groups ranged from −28.4% to 16.0% (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB2">2</xref>). However, the paired 
 <italic>t</italic> test comparing mean vaccination coverage between these groups suggested no statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.61). Of 18 differences in vaccination coverage point estimates, 6 were higher than 10%. We did not identify any age- or setting-specific pattern larger or smaller than 10% by univariate analysis.
