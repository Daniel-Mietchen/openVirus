<p>All studies estimated VE using both FLU-negative and ORV-positive controls. Seven also reported VE estimates obtained using PAN-negative controls (

 <xref rid="kwx251C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="kwx251C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). All studies performed PCR/reverse transcription PCR for influenza diagnosis among all patients or in a subset of patients. Some studies also used immunofluorescence and/or virus culture (

 <xref rid="kwx251C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB1">1</xref>). The number of ORVs included in the respiratory panels ranged from 3 to 8. All included studies tested for RSV. Other commonly included viruses were human metapneumovirus (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9 studies), adenovirus (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8), and rhinovirus (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB1">1</xref>). Only 2 studies reported the number of specimens testing positive for each ORV tested (
 <xref rid="kwx251C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In these 2 studies, the most commonly detected ORVs were RSV and rhinovirus, accounting for 66.5% (
 <xref rid="kwx251C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) and 73.1% (
 <xref rid="kwx251C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) of total ORVs detected, respectively. There was a weak negative correlation between the number of ORVs included in the panel and the proportion of patients identified as PAN-negative (
 <italic>r</italic> = –0.37), but this was not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.13). The proportion of controls identified as PAN-negative was lowest among children: 17.3% in 1 US study (
 <xref rid="kwx251C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), 26.8% in 1 Australian study conducted in an ED (
 <xref rid="kwx251C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and 21.3% from another Australian study conducted in an outpatient setting (
 <xref rid="kwx251C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB2">2</xref>). The proportion of patients testing positive for ORVs in the FLU-negative group ranged from 13.5% among people aged ≥10 years in Japan (
 <xref rid="kwx251C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) to 80.2% among children aged 6–59 months in the United States (
 <xref rid="kwx251C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The interquartile range was 27.5%–45.5% for all studies (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="kwx251TB2">2</xref>).
