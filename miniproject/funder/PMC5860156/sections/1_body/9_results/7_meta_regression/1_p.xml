<p>We performed meta-regression to explore factors that may contribute to VE using univariate and multivariate random-effects models. In univariate models, VE estimates were higher if the estimate was for children (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), persons of all ages (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), or inpatients (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) (

 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05; results not shown). In the multivariate regression, we also did not observe a significant association between the choice of control group and VE (

 <sub>(ORV+)</sub> = 0.24,

 <sub>(PANâˆ’)</sub> = 0.93) (
