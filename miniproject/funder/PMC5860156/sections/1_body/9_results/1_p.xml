 <xref rid="kwx251C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Kelly et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) estimated VE for children recruited from both a hospital emergency department (ED) and general practices in 2008, with estimates reported separately by setting; Blyth et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) conducted analysis for children recruited from the same ED from 2008 to 2012. To avoid this overlap, the ED results reported by Kelly et al. were excluded.
