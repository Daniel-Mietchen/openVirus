<p>However, TND studies conducted in inpatient settings could be complicated by acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory conditions, which could be difficult to distinguish from respiratory virus infections requiring hospitalization. Furthermore, if this population were more likely to receive influenza vaccination than the source population, selection bias would be introduced. Nevertheless, in a meta-analysis comparing inpatient and outpatient VE, Feng et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) observed similar VE estimates by setting when the analysis was restricted to the same season, country, and age group. In a simulation study examining the validity of the TND for inpatient settings, Foppa et al. (
 <xref rid="kwx251C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) concluded that VE estimates would be biased if chronic respiratory conditions were not well-controlled in the analysis. Under this assumption, vaccination coverage and VE estimates might differ according to different control groups; that is, higher vaccination coverage, and thus higher VE estimates, would be observed with the use of PAN-negative controls.
