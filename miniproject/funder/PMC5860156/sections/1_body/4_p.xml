<p>An assumption of case-control studies is that control selection should be independent of exposure. For influenza VE studies, this assumption may be violated if the risk of infection with a noninfluenza virus is not independent of vaccination status (

Several epidemiologic studies have observed “viral interference,” a phenomenon in which infection by one virus alters susceptibility to infection by another virus. This has been reported, for example, for influenzavirus and rhinovirus (
