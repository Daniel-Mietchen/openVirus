<p>Although randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for measuring vaccine efficacy, for the purpose of making annual VE estimates, observational studies are carried out more commonly because of feasibility, efficiency, and ethics. The test-negative design (TND) has been widely applied for measuring influenza VE on a routine basis in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia since 2005 (

In this study design, patients with signs and symptoms meeting predefined clinical definitions (e.g., acute respiratory infection or influenza-like illness) are swabbed and tested for influenza viruses. In some cases, testing may be done against a panel of respiratory viruses. Persons testing positive are defined as cases, while those testing negative for influenza viruses (influenza (FLU)-negative) are classified as controls. Persons who test negative may test positive for another respiratory virus (other/another respiratory virus (ORV)-positive) or may test negative for all viruses in the panel (panel (PAN)-negative). VE is estimated as VE% = 1 âˆ’ OR
 <sub>adj</sub>, where OR
 <sub>adj</sub> is the odds ratio comparing the odds of vaccination among cases with the odds of vaccination among the controls, adjusted for potential confounders such as age. This design can be embedded within existing surveillance systems to enable timely estimation of VE in both inpatient and outpatient settings at a reasonable cost (
