<p>Although the number of studies using the TND has been increasing, the theoretical underpinnings and inherent assumptions of the TND need further evaluation (

As a type of case-control study, the TND should follow the basic principles of control selection: 1) controls should be selected from the same population as cases and 2) controls should be selected independently of exposure, within each stratum of factors included in stratified analysis (
