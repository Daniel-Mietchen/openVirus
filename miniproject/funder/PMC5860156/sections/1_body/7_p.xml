<p>In this review, we aimed to assess whether virus interference could affect VE estimates generated from studies using the TND. First, we compared vaccination coverage using alternative control groups. Second, we compared VE estimates according to the choice of control group. Third, we summarized the total difference in VE estimates and assessed deviations from zero. Finally, we assessed whether any differences in VE were equally apparent among all age groups and in different study settings.</p>
