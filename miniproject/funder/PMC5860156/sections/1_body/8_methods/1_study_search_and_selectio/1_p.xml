<p>We previously reviewed TND studies that estimated influenza VE (
 <xref rid="kwx251C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). For the current review, we reassessed all papers derived from our previous searches (last performed on December 28, 2015 (
 <xref rid="kwx251C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)) and conducted an online update on April 18, 2017. Following the previous search strategies, papers were searched on PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland), MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), and Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for the following combination of keywords: 1) “influenza” 
 <italic>or</italic> “flu”; 2) “vaccine effectiveness” 
 <italic>or</italic> “VE”; 3) “test-negative” 
 <italic>or</italic> “test negative” 
 <italic>or</italic> “case-control” 
 <italic>or</italic> “case control”; and 4) sets 1, 2, 
 <italic>and</italic> 3. Articles were independently screened by 2 of the authors (S.F. and S.G.S.). Studies estimating influenza VE for any season, any influenza type/subtype, or any type of influenza vaccination by VE were considered. Only articles published in English were considered. Studies or subanalyses of studies which reanalyzed previously published data, reported interim estimates, or did not use the TND were excluded. All studies meeting these inclusion criteria were further screened and were included if influenza VE was estimated using alternative control groups, including FLU-negative, ORV-positive, and/or PAN-negative controls.
