<p>To test our hypothesis that virus interference may vary by age, we further estimated ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> by age group—that is, children (ages 6 months–17 years), young adults (ages 18–49 years), and older adults (ages ≥50 years). Since inpatient studies may be biased due to recruitment of patients with chronic respiratory disease rather than viral infection, we also examined ΔVE by setting, whenever possible. We evaluated whether pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> differed from zero among children or young adults more than among elderly adults. To further examine whether any study design feature was associated with VE estimates, we also conducted meta-regression by means of univariate and multivariate random-effects models. The predictors included age group (children, adults, elderly, and all ages), study setting (inpatient/outpatient/mixed), season (single/multiple), restriction of patients to those presenting for health care within 4 days (yes/no), exclusive use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/reverse transcription PCR for testing (yes/no), number of ORVs tested, and type of control group (FLU-negative, ORV-positive, or PAN-negative). All analyses were conducted using R, version 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the
