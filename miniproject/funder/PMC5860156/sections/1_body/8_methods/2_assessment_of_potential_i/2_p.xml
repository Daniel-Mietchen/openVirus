<p>We calculated 95% confidence intervals for each ΔVE by bootstrap, using 1,000 resamples (see the Web Appendix, available at 
 <uri xlink:href="https://academic.oup.com/aje" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://academic.oup.com/aje</uri>). We excluded studies with large uncertainty, as defined by a 95% confidence interval range for VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> of more than 100 percentage points. The remaining studies were pooled, and estimates of ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub>, ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,PAN−</sub>, and ΔVE
 <sub>ORV+,PAN−</sub> against influenza A or B were calculated. Where studies provided both overall estimates and estimates for subgroups, we removed the overall estimate to avoid any overlap. We performed Egger’s test on ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> and its standard error to assess publication bias. A fixed-effects model was assumed, and heterogeneity was examined by means of the 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> statistic and Cochran’s 
 <italic>Q</italic> test. The inverse of the variance of ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> was used to weight the studies.
