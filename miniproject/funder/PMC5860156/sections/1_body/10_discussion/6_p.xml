<p>In conclusion, based on 12 studies estimating VE using alternative control groups, we did not find evidence of virus interference, suggesting that VE estimates obtained by means of the TND are not biased by virus interference. Using FLU-negative controls is likely to produce VE estimates that are as reliable as those of ORV-positive and PAN-negative controls. From a resource-saving perspective, investigators in surveillance systems or research schemes using the TND to measure influenza VE may consider not testing further for ORVs when estimating influenza VE. Further simulation studies that incorporate multiple sources of bias and examine this phenomenon in different age groups could help confirm or refute our findings.</p>
