<p>We found that the proportion of PAN-negative controls varied substantially among studies. These differences could partially be explained by the number of ORVs tested. However, we only observed a nonsignificant, weak, negative correlation between the number of ORVs tested and the proportion PAN-negative. The types of viruses included in the panel may also affect the proportion PAN-negative. For example, in the 2 studies reporting the detection rates of each ORV, rhinovirus and RSV were most commonly detected. Only 1 study from Hong Kong (
 <xref rid="kwx251C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) did not include rhinovirus, which could explain why this study had the highest proportion PAN-negative. The differences in proportion PAN-negative are likely to also be associated with viral load and shedding. With the exception of the Hong Kong study (
 <xref rid="kwx251C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), the studies involving children presented low proportions of PAN-negative subjects among all eligible subjects, which is consistent with observations of higher viral load and shedding from children (
 <xref rid="kwx251C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The heterogeneity of viral shedding by age suggests potential misclassification bias in the PAN-negative group, where results may be more likely to be false-negative among samples taken from older patients. Other reasons for false-negative influenza results may be associated with suboptimal swab quality, imperfect laboratory testing methods, or long intervals from symptom onset to presentation (
 <xref rid="kwx251C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). All of these factors could contribute to misclassification of infection status and contribute to larger ΔVE
 <sub>ORV+,PAN−</sub> values. Under this circumstance, the ORV-positive group could be considered the one providing more accurate VE estimates, because it demonstrates that the swab and swabbing method were of sufficient quality to detect virus (
