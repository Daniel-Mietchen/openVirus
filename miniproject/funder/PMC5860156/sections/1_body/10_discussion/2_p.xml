<p>The nonspecific immune response to influenzavirus involves the activation of natural killer cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, the immune functions of which are known to decrease with age (
 <xref rid="kwx251C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Therefore, we assumed that the phenomenon of virus interference may be more prevalent among younger, rather than older, age groups. However, our analysis did not strongly support this hypothesis; although age group was correlated with VE estimates, we did not observe an interaction between any age groups and choices of control groups in multivariate meta-regression. We acknowledge that our sample size was small, and as the number of studies examining this phenomenon increases, evidence for virus interference may arise.
