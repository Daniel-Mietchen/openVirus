<p>Based on 12 studies identified from 155 TND publications providing 63 VE
 <sub>FLU−</sub> estimates, 62 VE
 <sub>ORV+</sub> estimates, and 33 VE
 <sub>PAN−</sub> estimates, we did not find any statistical differences in VE by type of control group. The paired 
 <italic>t</italic> test assessing vaccination coverage also did not demonstrate any difference by choice of control group. Although we observed a ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> less than zero reported in 1 study, the difference was not consistently observed in each season (
 <xref rid="kwx251C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The pooled ΔVE
 <sub>FLU−,ORV+</sub> estimate for 21 pairs of observations was –4% (95% CI: –10, 2), suggesting that the choice of control group is unlikely to significantly affect VE estimated using the TND.
