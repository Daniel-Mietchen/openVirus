<p>Influenza vaccines are the most effective measure available for reducing the substantial annual disease burden associated with 
 <italic>Influenzavirus</italic> infections. Influenza vaccines generally have moderate-to-good efficacy, estimated to fall within the range of 60%–70% in children and 50%–60% in adults based on randomized controlled trials (

 <xref rid="kwx251C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, influenza vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary from year to year depending on the degree of antigenic match between strains selected for inclusion in the vaccine and circulating strains, as well as the intervals between vaccination and influenza epidemics (

 <xref rid="kwx251C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="kwx251C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These factors may affect both experimental and observational study designs. Thus, annual estimates of influenza VE can provide ongoing evidence on the performance of influenza vaccines in the community.
