 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Some workshops were with single organizations and some with up to four organizations. All the participating organizations conducted peer-led programs with a mix of paid and volunteer staff. The size and capacity of the organizations varied significantly (ranging from four paid staff to over 40). All were engaged in peer service delivery, peer health promotion and peer leadership activities to varying degrees. Organizations participated in the project on the basis that staff participation in workshops was voluntary. Each participant in the workshops was provided a plain language information pack about the project and provided signed voluntary informed consent to participate in each aspect of the research data collection. The project was provided ethics approval by the La Trobe University Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval No: FHEC14/155). More than 90 staff and volunteers were involved across the workshops (
