<p>In its original format Maani and Cavana's (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) “iceberg” model invites reflection on events, patterns, structures, with mental models at the base. In our version of the model we asked about events, patterns, structures and 
 <italic>cultures</italic>—since cultures are how mental models are transmitted and inculcated in a peer networks or communities. Facilitating the discussion using the iceberg model made it possible to reconstruct, from the mental models that different participants described to understand and explain the hypothetical event depicted in the narrative, how the program learns about the social systems it engages with. Following the small group discussions to generate insights, affinity methods were used to discuss different ways of grouping the insights to identify higher-level themes.
