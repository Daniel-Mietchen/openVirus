 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), a tool used in systems thinking to identify the regular (i.e., cyclical) relationships or “loops” among the higher-level themes. They provided a visual language for specifying relationships and flows of influence, thus helping us theorize what social processes and causal mechanisms might underlie the repeated emergence of these themes in program and sector-level discussions. For example, a commonality among the diagrams was that flows of 
 <italic>knowledge</italic> were essential for the purposes of guiding adaptation, both within the program and the sector, to maintain sustained influence within both the target communities and the policy context.
