<p>The workshops from phase 1 elicited a series of complex system maps looking at peer-led programs and leadership with communities of gay and other men who have sex with men, people living with HIV, people who inject drugs, and sex workers. These included programs engaging at different levels of the HIV and hepatitis C responses in Australiaâ€”from frontline peer service delivery, to peer health promotion, and peer leadership. The final versions of the maps and their full descriptions are available as Supplementary Materials, and further updates on the project can be found online at
