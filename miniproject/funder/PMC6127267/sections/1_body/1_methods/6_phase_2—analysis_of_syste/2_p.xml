<p>As our goal was to develop a framework for monitoring and evaluation that could be applied to peer led programs at different levels and contexts, we needed to analyse and generalize across these system maps. Within the tradition of realist evaluation and synthesis, Pawson and Tilley (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Envisioning the program as an organism and its community and policy contexts as its surrounding ecology, we asked what functions it would need to be equipped with in order to learn about and adapt to changes in its environment. We analyzed the maps for functions that occurred across all the system maps and incorporated the relationships and flows within the system maps.
