<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> provides examples of quality indicators for peer leadership drawn from the broader work with the peer-led organizations. The indicators were developed in consultation with partner organizations and serve as examples of check list items to ensure the preconditions for peer leadership and influence in the community and the policy system are being met. The intention is the quality indicators in Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> would be tailored to the specifics of a peer program or peer organization, and so be more specific and measurable. The W3 project is now undertaking this process by using the W3 framework to trial tailored indicators and tools for use within specific peer-led organizations. This includes indicators and tools for use in peer-outreach supervision meetings, program planning and review sessions, collation of process and impact evaluation data, and participation in peer-leadership advocacy coalitions and collectives. The focus is on using current process, quality and impact data in a more effective and meaningful way. For further details see
