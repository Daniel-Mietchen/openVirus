<p>For example, a program that is influential and valued in its community should be hearing and seeing through its engagement how the community is adapting or responding to the changing environment. A program that is not privy to such changes may be an indicator that it is not reaching or influential within those parts of the community. A program that is not adapting may be an indicator of a program with low community engagement, or a whose policy environment is not allowing it to adapt in tandem with its community, rather than a program maintaining fidelity to an intervention protocol. Therefore, process data on changes in the way the community is engaging with the peer program may provide insight into the quality and impact of their previous community influence, as it is part of the same system dynamic.</p>
