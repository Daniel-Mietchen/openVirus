<p>Influence within community systems: Peer leadership involves working within, rather than intervening upon, community. In addition to its cultural relevance, it has the credibility of being accountable to community members and groups. The role of peer leadership includes navigating and participating in community debate with its tensions and challenges. Effective peer leadership brings to the strategy an authenticity and credibility based within a long term relationship within the target communities, yet its influence on the community is also drawn in part from the visibility of its advocacy within the policy system and the broader mainstream society. The W3 Framework looks for signs that community members see the peer led program as culturally credible and authentic and expects the peers taking on leadership activities to draw on insights based in part on their own lives. The evolving ways that the community engage with the peer program, and become more empowered, can be an indicator of the authenticity, relevance and impact of past influence.</p>
