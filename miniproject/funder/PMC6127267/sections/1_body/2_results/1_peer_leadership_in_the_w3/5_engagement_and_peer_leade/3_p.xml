<p>A key finding from the W3 project is that knowledge generated through high quality engagement can flow, through effective practices of peer leadership, to other policy actors and stakeholders in the prevention sector. This knowledge may identify emerging trends and issues well in advance of formal surveillance and social/behavioral research studies, and this can be crucial in fast-changing contexts. For example, responding quickly to address barriers to safe injecting posed by changing policing practices in street drug markets, or the way PrEP may be increasing or decreasing stigma as the community's engagement with PrEP evolves, or the ways sex workers adapt to changes in policing policies or laws to try and maintain their safety. These real-time insights, and the capacity to identify emerging trends and issues within a community, are critical to peer leadership being relevant and persuasive in the community and policy systems.</p>
