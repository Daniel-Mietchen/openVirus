<p>While there are findings and implications from the W3 Project that are specific to different types of peer-led activities (e.g., peer service delivery, peer health promotion, and peer leadership) and to different key populations (e.g., gay men, people who use drugs, sex workers, and people living with HIV), these differences will be explored in detail in forthcoming papers. This paper will focus on broad lessons and implications for peer leadership programs engaging with diverse communities and policy settings.</p>
