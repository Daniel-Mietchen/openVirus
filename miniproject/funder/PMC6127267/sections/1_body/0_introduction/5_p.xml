<p>Monitoring the quality and impact of specific peer-led programs and their leadership role is challenging (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Most evaluations look at the quality and impact of programs in isolation from their context and measure fidelity to a pre-defined protocol, and therefore struggle to capture the complexity of their interaction with and adaptation to the rapidly changing community and socio-political contexts in which they are implemented (

 <italic>all about</italic> interactions between the program, the communities they work with, and the policy environment within which they operate and collaborate. What this often leads to is a policy rhetoric about community mobilization and peer leadership and the importance of combining behavioral, biomedical, and structural responses, but community and peer-led programs being funded, monitored and managed as standalone instances of generic interventions. There is conflicting evidence as to the cost effectiveness of peer led health promotion (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), however often omitted from the analysis is the potential community and policy system roles of peer-led programs. Moreover, cost-effectiveness studies tend to focus on direct effects rather than synergistic effects registered in other parts of the prevention system as a result of the contribution made by peer leadership activities and programs.
