<p>Drawing on a systems thinking approach, the W3 framework provides a new way of articulating the role of peer-led programs and peer leadership activities in a changing HIV prevention landscape, and identifying more useful indicators for the monitoring of quality and impact. Feedback from our collaborating partners highlight the “sense making” role of systems thinking approach. The W3 Framework assisted peer leaders to highlight the relationship between the elements of their system. This included relationship between on the ground peer outreach activities and the role of peer leadership activities in policy reforms. The framework (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and indicators (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) assist in identifying the most important relationships within that complexity, and then draw together the formal and informal evaluation data, programmatic insights, and community anecdotes in a way that can be more meaningful and useful. The W3 Framework also highlights the role that the rest of the HIV response needs to play in order to gain the most benefit from investments in peer-led programs. Peer led programs, as part of that investment, need the ability to maintain strong connections with all members of the policy system, and possess the necessary resources to maintain alignment of purpose. Peer led programs need to not only demonstrate authenticity to advocate on behalf of their community—but this authenticity needs to be recognized and supported by the sector and timed to when the opportunity emerges or is created (
