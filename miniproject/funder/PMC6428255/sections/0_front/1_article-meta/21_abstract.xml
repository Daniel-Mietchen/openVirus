 <p>The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Western Africa is the largest recorded filovirus disease outbreak and led to the death of over 11,000 people. The recent EVD outbreaks (since May 2018) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already claimed the lives of over 250 people. Tackling Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks remains a challenge. Over the years, significant efforts have been put into developing vaccines or antibody therapies which rely on an envelope glycoprotein (GP) of 
  <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (strain Mayinga-76). Therefore, one key approach for combating EVD epidemics is to predict mutations that may diminish the effectiveness of the treatment. In a previous study we generated a watch list of potential antibody escape mutations of EBOV GP against the monoclonal antibody KZ52. Molecular modeling methods were applied to the three-dimensional experimental structure of EBOV GP bound to KZ52 to predict the effect of every possible single mutation in EBOV GP. The final watch list contained 34 mutations that were predicted to destabilize binding of KZ52 to EBOV GP but did not affect EBOV GP folding and its ability to form trimers. In this study, we expand our watch list by including three more monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes on GP, namely Antibody 100 (Ab100), Antibody 114 (Ab114) and 13F6-1-2. Our updated watch list contains 127 mutations, three of which have been seen in humans or are experimentally associated with reduced efficacy of antibody treatment. We believe mutations on this watch list require attention since they provide information about circumstances in which interventions could lose the effectiveness.
