<p>For a mutation to be placed on a watch list for EBOV it must: (1) disrupt binding to a protective antibody, and (2) leave the viral proteins functional thus allowing them to fold and assemble. It is thus necessary to determine how amino acid mutations alter stabilities (ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values) for GP folding, forming a trimer and binding to the antibody. In our previous work, we have obtained ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values of GP folding, GP trimer formation and GP binding to KZ52 antibody using our molecular dynamics (MD) plus FoldX approach.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this study we calculate ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values of binding for Ab100, Ab114 and 13F6-1-2 antigen-antibody complexes using the same modeling approach.
