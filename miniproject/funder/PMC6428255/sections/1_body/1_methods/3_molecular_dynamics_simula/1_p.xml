<p>All three EBOV–antibody complexes were subjected to atomistic MD simulations using the protocol reported in our previous study.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Briefly, the software package GROMACS 5.0.7[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] was used for all MD simulations with the Charmm22* forcefield.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] GP MLD peptide– 13F6-1-2 simulations were 100 ns, and the GP–Ab100 and Ab114 production simulations were run for a shorter 50 ns due to the large number of atoms in the final simulation box. During the production simulation snapshots were saved every 1 ns resulting in 50 snapshots for each of the GP–Ab100 and GP–Ab114 systems, and 100 snapshots for the peptide– 13F6-1-2 complex.
