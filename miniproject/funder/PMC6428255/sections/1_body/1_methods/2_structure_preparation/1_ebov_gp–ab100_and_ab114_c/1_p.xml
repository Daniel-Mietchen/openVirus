<p>Structures of Ab100 and Ab114 bound to EBOV GP were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 5FHC.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The EBOV GP amino acid sequence was based on the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (strain Mayinga-76), just like our previous study. The PDB file 5fhc.pdb contains coordinates of both Ab100 and Ab114 bound to EBOV GP (GP1 &amp; GP2) monomer at different sites. This file was first modified to remove all but one copy each of GP1, GP2, antibody light chain and antibody heavy chain of Ab100 and Ab114 (one third of the GP-Ab100/Ab114 trimeric complex), and then was split into two files where one file had the GP–Ab100 complex and the other had the GP–Ab114 complex. The MODELLER software[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was then used to build the missing residues. This included residues 190–213 that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered; the resulting complexes had no secondary structure content in this region. The full EBOV trimer protein complex was then created using the symexp command in PyMOL (see Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g001">1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g002">2A</xref>) and contained three copies each of GP1 (residues 33–278), GP2 (residues 502–599), heavy and light chains of the antibody.
