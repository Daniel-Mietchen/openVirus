<p>Crystal structure of the 13F6-1-2 Fab fragment bound to its EBOV GP mucin-like domain (GP MLD) peptide epitope (11 amino acids, VEQHHRRTDND) was downloaded from the PDB using the 2QHR accession number.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Unlike other epitopes used in our previous and current study, this structure was based on the 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic> (strain Eckron-76). However, the alignment of the 11-residue long peptide was 100% identical to the 1976 Mayinga strain. The PDB file 2qhr.pdb was edited to remove everything except GP MLD peptide (residues 404â€“414) and heavy and light chains of 13F6-1-2 antibody. (see
