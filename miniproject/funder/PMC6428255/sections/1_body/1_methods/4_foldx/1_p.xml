<p>Snapshots of all three complexes were analyzed using FoldX software.[

 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] As with our previous study, we began by executing RepairPDB command on each snapshot six times in succession to minimize and obtain convergence of the potential energy. BuildModel command was then used to generate all possible 19 single mutations in EBOV GP and GP MLD peptide at each amino acid site. Lastly, the binding stability of the protein complex due to each mutation was estimated using AnalyseComplex command. For each mutation, we then estimated ΔΔ
