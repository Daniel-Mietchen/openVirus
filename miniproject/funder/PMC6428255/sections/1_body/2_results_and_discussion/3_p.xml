 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g004">Fig 4</xref> represents our expanded watch list of EBOV GP mutations against KZ52, Ab100, Ab114 and 13F6-1-2 antibodies. ΔΔ

 <sub>Bind</sub> values for all antibody complexes. The 127 mutations highlighted in colors are part of the watch list as they are predicted to destabilize the antibody binding yet allow EBOV GP to remain functional. There were 21, 33, 39 and 34 watch list mutations respectively in Ab100, Ab114, 13F6-1-2 and KZ52 antibody complexes. Each watch list mutation is given in the 
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and shows that they are concentrated at just six residues in KZ52 and at five residues in each of the other three antibody complexes. (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g001">Fig 1B &amp; 1C</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) All of these 21 amino acid sites on EBOV GP are present at the binding interface with mAbs. Interestingly, amino acid changes to Tryptophan (W), Tyrosine (Y), Phenyl alanine (F) and Argenine (R) were seen on 17, 15, 12 and 11 sites respectively out of 21 sites on the watchlist. This clearly suggests that amino acid substitution with bulky side chain at the binding interface is disruptive to the antibody binding.
