<p>The current expanded watch list includes only four epitopes for which experimental structures of antibodies interacting with viral proteins are available. However, there are other epitopes known for EBOV GP.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The availability of more experimental three-dimensional structures would allow the current watch list to grow. In our previous study,[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] we chose a conservative functional zone of −3 &lt; ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>Max</sub> &lt; 3 kcal/mol for mutations based on the in-silico stability predictions of the observed functional mutations in a viral coat protein[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and of 41 mutations detected in 963 EBOV GP sequences. Moreover, our choice of ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>Bind</sub> &gt; 2 kcal/mol to define disruption of antibody binding was made by refining the initial threshold to be more inclusive. Further in-depth justification on thresholds is provided in our previous study.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, experimental evaluation is necessary to define these thresholds. The size of our watch list would naturally change with modified thresholds so we have provided spreadsheets with raw ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic>
 <sub>Bind</sub> data to enable others to build custom watch lists. Our modeling approach predicts ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> value for single amino acid substitutions since it uses FoldX and thus is not appropriate for cases where the antibody binding is disrupted by multiple substitutions. This is because the semi-empirical energy function built into the FoldX software is trained using experimental ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values of single mutations.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Using FoldX to predict ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values for multiple substitutions is thus expected to yield erroneous results. Moreover, FoldX uses a single three-dimensional static protein structure as an input for predicting ΔΔ
 <italic>G</italic> values. Therefore, it is unlikely to identify escape mutations occurring at a region other than binding interface or where mutations disrupt binding by altering the conformation of the protein. In vitro validation of the expanded watch list and the accuracy of this approach in predicting escape mutation has not yet been carried out and we hope our study will encourage such research.
