<p>Watch list mutations in 
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> may act as a reference for public health monitoring agencies. Appearance of any of these mutations in a real population suggests possible diminished effectiveness of these antibodies. One watch list mutation N550K mutation was detected during an EVD outbreak in humans who are believed to have acquired EBOV from gorillas in Central Africa between 2001 and 2003. Moreover, sequencing study carried out on all the isolates from this outbreak revealed the presence of this mutation. N550K has appeared on our watch list suggesting the reduced efficacy of KZ52.[
