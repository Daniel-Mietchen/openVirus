<p>As reported in our previous work,[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] we were able to identify three amino acid sites (N550, D552 and G553; see 
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) out of five sites (C511, N550, D552, G553 and C556), that were found to be critical in binding of KZ52 to GP in an alanine scanning mutagenesis conducted by Davidson et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] 74% of the watch list mutations predicted against KZ52 occurred at these three sites. (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) If we ignore our threshold for folding and dimer or trimer formation, we would predict all five crucial sites reported by Davidson et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Our modeling approach predicted a destabilizing (ΔΔ

 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is likely due to the limitation of the FoldX software or possible changes in the conformation caused by the alanine substitution.
