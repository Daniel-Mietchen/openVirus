<p>In summary, we have expanded the watch list of potential antibody escape mutations of EBOV by including three more antibody complexes: EBOV GP–Ab100, GP–Ab114 and GP Mucin-like domain (GP MLD) peptide– 13F6-1-2. The watch list now contains 127 mutations in 21 sites in EBOV GP. Mutations from the watch list that appear during an outbreak deserve attention since they may be a signal of an evolution of the virus or evolutionary response against the antibody treatment that could reduce the efficacy of treatment efforts. Ab114 has been recently approved for the first time to treat infected individuals during the current EVD outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo. (

The watch list can still be expanded if more experimental structures of EBOV–antibody complexes become available. In fact, as we were preparing this manuscript, the crystal structure of mAb CA45 bound to GP1 and GP2 interface of EBOV GP were published by Janus et al.[
