<p>In the study of MB-003,[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] a plant-derived monoclonal antibody cocktail composed of c13C6, 13F6-1-2, and c6D8 used effectively in treatment of EBOV virus infection in non-human primates. This cocktail was unable to protect two of six animals when initiated one- or two-days post-infection. Investigation of a mechanism of viral escape in one of the animals showed five nonsynonymous mutations in the monoclonal antibody target sites. Among these mutations 
 <italic>Q406R</italic> and 
 <italic>R409C</italic> were linked to a reduction in 13F6-1-2 antibody binding.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Both of these mutations were correctly identified by our modeling strategy and are present on the watch list.
