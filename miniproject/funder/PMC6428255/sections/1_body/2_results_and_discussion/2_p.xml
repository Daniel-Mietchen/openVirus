<p>The EBOV GP is a class I fusion protein consisting of disulfide-linked subunits, GP1 and GP2, that bind to form a chalice-shaped trimer. (see Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g002">2A</xref>) Ab100 interacts at the base of the GP trimer (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). This interaction is similar to that of KZ52, the prototypic neutralizing antibody used in our previous study. However, Ab100 contacts GP1 and GP2 of a monomer and the disordered (residue 190â€“213) loop of the neighboring monomer (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) in contrast to KZ52 which interacts with GP2 of a single monomer. The epitope for Ab114 spans the inner chalice of GP and is in close proximity to the glycan cap, (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211093.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) where it remains bound after proteolytic cleavage of the glycan cap and prevents interaction of cleaved GP to its host receptor.[
