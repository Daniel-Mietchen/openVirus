<p>There is evidence to suggest that our watch list may also be applicable to the secreted glycoprotein (sGP). The main protein expressed from 
 <italic>GP</italic> gene is sGP, not the EBOV envelope GP. sGP is dimeric and has a same sequence for first 295 amino acids at N-terminal as envelope GP but has a differing C-terminal region. A study by Iwasa et al.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that sGP was able to form a complex with GP2 and mimic the role of GP1 in an in vitro analysis. Moreover, they showed that a complex formed by sGP and GP2 was able to interact with KZ52 antibody.
