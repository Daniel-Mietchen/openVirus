<p>The 2014–2016 EVD outbreak in Western Africa promoted discovery of new therapeutics and accelerated development of existing candidates.[

Sequencing studies conducted on EBOV have revealed a significant genetic variation in EBOV glycoprotein (GP). Sequences recovered during 2014–2016 EVD outbreak in Western Africa have shown 106 out of 676 sites in the GP are affected by the genetic modifications.[
