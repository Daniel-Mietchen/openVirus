<p>The aim of this study is to expand our watch list of potential antibody escape mutants for EBOV GP. After we published our previous watch list, three more 3-D structures of mAbs interacting with different epitopes on EBOV GP (necessary for our molecular modeling approach) were published in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In this study, we expand our watch list to include possible antibody escape mutations from three antibodies with distinct epitopes: Antibody 100 (Ab100), Antibody 114 (Ab114) and 13F6-1-2. Our watch list now contains 127 mutations, three of which have been seen in humans (
