<p>To address the potential threat of EBOV evolution outpacing antibody treatment efforts we previously initiated a watch list of potential antibody escape mutants for the EBOV GP.[
 <xref rid="pone.0211093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] We focused on the KZ52 mAb as it had a 3-D experimental structure bound to EBOV GP available. In this previous study, we combined use of FoldX software with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to estimate folding and binding stabilities. We placed 34 mutations on the watch list by considering every possible EBOV GP mutation and choosing those that disrupt binding between GP and KZ52 but do not disrupt the ability of GP to fold and bind to form a complex. One of these 34 mutations (
