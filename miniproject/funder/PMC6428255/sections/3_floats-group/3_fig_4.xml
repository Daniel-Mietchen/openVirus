   <sub>Max</sub> values are considered to be zero for the intrinsically disordered 11-residue MLD peptide. Symbols in the inset legend indicate the corresponding antibody. Watch list mutations are shown as colored symbols and are predicted to disrupt binding to any one of the four antibodies (KZ52, Ab100, Ab114 and 13F6-1-2) but not to disrupt GP folding and trimer formation. Consistent with our previous study, mutations with ΔΔ
   <italic>G</italic>
   <sub>Bind</sub> &gt; 2 kcal/mol are considered disruptive to antibody binding and those with −3 &lt; ΔΔ
   <italic>G</italic>
   <sub>Max</sub> &lt; 3 kcal/mol are considered functional. The number of watch list mutations associated with each antibody is shown in the legend.
