<p>Reviewer #2: In the manuscript by Verster et al, the authors attempt to correlate variables found in soil to areas associated with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). As this virus is associated with increased rainfall, and is a well-known zoonotic agent transmitted by mosquitos, an attempt to associate factors such as soil minerality, as well as factors associated with soil moisture were measured. This involved comparing sites where RVFV have been known to exist, and comparing them to sites where RVFV has not been known to exist.</p>
