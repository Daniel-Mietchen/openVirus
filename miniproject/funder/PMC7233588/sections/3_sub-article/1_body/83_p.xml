<p>There is no comment on the relationship between Br and mortalities? But it is mentioned in the results (line 250) and the discussion (line 282) as a significant variable. There seems to be discrepancy between the results, the discussion and the conclusion and the abstract about which variables are significantly associated with RVF mortalities. The conflicting variables are Ca2+, Mg2+ and Br.</p>
