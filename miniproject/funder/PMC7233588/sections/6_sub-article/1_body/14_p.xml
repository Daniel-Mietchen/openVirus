<p>There is a discrepancy between the described results and the discussion with different variables being described as being included in the final model. (Line numbers refer to the marked-up version). On line 255 of the marked-up version the results clearly state the following “four variables (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were identified by the stepwise variable selection of the discriminant analysis to discriminate between sites with and without reported RVF mortality”. There is a clear list of FOUR variables. However, in the discussion line 275 the authors refer to three variables “soluble Ca2+ and exchangeable K+, and medium sand”. The authors are discussing different variables from their results – soluble Ca2+ has been added and Br and exchangeable Mg2+ dropped? Then again on line 290 they refer to four variables being in the model “Although only soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, Br and medium sand were used in the final model”. Again a different list of variables. Please note that soluble Ca2+ is not described in the results in page 15 as being in the final model. In the conclusion line 333-335 the authors again refer to three variables “Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, and medium sand) were subsequently selected for inclusion into a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict an RVF outbreak site” In the abstract line 11-12 the authors write “Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, and medium sand) were consequently included in a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict a Rift Valley fever outbreak site”. This inconsistency regarding the number of variables and the list of variables included in the final model NEEDS to be rectified before publication.</p>
