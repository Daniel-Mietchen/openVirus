<p>17. Discussion: According to us the distinction is quite clear. There were eight variables (CEC, exchangeable Ca2+, exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, soluble Ca2+, medium sand, As, and Br) that differed significantly between the with and without RVFV. From these eight variable only four (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were used in the discriminant function, since the inclusion of the other four would be superfluous. Also, the other reviewer did not comment on this.</p>
