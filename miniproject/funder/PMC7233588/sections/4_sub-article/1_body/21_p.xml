<p>Reviewer 2 states: “Interestingly, the conclusions that the authors propose seem to be at odds with other publications, where soil conditions of RVFV+ regions are considerably different than the ones proposed as ideal in this publication.” We have found only two papers (Hightower et al., 2012; Sindato et al., 2016) relating soil properties to RVF. If anything, the findings of these papers support, rather than contradict our findings. We have added some sentences in the manuscript to clarify this.</p>
