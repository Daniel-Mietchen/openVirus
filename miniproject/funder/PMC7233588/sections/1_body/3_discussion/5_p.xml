<p>By including other environmental components drawn from soil, geology, hydrology, vegetation and climate, a more accurate conclusion could possibly be drawn about the areas of southern Africa at greatest risk for future outbreaks of RVF. Predictive ecological/epidemiological models, based on these linkages are vital to provide insight on how best to mitigate and control future RVF outbreaks. In addition, future national soil surveys should include characterization of soil properties such as those highlighted here to serve as a reference for areas of potential RVF activity.</p>
