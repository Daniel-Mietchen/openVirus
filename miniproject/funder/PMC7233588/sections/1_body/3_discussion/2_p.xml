 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conducted a visual field assessment of soil type and found that high clay-content soils was a common factor in areas of high RVF mortality in the Free State and Northern Cape of South Africa. While clay was not found to be a significant factor in our study, a lower medium sand content may indicate there is higher water retention. Sindato et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recently determined that in northern and central-eastern Tanzania, soil type (impermeable soils) and rainfall in the wettest quarter of the year accounted for nearly two-thirds of the variation in habitat suitability for RVF occurrence. Impermeable soils, which are characterized by high clay content and loamy texture, do not allow water to easily filter through. This supports long periods of water retention, which contributes to flooding and wetness and thus provides a habitat suitable for the breeding, survival, and hatching of RVFV infected
