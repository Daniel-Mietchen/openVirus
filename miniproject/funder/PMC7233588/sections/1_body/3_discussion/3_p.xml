<p>Although only exchangeable K
 <sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, and Br were used in the final model, the correlation between CEC on the one hand, and exchangeable Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K
 <sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, and soluble Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> on the other hand, was relatively high (
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and therefore these latter variables were not considered to be independent predictors of whether or not RVF mortalities had been reported. CEC represents the total amount of exchangeable cations that the soil can adsorb, and thus CEC and the basic cations (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>) frequently have a close relationship, with a higher CEC in the soil correlating to a higher basic cation concentration [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, CEC is also dependent on the clay content, clay type, organic matter content, and pH of the soil [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, a higher CEC (and in parallel, higher amounts of exchangeable Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K
 <sup>+</sup>, and exchangeable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>) likely represents a more clayey, alkaline soil. The higher CEC and exchangeable cations in sites with observed RVF relates somewhat to the findings of Hightower et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], that RFV is accociated with Solonetz, Calcisol, Solonchak, and Planosol soil types. Although not stated in their paper, these soils are normally associated with more clayey, alkaline environments.
