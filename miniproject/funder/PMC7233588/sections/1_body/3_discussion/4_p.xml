<p>The properties of soil influence the flooding and drainage of a wetland, and, potentially, the capacity for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito eggs to survive and remain vital in the soil until heavy rainfall occurs [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. By identifying sites of past RVF outbreaks in South Africa, this study was able to retrospectively identify possible links between soil chemistry and mineralogy, microbiology, and RVF mortalities. Wetland soil characteristics could thus be used to improve predictive ecological models for identifying areas that are likely to be conducive to mosquito vector breeding and survival, and subsequent RVF outbreaks. Water content, pH, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and lithology also merits investigation to enhance understanding of the requirements for vector production, in addition to the factors highlighted here. Common factors that have been related to areas of high RVF mortality in South Africa include the presence of low-salinity, freshwater and wetland vegetation composed mainly of sedges, 
 <italic>Juncus</italic> and grasses [
