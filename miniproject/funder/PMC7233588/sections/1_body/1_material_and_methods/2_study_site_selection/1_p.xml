<p>An area of approximately 200 km by 200 km in the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces was chosen for this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232481.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Five sites were selected at approximately 40 km intervals along an east-west transect from Bloemfontein to the Mokala National Park, also representing a moisture gradient, regardless of whether or not RVF livestock mortality had been reported to the OIE in 2009â€“2010 [

Ten sites were additionally selected based on locations with reported mortalities in livestock, while an additional seven sites were selected that did not report livestock mortalities, giving 22 sites in total. The field work was primarily conducted on private land and the owners gave us explicit permission to conduct the research on their land. One site was managed by the South African National Parks and for this site we worked under permit: KAREW1257. Study sites were subsequently grouped into those where RVF livestock mortality had been reported and those where no livestock mortality had been reported [
