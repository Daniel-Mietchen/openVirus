<p>Soil samples were collected in May and June 2015, using a soil auger. Soil samples were collected from the permanent wet zone of the wetland [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with plot sizes varying (approximately 10 m
 <sup>2</sup>) according to wetland type, location and physical access to sites. These plots were also investigated for vegetation [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], mosquito and weather-related factors, as part of a larger study. Composite soil samples, consisting of sub-samples from six auger holes within each plot were collected. The six sub-samples were mixed thoroughly, and a representative sample of approximately 1 kg was taken for further analysis. Soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0â€“50 mm) and from each dominant soil layer, also termed the master horizon [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], yielding 3 to 4 sampled layers per site. A detailed soil profile description [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and soil profile classification, using IUSS Working Group WRB [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], was done at each plot.
