<p>A surface organic material (dead vegetation) sample was also collected from a 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> area within each plot for active carbon analysis. Each 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> area was divided into four quarters. An approximately 100 g sub-sample was collected from each quarter, sieved through a 2 mm mesh and recombined, from which a representative sample of approximately 100 g was collected for further analysis. Latex gloves were used during the collection of the surface organic material to avoid sample contamination.
