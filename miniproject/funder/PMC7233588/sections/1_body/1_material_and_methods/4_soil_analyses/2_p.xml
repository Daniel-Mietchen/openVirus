<p>The soil clay fraction mineralogy was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. XRD patterns were obtained with an Empyrean theta-theta diffractometer (Malvern-Panalytical, Netherlands) equipped with a copper anode X-ray tube, operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. The measurements were carried out in Bragg-Brentano mode according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phase identification and semi-quantitative analyses were performed using the Highscore software (Malvern-Panalytical, Netherlands). The elemental composition of the &lt;2 mm soil fraction was determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) [

Both XRD and XRF determinations were performed by the Department of Geology at the University of the Free State. Mineralogical analyses were done for the samples from the 0–50 mm layer only, since this is the layer where floodwater
