<p>Soil physical and chemical analyses of all sampled soil layers were completed using standard procedures [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Texture was analyzed by determining the sand, silt, and clay content of the soil in seven fractions. Chemical analyses included organic carbon, total nitrogen (dry oxidation), pH (water and KCl), electrical resistance, soluble and exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC).
