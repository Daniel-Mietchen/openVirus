<p>Active carbon or permanganate oxidizable carbon (C) was analyzed according to Culman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A of sieved air-dried soil sample of 2.5 g was placed into 50 ml tubes, wherein 18 ml of deionized water and 2 ml of 0.02 M KMnO
 <sub>2</sub> solution were added. The tubes were shaken for 2 minutes at 240 rpm on an oscillating shaker and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. A volume of 0.5 ml of the supernatant was immediately transferred to new 50 ml tubes and diluted with 49.5 ml deionized water before measuring the absorbance on a spectrophotometer at 550 nm. The amount of carbon oxidized was then calculated as a function of the quantity of the measured reduced permanganate. The final active carbon was calculated using the equation proposed by Weil et al.
