<p>Discriminant analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] was conducted as follows: For each of the soil properties selected as significant or near significant through the van der Waerden test, the optimal transformation to normality was determined using the Box-Cox method for each of the first three layers as implemented in the SAS procedure “TRANSREG”. Thus, the optimal parameter of the power transformation was determined; thereafter the overall best parameter across the three layers was chosen by inspection (based on likelihood profiles as a function of the power parameter). For each site, the mean of the first three layers for each of the transformed variables was used (except for the mineralogical and microbiological variables since only one layer was assayed). Stepwise selection for discriminant analysis of the above transformed (and averaged) variables was carried out using the SAS procedure “STEPDISC”. Variables were kept in the discriminant analysis based on a 0.1 significance level. Quadratic discriminant analysis was carried out using the variables included in the model using the SAS procedure “DISCRIM.” The misclassification rate of the quadratic discriminant function was estimated using cross-validation.
