<p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and included descriptive statistics, between-group comparisons, Pearson correlation coefficients, and discriminant analysis. For the chemical and physical soil properties, only the top three layers (0–50 mm, A horizon, B/B1/G/C1 horizon) were used in the statistical analyses since the lowest layer was not collected at all sites. For the mineralogical, microbiology, and active carbon analysis, only the one sampled 0–50 mm layer was used in statistical analyses.
