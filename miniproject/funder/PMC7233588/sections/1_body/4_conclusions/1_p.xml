<p>A relatively large body of research exists on the relationships between environmental factors such as soil and water on a number of viruses (such as poliovirus, Coxsackie-virus, and reovirus) that affect human and animal health [

 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, research regarding the link between RVFV and environmental factors, such as soil, is minimal. Intensive research is therefore needed on how various soil elements can affect the microenvironment for the survival of RVFV and its vectors. Through statistical analysis, this study identified eight soil characteristics (CEC, exchangeable Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K
 <sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, soluble Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, As, and Br) to be potential indicators of sites with reported RVF mortalities. Four soil characteristics (exchangeable K
 <sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, and Br) were subsequently selected for inclusion into a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict an RVF outbreak site. This study serves as a basis for broader scientific research on the interaction between soil,

 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. abundance and RVFV prevalence. Understanding the complex connections between the various physical and biotic variables, and vector ecology may mitigate the devastating effects of RVFV on animal and human health, and the local and national economies in regions at risk of these outbreaks.
