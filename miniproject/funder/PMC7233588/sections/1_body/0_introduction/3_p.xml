<p>RVF outbreaks are highly correlated with anomalous high rainfall, and subsequent flooding that allows for dormant 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. eggs to hatch [

Despite an accurate prediction of the 2006â€“2007 RVF outbreak in East Africa, rainfall anomalies and rapid increase in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have, however, not always been able to accurately predict epidemics. This indicates that there are other environmental or host factors that contribute to the temporal pattern of RVF outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only one study was found that developed a RVF risk map, using rainfall and soil water saturation levels at the landscape scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, Hightower et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Sindato et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] suggest that RVF outbreaks were highly associated with Solonetz, Calcisol, Solonchak, and Planosol soil types and with soils with low water permeability. These associations between soil type, soil moisture and epidemics are large-scale observations and do not suggest mechanisms for linking specific ecological factors to RVFV epidemics.
