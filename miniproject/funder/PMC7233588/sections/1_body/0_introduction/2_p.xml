<p>Rift Valley fever virus is a vector-borne zoonosis and certain floodwater 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes are implicated as important vectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is believed that floodwater 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes can transmit the RVFV both horizontally and transovarially [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The transovarial transmission may thus allow the maintenance of RVFV during the long inter-epidemic periods. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes typically lay their eggs singly on the surface of the moist soil substrate, at the edge of the water surface [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in shallow grassland depressions, or in endorheic pans (also called 
 <italic>playas</italic> or 
 <italic>dambos</italic> in East Africa) [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These eggs desiccate and enter a state of dormancy that is broken only when heavy rainfall occurs and the flooded pan triggers hatching of the embryonated eggs [

 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With the appropriate humidity, floodwater mosquito eggs can potentially remain quiescent in wetland soils for up to 12 months or longer [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Understanding the factors that contribute to the survival of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. eggs could therefore improve our ability to predict when and where RVFV outbreaks are likely to occur.
