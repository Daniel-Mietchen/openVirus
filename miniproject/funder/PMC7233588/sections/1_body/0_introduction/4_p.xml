<p>We hypothesize that soil properties, including moisture, are associated with sites where 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquito eggs and RVFV have higher levels of survival, which ultimately manifests as RVF mortality in livestock during outbreaks. To test this hypothesis we compared the soil characteristics of wetlands where RVF livestock mortalities were reported to the soil characteristics of wetlands where no mortalities were reported during the 2009â€“2010 RVF outbreak in the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces of South Africa. By understanding the ecology of RVFV, we thus hope to improve predictive and mitigation measures to reduce the impact of future RVF outbreaks.
