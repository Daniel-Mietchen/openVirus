 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Symptoms in humans are usually mild, although it may lead to death in a small proportion of cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Large outbreaks of RVF tend to be followed by years with very low levels of inter-epidemic transmission of RVFV and few diagnosed cases in people or animals [
