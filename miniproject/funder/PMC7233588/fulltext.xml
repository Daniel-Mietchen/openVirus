Although numerous studies on the impact and outbreak of Rift Valley fever exist, relatively little is known about the role of environmental factors, especially soil, on the aestivation of the virus. This study thus selected 22 sites for study in central South Africa, known to be the recurrent epicenter of widespread Rift Valley fever outbreaks in Southern Africa. Soils were described, sampled and analyzed in detail at each site. Of all the soil variables analyzed for, only eight (cation exchange capacity, exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, As, and Br) were statistically identified to be potential indicators of sites with reported Rift Valley fever mortalities, as reported for the 2009&#x02013;2010 Rift Valley fever outbreak. Four soil characteristics (exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, and Br) were subsequently included in a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict sites that had reported Rift Valley fever-associated mortalities in livestock. This study therefore constitutes an initial attempt to predict sites prone to Rift Valley fever livestock mortality from soil properties and thus serves as a basis for broader research on the interaction between soil, mosquitoes and Rift Valley fever virus. Future research should include other environmental components such as vegetation, climate, and water properties as well as correlating soil properties with floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. abundance and Rift Valley fever virus prevalence.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000774</institution-id><institution>Defense Threat Reduction Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HDTRA1-14-1-0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karesh</surname><given-names>William B.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>WBK, MKR and JTP are thankful to the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Biological Threat Reduction Program for funding.

In livestock, the RVF virus (RVFV) can cause abortion in up to 100% of pregnant animals, as well as hepatic disease [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Livestock are infected with RVFV via the bite of an infected mosquito [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], whereas people are most frequently infected through direct and indirect contact with infected animal tissue, blood, or other bodily fluids [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Symptoms in humans are usually mild, although it may lead to death in a small proportion of cases [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Large outbreaks of RVF tend to be followed by years with very low levels of inter-epidemic transmission of RVFV and few diagnosed cases in people or animals [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Rift Valley fever virus is a vector-borne zoonosis and certain floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. and <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes are implicated as important vectors [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is believed that floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes can transmit the RVFV both horizontally and transovarially [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The transovarial transmission may thus allow the maintenance of RVFV during the long inter-epidemic periods. <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes typically lay their eggs singly on the surface of the moist soil substrate, at the edge of the water surface [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in shallow grassland depressions, or in endorheic pans (also called <italic>playas</italic> or <italic>dambos</italic> in East Africa) [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These eggs desiccate and enter a state of dormancy that is broken only when heavy rainfall occurs and the flooded pan triggers hatching of the embryonated eggs [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. With the appropriate humidity, floodwater mosquito eggs can potentially remain quiescent in wetland soils for up to 12 months or longer [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Understanding the factors that contribute to the survival of the <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. eggs could therefore improve our ability to predict when and where RVFV outbreaks are likely to occur.</p><p>RVF outbreaks are highly correlated with anomalous high rainfall, and subsequent flooding that allows for dormant <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. eggs to hatch [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite an accurate prediction of the 2006&#x02013;2007 RVF outbreak in East Africa, rainfall anomalies and rapid increase in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) have, however, not always been able to accurately predict epidemics. This indicates that there are other environmental or host factors that contribute to the temporal pattern of RVF outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Only one study was found that developed a RVF risk map, using rainfall and soil water saturation levels at the landscape scale [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, Hightower et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Sindato et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] suggest that RVF outbreaks were highly associated with Solonetz, Calcisol, Solonchak, and Planosol soil types and with soils with low water permeability. These associations between soil type, soil moisture and epidemics are large-scale observations and do not suggest mechanisms for linking specific ecological factors to RVFV epidemics.</p><p>We hypothesize that soil properties, including moisture, are associated with sites where <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquito eggs and RVFV have higher levels of survival, which ultimately manifests as RVF mortality in livestock during outbreaks. To test this hypothesis we compared the soil characteristics of wetlands where RVF livestock mortalities were reported to the soil characteristics of wetlands where no mortalities were reported during the 2009&#x02013;2010 RVF outbreak in the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces of South Africa.

Soil samples were collected from the permanent wet zone of the wetland [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with plot sizes varying (approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>) according to wetland type, location and physical access to sites. These plots were also investigated for vegetation [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], mosquito and weather-related factors, as part of a larger study. Composite soil samples, consisting of sub-samples from six auger holes within each plot were collected. The six sub-samples were mixed thoroughly, and a representative sample of approximately 1 kg was taken for further analysis. Soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0&#x02013;50 mm) and from each dominant soil layer, also termed the master horizon [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], yielding 3 to 4 sampled layers per site. A detailed soil profile description [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and soil profile classification, using IUSS Working Group WRB [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], was done at each plot.</p><p>A surface organic material (dead vegetation) sample was also collected from a 1 m<sup>2</sup> area within each plot for active carbon analysis. Each 1 m<sup>2</sup> area was divided into four quarters. An approximately 100 g sub-sample was collected from each quarter, sieved through a 2 mm mesh and recombined, from which a representative sample of approximately 100 g was collected for further analysis. Latex gloves were used during the collection of the surface organic material to avoid sample contamination.</p><p>Soil and surface organic material samples were analyzed from June 2015 to January 2016 at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Soil analyses</title><p>Soil physical and chemical analyses of all sampled soil layers were completed using standard procedures [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Texture was analyzed by determining the sand, silt, and clay content of the soil in seven fractions. Chemical analyses included organic carbon, total nitrogen (dry oxidation), pH (water and KCl), electrical resistance, soluble and exchangeable cations, and cation exchange capacity (CEC).</p><p>The soil clay fraction mineralogy was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. XRD patterns were obtained with an Empyrean theta-theta diffractometer (Malvern-Panalytical, Netherlands) equipped with a copper anode X-ray tube, operating at 45 kV and 40 mA. The measurements were carried out in Bragg-Brentano mode according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Phase identification and semi-quantitative analyses were performed using the Highscore software (Malvern-Panalytical, Netherlands). The elemental composition of the &#x0003c;2 mm soil fraction was determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An Axios XRF spectrometer (Malvern-Panalytical, Netherlands) with a 4 kW anode and a 1 W cathode was used. Both XRD and XRF determinations were performed by the Department of Geology at the University of the Free State. Mineralogical analyses were done for the samples from the 0&#x02013;50 mm layer only, since this is the layer where floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes would lay their eggs [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Total microbial activity (active fungi, bacteria, and protists present) of the surface organic material samples were analyzed at each site [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Before analysis, 2 g samples were prepared and stored in 50 ml centrifuge tubes in a refrigerator (at 4&#x000b0;C). Fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was performed using methods outlined by Adam and Duncan [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], as modified by Zabaloy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The 2 g soil sample was mixed with a 200 ml, 60 mM sodium phosphate buffer, at a pH of 7.6, in a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube. Then 0.2 ml of the 2 mg/ml FDA stock solution was added [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The FDA stock solution was prepared by adding 200 mg FDA to 100 ml acetone and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until it was used to determine the microbial activity. The 50 ml tubes containing the samples were incubated for 20 minutes at 28&#x000b0;C in a Labcon growth chamber (Air &#x00026; Vacuum Technologies, South Africa). During the incubation period, the tubes were shaken manually three times. After the incubation period, the tubes were placed on a Multi Reax shaker (Heidolph, Germany) at 300 rpm for 10 minutes at room temperature. To end the hydrolysis reaction, 15 ml of a 2:1 chloroform methanol solution was added. Approximately 1.5 ml of the supernatant was then placed in an Eppendorf tube (Hamburg, Germany) and centrifuged at 200 rpm for 3 minutes. An aliquot was subsequently placed in a microtiter plate and absorbance measurements were taken at 490 nm. For each sample, two controls were also prepared. The first control consisted of 2 g of sample and the phosphate buffer, without any FDA stock solution added. The second control contained the phosphate buffer and FDA stock solution without any sample.</p><p>Active carbon or permanganate oxidizable carbon (C) was analyzed according to Culman et al.

A of sieved air-dried soil sample of 2.5 g was placed into 50 ml tubes, wherein 18 ml of deionized water and 2 ml of 0.02 M KMnO<sub>2</sub> solution were added. The tubes were shaken for 2 minutes at 240 rpm on an oscillating shaker and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 rpm. A volume of 0.5 ml of the supernatant was immediately transferred to new 50 ml tubes and diluted with 49.5 ml deionized water before measuring the absorbance on a spectrophotometer at 550 nm. The amount of carbon oxidized was then calculated as a function of the quantity of the measured reduced permanganate. The final active carbon was calculated using the equation proposed by Weil et al.

Thus, the optimal parameter of the power transformation was determined; thereafter the overall best parameter across the three layers was chosen by inspection (based on likelihood profiles as a function of the power parameter). For each site, the mean of the first three layers for each of the transformed variables was used (except for the mineralogical and microbiological variables since only one layer was assayed). Stepwise selection for discriminant analysis of the above transformed (and averaged) variables was carried out using the SAS procedure &#x0201c;STEPDISC&#x0201d;. Variables were kept in the discriminant analysis based on a 0.1 significance level. Quadratic discriminant analysis was carried out using the variables included in the model using the SAS procedure &#x0201c;DISCRIM.&#x0201d; The misclassification rate of the quadratic discriminant function was estimated using cross-validation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Between-group comparisons</title><p>The mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for each measured variable were calculated by layer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232481.s001">S1 Table</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232481.s002">S2 Table</xref>) and group of sites (RVF mortalities reported versus not reported; <xref rid="pone.0232481.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0232481.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

A recent study by Brand <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conducted a visual field assessment of soil type and found that high clay-content soils was a common factor in areas of high RVF mortality in the Free State and Northern Cape of South Africa. While clay was not found to be a significant factor in our study, a lower medium sand content may indicate there is higher water retention. Sindato et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] recently determined that in northern and central-eastern Tanzania, soil type (impermeable soils) and rainfall in the wettest quarter of the year accounted for nearly two-thirds of the variation in habitat suitability for RVF occurrence. Impermeable soils, which are characterized by high clay content and loamy texture, do not allow water to easily filter through. This supports long periods of water retention, which contributes to flooding and wetness and thus provides a habitat suitable for the breeding, survival, and hatching of RVFV infected <italic>Aedes spp</italic>. mosquito eggs [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In contrast, permeable soils are characterized by sandy textures that do not result in as much flooding.</p><p>Although only exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, and Br were used in the final model, the correlation between CEC on the one hand, and exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the other hand, was relatively high (<xref rid="pone.0232481.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and therefore these latter variables were not considered to be independent predictors of whether or not RVF mortalities had been reported. CEC represents the total amount of exchangeable cations that the soil can adsorb, and thus CEC and the basic cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>) frequently have a close relationship, with a higher CEC in the soil correlating to a higher basic cation concentration [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, CEC is also dependent on the clay content, clay type, organic matter content, and pH of the soil [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, a higher CEC (and in parallel, higher amounts of exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, and exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>) likely represents a more clayey, alkaline soil. The higher CEC and exchangeable cations in sites with observed RVF relates somewhat to the findings of Hightower et al. [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], that RFV is accociated with Solonetz, Calcisol, Solonchak, and Planosol soil types. Although not stated in their paper, these soils are normally associated with more clayey, alkaline environments.</p><p>The properties of soil influence the flooding and drainage of a wetland, and, potentially, the capacity for <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito eggs to survive and remain vital in the soil until heavy rainfall occurs [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. By identifying sites of past RVF outbreaks in South Africa, this study was able to retrospectively identify possible links between soil chemistry and mineralogy, microbiology, and RVF mortalities. Wetland soil characteristics could thus be used to improve predictive ecological models for identifying areas that are likely to be conducive to mosquito vector breeding and survival, and subsequent RVF outbreaks. Water content, pH, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen content, and lithology also merits investigation to enhance understanding of the requirements for vector production, in addition to the factors highlighted here. Common factors that have been related to areas of high RVF mortality in South Africa include the presence of low-salinity, freshwater and wetland vegetation composed mainly of sedges, <italic>Juncus</italic> and grasses [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>By including other environmental components drawn from soil, geology, hydrology, vegetation and climate, a more accurate conclusion could possibly be drawn about the areas of southern Africa at greatest risk for future outbreaks of RVF. Predictive ecological/epidemiological models, based on these linkages are vital to provide insight on how best to mitigate and control future RVF outbreaks. In addition, future national soil surveys should include characterization of soil properties such as those highlighted here to serve as a reference for areas of potential RVF activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A relatively large body of research exists on the relationships between environmental factors such as soil and water on a number of viruses (such as poliovirus, Coxsackie-virus, and reovirus) that affect human and animal health [<xref rid="pone.0232481.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0232481.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, research regarding the link between RVFV and environmental factors, such as soil, is minimal. Intensive research is therefore needed on how various soil elements can affect the microenvironment for the survival of RVFV and its vectors. Through statistical analysis, this study identified eight soil characteristics (CEC, exchangeable Ca<sup>2+</sup>, exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, soluble Ca<sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, As, and Br) to be potential indicators of sites with reported RVF mortalities. Four soil characteristics (exchangeable K<sup>+</sup>, exchangeable Mg<sup>2+</sup>, medium sand, and Br) were subsequently selected for inclusion into a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict an RVF outbreak site. This study serves as a basis for broader scientific research on the interaction between soil, <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes and RVFV. Future work should focus on including other environmental components such as lithology, vegetation, climate, and water properties as well as correlating these soil properties with floodwater <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. abundance and RVFV prevalence. Understanding the complex connections between the various physical and biotic variables, and vector ecology may mitigate the devastating effects of RVFV on animal and human health, and the local and national economies in regions at risk of these outbreaks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232481.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Descriptive statistics of the physical and chemical properties by soil layer(where the &#x0201c;Reported&#x0201d; group consists of sites where RVF mortalities have been reported and &#x0201c;Not Reported&#x0201d; consists of sites where RVF mortalities have not been reported).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232481.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232481.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Descriptive statistics of the soil microbiology and mineralogical analyses (where the &#x0201c;Reported&#x0201d; group are sites where RVF mortalities have been reported and the &#x0201c;Not Reported&#x0201d; group are sites where RVF mortalities have not been reported).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232481.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The project depicted is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

I have mentioned to the editor that I do not have the appropriate expertise to comment on your selection of techniques for soil analysis.</p><p>I have recommended the manuscript undergo minor revisions which I have outlined below</p><p>Minor revisions</p><p>Abstract</p><p>1. CEC should be written in full in the first instance</p><p>2. I am not familiar with the standard nomenclature but should the cations also be written in full at the first mention</p><p>3. The elements should be written in full in the first instance</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Line 29 There is some repetition in this sentence which could be amended by deleting &#x0201c;and caused a widespread outbreak&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 68 &#x0201c;for and area&#x0201d; should be &#x0201c;for an area&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 75-79 This paragraph does not read well.

But it is mentioned in the results (line 250) and the discussion (line 282) as a significant variable. There seems to be discrepancy between the results, the discussion and the conclusion and the abstract about which variables are significantly associated with RVF mortalities. The conflicting variables are Ca2+, Mg2+ and Br.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In the manuscript by Verster et al, the authors attempt to correlate variables found in soil to areas associated with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). As this virus is associated with increased rainfall, and is a well-known zoonotic agent transmitted by mosquitos, an attempt to associate factors such as soil minerality, as well as factors associated with soil moisture were measured. This involved comparing sites where RVFV have been known to exist, and comparing them to sites where RVFV has not been known to exist.</p><p>Interestingly, the conclusions that the authors propose seem to be at odds with other publications, where soil conditions of RVFV+ regions are considerably different than the ones proposed as ideal in this publication. This makes the reviewer somewhat skeptical of the practical findings of this publications.</p><p>While the reviewer is not terribly convinced of the overall findings of the paper, the methods used appear to be sound ; and thus, this paper should probably be accepted. However, one wonders whether this simply isn&#x02019;t a case of &#x000ab; statistical artistry &#x000bb;--in other words, a case of presenting data in a manner that would make things more significant than they actually are.</p><p>Nevertheless, this paper should be considered for publication, assuming that the following concerns are addressed :</p><p>Minor concerns :</p><p>1) Don&#x02019;t call it &#x000ab; the Rift Valley fever virus &#x000bb;&#x02026;.it&#x02019;s just &#x000ab; Rift Valley fever virus &#x000bb;</p><p>2) Page 3, line 68&#x02014;&#x000ab; &#x02026;.for an area to be&#x02026;.. &#x000bb;</p><p>3) Page 4, line 76-77---please remove that sentence, as it makes no sense.</p><p>4) Page 7, line 119-120&#x02014;&#x000ab;&#x02026;and classification was done IUSS Working Group WRB &#x000bb;--what does that mean ?</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Please accept herewith our revised submission (PONE-D-19-27989). The manuscript has been edited, taking the reviewer&#x02019;s comments into account. We thank the reviewers for the positive and constructive suggestions that were made to improve the manuscript. We therefore believe that the current revision is of much better quality than the original. We have addressed most of the reviewer&#x02019;s comments. Please find our detail comments below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. Was done</p><p>2. We are of the opinion that element abbreviations are standard nomenclature end therefore do not need elucidation. However, we will abide by the editor&#x02019;s decision in this regard.</p><p>3. We are of the opinion that element abbreviations are standard nomenclature end therefore do not need elucidation.

Soil sampling: The term &#x0201c;master horizon&#x0201d; is common knowledge for anyone working with soil, and it is referenced. We therefore did not change anything. The other reviewer also did not comment on this.</p><p>10. Line 133: We are of the opinion that element abbreviations are standard nomenclature end therefore do not need elucidation.

Line 250: These sentences were edited to improve clarity.</p><p>17. Discussion: According to us the distinction is quite clear. There were eight variables (CEC, exchangeable Ca2+, exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, soluble Ca2+, medium sand, As, and Br) that differed significantly between the with and without RVFV. From these eight variable only four (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were used in the discriminant function, since the inclusion of the other four would be superfluous. Also, the other reviewer did not comment on this.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Reviewer 2 states: &#x0201c;Interestingly, the conclusions that the authors propose seem to be at odds with other publications, where soil conditions of RVFV+ regions are considerably different than the ones proposed as ideal in this publication.&#x0201d; We have found only two papers (Hightower et al., 2012; Sindato et al., 2016) relating soil properties to RVF. If anything, the findings of these papers support, rather than contradict our findings. We have added some sentences in the manuscript to clarify this.</p><p>1. Was done</p><p>2. Was done</p><p>3.

In particular, they seem to feel bad to see how you disrespectfully responded to their comments. Keep in mind that the referees sacrificed their valuable time to help you improve your research. If you decided to submit a R2 to PLOS ONE, I would like you to do your best to show your gratitude and respect to the reviewers because the same two people will be invited again. Also, below lists a number of issues of mine that should be addressed in your R2:</p><p>(1) The Intro section should be improved. From the beginning to Line 54, you provided sort of textbook knowledge only. Please write a more argumentative introduction, rather than an explanative one. Clearly discuss what knowledge gaps exist, why these gaps are important, what your hypothesis is, etc.</p><p>(2) Line 118 -- It is very easy to follow Reviewer 1 and to provide a very simple description of "each master horizon." Please do so, rather than saying "everybody knows that."</p><p>(3) The section titles "Physical and chemical analysis," "Mineralogical analysis," "Soil microbiology analysis," and "Active carbon analysis" could be combined to a single one, titled, for example "Soil analysis."</p><p>(4) Line 186 -- Explain the van der Waerden analysis.</p><p>(5) Lines 284-285 -- Why don't you present the results of pairwise correlation analysis between soil properties?</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

I have now highlighted this as a major issue which needs to be rectified before publication.</p><p>Major amendment</p><p>There is a discrepancy between the described results and the discussion with different variables being described as being included in the final model. (Line numbers refer to the marked-up version)</p><p>On line 255 of the marked-up version the results clearly state the following &#x0201c;four variables (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were identified by the stepwise variable selection of the discriminant analysis to discriminate between sites with and without reported RVF mortality&#x0201d;. There is a clear list of FOUR variables.</p><p>However, in the discussion line 275 the authors refer to three variables &#x0201c;soluble Ca2+ and exchangeable K+, and medium sand&#x0201d;. The authors are discussing different variables from their results &#x02013; soluble Ca2+ has been added and Br and exchangeable Mg2+ dropped?</p><p>Then again on line 290 they refer to four variables being in the model &#x0201c;Although only soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, Br and medium sand were used in the final model&#x0201d;. Again a different list of variables. Please note that soluble Ca2+ is not described in the results in page 15 as being in the final model.</p><p>In the conclusion line 333-335 the authors again refer to three variables &#x0201c;Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, and medium sand) were subsequently selected for inclusion into a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict an RVF outbreak site&#x0201d;</p><p>In the abstract line 11-12 the authors write &#x0201c;Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca 2+, exchangeable K +, and medium sand) were consequently included in a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict a Rift Valley fever outbreak site&#x0201d;.</p><p>This inconsistency regarding the number of variables and the list of variables included in the final model NEEDS to be rectified before publication.</p><p>Minor amendments</p><p>The authors might colour the sampling sites more clearly in Figure 1</p><p>Line 172 This sentence starts with a digit &#x0201c;2.5g&#x0201d; and should be rewritten</p><p>Line 178 measureing is misspelled</p><p>Line 297 and Line 298 there appears to be issues with the references?</p><p>Reviewer #2: The Reviewer only has two points to make:</p><p>1) The submission has been made to PLoS One---not the Journal of Soil Sciences. Therefore, the authors' assertion that certain terminology "is common knowledge for anyone working with soil" is inappropriate. Comments like these generally don't help your argument; and to be honest, the Reviewer finds it to be quite rude. The authors should appreciate that comments like these may automatically get your manuscript rejected.</p><p>2) Just because the second Reviewer does't repeat a concern that the first Reviewer raises, it doesn't mean that the first Reviewer's concerns are not justified. As the second reviewer, I actually agree with Reviewer #1 on most points (including points 9 and 17); and just for your information, Reviewer # 2 also had to look up the definition of "Master Horizon". This is simply another example of poor conduct on the part of the authors.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.

</p><p>I have included a separate letter in this regard, but also copy it here:</p><p>Editor:</p><p>(1) The Intro section should be improved. From the beginning to Line 54, you provided sort of textbook knowledge only. Please write a more argumentative introduction, rather than an explanative one. Clearly discuss what knowledge gaps exist, why these gaps are important, what your hypothesis is, etc.</p><p>This was done.</p><p>(2) Line 118 -- It is very easy to follow Reviewer 1 and to provide a very simple description of "each master horizon." Please do so, rather than saying "everybody knows that."</p><p>This was done.</p><p>(3) The section titles "Physical and chemical analysis," "Mineralogical analysis," "Soil microbiology analysis," and "Active carbon analysis" could be combined to a single one, titled, for example "Soil analysis."</p><p>This was done.</p><p>(4) Line 186 -- Explain the van der Waerden analysis.</p><p>This was done.</p><p>(5) Lines 284-285 -- Why don't you present the results of pairwise correlation analysis between soil properties?</p><p>This was done. (Table 4)</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>There is a discrepancy between the described results and the discussion with different variables being described as being included in the final model. (Line numbers refer to the marked-up version). On line 255 of the marked-up version the results clearly state the following &#x0201c;four variables (exchangeable K+, exchangeable Mg2+, medium sand, and Br) were identified by the stepwise variable selection of the discriminant analysis to discriminate between sites with and without reported RVF mortality&#x0201d;. There is a clear list of FOUR variables. However, in the discussion line 275 the authors refer to three variables &#x0201c;soluble Ca2+ and exchangeable K+, and medium sand&#x0201d;. The authors are discussing different variables from their results &#x02013; soluble Ca2+ has been added and Br and exchangeable Mg2+ dropped? Then again on line 290 they refer to four variables being in the model &#x0201c;Although only soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, Br and medium sand were used in the final model&#x0201d;. Again a different list of variables. Please note that soluble Ca2+ is not described in the results in page 15 as being in the final model. In the conclusion line 333-335 the authors again refer to three variables &#x0201c;Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, and medium sand) were subsequently selected for inclusion into a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict an RVF outbreak site&#x0201d; In the abstract line 11-12 the authors write &#x0201c;Three soil characteristics (soluble Ca2+, exchangeable K+, and medium sand) were consequently included in a discriminant function that could potentially be used to predict a Rift Valley fever outbreak site&#x0201d;. This inconsistency regarding the number of variables and the list of variables included in the final model NEEDS to be rectified before publication.</p><p>This was corrected.</p><p>Minor amendments</p><p>The authors might colour the sampling sites more clearly in Figure 1</p><p>I have used un-filled triangles to indicate the study sites, because they overlap at the scale of presentation. I therefore did not change the current layout, although I can easily do so if required.</p><p>Line 172 This sentence starts with a digit &#x0201c;2.5g&#x0201d; and should be rewritten</p><p>This was corrected.</p><p>Line 178 measureing is misspelled</p><p>This was corrected.</p><p>Line 297 and Line 298 there appears to be issues with the references?</p><p>This was corrected. I have also checked the other references, since more such issues were found. It seems that the cross references went awry during the editing and by using track changes.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The submission has been made to PLoS One---not the Journal of Soil Sciences. Therefore, the authors' assertion that certain terminology "is common knowledge for anyone working with soil" is inappropriate. Comments like these generally don't help your argument; and to be honest, the Reviewer finds it to be quite rude. The authors should appreciate that comments like these may automatically get your manuscript rejected.</p><p>I hereby offer my sincere, unreserved apology and assure you that no affront was intended.</p><p>2) Just because the second Reviewer does't repeat a concern that the first Reviewer raises, it doesn't mean that the first Reviewer's concerns are not justified. As the second reviewer, I actually agree with Reviewer #1 on most points (including points 9 and 17); and just for your information, Reviewer # 2 also had to look up the definition of "Master Horizon". This is simply another example of poor conduct on the part of the authors.</p><p>We will gladly include any elucidation required, but there is also an assumed common discourse, which in this case obviously did not hold true. Once again, my sincere apologies.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232481.s003"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Responce to Reviewers R2.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232481.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0232481.r005" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0232481.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Daehyun</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Daehyun Kim</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Daehyun Kim</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0232481" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
