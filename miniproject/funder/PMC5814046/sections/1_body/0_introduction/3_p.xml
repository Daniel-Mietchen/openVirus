<p>However, the current infection control strategy of LPM closures may not be the best method of disease management, especially for the fifth epidemic wave, in which the epidemic size increased after LPM closures. Many of the LPMs in urban central regions were shut down, but LPMs in rural regions remained opened and a relatively proportional increase in the number of H7N9-infected towns and H7N9 cases was observed. In 2014, there was a reported case of a re-emergent H7N9 infection in the Zhejiang province despite the closure of most LPMs in the central towns. In this case, the infection was transmitted by an individual who had visited the LPMs in the rural Xinren village [

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the difference in proportional changes between urban and rural infections in the Zhejiang province from 2013 to 2017 by analyzing the exposure histories of cases. The majority of the human infection sources was expected to change from LPMs to rural reservoirs, such as poultry farms and backyards, possibly as a result of limited control measures in rural settings or limited alternative routes for poultry trading.
