<p>Numerous studies have shown that exposure to poultry in live poultry markets (LPMs) is the most common and probable transmission route of H7N9 infections in humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, closing LPMs has been proven to be an effective control measure in the prevention of zoonotic transmissions [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the Zhejiang province, approximately 30% of LPMs in central towns were shut down from April 13 to April 22, 2013, following the advice of the Zhejiang Center for Disease Control (CDC). After the LPM closures, the number of infections dropped substantially, with the number of human infections dropping by 92% in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the second epidemic wave, approximately 71% of LPMs were closed from January 1 to February 15, 2014. Similar significant decreases were observed in other cities, with the mean number of daily infections decreasing by 99% in Shanghai and by 97% in Nanjing [
