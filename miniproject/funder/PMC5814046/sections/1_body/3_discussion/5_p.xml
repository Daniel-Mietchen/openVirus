<p>While prevention measures, such as species segregation, centralized environment disinfection, and annual rest days, are difficult to impose on rural poultry farms and backyards, vaccination of domestic poultry could be a potential alternative that would reduce the susceptibility to and probability of zoonotic transmissions [

Vaccinations would not only save the poultry from culling, it would also prevent income losses of farmers and live poultry workers caused by LPM closures or poultry keeping bans. A recent investigation showed that a newly developed vaccine was able to induce higher immunity to H7N9 strain in chickens [

Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture of China conducted the first H7N9 immunization campaign targeting species, including broiler chickens, egg-laying hens, geese, and ducks, in southern China, which reported more than 300 human cases during the 2016â€“2017 H7N9 outbreak [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Large-scale immunizations for the prevention of avian influenza A/H5N1 infections among poultry have been conducted in China since 2004 [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but vaccination failures were successively reported, probably as a result of antigenic drifts and immune escapes [
