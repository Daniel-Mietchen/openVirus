<p>The results of this study are in accordance with a recent study conducted by He et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], in which an increasing rate in the prevalence of the H7N9 virus was observed in environment samples of rural towns. He at al. found that when compared with the initial epidemic, the proportions of positive samples in the third epidemic increased approximately six-fold in the third wave. With a high correlation between human infections and positive environment samples [
