<p>Based on the findings of the present study, more infection control measures should be implemented in rural areas. Although LPM closures were unable to control the transmission and proliferation of the fifth epidemic in Zhejiang, extending market closures to the provincial level or even banning the presence of poultry around homes could be considered as one of the mitigation measures. Since 2006, the Hong Kong government has banned the keeping of backyard poultry and has achieved a success in minimizing the risk of a local avian influenza outbreak [

Conversely, this mandate would be challenging to implement in rural towns of China because rearing poultry in the backyard is common amongst many households in these regions. With a great demand of live poultry in China, especially during festivals, such as the Chinese New Year, which that traditionally use live chickens for celebrations, even a temporary prohibition of poultry trade would raise economic and social concerns [

Multi-sector collaboration is also recommended to register households having live poultry, as these places should serve as active surveillance points for the H7N9 virus.
