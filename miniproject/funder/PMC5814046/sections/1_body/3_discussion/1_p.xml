<p>In this study, the changes in proportions between urban and rural infections of the human influenza A (H7N9) in the Zhejiang province from 2013 to 2017, spanning a total of five epidemic waves, were analyzed. Through the analysis of case exposure histories, this study found significant increase in the proportions of rural infections over time, even though there were drops in overall incidence. This finding is believed to be the result of insufficient infection control measures in rural areas, for example, a lack of surveillance for poultry rearing in rural towns. This study provides empirical evidence for the relative increases in human H7N9 cases observed in rural regions since the start of the H7N9 epidemics. A previous study indicated that highly pathogenic H7N9 infections that emerged during the fifth epidemic were likely associated with exposures to infected or dead poultry in rural areas [

The increase in proportion of rural infections may also be the result of residents traveling to rural or semi-rural areas to purchase poultry after the closure of urban LPMs, especially during the period of growing integration of urban and rural towns in China [

In addition, this study found significant increases in the proportions of live poultry transactions in LPMs and the processing of poultry in plants in both urban and rural infections over the years. Specifically, numbers of rural cases steadily increased. This finding indicated that direct poultry contact remained a potential source of infection, especially in rural areas. A previous survey in Zhejiang revealed that residents did not decrease or stop eating poultry, even though more than half of them expressed concern about contracting the H7N9 virus [
