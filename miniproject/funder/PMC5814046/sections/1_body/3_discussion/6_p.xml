<p>The present study had several major limitations. The analysis indicated a significant increase in the proportion of rural infections over the years, but the study could not confirm whether or not the relationship resulted from a shift of transmissions from urban areas to rural areas via poultry trade and transportation because of there was a lack of relevant trade network data. Further, patients who did not have any exposure history to poultry were excluded from the analysis because they could have potentially been infected by human-to-human transmission [

Although there is limited evidence on the human-to-human infection pathway and the main transmission route remains associated with LPM exposure, some studies have shown that ferrets can be a mammalian model for H7N9 transmission, spreading the virus via airborne routes and direct-contact with other animals, which suggests the possibility of viral evolution for human-to-human transmission [

 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, as with all cases, the exposure histories of the patients could be subjected to recall bias. Another major limitation of the present study is the under-reporting in surveillance, as most H7N9 cases could be asymptomatic or present mild conditions. With limited health care resources in rural areas, infections may not be successfully identified.
