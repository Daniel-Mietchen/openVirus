<p>The primary endpoint of this study was the proportional trend of rural infections over time, which was analyzed using the Chi-square trend test. Univariate incremental odds ratio (ORR) by time (order of waves) and the ORR adjusted for age and gender were obtained by logistic regressions. In addition, the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the demographics, occupations, and exposure types. The trends of variables by time, such as occupation and exposure history, were also tested using the Chi-square trend test. To assess the changes of the association (between variables and rural infections) by time, logistic regression was used to obtain the

 <italic>P</italic>-values&lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 software.
