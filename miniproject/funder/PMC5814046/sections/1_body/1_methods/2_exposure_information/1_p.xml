<p>Urban infections and rural infections were defined based on the location of where the patient had direct or indirect contact with poultry. According to the official definition [
 <xref rid="pone.0193052.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], an urban location was defined as a settlement with a non-agricultural population, including cities and central towns, that either had a population density &gt;1500 inhabitants per square kilometer or had major municipal government facilities. A rural location was defined as a settlement with an agricultural population dominated by agricultural production. In China, rural areas were commonly regarded as settlements outside urban areas, such as towns and villages on the outskirts of cities. Subjects without clear locations, for example, a patient having contact with chickens in a bus, were excluded from the analysis. The period of a patientâ€™s exposure history was limited to two weeks before illness onset.
