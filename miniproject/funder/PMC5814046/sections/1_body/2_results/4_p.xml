<p>The analysis of the exposure histories of patients indicated that there were significant increases in the proportions of transactions (selling or buying) of live poultry in LPMs in both urban and rural infections. The proportion of urban infections increased each year from 18% in 2013 to 53% in 2016, followed by a dip to 36% in 2017 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). The proportion of rural infections increased from 0% in 2013 to 36% in 2014 and decreased to 30% and 21% in 2015 and 2016, respectively; however, the highest proportion (45%) was reached in 2017 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). The number of cases resulting from exposure to slaughtering or processing poultry increased significantly by year (

Among the rural cases, poultry rearing was one of the major sources of rural infection, maintaining an infection proportion more than 30% infection cases in every year (
