 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0193052.t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographics and epidemiological characteristics of the urban and rural cases. Overall, the median age for both urban and rural infections as between 54- to 65-years-old. The majority of the patients (&gt;80%) were adults aged greater than 35 years, with approximately 50% being over the age of 60. Among the urban infections, the male proportion significantly decreased from 68% (23/34) in W1 to 64% (37/58) in W2, to 44% (8/18) in W3, to 33% (5/15) in W4, and to 52% (13/25) in W5. No statistically significant change in the association between urban and rural infections and occupations was detected. The majority of the rural patients were farmers (&gt;40%), while the majority of the urban patients were homemakers (&gt;30%). In 2014, an increase in the proportion of rural patients who worked in LPMs was observed (
