 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193052.g002">Fig 2</xref>. In the study period from 2013 to 2017 (W1 to W5), 26% (12/46), 38% (36/94), 60% (27/45), 56% (19/34), and 71% (62/87) rural infections were reported in the Zhejiang province, respectively. A statistically significant trend was observed in the number of rural infections from W1 to W5 (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and the incremental ORR over time was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.34 to 1.86), meaning the odds of rural infections increased by approximately 59% each epidemic year. After adjusting for age and gender, the incremental ORR was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.37 to 1.93).
