<p>In this study we characterized an outbreak caused by CHIKV in Boa Vista city, Roraima state, northern Brazil, using a combination of genetic, laboratory-confirmed and -suspected, and digital search data. Our findings show that an ECSA lineage was introduced in Roraima around July 2016, six months before the beginning of the exponential increase in case numbers. Using simple epidemiological models, we show that on average 1 in 17 (95% CI: 14–20) symptomatic CHIKV cases, a fraction of the 110,882 (95% CI: 102,352–127,940) estimated number of infections, sought medical care during the outbreak of CHIK ECSA in Roraima. Incidence of CHIKV notified cases was strongly associated with fluctuation in Google search activity in Roraima. Moreover, this study represent the first effort to generate on-site complete CHIKV genome sequences. Our results deliver a genomic and epidemiological description of the largest outbreak ever reported in north Brazil, revealing the circulation of the ECSA lineage in the Amazon region.</p>
