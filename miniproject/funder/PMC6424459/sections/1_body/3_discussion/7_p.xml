<p>Improving surveillance in the Amazon region may help anticipate transmission of vector-borne diseases and also spillover from wild mammals of zoonotic viruses of particular concern [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Genomic portable sequencing of vector-borne viral infections in the Amazon may is particularly important in the context of early identification of circulation of strains newly (re)-introduced from wildlife. For example, yellow fever strains collected in Roraima seem to be at the source of the 2016–2018 yellow fever virus outbreak in southeast Brazil, which has affected large urban centres in Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro [
