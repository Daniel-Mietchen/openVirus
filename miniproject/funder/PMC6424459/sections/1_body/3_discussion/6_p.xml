<p>The past dengue serotype 4 genotype II outbreak in Brazil ignited in the north of the country, and is inferred to have been introduced from Venezuela to Roraima, before spreading to the northeast and southeast region of Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Our genetic analysis reveals at least four instances of ECSA-Br virus lineage migration in the opposite direction, i.e., from northeastern to northern Brazil. Such a pattern may not be surprising due to the year-round persistence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos in the northeast and the north areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Within-country transmission will be dictated by human mobility, climatic synchrony, and levels of population immunity. Moreover, international spread of the ECSA-Br linage is expected to regions linked to Brazil. Previous analyses of dengue virus serotypes has identified a strong connectivity between north Brazil and Venezuela [
