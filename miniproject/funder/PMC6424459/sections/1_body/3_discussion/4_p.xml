<p>We used genomic data collected over a 3-year period to estimate the genetic history of the CHIKV-ECSA-Br lineage. We estimate that the CHIKV-ECSA-Br lineage arrived in Roraima around July 2016, whilst the first confirmed CHIKV cases in Roraima occurred earlier, in August 2014. That the discovery date anticipates the estimated date of introduction can be explained by initial introduction(s) of the Asian linage (from the north of Brazil or from other south American regions) resulting in only limited onwards transmission, followed by the replacement of the Asian lineages by an epidemiological successful ECSA lineage. Transmission of the Asian genotype during this period is in line with an increase in notified and confirmed cases, as well internet search query data between August 2014 and June 2016. It is also possible that ecological conditions may have dampened the transmission of the Asian genotype between August 2014 (detection of autochthonous transmission of the Asian genotype in the north region of Brazil) and July 2016 (estimated arrival of the ECSA in Roraima). In the future, fine-scaled, high-resolution measures of transmission potential that take into account daily changes in humidity and temperature will help addressing the impact of climatic changes in the arbovirus epidemiology in the Brazilian Amazon. Nationwide molecular and seroprevalence studies combined with epidemiological modelling [
