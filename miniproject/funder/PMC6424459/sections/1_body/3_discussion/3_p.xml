<p>Different CHIKV circulating lineages may have remarkably different public health consequences. Lineage-specific clinical presentations have been recently highlighted by a recent index cluster study which showed that 82% of CHIKV infections caused by the ECSA lineage are symptomatic, in comparison to only 52% of symptomatic infections caused by the Asian genotype [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the faster detection of the ECSA lineage in Brazil could at least in part be a consequence of a higher rate of symptomatic to asymptomatic infections of the ECSA lineage circulating in Brazil. The time lag between the phylogenetic estimate of the date of introduction of a virus lineage and the date of the first confirmed case in a given region, enables us to identify surveillance gaps between the arrival and discovery of a virus in that region [
