<p>We estimate that 39% (95% CI: 36–45%) of Roraima’s population was infected with CHIKV-ECSA-Br during the outbreak in 2017. Our estimates are higher than the 20% seropositive observed in a rural community in Bahia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and slightly lower than the 45.7–57.1% observed in two serosurveys conducted in the same state [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where the ECSA lineage also seems to predominate. The observed differences in terms of the proportion of the population exposed to CHIKV in Roraima compared to previous estimates from the northeast region could result from partial protection resulting from low-level transmission of the CHIKV-Asian genotype during 2014–2016 in the north region. Alternatively, some level of cross-protection could have been conferred by previous exposure to Mayaro virus (MAYV); Mayaro is an antigenically-related alphavirus that may provide some level of cross-reactivity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and is associated with 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], but has also been identified in 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. MAYV has been detected in the north [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and centre-west [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] regions of Brazil. Moderate to high prevalence of MAYV IgM have been found in urban northern areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], which could explain the limited spread of CHIKV in Manaus compared to Roraima. Finally, because CHIKV notified cases will be influenced by the apparent rate of infection associated to the genotype causing an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], future comparisons of epidemiological parameters across different regions from where no genotype data is available should be taken with caution. Given the rapid spread of different CHIKV lineages, novel diagnostic tools may be needed to evaluate the proportion of individuals infected by each genotype.
