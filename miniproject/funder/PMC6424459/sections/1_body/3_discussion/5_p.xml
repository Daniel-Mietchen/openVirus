<p>We estimated high rates of nucleotide substitution for this lineage, which equates to around 8 (95% BCI: 6–11) nucleotide substitutions per year across the virus genome. Such rates are similar to the evolutionary rates estimated for the IOL lineage; these are typical of urban and epidemic transmission cycles in locations with an abundance of suitable hosts and lack of herd immunity [

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitos in the Indian Ocean region were identified in this study. However, it is currently unclear whether we should expect the same mutations to be linked with increased transmission in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. populations both from Brazil and from Southeast Asia. Further, it is possible that CHIKV in Brazil is transmitted mainly by the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> vector that is abundant throughout Brazil [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> from Maranhão [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] and Rio de Janeiro states [
