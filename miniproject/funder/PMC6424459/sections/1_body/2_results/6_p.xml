<p>Next, we used notified case counts to estimate the basic reproductive number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, of the epidemic. R
 <sub>0</sub> is the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual and can be estimated from epidemic growth rates during its early exponential phase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. We find that R
 <sub>0</sub> ≈ 1.66 (95% CI: 1.51–1.83), in line with previous reports from other settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A sensitivity analysis considering different exponential growth phase periods resulted in a lower bound for R
 <sub>0</sub> of around 1.23 (

 </bold>). To gain insights into the possible magnitude of the outbreak and local surveillance capacity we used the equilibrium end state of a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model: 
 <italic>N</italic> = 
 <italic>S</italic> + 
 <italic>I</italic> + 
 <italic>R</italic>, 
 <italic>S</italic> ~ 1/R
 <sub>0</sub>, I ~ 0, with 
 <italic>N</italic> being the total population size of Roraima. Using this simple mathematical approach, we obtain an attack rate (R) of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36–0.45), slightly lower than elsewhere in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This corresponds to an estimated 110,882 (95% CI: 102,352–127,940) infected individuals, and a case detection rate of 5.34% (95% CI: 4.63–5.79). This implies that approximately 1 case was notified for every 19 infections. If we assume 32.7–41.2% of the estimated infections are symptomatic, as previously reported in Bahia and Sergipe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], then we estimate that the local observation success of symptomatic cases was between 12.8–16.1%. However, if we assume that 75–97% of people infected with CHIKV will develop symptomatic infections, as reported for the Indian Ocean lineage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], then the chances of a reported a symptomatic CHIKV case decrease to 5–7% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Case reports suggest that the beginning of the exponential phase of the outbreak was in December 2016 (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007065.s004">S4 Fig</xref>
 </bold>), while genetic data suggests that the outbreak clade emerged around July 2016. However, between August 2014 and June 2016, 612 CHIKV notified cases and 40 confirmed cases were reported by the LACEN-RR. It is therefore likely that prior to Jan 2017, low but non-neglectable transmission of the Asian genotype occurred in Roraima.
