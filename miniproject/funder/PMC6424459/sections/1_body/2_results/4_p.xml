<p>ML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses reveal that the ECSA sequences from Brazil form a single well-supported clade (bootstrap support = 100), hereafter named as ECSA-Br clade; which contains strong temporal signal (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.84) as measured by a regression of genetic divergence against sampling dates (

 </bold>). Thus we estimated the evolutionary time-scale of the ECSA-Br lineage using several well-established molecular clock coalescent methods. Our substitution rate estimates indicate that the ECSA-Br lineage is evolving at 7.15 x 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year (s/s/y; 95% Bayesian credible interval: 5.04–9.55 x 10
 <sup>−4</sup>). This estimated rate is higher than that estimated for endemic lineages, and is similar to the evolutionary rates estimated for the epidemic lineage circulating in the Indian Ocean region (
