<p>Identification of virus genotypes was conducted using phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome datasets (manual classification) and using an online phylogenetic analysis tool (automated classification). Both approaches identified the ECSA genotype as the dominant genotype circulating in both Roraima and Manaus between 2015 and 2017. However, two cases from late 2014 returning from Venezuela to Roraima (AMA294 and AMA295) were classified as Asian genotype, the dominant lineage circulating in Latin America.</p>
