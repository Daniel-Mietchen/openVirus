<p>We selected 15 RT-qPCR+ virus isolates from autochthonous cases in Roraima state (11 from Boa Vista, 1 from Bonfim, and 1 from Iracema municipalities) (

 </bold>) with a cycle threshold (Ct) ≤30 (mean 20.3, range 13.7–27.41). We included two isolates from two infected travellers returning to Roraima in December 2014, and an additional five isolates from Amazonas state (all from Manaus municipality), sampled between July 2015 and March 2017. In less than 48 hours genome sequence data was obtained for all selected isolates and in less than 72 hours preliminary results were shared with local public health officials and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. A mean genome coverage of 86% (20x) per base pair was obtained for the sequenced data; mean coverage increased to 90% when focusing on samples with Ct&lt;26 (
