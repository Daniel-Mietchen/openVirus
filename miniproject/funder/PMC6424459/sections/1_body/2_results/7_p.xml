<p>We investigated the public’s awareness of the chikungunya outbreak by retrospectively monitoring Google searches of the search term “chikungunya” in Roraima state from January 2014 to July 2018 (

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.89; confirmed cases: 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.92,

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007065.g004">Fig 4B and 4F</xref>
 </bold>). It is important to note that web search activity was available weeks or months before the final number of confirmed (and suspected) cases were made publicly available. This fact highlights the potential utility of monitoring disease-related searches during the outbreak. Interestingly, we find some web-search activity in Roraima before June 2016, particularly in September 2014, March 2015 and March 2016 (

 <italic>r</italic> = 0.65; confirmed cases: 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.15), which shows an early peak in November 2014, soon after the estimated age of
