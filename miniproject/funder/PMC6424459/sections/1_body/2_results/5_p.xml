<p>This is consistent with the establishment of the ECSA genotype in Brazil following the introduction of a single strain to the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The two isolates collected in late 2014 in Roraima cluster together and fall as expected within the diversity of other Asian genotype sequences from the Americas. Our phylogenetic reconstruction suggests at least five separate introductions of the Asian genotype strain Brazil (

 </bold>), in contrast to a single introduction of the ECSA genotype followed by onward transmission. Moreover, all 13 ECSA isolates sampled in Roraima (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007065.g003">Fig 3</xref>
 </bold>), indicating separate introductions of the CHIKV-ECSA lineage, some in early 2015 (
 <italic>node B</italic>), possibly from the northeast region of Brazil. Interestingly, according to travel history reports, the first autochthonous transmission of CHIKV in Manaus was linked to an index patient who reported spending holidays in Feira de Santana (Bahia state) in early 2015, during a period when this city was experiencing a large CHIKV outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The date of 
 <italic>node A</italic> was estimated to be around mid-July 2014 (95% BCI: early Julâ€“late Aug 2014), shortly after the arrival of the presumed index case in Feira de Santana, Bahia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This is in line with a single introduction to Bahia (
 <italic>node A</italic>), followed by subsequent waves of transmission across the northeast and southeast regions of Brazil [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our demographic reconstructions indicate that the outbreak in Roraima 2017 probably represents the third epidemic wave spreading across Brazil (
