<p>Until the end of 2016, 83.3% of the cases in Brazil were reported in northeast region of the country [

Roraima is the northernmost state of Brazil, lies in the Amazon basin, borders Venezuela and French Guiana to the north, and Amazonas and Pará states to the south, and its equatorial climate favours year round transmission of mosquito-borne viruses [
