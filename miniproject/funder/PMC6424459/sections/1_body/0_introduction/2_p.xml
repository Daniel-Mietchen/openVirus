<p>Since 2014 and until the end of September 2018, a total of 697,564 CHIKV cases have been notified in Brazil (including 94,672 laboratory-confirmed cases). This is the largest number recorded in any of the 51 countries or territories reporting local CHIKV transmission in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The virus has been circulating in the Americas since 2013 where approximately 260 million people live in areas at-risk of transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the rapid spread of CHIKV in the Americas, including in Brazil, results from several factors, including the establishment and abundance of competent 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. vectors, lack of population immunity, poor housing quality, and increased mobility of vectors and humans between regions reporting current presence of the virus [
