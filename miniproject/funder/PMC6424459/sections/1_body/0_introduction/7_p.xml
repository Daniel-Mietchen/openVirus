<p>Due to its connectivity and potential impact on global epidemiology of vector-borne and zoonotic virus from the Amazon basin, it is important to improve genomic pathogen surveillance in Roraima. By August 2018, the public health laboratory of Boa Vista (capital city of Roraima state) had reported 5,928 CHIKV cases, 3,795 of which were laboratory-confirmed. Here we a use combination of on-site portable virus genome sequencing, and epidemiological analysis of case count and web search data to describe the circulation, genetic diversity, epidemic potential and attack rates of a large CHIKV outbreak in Boa Vista.</p>
