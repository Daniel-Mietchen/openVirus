<p>Chikungunya virus is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded positive polarity RNA alphavirus that is a member of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and is transmitted predominately by the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> vectors, which are widespread in Brazil [

There are four main genotypes: (i) the West African genotype is maintained in an enzootic cycle in Africa, (ii) the Asian genotype, which is endemic in Asia, (iii) the East-Central-South-African genotype, endemic to Africa, and (iv) the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) genotype, an epidemic lineage that emerged from the ECSA genotype around 2004 and swept through the Indian Ocean region causing a series of explosive outbreaks [
