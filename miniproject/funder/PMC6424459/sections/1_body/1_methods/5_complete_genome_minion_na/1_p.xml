<p>Sequencing was attempted on samples with Ct-value ≤30 at Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane, FIOCRUZ Manaus. We used an Oxford Nanopore MinION device with protocol chemistry R9.4, as previously described [

 </bold>. In brief, we employed a protocol with cDNA synthesis using random primers followed by strain-specific multiplex PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA using the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) and random hexamer priming. CHIKV genome amplification by multiplex PCR was attempted using the CHIKAsianECSA primer scheme and 35 cycles of PCR using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) as described in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. PCR products were cleaned up using AmpureXP purification beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and quantified using fluorimetry with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on the Qubit 3.0 instrument (Life Technologies). PCR products for samples yielding sufficient material were barcoded and pooled in an equimolar fashion using the Native Barcoding Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). Sequencing libraries were generated from the barcoded products using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-MAP007/SQK-LSK108 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Libraries were loaded onto a R9/R9.4 flow cell and sequencing data were collected for up to 48hr. Consensus genome sequences were produced by alignment of two-direction reads to a CHIKV virus reference genome (GenBank Accession number: N11602) as previously described in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Positions with≥20× genome coverage were used to produce consensus alleles, while regions with lower coverage, and those in primer-binding regions were masked with N characters. Validation of the sequencing protocol was previously performed in [
