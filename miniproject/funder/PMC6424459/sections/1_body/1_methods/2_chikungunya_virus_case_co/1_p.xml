We follow the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s guidelines and define a notified CHIKV case as a suspected case characterized by (i) acute onset of fever &gt;38.5°C, (ii) severe arthralgia and/or arthritis not explained by other medical conditions, and (iii) residing or having visited epidemic areas within 15 days before onset of symptoms. A laboratory-confirmed case is a suspected case confirmed by laboratory methods such as (i) virus isolation in cell culture, (ii) detection of viral RNA, (iii) detection of virus-specific IgM antibodies in a single serum sample collected in the acute or convalescent stage of infection; or (iv) a four-fold rise of IgG titres in samples collected during the acute phase, in comparison with a sample collected in the convalescent period.
