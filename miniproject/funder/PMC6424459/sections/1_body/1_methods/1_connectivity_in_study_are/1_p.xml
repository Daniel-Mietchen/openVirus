This road also connects Roraima’s capital city, Boa Vista, to the states of Bolivar and Amazonas in Venezuela in the north. Further, the road BR-401 links Boa Vista to Guyana in the east. There are four daily flights connecting Boa Vista with Brasília, capital of Brazil, as well as six weekly flights to Manaus, the capital city of Amazonas state and the biggest city in the north of the country, with connecting daily nonstop flights to all other Brazilian states/regions and international destinations, including important international airport hubs in Panamá City and Miami, USA. There are also less-commonly used seasonal fluvial networks that connect Boa Vista and Manaus via the Amazonas river.
