<p>To estimate time-calibrated phylogenies we used the BEAST v.1.10.1 software package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To infer historical trends in effective population size from the genealogy we used several different coalescent models. Because preliminary analysis indicated oscillations in epidemic size through time (as also expected from national case report data), we used three flexible, non-parametric models: a) the standard Bayesian skyline plot (BSP; 10 groups) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], b) the Bayesian skyride plot [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and c) the Bayesian skygrid model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], with 45 grid points equally spaced between the estimated TMRCA of the CHIKV-ECSA genotype in Brazil and the date of the earliest available isolate, collected in 18 March 2017 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For comparison, we also used a constant population size coalescent model. We tested two molecular clock models: a) the strict molecular clock model, which assumes a single rate across all phylogeny branches, and b) the more flexible uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model with a lognormal rate distribution (UCLN) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Because the marginal posterior distribution of the coefficient of variation of the UCLN model did not exclude zero (most likely due to the small alignment size), we used a strict molecular model in all analyses. For each coalescent model, Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses were run in duplicate for 10 million steps using a ML starting tree, and the GTR+4Î“ codon partition (CP)1+2,3 model [
