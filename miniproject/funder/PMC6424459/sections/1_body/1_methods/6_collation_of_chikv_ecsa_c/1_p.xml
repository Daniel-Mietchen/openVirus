 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Two complete or near-complete CHIKV genome datasets were generated. Dataset 1 included ECSA-PreAm (ECSA sampled outside the Americas) and ECSA-Br (ECSA sequences sampled in the Americas) sequences. This dataset contained 36 complete genomes from the ECSA genotype, including 7 from East and Central Africa (HM045823 from Angola 1962; HM045784 from Central African Republic 1984; HM045812 from Uganda 1982; KY038947 from Central African Republic 1983; HM045793 from Central African Republic 1986; HM045822 from Central African Republic 1978; and KY038946 from Central African Republic 1975). Dataset 1 also included 29 sequences from Brazil, including the new 18 genomes reported here from the ECSA lineage and 3 genomes from the outbreak caused by the ECSA lineage in June 2016 in Macei√≥, Alagoas states, northeast Brazil (
