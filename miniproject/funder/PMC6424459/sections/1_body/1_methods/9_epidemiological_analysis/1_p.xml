<p>The epidemic basic reproductive number (R

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Because (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and (
 <italic>ii</italic>) we observed a relatively small number of cases both in the notified and confirmed time series, we assume cases from June 2014 and December 2016 did not represent autochthonous transmission of CHIVK-ECSA. We assume a mean generation time of 14 days, as previously reported elsewhere for an outbreak caused by an Indian Ocean lineage (IOL), a subclade of the ECSA genotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We report R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates for different values of the generation time (g) parameter, along with corresponding estimates of the epidemic exponential growth rate, per month (r).
