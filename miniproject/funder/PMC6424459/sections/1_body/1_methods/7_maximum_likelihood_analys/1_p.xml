<p>Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses were performed for each dataset using RAxML v8 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We used a GTR nucleotide substitution model with 4 gamma categories (GTR+4Î“). In order to investigate the evolutionary temporal signal in each dataset, we regressed root-to-tip genetic distances against sample collection dates using TempEst [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For both datasets we obtained a strong linear correlation (dataset 1: r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.93; dataset 2: r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.84) suggesting these alignments contain sufficient temporal information to justify a molecular clock approach. However, for dataset 1, the Angola/M2022/1962 strain was positioned substantially above the regression line. Previous investigations have suggested this strain may have been the result of contamination or high passage in cell culture [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], so this sequence was removed from subsequent analyses.
