<p>Residual anonymized clinical diagnostic samples were sent to Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane, FIOCRUZ Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, for molecular diagnostics as part of the ZiBRA-2 project. Total RNA extraction was performed with QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), following manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were first tested using a multiplexed qRT-PCR protocol against CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV1-4), yellow fever virus, Zika virus, Oropouche virus and Mayaro virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007065.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; comparable Ct values were obtained with the two protocols. CHIKV positive samples tested negative for all other arboviruses tested. Samples were selected for sequencing based on Ct-value &lt;30 (to maximize genome coverage of clinical samples by nanopore sequencing [
