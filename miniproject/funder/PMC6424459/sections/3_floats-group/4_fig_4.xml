Dashed grey lines in (a) and (c) represent Google Trends activity for the term “chikungunya” in Roraima and Amazonas, respectively. Panels b and d show the correlation between Google Trends activity and cases notified in Roraima and Amazonas, respectively. Strength of the association was measured using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (in panel b: p-value &lt; 0.001; panel d: p-value = 5.183e-09).</p>
