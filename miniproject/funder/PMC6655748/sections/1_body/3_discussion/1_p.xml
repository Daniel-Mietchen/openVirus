<p>Wintermantel and Wisler [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] demonstrated that hosts infected with different crinivirus species may produce the same symptoms. For example, tomatoes infected with TICV or ToCV are indistinguishable based on visual inspection. These symptoms may also be mistaken for physiological disorders and pesticide toxicity. In some cases, it may simply be a nutrient deficiency or some abiotic stress. Therefore, it is important to use molecular methods to validate symptoms in the field. In addition, criniviruses that are capable of infecting solanaceous hosts have been grouped accordingly and include ToCV, TICV, BPYV, and PYVV [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For these reasons, a multiplex RT-PCR approach was used to detect single or mixed infections of crinivirus species that commonly infect solanaceous hosts. Our results showed that only
