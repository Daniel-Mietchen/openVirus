<p>The small percentage of asymptomatic tomato samples that tested positive for ToCV infections may be the result of early or latent stages of infection. Since tomato samples were collected in the presence of whiteflies it was necessary to test all samples (symptomatic/asymptomatic) to reduce the disparity/bias associated with prevalence studies. Some tomato samples that tested positive for ToCV exhibited symptoms atypical to those caused by ToCV and was later found to be coinfected with an array of other viruses including 
 <italic>Tomato torrado virus</italic> (ToTV), 
 <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic> (PepMV), and 
 <italic>Potato virus Y</italic> (PVY). These viruses were serendipitously identified using next-generation sequence analysis. Coinfecting viruses may have suppressed the rate of ToCV replication and subsequent symptom expression in a phenomenon known as virus synergism.
