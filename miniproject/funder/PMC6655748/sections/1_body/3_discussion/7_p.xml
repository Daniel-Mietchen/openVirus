<p>A further investigation of the molecular characteristics of ToCV from South Africa provided insight into the possibility of genetic recombination and reassortment. Phylogenetic analysis (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g005">5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g006">6</xref>) shows that the RNA-1 segment (ToCR1-186) groups most closely with Spanish isolates, however, the RNA-2 (ToCR2-186) diverges from and shows the highest identity with South Korean isolate JJ which ultimately group with Spanish isolates. Interestingly, the RNA-1 segment of the South Korean isolate JJ clusters within a group of South Korean isolates. Similar trends are observed with South Korean isolate HP (RNA-1 groups with Chinese isolates and RNA-2 groups with South Korean isolates) and Spanish isolate 2.5 (RNA-1 groups independently and RNA-2 clusters within the Spanish group). This also suggests a possible connection between Spanish and some South Korean isolates, specifically JJ. This genetic diversity of the RNA-1 and RNA-2 segments of ToCV isolates throughout the world may have resulted from recombination. However, no conclusive recombinant events were detected following the 
 <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis of these RNA molecules using recombination detection program (RDP 4) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Subsequently, our findings suggest the likelihood of intraspecific reassortment, based on the inconsistencies associated with the position of the RNA-1 and RNA-2 segments of ToCV isolates from phylogenetic analysis (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g005">5</xref> and
