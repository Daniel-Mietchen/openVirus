<p>According to Farina et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], it is well known that the development of plant disease epidemics begins with viruliferous vectors that have acquired viruses from primary sources of inoculum such as weeds and subsequently spread to nearby crop fields. Further development of the epidemic is facilitated by a process known as secondary spread. Macedo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] demonstrated the importance of primary spread in the epidemiology of ToCV on tomato crops, and how the spatial dynamics of the disease can be contained via intervention. Therefore, understanding the role of primary spread is fundamental to the development of effective cultural methods that reduce sources of inoculum. Further studies are required to determine the transmission efficiency of ToCV from infected
