<p>The grouping of the South African ToCV isolate with Spanish isolates (Figs

The establishment of the exotic Mediterranean whitefly biotypes Q (MED) and B (MEAM1) in South Africa may have displaced indigenous species by means of fitness and resistance to broad-spectrum pesticides that indirectly killed off natural enemies [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Apart from the movement of contaminated plant and seed material across countries and farming communities around the world, the spread of ToCV in South Africa is exacerbated by farming practices and pesticide abuse. Smallholder and rural farmers generally lacked resources and knowledge of disease management. Much of their efforts were further hampered by the absence of skilled government extension workers able to bridge the gap between the technical jargon associated with research and farmers.
