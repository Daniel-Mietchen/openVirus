<p>Since epidemics and emerging disease are strongly influenced by the density and diversity of vector populations (especially with viral pathogens such as ToCV that are not mechanically or seed transmissible), a greater understanding of what influences vector dynamics is required. Tzanetakis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] indicate that the management of ToCV is primarily by chemical and cultural methods. Conversely, chemical control is considered somewhat inefficient since whitefly vectors can still transmit viruses before being poisoned with pesticides. Consequently, alternative hosts such as weeds cannot be overlooked as potential sources of virus inoculum. They serve as overwintering hosts that reduce the quality of soils in arable land. Their robust nature and adaptive capacity to survive and reproduce in adverse conditions is an evolutionary trend that indirectly contributes to the epidemiology of vectors such as whiteflies and viruses such as ToCV throughout the world. On the other hand, climate variability directly influences the level of biotic and abiotic stress in agricultural systems. Knowledge of abiotic factors that contribute to pest and disease outbreaks is fundamental to the development of climate models that project the risks associated with epidemics. Pest phenology models may be an effective way to reduce vector populations and pesticide applications when coupled with cultural, chemical, and biological practices. Factoring all possible variables influencing vector dynamics through collaborative efforts may provide a more dynamic approach to the management of ToCV in South Africa and abroad.
