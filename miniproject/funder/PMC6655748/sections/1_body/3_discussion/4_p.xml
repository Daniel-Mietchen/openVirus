<p>A high prevalence of ToCV was identified in the northern, north-western and central parts of South Africa, and to a lesser extent, in the north-east and southeastern regions (

Interestingly, ToCV was not identified in tomato growing regions along the central east coast (KwaZulu Natal Province), further west of the Eastern Cape province (Port Elizabeth) and in the Western Cape province, even though large whitefly populations and symptoms characteristic for crinivirus infections were observed suggesting the likelihood of nutrient deficiencies or physiological disorders. Moreover, only weed samples collected from the northern and south-eastern parts of the country tested positive for ToCV; with a higher prevalence in the north (
