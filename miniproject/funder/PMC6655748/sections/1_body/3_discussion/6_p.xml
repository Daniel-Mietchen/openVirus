<p>ToCV can be vectored by five types of whiteflies with varying levels of efficiency [

 <italic>Trialeurodes abutilonea</italic> and 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (MEAM1, formerly biotype B) are highly effective vectors in comparison to 
 <italic>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</italic> and 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (New World, formerly biotype A) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Navas-Castillo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported the emergence and spread of ToCV by a highly effective 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (MED, formerly biotype Q) in Europe. In this study, mixed whitefly populations belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Bemisia</italic> and 
 <italic>Trialeurodes</italic> were identified in open field and greenhouse-produced tomatoes that tested positive for ToCV infection. 
 <italic>Bemisia</italic> sp. were more predominant throughout the areas surveyed; however, significantly higher populations of 
 <italic>Trialeurodes</italic> sp. were observed in most greenhouses and sampling sites located in the North-West province.
