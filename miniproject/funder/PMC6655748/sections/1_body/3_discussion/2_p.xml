<p>The isolate of ToCV previously reported from South Africa (Nel-186Cr; Accession no. KT989862) on 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>stramonium</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], was predominant among tomato crops and some arable weed species. All subsequent aligned ToCV sequences analyzed in this study matched â‰¥ 99% to Nel-186Cr. The low nucleotide sequence variability among ToCV isolates infecting weeds and tomato crops in South Africa raises concerns about the epidemiology of the virus and suggests that ToCV isolates identified on some weed species are likely to be the same as those infecting nearby tomato crops. Although weed samples belonging to six botanical families were assayed for crinivirus infections, only two weed species i.e. 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>nigrum</italic> and 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>stramonium</italic> belonging to the Solanaceae family tested positive for ToCV. Importantly, these weeds are distributed throughout much of South Africa and may have significantly contributed to the epidemiology of ToCV.
