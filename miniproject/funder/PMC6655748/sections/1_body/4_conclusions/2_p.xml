<p>Insecticide treatment to control vector populations must be used sparingly and rotated with different active ingredients (AIâ€™s) to minimize treadmill effects. The removal of alternative sources of inoculum such as weeds, crop residues, and volunteer plants prior to planting is also recommended to reduce primary spread of ToCV. Parasitic wasps belonging to the species 
 <italic>Encarsia formosa</italic> can be used to effectively control vector populations in greenhouse cultivated tomato crops. Optimizing the use of cultural and biological control measures will ultimately lead to a decrease in pesticide applications and may have positive outcomes on the long-term sustainability of whitefly population control and virus management.
