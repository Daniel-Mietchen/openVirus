<p>PCR positive samples were validated by cloning (using a TA cloning kit [Invitrogen, USA] according to the manufacturers’ guidelines) and sequencing. Five positive amplicons were excised from the agarose gel, purified using a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, USA) and ligated onto a PCR 2.1 cloning vector. The ligation reaction was incubated at 14°C overnight and kept on ice. Two microliters of each ligation reaction were added to TOP10 chemically competent

 <italic>coli</italic> cells and heat shocked at 42°C for 30 s. Successful transformants were selected (from blue/white colony screening) and cultured using LB (Luria-Bertani) broth in a shaking incubator at 37°C overnight. The overnight cultures were concentrated by centrifugation, and the recombinant plasmids were purified using a Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, USA). The insert was confirmed using
