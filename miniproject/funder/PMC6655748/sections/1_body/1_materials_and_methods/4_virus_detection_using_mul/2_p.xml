 <italic>Tomato infectious chlorosis virus</italic> (TICV), 
 <italic>Beet pseudo-yellows virus</italic> (BPYV) and 
 <italic>Potato yellow vein virus</italic> (PYVV) may produce similar or indistinguishable symptoms on tomato crops. To determine the possibility of infection by all known criniviruses, a multiplex system targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) encoded by the ORF-1b gene was used [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PCR was performed in 20 μl volumes using a KAPA2G Fast HotStart ReadyMix PCR kit (KAPA Biosystems, USA) containing 0.75 ng/μl of each primer (
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), 30 ng of cDNA and 10 ul of KAPA master mix. Conditions for PCR were 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 25 s; 52°C for 30 s and 72°C for 25 s following a final elongation of 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, USA).
