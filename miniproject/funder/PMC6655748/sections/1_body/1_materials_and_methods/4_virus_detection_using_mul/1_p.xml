<p>First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using a RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. USA). RNA templates were incubated at 65°C for 5 min and placed on ice prior to the addition of a master mix component as indicated by the manufacturer. A gene-specific Solanaceae reverse primer designed by Wintermantel and Hladky [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was used at a final concentration of 1 ng/μl in each 20 μl RT reaction. Conditions for RT were 42°C for 1 h and 85°C for 10 min (enzyme inactivation).
