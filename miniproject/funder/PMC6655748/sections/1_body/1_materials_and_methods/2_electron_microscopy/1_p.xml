<p>A sterile scalpel was used to make an incision along the midrib of a fresh symptomatic leaf tissue sample. A leaf dip was performed by gently squeezing the exudate onto a droplet of sterile water. A copper formvar-coated grid was subsequently inverted onto the droplet for 5 min and negatively stained with a 3% potassium phosphotungstate solution for 1 min in the absence of light. Following a 20 min drying step, each copper grid was assessed for the presence of virus particles using a JOEL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope.</p>
