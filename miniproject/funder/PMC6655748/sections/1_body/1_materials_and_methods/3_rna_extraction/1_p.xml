<p>RNA was extracted from 20 mg of frozen leaf tissue samples using a Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, USA) according to the manufacturers’ guidelines. Each sample was lysed in a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing plastic beads, and 500 μl of lysis buffer, using a BioSpec Mini-Beadbeater-16 high-energy cell disrupter (USA). The column was subjected to a dry spin in the final step preceding elution, to remove unwanted residual ethanol from the wash buffer. A final elution of ≤ 30 μl was obtained and quantified using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).</p>
