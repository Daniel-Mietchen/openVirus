<p>The use of high-throughput sequencing was a rapid and effective method to generate the full genome sequence of ToCV from South Africa. A total of 127,654 contigs were generated from the de novo metaSPAdes assembly. Only 2,101 contigs were not aligned to the 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> genomes. Of the 2,101 contigs, 68 contigs were similar to known viral sequences. Contigs that matched to ToCV RNA-1 and RNA-2 sequences as per NCBI GenBank, ranged from 98% to 99%. RNA-1 spanned a total of 8610 nt in length comprising four ORFs, a 303 nt untranslated leader sequence at the 5ʹ end, and a 190 nt non-coding region at the 3ʹend (

ORF-1a (5838 nt/1945 aa) located at position 304 to 6141 encodes a 221 kDa multifunctional protein comprising a protease, methyltransferase and helicase domain. The 59 kDa RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by ORF-1b (nucleotides 6212–7657) is likely expressed as a result of a +1 ribosomal frameshift at the end of ORF-1a; a common strategy among members of the Closteroviridae family [

 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] were identified. ORFs 1a and 1b translate proteins involved in virus replication. ORF-2 (7664–8245) encodes a 22 kDa protein (P22) which is a suppressor of gene silencing [

 <xref rid="pone.0220298.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows a detailed comparison of the nucleotide and amino acid similarity profiles of coding and non-coding regions of ToCR1-186 and the fully sequenced RNA-1 segment of nineteen ToCV isolates that have been reported from various locations around the world. Although all values among all isolates were greater than 90% much of the individual ORFs and UTRs of ToCR1-186 shared the highest similarity to the Spanish isolates mentioned above.
