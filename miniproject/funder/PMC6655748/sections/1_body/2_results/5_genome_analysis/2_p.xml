<p>The 8242 nt RNA-2 molecule comprised of a 237 nt 5ʹ leader sequence, nine ORFs and a 214 nt 3ʹ untranslated region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g004">Fig 4</xref>). ORF-1 (nucleotides 238–339) encodes a 4 kDa protein that may function as a transmembrane protein because of the large hydrophobic domain [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The 61.9 kDa heat shock protein 70 homolog (Hsp70h) encoded by ORF-2 at nucleotides 732–2396 is a conserved protein among species of the genus 
 <italic>Crinivirus</italic>, and functions in the cell-to-cell movement, virus assembly and may associate with virion tails. ORF-3 (nucleotides 2406–2609) encodes a putative 8 kDa protein with no known function to date. A 59 kDa protein (P59), thought to associate with virion tails and movement is encoded by ORF-4 located at nucleotide position 2561–4114. The putative 9 kDa (P9) protein encoded by ORF-5 (nucleotides 4096–4332) has no assigned function. A 29 kDa coat protein (CP) encoded by ORF-6 (nucleotides 4332–5105) encapsidates the major part of ToCV virions whilst the 76 kDa minor coat protein (CPm) encoded by ORF-7 (nucleotides 5111–7120) encapsidates the 5ʹ end and is associated with virion tails and possibly cell-to-cell movement [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lozano et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] relate to a study in which the CPm of 
 <italic>Lettuce infectious yellows virus</italic> (LIYV) was linked to vector transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. ORF-8 (nucleotides 7124–7822) encodes a 27 kDa (P27) protein that is conserved among members of the Crinivirus genus, however, the amino acid similarity among species is low [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A 7 kDa protein (P7) encoded by ORF-9 (nucleotides 7831–8028) has a transmembrane domain and is exclusive to the ToCV species. The functional role of this protein is presently not known. Blast analysis of the RNA-2 segment ToCR2-186 (GenBank accession no. KY471130) from South Africa matched 98% with the isolate JJ (KP137101) from South Korea and the Spanish isolates AT80/99-IC (KJ740257), MM8 (KJ200307), 2.5 (KJ200305) and AT80/99 (DQ13614). A higher level of consistency was observed in the non-coding regions of RNA-2 (
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) than in RNA-1 (
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In addition, nucleotide and amino acid similarity profiles among individual ORFs were higher in RNA-2 as compared to RNA-1. Interestingly, the P4 protein encoded by ORF-1 from ToCR2-186 had the lowest amino acid similarity to the South Korean isolate JJ (
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
