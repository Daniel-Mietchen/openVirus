<p>Nucleic acid extracts from a total of 787 tomato samples and 182 weed samples from 15 species belonging to six botanical families (Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Malvaceae, and Solanaceae) were tested for crinivirus infection using multiplex RT-PCR to detect single or mixed infections of crinivirus species (ToCV, TICV, BPYV, and PYVV) that are known to infect solanaceous hosts.
