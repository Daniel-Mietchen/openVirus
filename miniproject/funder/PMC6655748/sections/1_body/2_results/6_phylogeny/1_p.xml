<p>The complete sequence of ToCV from South Africa was elucidated using next-generation sequencing (NGS). A consensus sequence was generated from the low nucleotide variability among ToCV isolates infecting weeds and tomato samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-1 segment showed that the South African ToCV isolate ToCR1-186 (Accession no. KY471129) was closely related to the group of Spanish isolates but did not cluster with any of these isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g005">Fig 5</xref>). These relationships are supported by strong bootstrap values (100%). Interestingly, the RNA-2 segment from South Africa (ToCR2-186; Accession no. KY471130) diverged from the South Korean Isolate JJ (which grouped with Spanish isolates) but did not group with these isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The relationship between Spanish isolates and the Korean isolate JJ is supported by strong bootstrap values, however, their relationship with ToCR2-186 is not supported by a significant bootstrap value.
