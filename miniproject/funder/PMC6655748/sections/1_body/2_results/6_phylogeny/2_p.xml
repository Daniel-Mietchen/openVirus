<p>Similarly, ToCR2-186 did not cluster with any of the isolates and formed a unique clade. The RNA-1 segment of the ToCV isolate JJ groups exclusively with other South Korean isolates (HS, JJ5) and clusters with isolate HS. Inconsistencies in the grouping of the RNA-1 and RNA-2 segments belonging to the same ToCV isolate suggest the possibility of intraspecific genetic acquisition through reassortment and recombination. South Korean isolates displayed the highest level of diversity and seem to show this trend more frequently than others (Figs
