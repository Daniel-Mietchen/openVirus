<p>Symptoms including interveinal leaf chlorosis, chlorotic flecking, and leaf bronzing that are typically associated with crinivirus infections were observed on tomato crops growing in fields and greenhouses located on commercial, smallholder, or subsistence farms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220298.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Although very widely distributed, these symptoms were concentrated in the northern, northwestern and central parts of South Africa where whitefly infestations of tomato crops were observed to be significantly higher. Whiteflies collected from field and tunnel sites across South Africa indicated the presence of

 <italic>Trialeurodes</italic> species from nymph and adult phenotypic analysis. Both whitefly genera are capable of transmitting criniviruses [
