<p>Although multiplex RT-PCR assays were carried out to determine the presence of four crinivirus species (i.e. ToCV, TICV, BPYV, and PYVV) that are known to infect solanaceous hosts (

In addition, NGS analysis of a pooled sample of RNA extractions from various symptomatic bell pepper crops infested with whiteflies confirmed the absence of any whitefly-transmitted viruses, suggesting that pepper-infecting strains of ToCV may not be present in South Africa.
