<p>In Africa, ToCV was identified in Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia located in the northern and Mediterranean parts of the continent. However, very limited information on ToCV is available from African countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, Moodley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported the occurrence of ToCV in South Africa. Against this background, a follow-up study was carried out to investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of criniviruses infecting tomato crops in South Africa. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis of the ToCV genome is described. It is hoped that the information generated from this study can be used to develop effective strategies to reduce the spread of ToCV.
