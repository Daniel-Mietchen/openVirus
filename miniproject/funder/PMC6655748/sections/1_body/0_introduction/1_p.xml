<p>Members of the genus 
 <italic>Crinivirus</italic> belong to the family 
 <italic>Closteroviridae</italic> and typically comprise a single-stranded bi-partite/tri-partite positive-sense RNA genome, approximately 15.6–17.9 kb in size [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The non-enveloped filamentous particles usually have two modal lengths (650–850 and 700–900 nm) and a diameter of 10–13 nm [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Criniviruses are exclusively transmitted by whiteflies belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Bemisia</italic> and 
 <italic>Trialeurodes</italic> in a semi-persistent manner [

 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], first reported a crinivirus infecting greenhouse cultivated cucurbits in California, since then, their emergence in field and greenhouse vegetable crop production has negatively impacted multi-million-dollar agricultural industries throughout the world [
