<p>In recent years, South Africa has experienced increasingly high whitefly populations that overwhelmed much of the countryâ€™s commercial and smallholder tomato farming communities [

 <italic>Bemisia</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Trialeurodes</italic> sp. were primarily identified from basic phenotypic screening [

Most of these symptoms developed in the mid to lower parts of tomato crops, and gradually progressed toward the apex as the plant matured. In addition, the onset of early senescence was observed. Although the fruit remained symptomless and is of marketable standards, many commercial farmers in South Africa reported a significant reduction in their overall yield.
