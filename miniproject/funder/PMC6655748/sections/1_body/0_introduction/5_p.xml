<p>Methods to suppress vector populations are a key management strategy for ToCV control as outlined by Tzanetakis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0220298.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Various agro-ecological areas and microclimates across the globe possess a set of unique environmental parameters that directly or indirectly affect vector population dynamics. Apart from anthropogenic activity and farming practices that directly influence the density and diversity of insect pest populations, climate change variability is an integral element that many farmers and scientists have only recently recognized. In addition, it is almost impossible to control the spread of a virus without a profound understanding of its molecular genetics and factors that influence its virulence and distribution.
