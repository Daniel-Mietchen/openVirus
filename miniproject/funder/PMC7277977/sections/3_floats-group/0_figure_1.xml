  <p>Intervention scenarios.*: The “as-studied” and “MOH implementation” scenarios both assume healthcare staff provides individual counseling with pregnant women living with HIV (PWLHIV) on HIV self-test (HIVST) use and strategies to give tests to their male partners. Regardless of whether males self-test HIV-positive or negative, they are encouraged to link to the clinic for confirmatory testing, counseling, linkage to treatment (if positive), PrEP (if negative), and syphilis testing; all men who attend the clinic receive a travel reimbursement. The “MOH roll-out” scenario assumes provision of group counseling for pregnant women, regardless of HIV status, on how to distribute HIVST kits to their male partners. Male partners are encouraged to link to the clinic only if they self-test positive; men attending the clinic receive confirmatory testing using the dual HIV/Syphilis rapid test, counseling, and linkage to treatment. Men in this scenario are not offered a travel reimbursement. The MOH currently offers toll-free phone counseling for anyone, male or female, interested in using an HIVST kit; therefore, this cost is included in the scenario.</p>
