<p>We explored the relationship between costs of secondary distribution of HIVST kits by pregnant women to increase male partner testing uptake and linkage to care under varying intervention scenarios in Uganda. We found that secondary distribution of HIVST kits in ANC settings can be implemented at reasonable costs. Programmatic costs were highest in the as-studied scenario and decreased when assuming the intervention was implemented by the MOH (scenario 2). Costs were the lowest in the Ministry of Health scenario, which is currently being scaled-up in Uganda. Although the Ministry of Health scenario is the most applicable to the present HIVST distribution strategy in Uganda, we present the costs of more intensive interventions aimed at increasing uptake among HIV-positive pregnant women.</p>
