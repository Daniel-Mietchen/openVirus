<p>Personnel costs make up the majority of program costs in scenarios 1 and 2, which assumed individual HIVST counseling is provided to each pregnant woman. The national rollout of secondary distribution of HIVST kits in Uganda is utilizing group counseling for kit provision, significantly reducing the amount of time health providers spend administering the intervention. However, since PWLHIV may face greater consequences of delivering HIVST kits (e.g., accidental HIV disclosure, relationship dissolution, etc.), individualized counseling and risk-assessment, as provided in the Obumu trial, could increase the proportion of women who successfully deliver kits to their partners and encourage them to link to the clinic for HIV care or prevention. While this strategy is more costly than group counseling, cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to assess if it provides good value for money. Further, individualized counseling and risk assessment may lower risks of adverse events (e.g., intimate partner violence or relationship dissolution). If HIVST distribution is scaled up using group counseling, programs should be monitored for adverse events.</p>
