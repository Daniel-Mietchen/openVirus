<p>In summary, our costing analysis addresses the lack of primary cost data on HIVST distribution strategies which is useful as governments scale-up provision of HIVST kits as part of routine antenatal care. We found that secondary distribution of HIVST kits from pregnant women to their male partners can be implemented at reasonable costs to increase HIV testing coverage among men in Uganda. Our costs are likely generalizable to other countries in SSA with similar HIV epidemics. These results are timely as many countries in SSA, including Uganda, have recently begun rolling out secondary distribution of HIVST kits to pregnant woman in ANC to give to their male partners.</p>
