<p>Our analysis has several limitations. We conducted a micro-costing study within a clinical trial, yet our objective was to estimate programmatic costs of HIVST if implemented in a government setting. However, we conducted detailed time and motion observations and stakeholder interviews to remove research costs and include only costs relevant to programmatic implementation of secondary distribution. Further, the as-studied scenario only included estimated costs of HIVST provision for PWLHIV, since HIV-negative pregnant women were not eligible to enroll in the Obumu trial. However, it is likely that the intervention procedures would be similar for HIV-negative women and therefore the costs would generalize to pregnant women regardless of HIV status. Further, we conducted a micro-costing early in Uganda’s HIVST rollout when most participants were unfamiliar with HIVST, which posed a barrier for widespread uptake and trust in the test’s accuracy. As communities become more sensitized to HIVST, familiarity with the test will increase and counseling time may decrease. Our analysis only accounted for the costs of testing a male in the clinic, and did not account for the costs that are incurred after a man tests positive or negative (e.g., ART initiation and viral load testing if he tests positive, and creatinine testing and PrEP initiation if he tests negative). The as-studied scenario assumed that women only took home one kit despite being offered two; this is because women in the study were living with HIV and most had not yet disclosed their status to their male partner, and bringing two kits home could lead to her unintended disclosure. If women were to accept taking two kits home to test together, the costs would increase by the cost of another kit (USD $3.05). The as-studied scenario assumed that men received one HIV test and one syphilis test, and the MOH scenario assumed men received a dual rapid HIV/syphilis test per the Ugandan MOH guidelines. Despite one combined test costing less ($2 with subsidy) than two separate tests, there are perpetual stockouts and shortages of the dual test and therefore it is not always used. By assuming 100% usage of dual HIV/syphilis tests in the MOH scenario, we may be under-estimating the costs of providing syphilis screening as part of this intervention. Ongoing cost evaluations are needed to provide up-to-date cost evidence as HIVST continues to roll out to health facilities and public markets across the country. </p>
