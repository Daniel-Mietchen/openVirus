<p>Similarly, the provision of a travel reimbursement for men upon linkage to the clinic can increase the proportion of men who attend the clinic after HIVST. Financial costs associated with clinic attendance (e.g., transport and lost wages) have been cited as barriers to menâ€™s clinic linkage [

Providing a financial incentive in the form of a transport reimbursement can offset these costs and motivate men to come to the clinic for confirmatory testing, counseling, and linkage to HIV prevention services (e.g., PrEP) or HIV care. Further, incentives also provide a near term reward for a health behavior. Prior studies have shown the benefits of financial incentives to increase HIV testing [

 <xref rid="B19-diagnostics-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A trial of incentivized mobile testing among men in Malawi found more first time testers and HIV-positive men in the incentivized compared to the non-incentivized mobile testing arm [

Future economic analyses should be conducted after the unblinding of the Obumu trial to assess testing coverage among men compared to the MOH roll-out scenario and determine if the added costs of individual counseling and travel reimbursements cost-effectively improve clinical outcomes.
