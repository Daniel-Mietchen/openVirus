<p>The average cost of secondary distribution of HIVST kits by a PWLHIV, assuming the Obumu intervention was implemented by the MOH, was $9.45 (

The average cost providing facility-based HIV testing for men who link to the clinic after secondary distribution of HIVST was $7.87 and $6.99 per male partner who tests HIV-positive and HIV-negative, respectively. These costs increased to $16.00 and $15.12, respectively, if an $8.13 travel reimbursement was given to men to incentivize clinic linkage for HIV testing. Similar to the as-studied scenario, personnel comprised the largest proportion of the cost (60.6%), followed by HIVST kits (24.0%) (
