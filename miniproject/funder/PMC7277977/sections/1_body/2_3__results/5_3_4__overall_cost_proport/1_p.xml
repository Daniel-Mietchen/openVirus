 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="diagnostics-10-00318-f002">Figure 2</xref> presents the proportional breakdowns of the total cost for each scenario. Because Scenarios 1 and 2 involved individual counseling, personnel comprised the largest proportion of the cost (73.4% and 60.6%, respectively), followed by the cost of HIVST kits. In Scenario 3, group counseling allowed the personnel costs to drop, and therefore HIVST kits comprised the largest proportion of total costs.
