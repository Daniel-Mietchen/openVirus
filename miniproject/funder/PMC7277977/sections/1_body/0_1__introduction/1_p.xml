<p>HIV testing is the critical entry point to accessing lifesaving antiretroviral treatment (ART) and prevention strategies. However, the potential of ART to curb the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is hindered by the gender disparity in HIV testing uptake. Compared to women, men in SSA have lower HIV testing rates and link to ART later in the course of their illness at lower CD4 counts, resulting in poorer clinical outcomes and increased transmission to female partners [
