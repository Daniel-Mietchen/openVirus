<p>High fertility rates in SSA coupled with high antenatal care (ANC) attendance (98.4% in Uganda) result in the majority of women attending clinics for HIV testing in their lifetime; therefore, secondary distribution has the potential to reach a large proportion of the male population [

One study found that 91% of ANC attendees reported successfully distributing HIVST kits to their male partners, which facilitated couples testing and disclosure as well as safer sexual behaviors; however, most of the women included in this study were HIV negative so HIV status disclosure is not a barrier to delivery of HIVST to their partners [
 <xref rid="B9-diagnostics-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In response to studies showing high testing uptake, the WHO issued guidelines recommending scale-up of HIVST distribution, including secondary distribution to pregnant women in order to close the testing gap among men. Several countries in SSA have begun national scale-up of secondary distribution of HIVST as part of routine care in ANC clinics. To our knowledge, the programmatic costs of this strategy have not been evaluated. Estimating the cost of secondary distribution of HIVST in ANCs is useful for budgetary planning for ministries of health, donors, and other stakeholders designing policies to scale-up HIVST. Costs can also be used to form economic evaluations including budget impact and cost-effectiveness analyses. Our research objective was to estimate the incremental cost of incorporating secondary distribution of HIVST into routine care in ANC clinics in Uganda, estimating costs for three scenarios of varying staff and resource intensity. This study is timely as the Uganda Ministry of Health began rolling out this intervention in ANC clinics across the country starting in January 2020.
