<p>Time and motion observations and staff interviews were used to inform productivity assumptions. We estimated the daily average number of pregnant women that could be counseled on distributing HIVST to their male partners and the daily average number of male partners that could be provided confirmatory HIV testing after HIVST distribution (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-diagnostics-10-00318">Supplemental Appendix</xref> for details). We assumed the clinic was operating at full capacity and staff conducted routine standard of care activities if they were not working on the HIVST intervention. Capital costs (e.g., equipment, furniture) and start-up costs (e.g., staff hiring, training) were annualized assuming 5-year useful life and discounted annually at 3% [

Intervention costs were estimated separately for pregnant women and male partners by HIV status and were calculated as the annual intervention costs divided by the number of participants reached per year. Assumptions on patient volume, staff structures, and all costing inputs are described in the
