<p>This scenario reflects the estimated program costs of the Obumu intervention if implemented by the Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH). Similar to the as-studied scenario, we assumed PWLHIV received individual HIVST counseling but we used government health sector salaries for personnel costs instead of research staff salaries. We used government vendor-negotiated costs for clinical supplies instead of study costs, which were obtained from personal communications with policy makers at the Uganda Ministry of Health. To maintain consistency with the Obumu intervention, we assumed men receive a travel reimbursement upon linking to the clinic. </p>
