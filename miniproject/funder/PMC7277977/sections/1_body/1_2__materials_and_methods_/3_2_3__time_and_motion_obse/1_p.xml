<p>We conducted time and motion observations over 4 weeks in August 2019 in the Obumu study clinic to estimate staff time needed to implement the intervention. When a study participant arrived at the clinic research room, a stopwatch was started and the amount of time each activity took was recorded using pen and paper (e.g., screening, informed consent process, HIV test, counseling, HIVST training, and research questionnaires). Time and motion observations were conducted until we reached information saturation, and data were extracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to calculate total and unit costs associated with the intervention. Resources and time spent on research (e.g., administering informed consent and study questionnaires) and routine clinical activities (e.g., ART dispensing, adherence counseling, and viral load testing) were removed from programmatic costs. </p>
