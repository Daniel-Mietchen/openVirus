<p>This scenario reflects the cost of implementing HIVST distribution as conducted in the Obumu intervention, whereby PWLHIV received individual counseling on HIVST use and strategies to encourage their male partners to use the HIVST kit. Individual counseling was provided in Obumu since all pregnant women were living with HIV. Women were given tools to prepare them for disclosing their HIV status if they desired, as well as how to provide some initial counseling to their partner regarding HIVST, and benefits of PrEP and ART depending on his status. A male health care provider calls male partners (with permission from pregnant women) and encourages them to link to the clinic for confirmatory testing regardless of the results of their HIVST. Further, men receive a transport reimbursement for attending the clinic. Personnel costs were calculated using the annual salaries of the research staff delivering the intervention, including a 34% benefits rate. Start-up costs included the development of standard operating procedures and a 3-day offsite training for all staff associated with intervention implementation. Clinical supplies costs included the HIVST kits provided to women, and rapid HIV and syphilis tests for all male partners who come in for a clinic visit (refer to
