<p>We conducted a micro-costing study at the Obumu study clinic to capture the economic costs of implementing secondary distribution of HIVST and male partner testing after clinic linkage. Costs (2019 USD) were collected using a provider perspective from expense reports, staff and expert interviews, and divided into: personnel, transportation, equipment, supplies, buildings and overhead, start-up, and phones/data monitoring. We developed an initial list of main activities through review of the project protocol and discussion with the site team. We conducted semi-structured interviews with study and facility staff to obtain information on resource use and staff time needed for HIVST distribution. Unit costs were estimated separately by HIV status for pregnant women and male partners.</p>
