<p>The present study was nested within an ongoing randomized clinical trial (Obumu) conducted at Kitebi Health Centre III, a public clinic in Kampala, Uganda (
 <uri xlink:href="www.ClinicalTrials.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</uri> NCT03484533). The primary goals of Obumu are to evaluate the impact of secondary distribution of HIVST from HIV-positive pregnant women on 1) male partner’s testing and linkage to ART or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and 2) women’s post-partum ART continuation and viral suppression. Eligibility criteria include HIV-positive pregnant women ≥ 18 years accessing antenatal care at Kitebi Health Centre III, who have a male partner of unknown HIV status, and are at low risk of intimate partner violence. The majority of women enrolled in Obumu had not disclosed their HIV status to their male partners by the time of study enrollment (68.2%). Women (
 <italic>N</italic> = 500) were randomized 2:1 to receiving an HIVST or an invitation letter to their partner for fast-track testing at the antenatal clinic (standard of care). Women in the intervention arm receive individual counseling from a healthcare provider on the use and interpretation of HIVST and strategies to approach their partner to increase his HIVST uptake. All men are encouraged to come to the antenatal clinic for a provider-administered HIV test. Men who test HIV-positive are linked to HIV care and HIV-negative men are offered PrEP. Study recruitment was completed in February 2020, and women and male partners will be followed until 12 months post-delivery.
