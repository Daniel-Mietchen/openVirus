<p>This study has several limitations. First, we only included studies written in English. It is possible that our review missed articles of interest written in other languages. Second, we conducted only a qualitative review due to the variability of the outbreak reports. Third, the quality assessment was conducted on studies of certain design including case-control and cohort study due to applicability of the quality assessment tool. Fourth, the results of this review have limited generalizability due to publication bias, given that either successfully controlled outbreaks or outbreaks with higher attack rates or fatality rates tend to be published.</p>
