<p>Lastly, additional challenges in managing the outbreaks in LTCFs were reported. They included understaffing, insufficient supply of products such as PPE, lack of expertise, and limited application of isolation [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and concern about the adverse effects of isolation and additional precautions may affect the compliance with related practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. For the same reason, some studies in this review used minimal types of isolation like enteric isolation. If single rooms are not available, facilities should consider applying the cohort measure or bed curtains as another method of isolation. In regard to this challenge, a study by Dumyati et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] suggested a shift towards enhanced standard precautions or risk-based application of transmission-based precautions to uphold the quality of life of residents by HCWs. Future research should identify the rationale for the safety and effectiveness of this strategy or other options. Additionally, one qualitative study found that misunderstanding of the key concepts and recommendations of IPC contributed to under-utilization of transmission-based precautions [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Thus, emphasis should be on training and education of HCWs on transmission-based precautions.
