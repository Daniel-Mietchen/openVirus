<p>Secondly, this review found that many LTCF employees were affected by the outbreaks, which is consistent with the finding of the previous review [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it also revealed that work restriction for ill staff was not implemented well during the outbreaks in the LTCFs, which was not reviewed in the prior review [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Gastroenteritis outbreaks in this review had a higher median attack rate among staff than the other outbreaks, but only one study among them reported the application of work exclusion. Moreover, there were some reports that implied transmission attributable to sick employees. These results pointed out the role of presenteeism in LTCFs. Presenteeism among sick employees may have a role in either introducing pathogens or facilitating the transmission of outbreaks. The CDC recommends work restrictions for health care workers infected with or exposed to diseases such as diarrheal diseases, GAS, tuberculosis, and viral respiratory infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The study by Widera et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] suggested that daily screening of all staff members for symptoms during outbreaks on every shift may mitigate the impact of presenteeism. Considering that presenteeism is associated with various factors such as job security and lack of paid sick leave [
