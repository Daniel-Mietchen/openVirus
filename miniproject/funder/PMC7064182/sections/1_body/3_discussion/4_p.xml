<p>This review also explored critical issues on practices that propagated the occurrence and spread of outbreaks. Consequently, failure to adhere to basic infection control practice, including hand hygiene, disinfection, and cleaning, was found to be a practical issue of great importance on the transmission of the outbreaks in LTCFs. Some reports even mentioned that this issue ultimately caused their outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Most studies showed that this problem contributed to their outbreaks by causing cross-contamination between hands, environments, and equipment. First, the hands of HCWs may be the sources of the outbreaks. Frequent close contacts between residents and HCWs in LTCFs increase the risk of widespread outbreaks. Incorrect hand hygiene among HCWs can result in hands remaining contaminated, and this may lead to the transfer of organisms to the environment and to other residents [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Like previous studies that already confirmed poor compliance with hand hygiene among HCWs [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], one of the included studies reported that hand hygiene compliance was less than 30% [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Semmelweis demonstrated the role of hand hygiene in preventing infections transmitted by person-to-person [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Hand hygiene has a significant effect on reducing GI and respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The WHO recommends that hand hygiene should be performed at the following 5 key moments: before and after touching a patient, before clean/aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure risk, and after touching a patient’s surroundings [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Promotion of hand hygiene compliance through multimodal strategies has been proven to reduce healthcare-associated infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Multifaceted interventions such as WHO-5 strategies (including system change, training and education, monitoring and feedback, reminder and communication, and culture of safety) are generally effective in increasing and sustaining hand hygiene compliance at various settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The same evidence has been reported from studies on LTCFs, suggesting improved hand hygiene reduces the infection rate or respiratory outbreaks [
