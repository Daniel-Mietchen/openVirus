<p>The most common outbreaks in LTCFs in this review were respiratory infections followed by GI infections, showing consistency with the findings of a previous study on nursing homes [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Interestingly, there is a difference in the outbreak reports for MDROs compared to the previous review [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This review identified three reports including MRSA, MRPA, and KPC-KP, suggesting the increase of multidrug-resistant organisms, given that the prior review found only two reports of MRSA [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As the prevalence of MDROs is increasing in LTCFs [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], they become a particular concern in these facilities. With drug resistance on the rise, MDRO related outbreaks may occur in LTCFs with growing frequency. It shows that staff and managers of LTCFs need to be aware of the significance of this trend and to prepare a plan.
