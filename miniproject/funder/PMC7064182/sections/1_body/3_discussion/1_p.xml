<p>We updated the understanding of outbreaks in LTCFs with more recently published reports. This review also explored and summarized critical issues facilitating the spread of the outbreaks and the control measures, which have not been addressed in detail in the previous review [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lessons learned from the results of this review would enable better prevention and control of outbreaks in LTCFs in the future. Implications and suggestions for achieving the best response to epidemics by LTCFs, and for future research concerning outbreaks, have been described in this review.
