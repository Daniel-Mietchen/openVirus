<p>The quality of studies was assessed using Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Nonrandomized Study (RoBANS) by two reviewers [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. RoBANS is an evaluation tool for the risk of bias of non-randomized studies, with moderate reliability and acceptable validity and compatible with domains of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Six domains were evaluated including the selection of participants, confounding variables, exposure measurement, blinding for outcome assessment, incomplete outcome, and selective outcome reporting. According to the instruction for evaluation [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the risk of bias for each domain was determined as low risk, unclear risk and high risk. Studies with full-text including case-control analysis, cohort study was involved in the quality assessment. Studies that simply described the results of investigation without comparative analysis were not able to evaluate the domains of the tool. Thus, the quality evaluation was not conducted with this type of study. Any difference was discussed between the two reviewers, and, if necessary, an agreement was reached with the corresponding author. The result of quality assessment was displayed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).
