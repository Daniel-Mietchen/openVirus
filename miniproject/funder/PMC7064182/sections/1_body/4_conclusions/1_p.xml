<p>This update for understanding outbreaks in LTCFs by reviewing recent studies indicates that staff members and residents are still at risk for contagious disease outbreaks including influenza, gastroenteritis, and GAS infection. As for the problem aspects, rather than by new or unexpected issues, violation of basic infection control practices was found to facilitate the occurrence and onward transmission of pathogens. The results of this review suggest that LTCFs need to inspect basic infection control practice and to implement them thoroughly in daily care as priorities. Efforts should be directed to promoting consistent and optimal adherence to the basic practice of infection control among HCWs at all times in LTCFs.</p>
