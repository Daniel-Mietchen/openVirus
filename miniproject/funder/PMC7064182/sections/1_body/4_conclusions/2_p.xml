<p>When an outbreak occurs, non-pharmaceutical control measures should be utilized to interrupt transmission. However, work restriction was infrequently taken compared to other measures. Given the fact that over half of the included studies reported at least one employee ill and their possible role in the spread of pathogens, it is necessary that symptomatic staff members temporarily preclude themselves from working. In addition to work restriction, though, LTCFs with poor resources have faced various challenges in outbreak management. Further discussion and studies are needed to identify the way addressing these challenges.</p>
