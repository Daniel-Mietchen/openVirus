<p>Prophylaxis of hepatitis B vaccine and immuno-globulin were implemented for hepatitis B virus outbreaks in two studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. There is not much generally recommended NPIs for the hepatitis B and C outbreaks; thus, the studies on these outbreaks reported fewer NPIs than those on the other outbreaks. Three of the studies on the hepatitis virus outbreaks tried to find additional cases by serologic screening [
