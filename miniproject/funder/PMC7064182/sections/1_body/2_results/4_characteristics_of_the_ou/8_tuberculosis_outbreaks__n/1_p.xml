 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Responding to the outbreaks, measures for the cases included isolation and transfer to a hospital in one study [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Neither of them mentioned airborne precautions taken such as N95 respirators. Investigations in both reports found that the air exchange rates of the rooms were inadequate. The study by Lai et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] corrected the failure of the environmental infection control by increasing the ventilation rates in the building. Both outbreaks involved cases among workers, but there was no description about the work status of the affected staff after the occurrence.
