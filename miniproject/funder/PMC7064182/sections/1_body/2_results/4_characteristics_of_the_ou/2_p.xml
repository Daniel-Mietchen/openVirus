<p>In total, 37 studies reported 1,332 outbreaks (affecting 1,122 residents and 385 staff members) in 1,182 facilities. There were three prolonged GAS outbreaks of multiple consecutive clusters for over 6 months. The overall attack rates ranged widely from 0.84% to 73.17% in 29 studies. Among the 29 studies, the median of the overall attack rate was 15.73%: 8.27% for bacterial outbreaks and 19.25% for viral outbreaks (
