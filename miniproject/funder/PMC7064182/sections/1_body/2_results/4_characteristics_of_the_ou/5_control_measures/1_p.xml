<p>Strategies to control outbreaks were reported in 30 of the 37 reviewed papers, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. All 30 studies reported that one or more NPIs were applied to control the outbreaks. From a rigorous perspective, only one study on a multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MRPA) outbreak implemented all the measures recommended to control an outbreak by pathogens [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Work restriction of ill workers was less frequently reported compared to other measures. Only five studies reported the creation of outbreak control teams for effective management of the outbreaks [

Most facilities notified public health authorities or institutions about the outbreaks and received advice and assistance to manage the outbreaks. All four studies applying limitation or cessation of group activities were recently published since 2014 [
