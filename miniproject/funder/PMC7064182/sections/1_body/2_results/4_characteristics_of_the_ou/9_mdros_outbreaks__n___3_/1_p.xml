<p>Three outbreaks of MDROs were caused by MRSA, MRPA, or

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All three outbreaks used transmission-based precautions and quarantine measures to prevent the spread of MDROs. In addition, they all provided re-education for the staff to improve infection control practice. Furthermore, two of the reports on MRPA and KPC-KP intensified the cleaning of the environment to interrupt the contamination of the environment. The study by Kanayama et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] demonstrated that the sharing of a device such as a suction device was linked with the MRPA cases; thus, the control measures included stopping the sharing of devices.
