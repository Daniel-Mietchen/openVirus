<p>Most of the reviewed studies pointed out several issues in practice that might have facilitated the occurrence and spread of outbreaks. The most frequently observed problem was suboptimal hand hygiene, followed by personal protective equipment (PPE), and cleaning and disinfection. Investigation for the GAS outbreak in the study by Nanduri et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] revealed that hand hygiene compliance among employees was 14â€“25%. Additionally, poor hand hygiene became a more critical factor that facilitated the transmission of acute gastroenteritis, particularly in LTCFs having close living conditions with frequent close contact between the staff and dependent residents [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Issues related to PPE had been addressed including inappropriate use of glove and improper storage of PPE [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There were reports indicating the potential to cross-contamination by not-changing gloves between residents or by storage of PPE in the room of the index case [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Breaches in disinfection and cleaning of the environment and equipment were associated with many outbreaks, most of them were GAS [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] or hepatitis B and C outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three reports of GAS outbreaks found lapses in wound care practice such as inconsistent cleaning and disinfection [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The outbreaks of MDROs and hepatitis B reported device related issues including sharing of a device and inappropriate use of reusable devices [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hepatitis B and C outbreaks commonly reported that lapses during podiatry care and point-of-care testing procedures (blood glucose test and international normalized ratio monitoring) caused the transmission of bloodborne pathogens among residents [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The lapses included the sharing of contaminated equipment, improper disinfection, and poor hand hygiene adherence.
