<p>The quality of 20 studies was assessed and the results are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0229911.g002">Fig 2</xref>. One study was at high risk for five criteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Six studies were at low risk for all criteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Problems related to recall bias and standardization of self-reported measurement created a high risk of bias for the measurement of the exposure domain in seven studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Lack of consideration for confounders led to a high risk of bias in four studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The problem related to missing data resulted in a high risk of bias for the incomplete outcome domain in five studies [
