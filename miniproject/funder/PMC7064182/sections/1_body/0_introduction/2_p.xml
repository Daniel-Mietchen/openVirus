<p>Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are facing a great need for preparation for infection outbreaks because of an increase in the number of residents with global aging. LTCFs are exposed to the risk of outbreaks owing to several factors. First, older residents in LTCFs are susceptible to infectious diseases because of aging and health conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and are known to be dependent with regard to activities of daily living. Thus, among residents, self-hygiene is observed to be poor. Loss of independence in residents creates unique and frequent contact opportunities between healthcare workers (HCWs) and residents [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Third, the environment in LTCFs offers challenges for IPC, like the sharing of rooms, group living, and difficulty with the isolation of infected persons [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, LTCFs have limited resources and capacities for diagnosis of infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This leads to a delay in the detection of hidden carriers and infection. All these factors contribute to the onset and spread of outbreaks in LTCFs. Outbreaks in LTCFs threaten the life and health of both residents and HCWs, and thus, eliminating the risk of outbreaks is a matter of concern in such facilities. However, LTCFs vary in their individual capacities to respond to outbreaks [

The keys to outbreak control are as follows: identification of the transmission causes and minimization of the spread through early initiation of control measures. Therefore, it is essential to understand the causes of transmission and the applied measures to control outbreaks in LTCFs.
