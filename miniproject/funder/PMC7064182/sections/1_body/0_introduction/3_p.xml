<p>There are several gaps and limitations in previous studies to comprehensively understand outbreaks in LTCFs. First, in many previous researches that addressed outbreaks, the focus was on pathogens, burdens, and adverse outcomes such as mortality [

 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on the perceived importance of control measures, one of the purposes of this review was to explore and analyze in detail the control measures reported in studies. Secondly, pharmaceutical measures may have some limitations on effectiveness against newly emerging infectious diseases or resistant strains [

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as hand hygiene and precautions should be utilized to prevent the transmission of outbreak pathogens, regardless of the evolution of infectious diseases. However, little attention has been paid to NPIs in studies concerning outbreaks in LTCFs [
 <xref rid="pone.0229911.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This review focused on NPIs and ascertains the control measures based on the guideline for prevention and control of influenza outbreaks in LTCFs of the World Health Organization (WHO) [
