<p>To assess whether mosquitoes which fed on ZIKV-infected mice are capable of transmitting ZIKV to naïve mice, we allowed these ZIKV-infected mosquitoes to engorge on naïve mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). No animals fed on by the ZIKV-infected ORL mosquitoes developed viremia or died, consistent with the low or undetectable level of ZIKV in the SG of these mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). ZIKV was detected, in the blood fed on by the PAT strain in 1 of 5 mice (PAT strain, 7 days post blood meal), in HCM strain in 2 of 7 mice (HCM strain, 7 days post blood meal) and 1 of 5 mice (HCM strain, 10 days post blood meal), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), but no mice fed upon by ORL strain mice (0 of 8 mice on day 7 and 0 of 8 on day 10) or by PAT strain at day 10 of mosquito infection (0 of 5 mice). In addition, the mouse on which the most highly infected HCM mosquito (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) fed developed the ZIKV viremia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), and by day 12 this mouse developed severe paralysis and was sacrificed due to ZIKV infection, which was confirmed by a replicating virus present in the brain (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006350.t001">Table 1</xref>). These results show that ZIKV can migrate from infected mice to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, disseminate from the MG to the SG, and then be transferred back to naïve mice when mosquitoes ingest a blood meal. The transmission rate however, appears to be very low and depends on the ability for the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strain to replicate in both the MG and the SG.
