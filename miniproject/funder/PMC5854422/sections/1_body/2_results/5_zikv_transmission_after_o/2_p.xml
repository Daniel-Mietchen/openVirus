<p>A previous study demonstrated that the bacterial microbiome can alter mosquito vector competency [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These strains were all raised in the same environment for at least 3 generations, suggesting that the overall composition of the microbiome should be similar, but there is a chance that the ability for control of bacteria in the MG varies by strain. Therefore, to determine if these mosquitoes harbor significantly different levels of bacteria in their MG, an analysis of the overall 16s bacteria load was performed and no differences were observed (
