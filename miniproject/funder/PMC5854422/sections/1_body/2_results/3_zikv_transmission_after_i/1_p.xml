<p>To determine if intrathoracic ZIKV injected mosquitoes could efficiently transmit virus to mice, we fed these infected mosquitoes on naïve mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Most mice showed ZIKV RNA in the blood after being fed upon by ZIKV-injected mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Although we observed a significant difference at day 3 post feeding, there was no differences at other tested days after feeding. Of note, 67% (4 of 6 mice, ORL strain, 7 days post injection), 86% (6 of 7 mice, ORL strain, 10 days post injection), 57% (4 of 7 mice, PAT strain, 7 days post injection), 71% (5 of 7 mice, PAT strain, 10 days post injection), 25% (2 of 8 mice, HCM strain, 7 days post injection) and 83% (5 of 6 mice, HCM strain, 10 days post injection) of mice demonstrated significant hind-limb paralysis and were sacrificed after being infected by these mosquitoes, with no significant differences by groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). To further support that transmitted ZIKV was the cause of death in these mice, we performed plaque assays and showed replicating virus present in the brain of these mice (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006350.t001">Table 1</xref>). We also examined whether mice that survived virus infection elicited ZIKV-specific antibodies after feeding. We found that most mice with positive ZIKV titers in the serum developed virus-specific antibodies after infected- mosquito feeding, which also supports mosquito-mouse transmission (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006350.s003">S1 Table</xref>). This mode of transmission is very efficient, as all mosquitoes became infected and could transmit virus, and could be useful for future studies, but we also wanted to demonstrate a more natural route of transmission of ZIKV infection from an infected mammalian host to a mosquito vector and back to a naïve mammalian host. We were also curious if the differences we observed in the higher viral replication in the MG of the HCM strain would be apparent in this mouse-mosquito-mouse cycle.
