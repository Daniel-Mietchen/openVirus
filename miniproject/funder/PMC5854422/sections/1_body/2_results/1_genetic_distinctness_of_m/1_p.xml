 <italic>aegypti</italic> colonies using 12 microsatellite markers, as described previously [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) shows a large amount of genetic diversity among all strains. Since it is possible that these genetic differences lead to differences in the capacity for these strains to harbor and transmit ZIKV, we examined three disparate strains in an experimental murine model of mosquito-borne ZIKV infection, a well-studied laboratory strain originally from Florida (Orlando, ORL) and two recently collected strains, one from Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh, HCM) which is shown to be genetically distinct from the ORL strain by PCA analysis and one from Puerto Rico (Patilas, PAT) which can be seen to group between ORL and HCM genetically by PCA analysis (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g001">Fig 1B</xref> lower panel), we are able to demonstrate that the PAT strain is distinct from both the HCM and the ORL strain, but is closer genetically to the ORL strain. The alleles driving the differentiation among these strains are AC1 and CT2, and the allelic frequencies among the three strains further demonstrate the genetic uniqueness of these mosquito colonies (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) shows that these three strains are genetically distinct, but the PAT strain is more similar to the ORL strain than the HCM strain. A second PCA analysis, using only the three tested strains, also demonstrates the genetic distinction among these groups and suggests a closer genetic similarity between the PAT and ORL strains (
