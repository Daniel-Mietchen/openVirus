<p>Intrathoracic injection of virus has been shown to generate virus replication in mosquito models for many viruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and, recently, also for ZIKV. To determine if this was also true for our three strains, we injected 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of ZIKV
 <sup>Mex</sup>, directly into the thorax of ORL, PAT and HCM strains as described in [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). ZIKV replication was detected in SG and MG of all strains of mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), and 100% of injected mosquitoes exhibited viral replication in both SG and MG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In these strains, ZIKV replication was observed in the SG and the MG at 7 and 10 days after inoculation of these mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed significantly higher ZIKV levels in the MG of the HCM strain at day 10 as compared to either the PAT or ORL strain, although this experiment uses an artificial infection technique of intrathoracic injection that may not be reflected upon natural infection by blood feeding. These data demonstrate that all tested mosquito strains can sustain ZIKV replication, and the significantly higher infection in the MG of HCM mosquitoes at day 10 after ZIKV injection suggests an increased ability to replicate in these mosquitoes.
