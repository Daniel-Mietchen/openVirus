<p>To examine whether ZIKV can be transmitted from infected mice to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, we subcutaneously infected AG129 mice with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV. Four days after infection, the ORL, PAT and HCM strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were allowed to ingest a blood meal from the ZIKV-infected mice in which the ZIKV level was 10 
 <sup>5.0±0.3</sup> plaque-forming-units (PFU) equivalents per ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). ZIKV levels were low or undetectable in MG and SG of the ORL strain at 7 and 10 days after feeding, and the results varied in the PAT strain with some mosquitoes exhibiting higher levels of virus and some showing very low levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Higher levels of ZIKV were detected in the MG of the HCM strain as compared to the ORL strain at both time points, and as the PAT strain at day 10 post-feeding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). HCM mosquitoes also showed more virus replication in the SG relative to ORL, while the PAT strain had some mosquitoes that demonstrated virus levels closer to the HCM strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Overall, the infection rates were significantly different among the ORL, PAT and HCM strains, with the PAT strain, interestingly, exhibiting a phenotype that is between the HCM and ORL strains but closer to the ORL strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This intermediate phenotype demonstrated in the PAT strain could be interpreted as the genetic differences among the strains, demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g001">Fig 1A–1D</xref>, is capable of driving a difference in vector competency, although other differences could also play a role.
