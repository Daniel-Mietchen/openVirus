 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is one of the most genetically diverse species of insect ever studied, and has the ability to rapidly adapt to human habitats [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we established an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito model of ZIKV infection of mice. Consistent with recent studies, ZIKV transmits from infected mosquitoes to mice [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This study used AG129 mice for our transmission model, and this model has advantages for analyzing the pathogenesis of ZIKV or the effect of mosquito factors on ZIKV transmission and infectivity. We also demonstrated variability in the susceptibility of three genetically diverse colonies of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the ORL, PAT and HCM strains, to ZIKV infection. As viral replication in SG is important for ZIKV transmission to the vertebrate host, our results suggest that the HCM strain may be more capable than the ORL or PAT strain of transmitting virus. Also, these results were consistent with recent studies that suggest dissemination of ZIKV in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> depends on both virus and mosquito strains [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These observations have implications for the further spread of ZIKV into distinct populations of mosquitoes across the globe. There are multiple mechanisms by which the difference in vector capacity among strains could arise, such as genetic variation in metabolic and/or immune pathways, or entry or replication factors necessary for ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While it is impossible to make any definitive statements on genes that drive differences in vector competency based solely on the location of the microsatellite markers used to analyze genetic variability, we are able to indicate genes that are proximal to the markers driving variability among the groups, particularly AC1 and CT2 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006350.t002">Table 2</xref>). In order to make a more definitive statement on genes involved in vector competency, further experiments crossing the strains and mapping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or targeted gene modification is necessary.
