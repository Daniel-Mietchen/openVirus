<p>After a mosquito ingests an infectious blood meal, several steps are required for viral infection and subsequent transmission back to a mammalian host. Two types of MG and SG barriers are known to prevent infection by other viruses: one barrier prevents or controls virus infection of epithelial cells in the MG or SG, and the other is a MG or SG escape barrier which can block virus from escaping from the MG epithelial cells into the hemolymph or from the SG epithelial cells into the lumen of the SG [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since ZIKV levels were very similar among the three strains during intrathoracic injection but the ORL and PAT strains were lower during oral feeding, it seems that the ORL and PAT strains harbor a MG barrier to infection related to either the ability to replicate ZIKV in the MG or for the virus to escape once it does replicate.
