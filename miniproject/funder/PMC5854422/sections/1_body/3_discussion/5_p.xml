<p>During transmission from mosquitoes to mammalian hosts, SG proteins from the flaviviral vector, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, are known to enhance viral replication and pathogenesis of both dengue and West Nile virus in mammalian hosts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is also clear that the immune response to specific vector proteins in the saliva of mosquitoes can alter the severity of flaviviral disease for individual patients [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> SG components can facilitate greater ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ZIKV mosquito to mouse transmission model established here is crucial for the exploration into this phenomenon for this important human pathogen. Many studies into ZIKV have been performed using needle inoculation of virus into a mouse model [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], an unnatural route of infection that does not recapitulate what occurs in nature. While the data gained from these studies have undoubtedly uncovered interesting mechanisms of ZIKV replication and pathogenesis, the development here of a mouse-to-mosquito-to-mouse transmission model representing a natural route of infection has the potential to reveal aspects of the viral life cycle that have heretofore remained undiscovered. In addition, further investigation into the mechanisms that underlie the differences in vector capacities of these three strains has the potential to elucidate aspects of the life cycle of ZIKV in the
