<p>This barrier appears to be related to the underlying genetic differences among the strains, but it is also possible that the microbiome composition of the mosquito MG contributes to these phenotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The vast majority of the microbiome of the mosquito is acquired from the environment in which it was raised [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and we did not observe a difference in total bacteria burden. This further strengthens our hypothesis that the differences observed in vector competence are directly related to the genetic differences demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006350.g001">Fig 1</xref>, but clearly the observed phenotypic differences could be more complex and the composition of the microbiome, or even the insect-specific viriome have the potential to play a role in these infections.
