<p>ZIKV is thought to spread mainly through the bite of an infected mosquito, similar to other flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The major mosquito vector for ZIKV is 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which most likely originated in Africa and is now endemic in tropical and subtropical locations. While ZIKV has regularly been found to persist in populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in areas where this virus is circulating [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], data related to the experimental transmission of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> with ZIKV in a laboratory setting has been sparse [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A recent publication has shown experimental transmission from mosquito to mouse and back to mosquito [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but, to date, no experimental model of the transmission cycle from infected mammalian host to mosquito and back to mammalian host has been demonstrated. Also, the importance of a robust model for mosquito transmission of ZIKV is highlighted by recent work in a macaque model, showing that mosquito bite infection of animals significantly changes the viral replication dynamics and tissue tropism as compared to needle inoculation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These studies were carried out with a contemporary pandemic strain of ZIKV, but additional work is planned to determine the significance of pre- and post-pandemic viral strains on replication within the mosquito vector. A significant amount of genetic diversity exists within the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], so we hypothesized that the genetic background of individual strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> plays an important role in vector competence for ZIKV. This hypothesis is supported by research showing the dissemination of ZIKV within the mosquito host differs among mosquito strains, from Dominican Republic, Brazil and U.S.A [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in the wild. ZIKV poses a significant public health risk, and exploring the relationship between vector and pathogen is an important factor in determining the risk imposed by individual populations of mosquitoes. It is also vital to explore the role of the vector in ZIKV replication, infectivity, and pathogenesis within the mammalian host. In this study, we demonstrate a transmission cycle between infected mice to mosquitoes and back to mice using three 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> colonies, which were selected based on their genetic distinctness among tested strains, the Orlando (ORL) strain, a common laboratory colony, the Ho Chi Minh (HCM) strain and the Patilas (PAT) strain, both recently established colonies from the field (~14 generations and ~3 generations, respectively), and using mice lacking receptors for interferon α/β/γ (AG129 mice), which are susceptible to low levels of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also show that intrathoracic inoculation with ZIKV results in highly infectious mosquitoes regardless of strain, which will be important for future studies on the effect of mosquitoes in ZIKV infection and represents a natural route of infection for future studies of vaccines and therapeutics.
