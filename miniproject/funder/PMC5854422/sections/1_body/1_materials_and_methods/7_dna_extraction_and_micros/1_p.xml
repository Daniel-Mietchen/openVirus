 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions, with an additional RNAse A (Qiagen) step. Individual mosquitoes were genotyped as described in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The microsatellite loci analyzed were: A1, B2, B3, A9 (tri-nucleotide repeats), and AC2, CT2, AG2, AC4, AC1, AC5, AG1, and AG4 (di-nucleotide repeats) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Polymerase chain reactions were conducted as 10Î¼l reactions using the Type-it Microsatellite PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), 25 nM of each forward primer, 250 nM of each reverse primer, and 500 nM of a fluorescently labeled M13 primer to allow multiplexing [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. PCR products were run for fragment analysis on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Genetic Analyzer with a GS 500 Rox internal size standard (Applied Biosystems) at the DNA Analysis Facility at Science Hill at Yale University. Microsatellite alleles were scored using GeneMapper v4.0 (Applied Biosystems).
