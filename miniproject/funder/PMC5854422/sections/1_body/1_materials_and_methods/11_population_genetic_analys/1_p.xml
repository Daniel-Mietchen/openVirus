<p>Population structure was evaluated via the Bayesian clustering method implemented by the software STRUCTURE v. 2.3 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most likely number of clusters (K) was determined by conducting 20 independent runs from each K = 1 to 4. Each run assumed an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies using a burn-in value of 100,000 iterations followed by 500,000 repetitions. The optimal number of K clusters was determined both following the guidelines of [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the Delta K method from [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with the online version of STRUCTURE HARVESTER v. 0.6.94 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Plots of the most biologically informative number of clusters (K = 2) were generated with the program DISTRUCT v.1.1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant analysis of Principal Components (DAPC; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) were performed on allele frequencies and plotted with the ADEGENET package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in R v. 3.2.2. (R Core Team 2013).
