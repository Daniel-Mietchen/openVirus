<p>For mosquitoes, midguts (MG) and salivary glands (SG) were dissected and placed in individual tubes in RLT buffer with 0.1% ß-mercaptoethanol. RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s instructions. For mice, chloroform was added to blood samples from ZIKV-infected mice. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4°C. Aqueous layers was mixed with 100% ethanol and RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-rad) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expressions was measured using IQ SYBR Green Supermix. ZIKV RNA levels were normalized to mosquito Rp49 RNA levels or mouse
