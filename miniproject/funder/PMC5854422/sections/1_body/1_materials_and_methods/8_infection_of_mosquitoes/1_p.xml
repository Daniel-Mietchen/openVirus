<p>For oral-infection, na√Øve AG129 mice are first infected subcutaneously with 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU of ZIKV
 <sup>MEX</sup>. One day before oral-infection, mosquitoes are collected via vacuum aspiration and placed in paper cups with mesh lids without sucrose. At 4 days post ZIKV injection, infected mice are anesthetized using Ketamine-Xylazine and laid on top of mesh lids to allow mosquitoes to take infectious blood meal. Fed mosquitoes are placed back in paper cups with mesh lids and maintained in triple containment for 7 or 10 days. For ZIKV injection experiments, mosquitoes were knocked-down on ice before transfer to a cold plate under a dissecting microscope. A pulled microcapillary needle was filled with ZIKV using a Nanoject II auto-nanoliter injector (Drummond). ZIKV-filled needle is carefully inserted into the thorax of each mosquito and 69 nl of virus (~1000 PFU) is injected. Injected mosquitoes are placed in paper cups with mesh lids and maintained in triple containment for 7 to 10 days. The infection rate of each strain was calculated by comparing infected vs. uninfected mosquitoes (Infection rate (%) = 100 x [# of infected mosquitoes/# of total mosquitoes]) in each experiment.
