<p>Virus-specific antibodies (IgG) in serum from mice infected with ZIKV were analyzed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Recombinant ZIKV Envelope protein (Mybiosource, MBS140822) (0.1μg/well) were coated to 96 well plates overnight at 4°C. After the plates were blocked with 2% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, the plates were then incubated with serum samples serially diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS-T three times, the plates were incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. After the plates were washed again with PBS-T, 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine solution was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1M H

 <sub>4</sub>. The optical density at 450 nm (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) was measured and analyzed. The cut-off value was calculated as the mean OD
 <sub>450</sub> + 3SD acquired from corresponding samples from three naïve mice.
