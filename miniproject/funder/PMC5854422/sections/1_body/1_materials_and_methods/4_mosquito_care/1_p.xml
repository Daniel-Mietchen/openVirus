<p>Eggs were hatched in a shallow dish with distilled water with 2 parts brewer’s yeast (Bioserv #1710) and 3 parts desiccated liver powder (Bioserv #1320). After pupae emerged, mosquitoes were collected and placed in a small crystal dish with distilled water inside a 12” x 12” x 12” metal mesh cage (BioQuip #1450B). Adult mosquitoes are maintained on 10% sucrose feeders in walk-in incubator at 28
 <sup>o</sup> C and ~80% humidity. Egg masses are generated via blood meal on naïve mice.
