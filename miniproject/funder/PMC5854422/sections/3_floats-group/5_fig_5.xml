  </title>
  <p>HCM, PAT and ORL strains of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> were infected with ZIKV by allowing mosquitoes to ingest a blood meal from mice infected with ZIKV. (A) Experimental workflow for the ZIKV oral infection experiments. (B) Blood was collected every other day for one week from naïve mice fed on by mosquitoes infected with ZIKV for 7 or 10 days, and analyzed for ZIKV infection by qRT-PCR. ZIKV RNA levels were normalized to mouse 
   <italic>β</italic> actin (ACTB) RNA levels. (C) Naïve mice fed on by mosquitoes orally-infected with ZIKV were monitored for survival for at least 30 days after infected mosquitoes-feeding. Data shown are pooled from at least two independent experiments. (n = 8/group for ORL-Day 7; n = 8/group for ORL-Day 10; n = 5/group for PAT-Day 7; n = 5/group for PAT-Day 10; n = 7/group for HCM-Day 7; n = 5/group for HCM-Day 10.) Each data point represents an individual mouse. Significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Tukey test. * P&lt;0.05.
