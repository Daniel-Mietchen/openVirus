  <title>Antibody responses of ZIKV-replicated AG129 mice engorged upon by ZIKV-infected mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>ORL, PAT or HCM strains were infected with ZIKV, either orally or by intrathoracic injection, for seven or ten days before being allowed to take a blood-meal on naïve AG129 mice. After 4–5 weeks after feeding, serum of mice in which ZIKV were detected in blood were collected and antibody responses were analyzed by ELISA.</p>
