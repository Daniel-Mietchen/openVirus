  <title>Intrathoracic injection of the Ho Chi Minh (HCM), Patilas (PAT) and Orlando (ORL) strains of

  </title>
  <p>HCM, PAT and ORL strains of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> were infected by intrathoracic injection with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of ZIKV, and after 7 or 10 days allowed to feed on na√Øve mice. (A) Experimental workflow for the ZIKV injection experiments. (B) QRT-PCR analysis was performed on the salivary gland (SG) and midgut (MG) of ORL, PAT and HCM mosquitoes 7 or 10 days after injection with ZIKV. ZIKV RNA levels were normalized to mosquito 
   <italic>Rp49</italic> RNA levels. (C) Infection rate of each strain infected for 7 and 10 days was calculated by comparing infected vs. uninfected mosquitoes in each experiment. Data shown are pooled from at least two independent experiments. (n = 19/group for ORL-Day 7; n = 18/group for ORL-Day 10; n = 14/group for PAT-Day 7; n = 17/group for PAT-Day 10; n = 18/group for HCM-Day 7; n = 11/group for HCM-Day 10.) Significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA.
