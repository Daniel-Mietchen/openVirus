  <title>No difference of total bacterial burden among Ho Chi Minh (HCM), Patilas (PAT) and Orlando (ORL) strains of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> after intrathoracic injection or oral feeding.
  </title>
  <p>The microbial load in the MG was determined 10 days after intrathoracic injection (A) or oral feeding (B) by qRT-PCR. Total bacterial 16S rRNA levels were normalized to mosquito 
   <italic>Rp49</italic> RNA levels. One dot represents one mosquito gut. The horizontal line represents the median of the results. The results were combined from at least two biologically independent experiments.
