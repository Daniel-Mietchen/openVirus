  <title>Ho Chi Minh (HCM), Patilas (PAT) and Orlando (ORL) strains of 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> are genetically diverse.

  <p>Six strains of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> (Liverpool, Rockefeller, Ho Chi Minh (HCM), Orlando (ORL), Amacuzac (Mexico) and Patillas (Puerto Rico) strains) were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci and population genetic analyses were performed to compare these populations. (A) PCA analysis showing the extent of genetic diversity of various laboratory and field-collected strains of 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic>. The bar plot with eigenvalues shows the amount of variance represented by each principal component, black bars indicate the components illustrated in these PCA. The units of the grid are indicated at the top right corner. (B) Results of the Bayesian clustering analysis with STRUCTURE [
   <xref rid="pntd.0006350.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Shown is the bar plot indicating the genetic groupings of the three strains used for ZIKV infections. Each vertical bar represents an individual. The height of each bar represents the probability of assignment to each of (upper panel) K = 2 clusters or (lower panel) K = 3 clusters. Each cluster is indicated by different colours: HCM: blue, PAT: pink and ORL: red. (C) Frequency of alleles highlighting the differences among 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> laboratory populations from Ho Chi Minh, Orlando Strain, and Patilas, challenged with ZIKV. Two of the 12 microsatellite loci genotyped contributed to the population differentiation observed at a loading threshold of 0.10; AC1 and CT2. More specifically, alleles AC1:209, CT2:184, and CT2:188. Alleles are represented by numbers from 1â€“4 in the graph for simplification; AC1 (1: 195, 2: 197, 3: 209, 4: 201) and CT2 (1: 188, 2: 184, 3: 196). (D) Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) on microsatellite allele frequencies showing two clear genetic clusters with minimal overlap; colours are as in the upper panel of B.
