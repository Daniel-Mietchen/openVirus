<p>We apply the model to the case of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) transmission in Mexico City and show how media influence—measured by the time series of weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak—helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that the observed media coverage of the outbreak differs substantially from what would be predicted by approximate media functions. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage, showing that under typical conditions media has limited effect on the spread of disease.</p>
