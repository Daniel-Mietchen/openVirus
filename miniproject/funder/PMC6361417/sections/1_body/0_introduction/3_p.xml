<p>Here, we introduce a network-based model, in which disease spread is transmitted through local interactions between individuals, and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention to the outbreak increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing, face mask usage, and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease spread. We model media signal as a function of the actual number of articles published about the disease. Therefore, the media signal in our model is independent of the size of the outbreak. The proposed model is an extension of our previous model, ALARM [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which attempted to quantify the level of social reaction to disease, but which did not take the role of media into account in the disease transmission process. The key observation that drove the formulation of the ALARM model was that public reaction to a disease is frequently disproportionate to the number of cases. Some outbreaks with very few cases trigger outsized public alarm—for example, the handful of cases of Ebola in the US—while larger and more deadly outbreaks—such as the annual outbreaks of seasonal influenza—generate little interest. Factors such as the novelty of the disease in the area and its clinical severity play a role in shaping the public reaction. By incorporating actual media data into models of disease transmission, we can begin to account for those factors in the transmission dynamics and evaluate their significance in the disease transmission process.
