<p>In our proposed formulation, media exposure causes individuals to implement protective behaviors, reducing the per-contact transmission probability. Two parameters, 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ, determine how the media signal affects the rate of transmission. Specifically, λ determines the relative importance of recent and prior news coverage in determining individual behavior. As λ increases, the relative weight of recent news articles increases, compared with prior news articles. The parameter 
 <italic>α</italic> controls the degree to which media affects behavior. As 
 <italic>α</italic> increases, media exerts greater influence on behavior, leading to greater reduction in the per contact transmission probability. The effects of λ and 
 <italic>α</italic> on the number of cases and the media function 
 <italic>g</italic> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197646.g001">Fig 1</xref> for an outbreak in a population of size 500,000 with five weeks of constant media coverage beginning five weeks after the beginning of the outbreak. As λ increases, the effect of media becomes more prominent but for a shorter duration. As λ increases, peak height of media function increases (for 
 <italic>α</italic> greater than 0), indicating that the effect of media gets stronger (lower transmission probability). On the other hand, the rate at which the media function value goes back to one (no media effect) from the peak (maximum media effect) also increases as λ increases, suggesting a shorter duration of media effect. This phenomenon is explained by exponentially-weighted moving average function describing λ: smaller λ considers the media coverage from further back in the past, creating the lingering media effect as observed in the long tail of the media function curve for λ = 1. High values of λ can produce two wave outbreaks, if the value of 
 <italic>α</italic> is high enough to dramatically slow transmission but not high enough to altogether stop transmission for long enough for the outbreak to die out. As 
 <italic>α</italic> increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission.
