<p>The proposed model relies on volume of news coverage to estimate the media signal. We have compared the results of modeling disease spread dynamics over time using real data on news coverage as a proxy of media signal versus that utilizing the number of cases and their temporal change and that not using any media signal. We have demonstrated a significantly better model fit when utilizing the proposed media signal.</p>
