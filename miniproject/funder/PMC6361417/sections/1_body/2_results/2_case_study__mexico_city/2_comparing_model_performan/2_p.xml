<p>Since 
 <italic>f</italic> is dependent upon the rate of change and size of the infected population, 
 <italic>f</italic> results in the greatest reduction in transmission during the fall outbreak, instead of the spring outbreak. As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197646.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, 
 <italic>f</italic> overestimates the fall outbreak and underestimates the spring outbreak, resulting in much greater mean absolute error of 3733, three times the MAE obtained using the proposed media function. We have also compared the best-fit curve obtained using the proposed media function, 
 <italic>g</italic>, with the best-fit curve obtained without using a media function to evaluate the effectiveness of the media function. The best-fit parameters were 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 0.289 and 
 <italic>k</italic> = 2. The model without a media function overestimates both the spring and fall outbreaks, resulting in MAE of 1865, fifty percent over the MAE obtained using the proposed media function. During the spring outbreak where significant media coverage was observed, the model overestimates the peak by over twice as much. In order to replicate the dynamics of the two outbreaks of disease without considering additional control measures, consideration of factors affecting behavior other than the number of infected cases or rate of change in the number of infected cases is necessary. We found that use of actual media data fills the void, allowing us to account for the heightened attention to the disease in the spring that led to the extreme social distancing that eventually curtailed the outbreak.
