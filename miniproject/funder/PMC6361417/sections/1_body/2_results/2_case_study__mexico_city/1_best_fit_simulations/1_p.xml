<p>We fit the simulated epidemic curve from our model to the spring and fall outbreaks of H1N1 in Mexico City. An excellent overall fit was achieved, with a weighted mean absolute error of 1243 cases. In particular, the protective action implemented as a result of the media surge during the spring outbreak was sufficient to slow the outbreak. The fall outbreak, in contrast, spread nearly uninhibited, without generating extensive media attention.
