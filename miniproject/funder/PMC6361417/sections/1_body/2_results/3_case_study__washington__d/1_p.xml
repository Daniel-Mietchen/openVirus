<p>We fit our model to the epidemic curve from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC. The resulting fit had a MAE of 2818 cases. Our simulations indicate that media had limited effect on behavior during the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC, due to the small number of news articles published. In the best-fit simulations, the effect of each news article on protective behavior was moderate (
