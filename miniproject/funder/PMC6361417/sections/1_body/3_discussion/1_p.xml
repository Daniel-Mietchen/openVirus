<p>Previous models of infectious disease transmission that incorporate media influence have modeled media as a function of the rate of transmission and the number of cases of a disease, making it dependent upon the size of the outbreak. We have shown that media signal can be successfully modeled using real data on news coverage, and that using actual news coverage data better captures the disease dynamics compared to the estimation using the media function that uses the number of cases and rate of change in the number of cases.</p>
