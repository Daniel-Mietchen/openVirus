<p>Secondly, we provided a real world example that illustrates where models incorporating data on actual media coverage can be most useful. Although there were no significant differences in the per-contact transmission rate of the H1N1 virus or population structure, the spring outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City was quickly contained, while the fall outbreak grew to epidemic proportions. Differences in social distancing help to explain the different dynamics of the two outbreaks. The spring outbreak received extensive attention in the Mexican press. By incorporating data on the volume of media coverage of the outbreak and by assuming that media influence leads to increased protective practices and therefore reduction in the per-contact transmission probability, we were able to account for the social distancing that took place during the spring outbreak but which did not occur during the fall outbreak, achieving a good overall fit to the epidemic curves for the spring and fall outbreaks using the same model for both outbreaks. The Mexico City H1N1 example shows that there is not always a the direct link between case counts and media attention. Therefore, it is important to quantify actual media attention in infectious disease models.</p>
