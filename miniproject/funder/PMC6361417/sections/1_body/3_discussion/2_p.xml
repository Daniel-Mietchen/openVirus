<p>First, we demonstrated the theoretical properties of the proposed media function. The media function is affected by the observed volume of media coverage, as well as two parameters, λ and 
 <italic>α</italic>, with λ controlling the relative weight of recent and prior information in determining behavior and 
 <italic>α</italic> controlling the extent to which transmission is slowed by media exposure. As λ increases, the effect of media is more prominent and has shorter duration. As 
 <italic>α</italic> increases, the spread of disease is slowed more quickly, though there can be multiple waves of infection when the values of 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ are both relatively high.
