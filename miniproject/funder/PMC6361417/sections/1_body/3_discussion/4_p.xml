<p>Public reaction to common or seasonal diseases can be limited [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], even though such diseases are often deadly. Using data from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC, we explored the role of media in a typical, seasonal outbreak and demonstrated that the low level media interest exhibited during the influenza season was associated with only a small reduction in the number of cases. Media may be a tool for public health officials to communicate preventive measures to the public during disease outbreaks. Therefore, the effect of significantly increasing the volume of media coverage was explored. It was found that a ten-fold increase in the volume of media coverage resulted in a 33.5% decrease in the median number of infections. Thus, media may be a moderately effective means to prevent disease transmission.
