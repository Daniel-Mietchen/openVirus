<p>In conclusion, we have proposed a data-driven approach to incorporating the effect of media into models of infectious disease transmission, and have illustrated the effectiveness of the approach by fitting data from recent disease outbreaks. We believe media reaction can serve as a good proxy for the population reaction to disease outbreaks, and is substantially easier to measure accurately and quickly. Thus, as our study illustrates, incorporating media coverage allows for more accurate modeling of infectious disease outbreaks during which there are substantial changes in population behavior.</p>
