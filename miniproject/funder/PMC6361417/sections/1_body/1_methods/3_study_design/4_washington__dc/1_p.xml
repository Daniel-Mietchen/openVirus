<p>We fit data from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC in order to evaluate the model on a typical seasonal disease outbreak. As with the Mexico City simulations, the quality of fit was determined by mean absolute error (MAE) between the observed total number of cases and the median number of simulated cases per week taken over 1000 replications of the model. Using the best-fit parameters, we considered the effects of having no media coverage or ten times more media coverage on the the spread of disease. By doing so, we could obtain an estimate of the role of media in limiting the spread of the disease. Simulations were to scale, with 658,893 individuals [
