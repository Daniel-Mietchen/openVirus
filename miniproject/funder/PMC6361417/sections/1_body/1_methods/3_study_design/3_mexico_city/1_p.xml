<p>In 2009, there were two major outbreaks of H1N1 in Mexico City. The first began in mid-April [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The outbreak was relatively small and was controlled quickly via social distancing and a public information campaign [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The second outbreak began in August and spread much more widely than the first outbreak. The spring outbreak was met with intense media interest, while the fall outbreak received relatively little coverage. As there is no reason to believe that there were meaningful changes in the infectivity of the H1N1 virus or the social structure of Mexco City between the spring and fall outbreaks, the differences between the outbreaks needed to be explained by differences in media coverage.
