<p>In the model, the spring and fall outbreaks were simulated with the same parameters (i.e. 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub>, 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ) and the network structure was unchanged between simulations. Individuals who were infected during the spring outbreak were transferred to the recovered state prior to beginning the simulation of the fall outbreak, since they would have been immune to the virus. To model Mexico City we used a scale-free network [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with mean degree 2
 <italic>k</italic> and 885,108 nodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], each representing 10 people.
