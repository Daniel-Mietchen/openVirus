<p>Simulations were conducted on a network of 500,000 individuals (scale-free network with mean degree of 4), with 10 initially infected individuals. For baseline per-contact infection probability,

 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> = 1, we simulated outbreaks varying the media parameters, 
 <italic>α</italic> ∈ {0.0, 0.005, 0.01} and λ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, 1.0}. One week was used as the value of

 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub>, since influenza cases typically recover within a week. The value of

 <sub>0</sub> was selected to generate an outbreak affecting a large portion of the population. Varying the values of

 <sub>0</sub> and

 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> does not affect the interpretation of the roles of 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ. Simulations were conducted on a network of 500,000 individuals (scale-free network with mean degree of 4), with 10 initially infected individuals. We then examined the effects of the parameters, 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ, on the shape of the media function and the disease spread. For these simulations, there were five weeks without media, followed by five weeks with 100 articles each. The remaining weeks had no news articles published.
