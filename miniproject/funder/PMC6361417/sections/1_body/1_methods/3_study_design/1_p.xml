<p>We conducted several studies, including a sensitivity analysis of the model and several evaluations of the model in real-world scenarios. The first study explored the sensitivity of the model to variations in 
 <italic>α</italic> and λ. We examined both the changes to the media function and to the resulting epidemic curve. In the second study, we incorporated real media coverage data into a model of 2009 A(H1N1) in Mexico City. We then compared the fitted media function with proposed approximate media functions, showing that, for this outbreak, approximate media functions cannot replicate the observed transmission dynamics. The final study demonstrated how the model could be used for analysis of a more typical disease outbreak. Simulations were fit to data from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC. We compared the reduction in cases resulting from the observed level of media coverage with that expected from having no media coverage or increasing it ten times.
