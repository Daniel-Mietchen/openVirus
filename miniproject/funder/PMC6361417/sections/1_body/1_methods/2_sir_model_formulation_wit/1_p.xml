<p>Our proposed SIR model incorporating media effects differs from earlier formulations [

 <xref rid="pone.0197646.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in two primary ways. First, the media effect is formulated as a function of the actual number of articles published about the disease and is therefore independent of the size of the outbreak. Secondly, instead of the standard deterministic approach with homogenous mixing, we opt to develop a network-based model that operates in discrete time. Since the number of media articles published is discontinuous with respect to time, the use of a discrete time approach is helpful for model parameterization.
