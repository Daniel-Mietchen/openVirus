  <title>The effects of media function parameters.</title>
  <p>The effects of the media parameters, λ and 
   <italic>α</italic>, on (A) the median number of cases per week and (B) the media function, 
   <italic>g</italic>, are shown. As λ increases, the effect of media influence becomes more prominent but for a shorter duration. As 
   <italic>α</italic> increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission.
