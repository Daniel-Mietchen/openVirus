  <title>Comparison of media functions and simulated best-fit curves for 2009 A(H1N1) in Mexico City.</title>
  <p>(A) The proposed media function, 
   <italic>g</italic>, based on the number of published news articles (red line with square markers) is compared with the media function, 
   <italic>f</italic>, based on the number of infected individuals and the change in the number of infected individuals (blue line with triangular markers). (B) The number of news articles per week is depicted. (C) The best-fit curve using the proposed media function is compared with the best-fit curve using the media function 
   <italic>f</italic>. The proposed media function accurately captures both the large reduction in the spread of disease during the spring outbreak, due to social distancing, and the insignificant reduction during the fall outbreak. Media functions based on the number of cases and rate of spread reduce the spread of disease more substantially during the fall than during the spring, largely underestimating the fall outbreak.
