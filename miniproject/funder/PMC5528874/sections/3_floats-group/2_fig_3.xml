  <title>Onion thrips preference in paired potato leaflet assays.</title>
  <p>In trial 1 (A) leaflets were available for thrips, the trial 2 (B) leaflet were screened from thrips by a white mesh presenting visual stimuli and leaflet contact. The X axis indicates time (min) from deposition of thrips within the apparatus, the Y axis is the log value of the odds ratio; a positive value indicates preference for ‘Bismark’ leaflet, a negative value indicate preference for alternate cultivar or treatment. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence limits. Where the confidence limits do not encompass Y = 0 then the preference is significant (P&lt;0.05).</p>
