<p>Thirty two distinct volatiles were identified from headspace sampling of potato foliage using Carboxen-PDMS SPME needles. These were two aliphatic aldehydes, an aliphatic alcohol, an aromatic alcohol, four monoterpenes, and 24 sesquiterpenes. The sesquiterpene region was extremely complex and not all compounds were unequivocally identified, so several were assigned as unknown sesquiterpenes A to K. (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181831.t001">Table 1</xref>). All other compounds were less than 14% of the TIC. It should be stressed that these figures do not represent the actual proportion of these compounds either in the headspace or in the leaf, but simply the proportion they represented of the Total Ion Current. A compound’s vapour pressure and specific affinity for the SPME liquid phase strongly affect its contribution to the TIC [
