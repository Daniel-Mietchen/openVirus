<p>Examination of the proportion of each volatile by ROC curve analysis identified volatiles that were important predictors of each cultivar, and the thrips preference and plant age traits (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181831.g005">Fig 5</xref>). For thrips non-preference, β-elemene (0.09 area under curve; AUROC), isoamyl alcohol (0.22) and α-gurjunene (0.30) showed a significant positive association and may therefore be associated with thrips repulsion.

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181831.t002">Table 2</xref>). Volatiles significantly associated with individual cultivars present in greater or lesser relative amounts than other cultivars tested were also identified, with AUROC values as great as 1.00 or as little as 0.00 (
