<p>Significant differences in thrips preference were noted in the two paired plant choice experiments that compared cultivar treatments against a leaflet of ‘Bismark’. In trial 1, where thrips had access to the test leaflets, the thrips showed a marked preference for the ‘Bismark’ leaflet over the blank treatment that was statistically significant at the 30 (P = 0.041), 90 (P = 0.05), 120 (P = 0.011), 150 (P = 0.009), 180 (P = 0.012) and 240 min (P = 0.002) measurements, and a preference for the ‘Russet Burbank’ leaflet over the ‘Bismark’ leaflet that was statistically significant at the 60 (P = 0.026), 120 (P = 0.034) and 180 min (P = 0.041) assessments. In contrast there was no differences in preference shown between the paired ‘Bismark’ leaflets, and between the ‘Bismark’ leaflet and the ‘King Edward’ leaflet (
