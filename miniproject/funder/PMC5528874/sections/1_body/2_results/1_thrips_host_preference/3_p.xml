<p>Differences in host preference choice by 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>tabaci</italic> was again found in both five plant choice experiments. Insect recovery numbers following release varied from 75 to 16 individuals. The mean proportion of thrips recorded on each cultivar were: ‘Atlantic’ (26% in trial 1, 19% in trial 2); ‘Russet Burbank’ (17%, 21%); ‘Shepody’ (19%, 13%); ‘Tasman’ (15%; 0%); and ‘Bismark’ (11%, 6%). For greater analytical power, and to deal with the zero value recorded for ‘Tasman’ in trial 2, the data for both trials were combined for analysis and generation of log odds ratios (

Significant preferences was shown for ‘Atlantic’ (P&lt;0.0001; P&lt;0.0001), ‘Shepody’ (P&lt;0.0001; P = 0.0006) and ‘Russet Burbank’ (P&lt;0.0001; P = 0.0001) when compared with ‘Tasman’ or ‘Bismark’. No differences in thrips preference were seen in comparisons between ‘Atlantic’ and ‘Russet Burbank’; ‘Russet Burbank’ and ‘Shepody’, and ‘Tasman’ and ‘Bismark’. A minor but significant preference for ‘Atlantic’ over ‘Shepody’ was also shown (
