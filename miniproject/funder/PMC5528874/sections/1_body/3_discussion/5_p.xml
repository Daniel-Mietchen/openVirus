<p>Distinct foliar volatile patterns were found for each of the cultivars tested. Prior studies, using different extraction and detection methodologies, also found distinct foliar VOC patterns for different potato cultivars [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Using direct extraction in methylene chloride and GC, GC-MS and NMR analyses, Szafranek et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] identified two sesquiterpenoid alcohols and 17 sesquiterpenes, eight of which were in common with the present study, although further characterisation of the unidentified compounds from both studies may reveal further commonalities. They also found that VOC patterns could be used to differentiate cultivars. Similarly, an analysis of potato volatiles from late-blight affected plants revealed specific volatiles that were indicators of infection; these being (
