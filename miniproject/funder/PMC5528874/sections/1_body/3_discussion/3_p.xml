<p>Analysis of the headspace of foliage from eight potato cultivars assessed in this study using Carboxen-PDMS SPME needles and GC-MS revealed 32 volatiles including two aliphatic aldehydes, an aliphatic alcohol, an aromatic alcohol, four monoterpenes, and 25 sesquiterpenes, the latter including 11 unidentified compounds. Isoamyl alcohol, α-thujene, α-santalene, α-curcumene and calamene appear to be previously unreported VOCs from potato foliage [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We note SPME allows accurate comparison of specific compounds across samples, whereas comparison of amounts of different compounds within samples is not possible by relative SPME quantification [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For this reason we expressed compounds as a percentage of the total signal and then comparison of that percentage between samples (e.g. cultivars) is quite valid. In all samples Caryophyllene gave the most intense signal. Prior studies using a range of different sampling and analysis technologies have shown caryophyllene to be the most abundant VOC in the headspace surrounding, and on the surface of potato foliage [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], although in the variety Chipeta, γ-elemene was detected in greater abundance [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is important to note that different headspace sampling methods can result in altered ratios of volatiles depending on sampling conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and abundance results may not necessarily be directly compared or indeed appropriate (as for SPME). It is also known that volatile release by potato plants can be affected by the time of day with greatest releases occurring in the afternoon this being more evident in older plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In our study we ensured that all comparable insect preference trials and volatile samplings occurred at the same time during the day.
