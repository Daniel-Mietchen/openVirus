Furthermore, foliar volatiles were associated with plant age and with individual cultivar. These data and techniques can be applied to potato breeding to assist in selection of thrips non-preference to aid in TSWV control, and for identification of cultivars. Furthermore, VOCs associated with thrips preference traits may be now examined as potential tools for pest and virus management as thrips lures or in a push:pull system [
