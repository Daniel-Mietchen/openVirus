<p>Testing for insect preference in plants can be difficult and is prone to experimental bias with set-up and environmental factors influencing outcomes. As tests were carried out with multiple thrips per area in both paired and five plant choice tests we acknowledge that the thrips may have responded to one another through visual, volatile or tactile cues that may have influenced the outcome. Similarly in the five plant choice test the volatiles from each cultivar could mix to some extent and influence thrips behaviour. Importantly, the cultivars associated with the thrips non-preference phenotype were observed using two distinct experimental systems (pair-wise and five plant choice testing), with both intact and detached leaves providing the volatile cues, and reflect prior field observations (for ‘Bismark’). The use of multiple systems can reduce the influence of inherent experimental bias that may be present in single systems. We also showed restriction of visual cues did not alter non-preference of cv. ‘Bismark’. These observations together suggest the observed thrips preference phenotypes are robust. We also note that the study reported here only tested two thrips populations. In Australia all recorded
