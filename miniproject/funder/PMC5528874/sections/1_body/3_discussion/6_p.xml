<p>Few studies have examined changes in VOC patterns with potato plant age. Karlsson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] examined VOC profiles from potato foliage at sprouting, tuberisation and flowering, and compared these with volatiles produced from tubers. They showed that while most compounds detected were common at all three phenological stages, the release rate of many sesquiterpenes increased between sprouting and flowering. Flowering-related volatiles were also identified. They did not however attempt to identify the relative importance of each volatile in prediction of plant development.
