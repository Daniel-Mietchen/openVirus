<p>In these experiments leaflets attached to plants of each of five cultivars (‘Atlantic’, ‘Bismark’, ‘Russet Burbank’, ‘Shepody’, and ‘Tasman’) were positioned within a circular plastic chamber (10 cm tall x 15 cm diameter; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181831.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Planting material of ‘Kind Edward’ was not available for this experiment. Adult

 <italic>tabaci</italic> (
 <italic>c</italic>. 100 individuals from population 2) were placed in the centre of the chamber and the lid closed. After 3 h thrips present on the leaflet of each cultivar were carefully removed and counted. Thrips failing to migrate to a test leaflet were not recorded. This experiment was replicated six times with fresh cohorts of thrips, and was then fully repeated with a second set of plants.
