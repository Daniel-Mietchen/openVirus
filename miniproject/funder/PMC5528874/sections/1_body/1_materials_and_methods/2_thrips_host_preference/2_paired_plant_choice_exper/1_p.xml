<p>In these experiments detached leaflets of three potato cultivars (‘King Edward’, ‘Russet Burbank’, and ‘Bismark’) were tested against a leaflet of cv. ‘Bismark’ in paired choice assays. ‘Bismark’ was chosen as the standard comparator as prior field observations suggested probable thrips non-preference [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A terminal leaflet was detached from the youngest fully expanded leaf of seven week old plants of each potato cultivar and their petioles inserted into a 2 mL microfuge tube containing 0.7% sterile agarose. Leaves were then placed at either end of an experimental chamber consisting of a plastic tube (30 cm length, 6.5 cm diameter) with three 2.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup> mesh covered vents along the upper chamber surface to prevent condensation build-up and the mixing of leaf volatiles. A small hole in the centre of the chamber allowed thrips to be introduced (

 <italic>tabaci</italic> thrips (population 1) were collected from rearing containers, starved for 1 h and deposited in the centre of the chamber. Thrips migration to within 1 cm of the sample leaf at either end of the test chamber was recorded every 15–30 min for 3 h. Thrips failing to move to either of the chamber termini after 3 h were not recorded. The following paired challenges were conducted: ‘Bismark’ vs Blank (no leaflet); ‘Bismark’ vs ‘Bismark’; ‘Bismark’ vs ‘Russet Burbank’; ‘Bismark’ vs ‘King Edward’. Six replicates of each test pair were conducted with fresh cohorts of thrips, and cultivar leaflets rotated between each end of the chamber between replicates. The experiment was fully repeated except in this instance a fine mesh barrier was placed between leaf and the central part of the preference chamber at each end to remove potential visual cues. Both experiments took place at room temperature (
