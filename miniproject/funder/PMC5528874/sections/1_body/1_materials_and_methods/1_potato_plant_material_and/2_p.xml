 <italic>tabaci</italic> were used in host-preference trials. Both were collected from Cambridge, Tasmania, Australia (42°50’12” S, 147°26’28” E); population 1 collected from onion plants in 2002, and population 2 from potato plants in 2007. No specific permissions or permits were required for this study and the collection did not involve endangered or protected species. TSWV-free thrips colonies were reared from individual females on Common bean pods (
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> L.), following a protocol modified from van de Wetering et al. [
