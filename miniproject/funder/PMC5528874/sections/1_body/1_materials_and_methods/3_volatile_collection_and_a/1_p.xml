<p>Four plants each cultivar; one pair planted six weeks after the first pair; were grown in an insect-proofed glasshouse (16–22°C) for four (‘young’ plants) or ten (‘old’ plants) weeks post emergence prior to volatile analysis. At four weeks the plants were rapidly growing and had yet to initiate tuber set; at ten weeks plants had commenced tuber set but had yet to flower. The entire foliage of a single shoot from each potted potato plant was enclosed in a new polyethylene plastic bag (Clorox Pty Ltd., Padstow, Australia) which was loosely sealed around the potato stem. The bag was left in place for 30 minutes prior to volatile sampling. A manual SPME needle (75 μm Carboxen-PDMS, Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA) was inserted through a puncture hole into the headspace of the plastic bag, and the needle exposed to the headspace volatiles for 15 minutes. A new bag was used for each plant.</p>
