<p>Volatiles adsorbed onto the SPME needles were analysed by GC-MS using a Varian 3800 Gas Chromatograph coupled to a Varian 1200 quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in electron ionisation mode. A Varian 1177 injector was operated at 280°C in split mode, with a 2:1 split ratio. The column was a Varian FactorFour VF-5 ms, 30 m x 0.25 mm with 025 μm film. The carrier gas was helium at a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The column oven was held at 40°C for 3 minutes before a linear ramp to 240°C at 8°C per minute. The SPME syringe was left in the injector for ten minutes to minimise any carryover between samples. The transfer line was held at 290°C, the ion source at 220°C and electron voltage was 70 eV. The range from
