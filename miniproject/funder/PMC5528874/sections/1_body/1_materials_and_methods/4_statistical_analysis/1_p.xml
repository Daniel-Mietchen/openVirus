<p>Both the paired plant and five plant choice thrips preference trials were analysed as a series of challenges between cultivars. For the paired assays cv. ‘Bismark’ was always one of the alternatives. Both paired and the five-way data were analysed using logistic regression with a generalised logit link [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the case of the paired comparisons the proportions of insects that chose Bismark over the alternative cultivar in each experiment and time over an alternative cultivar were compared. The five-way experiment data were analysed as a series of null models, cycling through each cultivar as reference level in turn. The results of the logistic regression were presented as log (base 10) odds, which represented the (log) odds of selecting the first cultivar over the alternative. All analyses were conducted using Proc Logistic in SAS version 9.3.
