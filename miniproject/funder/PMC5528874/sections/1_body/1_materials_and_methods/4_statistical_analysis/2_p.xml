<p>For volatile analysis, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to characterise the usefulness of each volatile as a predictor of each trait of interest. In each ROC curve the estimated true positive (tp) rate was plotted on the vertical axis while the estimated false positive (fp) rate was plotted on the horizontal axis. The estimated tp rate was the proportion of samples with the predictor value being above a particular cut-point given that the sample is in the target population. The estimated fp rate was the proportion of samples above the same cut-point where the sample is not in the target population. ROC’s were constructed using the ROCR package in R [

Ideally, where a predictor is a useful one, the curve rises rapidly to the top-left corner or the bottom right corner and then flattens to follow the top or bottom of the plot. In the case where a predictor is not informative, the curve follows the diagonal line from the bottom left to the top-right. The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) were calculated to provide an indication of the test performance regardless of the selected cut-point. The AUROC can range from 0 to 1.0; those tests with areas closer to 0.5 have little discriminatory power whereas those tests with areas closer to 0 or 1 are good discriminators. The AUROC can also be interpreted as the average probability of correctly predicting a positive case across all possible cut-points of the predictor. To interpret the diagnostic accuracy of the tests, we consider AUROCs between 0.3 and 0.5 or 0.5 and 0.7 to reflect low accuracy; those between 0.2 and 0.3 or 0.7 and 0.8 have moderate accuracy; 0.1 and 0.2 or 0.8 and 0.9 show high accuracy; and those between 0.0 and 0.1 or 0.9 and 1.0, very high accuracy [
