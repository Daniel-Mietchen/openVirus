<p>Potato foliage continually releases volatile compounds into the air, and analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from potato green foliage has been the subject of several prior studies. Potato foliage VOCs are dominated by an abundance of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoid alcohols that generally account for greater than 90% of the total volatile release [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. No similar studies on thrips interaction with potato volatiles have been done, but prior studies have indicated variation in thrips herbivory of potato foliage [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and studies with other plant hosts have documented the effects of plant volatiles on thrips feeding [
