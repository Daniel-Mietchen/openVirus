<p>Mechanisms of host plant resistance to insects has been defined as non-preference, antibiosis or tolerance [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Non-preference is the most effective resistance form when dealing with virus vectors, as this reduces host plant contact by the vector, and diminishes opportunities for virus transmission events [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Non-preference can occur through interference with location of the plants, by altering colour or growth habit, or disrupting initial settling through leaf attributes such as waxes, trichomes, ridges and volatiles [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The role of plant volatiles in either attracting or repelling insects to plants is well documented [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For thrips, like most phytophagous insects, olfactory cues are important in the insect’s initial orientation to a plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Insects can be both attracted or repelled by plant volatiles [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Attractants can assist in locating food sources, potential mates, and may be used to identify oviposition sites [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Repellent plant volatiles provide insects with olfactory cues of the presence of non-hosts or harmful substances [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These have the potential for use as new tools for crop protection as repellent crop treatments [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Identification of the quantity and quality of volatiles involved in plant-insect interactions is the first step toward developing such strategies that manipulated host-finding behaviour [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In a meta-analysis of plant herbivore interactions with plant volatiles, Szendrei and Roderigues-Soaona (2010) [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found 76% of all characterised interactions involved attraction of the herbivore, with only 3% of the studies testing compounds that act as repellents. They conclude that the application of plant volatiles as repellents is an underexplored area.
