 <italic>tabaci</italic> preference amongst potato cultivars in a series of choice trials, and attempt to associate thrips non-preference with potato foliar volatiles. We used solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampling to assess the relative abundance of volatiles captured within the headspace around the foliage of six potato cultivars that vary in their relative preference to 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>tabaci</italic> (‘Atlantic’, ‘Russet Burbank’, ‘King Edward’, ‘Tasman’, ‘Bismark’), and two additional cultivars (‘Desiree’, Spunta’) at two different growth stages. We compared the volatile profiles of the sampled plants using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analyses. The use of ROC curves is the most appropriate analysis tool for polytomous data where volatiles are used as predictors of biological traits, and has been commonly used for similar analyses in agricultural and medical research [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It can compare the usefulness of the predictors across all possible values of cutpoints for the predictors. This is a model-based approach, unlike more exploratory approaches, such as PCA, that may identify groupings but do not obtain predictors. We used this data to calculate the relative importance of individual volatiles in identifying thrips non-preference, plant age and specific cultivar. We can use this information to aid in breeding programs for insect resistance, and target specific compounds for further biological testing and subsequent pest management strategies.
