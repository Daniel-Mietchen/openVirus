<p>Virus diseases pose significant threats to productivity of most crop plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Potato (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.), the world’s third largest staple food crop after wheat and rice, suffers from several virus diseases, exacerbated by vegetative propagation which can efficiently transfer virus infections between generations [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In potato, infections with Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) are generally rare [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], however in Australia, major epidemics can occur which may lead to complete crop loss [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. TSWV is naturally spread by certain thrips species and in Australia the most important for transmission of TSWV in potato is onion thrips (
 <italic>Thrips tabaci</italic> Lindeman) [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Prior observations comparing potato cultivars for resistance to TSWV revealed that in field exposure trials, cv. ‘Bismark’ had significantly lower incidence of TSWV infection, and reduced thrips feeding scars [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In contrast when mechanically inoculated with TSWV ‘Bismark’ readily succumbed to infection. This suggested the field resistance observed may relate to thrips vector non-preference rather than resistance to virus infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The absence of effective virus-resistant cultivars means thrips resistance is an attractive option for TSWV management avoiding interactions between vector and host plant. However, breeding crops for control of virus spread through resistance to vector species can be challenging. Resistant crops can be selected that restrict the colonisation and multiplication of the vector insect, providing effective reduction in losses due to pest feeding damage [
 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This may not however be sufficient to reduce virus acquisition or transmission. Indeed plants that do not readily support colonisation of virus vector species can be efficiently infected by a non-persistently transmitted virus through transient feeding [
