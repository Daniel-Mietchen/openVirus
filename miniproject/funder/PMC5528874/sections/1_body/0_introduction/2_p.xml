<p>Virus diseases in potato are commonly managed by ensuring seed tubers have low virus incidence through seed certification protocols [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However with TSWV epidemics, the majority of inoculum comes from sources external to the crop, and as such seed certification plays a reduced role in disease management. The use of resistant cultivars can provide another important avenue for virus disease control [

 <xref rid="pone.0181831.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, with the sporadic and limited global distribution of the disease in potato, TSWV resistance has not been a breeding priority for the major potato breeding programs. Most plant breeders looking to combat virus diseases focus on selection and introgression of major resistance genes that target the virus pathogen. However, no major TSWV resistance gene has been identified in potato. Furthermore TSWV has many variant strains and a propensity for breaking resistance in crops where resistance genes are available [

Alternatively, as many plant viruses, including TSWV, rely on an invertebrate vector species to facilitate spread between plants, targeting host genes that affect attraction, settling, feeding and fecundity of these vectors can be a valuable tool in virus disease management.
