 <p>Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) causes sporadic but serious disease in Australian potato crops. TSWV is naturally spread to potato by thrips of which 
  <italic>Thrips tabaci</italic> is the most important. Prior studies indicated possible non-preference of potato cultivars to 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>tabaci</italic>. Select potato cultivars were assessed for non-preference to 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>tabaci</italic> in paired and group choice trials. Cultivars ‘Bismark’, ‘Tasman’ and ‘King Edward’ were less preferred than ‘Atlantic’, ‘Russet Burbank’ and ‘Shepody’. Green leaf volatiles were sampled using solid-phase microextraction from the headspace of potato cultivars of two ages that differed in 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>tabaci</italic> preference. Analysis of headspace volatile data using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves identified individual volatiles associated with 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>tabaci</italic> preference and non-preference, young and old plants and individual cultivars. These data could be used to inform breeding programs for selection of 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>tabaci</italic> resistance to assist with TSWV management, and biological testing of novel thrips management compounds.
