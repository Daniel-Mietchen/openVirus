  <title>Association between normalized weekly percentages of ILI consultations (ILI) and weekly proportion of positive laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B (LAB).</title>
  <p>(A) Normalized weekly percentage of ILI consultations and laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza (A and B); (B) Cross wavelet transform of the LAB and ILI time series. The power values were colored in Fig 2B. The black solid contour lines indicate the regions of power significant at the 95% confidence level which can be assumed to be a true feature. The region outside the black-curved cone indicates the presence of edge effects and is not drawn as the evidence for conclusions. (C) Phases of LAB and ILI time series (solid lines, colors as in Fig 2A) and their phase difference (black dashed lines).</p>
