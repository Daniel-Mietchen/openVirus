  <title>Wavelet analysis of weekly percentage of positive laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B.</title>
  <p>(A) Weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A; (B) Power spectrum of time series of percentage of confirmed cases of influenza A; (C) Weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza B; (D) Power spectrum of time series of percentage of confirmed cases of influenza B. The black solid contour lines indicate the regions of power significant at the 95% confidence level which can be assumed to be a true feature. The region outside the black-curved cone indicates the presence of edge effects and is not the evidence for conclusions. The power values were shown in the panel on the right.</p>
