<p>We utilized wavelet analysis, involving the transformation of a data series with a wavelet, to determine the timing of epidemics. Employing time-localized waves as basis functions. This approach can detect non-stationary behavior, which changes over time in both frequency and amplitude. In the analysis of epidemiological time series data, wavelet analysis has been used previously to measure synchrony in influenza activity between two locations or between two incidence proxies [

We adopted a global wavelet spectrum to estimate the amplitude of annual and semi-annual epidemic cycles for subtypes of the weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens. As a measure of epidemic coherence between laboratory surveillance data and the weekly percentage of clinical ILI consultation, as well as between different age groups, the cross wavelet transform method was employed and high coherence suggested that one time series was associated with the other one at a particular time and frequency [
 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We estimated the weekly phase angle difference in wavelet-reconstructed time series after extracting the main annual cycle (52-week period; Morlet continuous wavelet). The Morlet wavelet is essentially a wavelet consisted of a complex exponential, which can capture the cyclical fluctuations in local time series [

 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to estimate the amplitude of the annual and semi-annual epidemic cycles in each wave. Following Maraun et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we estimated the coherence by smoothing 3 periods in the time direction and one octave (0.5 in each direction) in scale direction. The following results were not sensitive by changing these parameters.
