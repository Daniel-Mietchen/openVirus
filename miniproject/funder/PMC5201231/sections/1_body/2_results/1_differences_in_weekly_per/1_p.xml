 <xref rid="pone.0169199.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarized the annual numbers of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections and ILI in the Xicheng District of Beijing from 2008–2015. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1A</xref> showed the weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A. The mean was 7.8% and ranged between 0% to 67%. There were no clear epidemic periods after 2012, despite two sharp spikes around the winters of 2009 and 2010. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1B</xref> showed the wavelet power spectrum of the weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed positive specimens of influenza A. A high power indicates frequency- and time-specific periodicity. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, although annual influenza epidemics were identifiable in most years (not colored as pure blue), the wavelet analysis revealed that the influenza activities for type A showed a statistically significant annual pattern with one peak in winter in the years 2009–2010. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1C</xref> showed weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza B. The mean was 2.9% and ranged from 0 to 90%. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, influenza B showed one peak in the winter in 2012, 2014 and 2015, which was consistent with the annual cycle detected in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g001">Fig 1D</xref>. Only an annual seasonal pattern was noticeable in Beijing.
