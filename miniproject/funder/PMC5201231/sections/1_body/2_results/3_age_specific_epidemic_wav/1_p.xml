 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, we found that influenza virus activity was synchronized across age groups throughout the whole study period. The figure showed that consistent peak patterns were observed for the epidemic peak times of ILI among the three groups, especially for three obvious peaks in years 2013–2015. The composite epidemic pattern was also remarkably similar in the waves for the age groups 0–5, 5–15, and 25–60. One noticeable distinction between the curves of ages 0–5 and 5–15 and that of ages 25–60 during the pandemic in 2009–2011 was that the peak in the 5–15-year-old age group appeared much sharper than that of the adults of aged 25–60, and the influenza pandemic patterns appeared highly heterogeneous at each age scale. This phenomenon only appeared during the pandemic, but not in any other peak of the year, such as those in 2011 and 2013–2015. To compare the timing across various age groups, we calculated their phase angle difference for the annual cycle that was consistently observed throughout the study in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g003">Fig 3B</xref>. The 25–60 age group was found to follow the 0–5 group, with an average delay of 4.1 weeks, ranging from the delay of 2.0 to 6.4 weeks, and to follow the 5–15 group, with an average delay of 1.1 weeks, ranging from 1.0 week ahead to 3.9 weeks’ delay.
