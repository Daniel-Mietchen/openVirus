<p>The time series of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens (LAB) and weekly percentage of clinical consultations for ILI were normalized with mean and standard deviations as zero and one, respectively. After normalizing and aligning the curves of the weekly laboratory-confirmed rates and ILI consultation rates from 2008 to 2015, the irregular shapes of the epidemic curves for Xicheng District, Beijing, are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, showing both the level of synchronization as well as a similarity in shape. The results of wavelet coherence analysis between LAB and ILI are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g002">Fig 2B</xref>. The LAB data presented a consistently significant coherence with ILI for the annual cycle during 2009–2011 and 2014–2015 on 95% significance level. For the semiannual cycle, high coherence was found only in the year 2014. To compare the timing of LAB and ILI, we calculated their phase angle difference for the annual cycle that was most clearly observed throughout the study. The mean of the phase angle difference was 0.328 in radians as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169199.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, which implied that LAB was estimated to follow ILI with an average delay of 2.716 weeks. ILI consistently preceded LAB from 2008 to early 2011 and approached the latter thereafter.
