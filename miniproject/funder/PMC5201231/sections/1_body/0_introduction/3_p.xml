<p>Studies on age-specific epidemic activity curves could provide key evidence on the mechanism of virus transmission and could facilitate the formulation of age-specific control measures [

 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, this hypothesis has not been supported consistently; for example, some studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] questioned the hypothesis that the children actually bring about influenza epidemic fluctuations. The objective of this study is to identify the age groups in which influenza activity first peaks in the community using our extensive surveillance of ILI cases over eight years and thereby fill a gap in the data available for temperate developing regions.
