<p>In temperate developed regions, seasonal influenza has been well studied and be known as one of the main causes of substantial morbidity and mortality [

By identifying explicit and predictable annual seasonality, public health interventions can be implemented to prevent and control influenza. Investigating the seasonal patterns of influenza activity also allows for adequate preparations of preventive measures before the influenza season begins [

It is usually assumed that the reported influenza activity is generally representative of the timing of influenza activity and that influenza virus infections can be identified in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the surveillance of influenza epidemics cannot only rely on increasing numbers of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases because non-specific ILI-like symptoms may be caused by etiologies other than influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, many countries collect data on laboratory-confirmed influenza infection parallel to clinical surveillance to provide more accurate and timely information about influenza virus activity than information from conducting clinical surveillance alone. Although there has been important progress in influenza surveillance systems in recent years, the volume of information on the surveillance of ILI and laboratory-confirmed virus activity remains too sparse for detailed analyses at the province and city levels even in developed countries [
