<p>Annual cycles were observed in both the laboratory-confirmed influenza and ILI activity data, and both disease indicators were highly synchronous for most of the study period. Peak timing provides a complementary measure of synchrony between influenza surveillance systems. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] mentioned that although the weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens appeared to be temporally representative of the level of influenza activity at the community level, this was not the case during the 2009 pandemic, when laboratory practices varied in response to the public health needs. During the pandemic period, clinical and laboratory testing procedures varied in response to public health and clinical needs and laboratory capacity, and thus the detection rates were not constant over this period. We showed that the percentages of ILI consultations were in synchrony with laboratory surveillance findings in the period of the pandemic and therefore can be adopted as a reliable indicator of influenza epidemics during special periods.
