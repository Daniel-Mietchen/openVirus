<p>In our study, during both the pandemic period and peak timing from 2008â€“2015, laboratory surveillance and clinical surveillance data showed high retrospective correlation in capturing season-to-season epidemic timing and magnitude. However, we noticed that from 2008 to early 2011, these data sources were not exactly synchronous, and thus significant phase differences were captured by wavelet analysis. Yang et al. [

Additionally, competition and interference between influenza A viruses and other respiratory viruses existed. Therefore, we suspected that other viruses were active during the period, which could lead to clinical surveillance being less specific to influenza. Although laboratory data are considered to be more rigorous and accurate than clinical data, the surveillance system was constructed only since 2007 in China [
