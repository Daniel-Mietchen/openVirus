<p>When divided by age groups, clinically-diagnosed ILI indicators accurately capture weekly fluctuations in influenza activity during inter-pandemic and pandemic seasons and can be utilized to assess the effects of age on trends in epidemic activity. Using wavelet coherence analysis to compare these time series, we did not observe large differences in susceptibility from season to season. In the pandemic of 2009, the peak of the ILI wave for age 5–15 was extremely high for two possible reasons. The weak immune system of teenagers may not have been able to resist the substantial threats presented by new viruses. Additionally, schoolchildren had few ways to avoid cross-infections because classes were suspended for only a short period of time. The main limitation of the approach we used to study influenza epidemics is that we need to be cautious when interpreting distinctions because it is hard to determine whether it was the epidemic activities among school children that drove the pandemic after 2009 or whether the pandemic itself acted as a major destructive effect on school children in the following two years. Slight but consistent age-specific differences became apparent after identifying phase difference. We found that the peaks of influenza-like illness in the time series of groups aged 0–5 and 5–15 consistently appeared ahead of those of adults, implying the possibility that schoolchildren may lead epidemic fluctuations of clinical ILI consultations. Further research is needed to confirm this subtle difference. Beyond the analysis presented here, it is plausible that a thorough understanding of age-specific driving forces of seasonal epidemics will require additional long-term data from other temperate regions.</p>
