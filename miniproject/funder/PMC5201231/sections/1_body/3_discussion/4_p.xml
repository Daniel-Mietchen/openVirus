<p>Past work suggested there was essentially no lead between reference laboratory surveillance system and ILI cases in Hong Kong in 2009 [

 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0169199.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our findings regarding surveillance data in Beijing are consistent with these studies, and thus support that clinical ILI consultation rates could be a reliable and timely indicator of changes in influenza virus activities in Beijing, a city with temperate climate. The detection of the coherence between the confirmed influenza cases and ILI can be applied to other temperate regions to provide insights into the seasonality of influenza viruses in temperate regions. Meanwhile, laboratory confirmation will likely play an increasingly important role in the development of better methods of early detection and summary measures of influenza activity in key times. Our study provides certain evidence of the seasonality and periodicity of both surveillance and clinical data, such as the local features of a single time series and the local coherence between two time series. In practice, when ILI is consistently detected ahead of laboratory-confirmed cases, it can bring up an early warning for influenza epidemic, for susceptive populations to improve their self-protection, and for the government to allocate medical resources timely. These results will need to be verified by future research with access to greater number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. It is hoped that the size of laboratory samples can be increased to provide better evidence to facilitate the surveillance of both clinical and laboratory samples, both of which can be of great use in public influenza activity prediction.
