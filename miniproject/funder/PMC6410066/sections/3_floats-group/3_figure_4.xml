 <caption>
  <p>Influenza immune imprinting and the history of circulating influenza viruses. The timeline illustrates the relationship between virus circulation and influenza virus immune imprinting at infancy. Several published studies have shown that antibodies reactive toward the imprinting virus can last throughout the host’s lifetime. Human studies investigating imprinting serology, epidemiology, or cell reactivity are noted in the figure for the time period of imprinting. The author’s last name and publication date are given. The date in parentheses refers to study subjects’ date of birth if it is not easily deduced from the timeline.</p>
