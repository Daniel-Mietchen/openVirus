<p>The host pathogen interaction of antigenically-evolving and variable influenza viruses leads to a complex host immune background. Preimmunity blends age, immune function, and sequence of influenza virus infections. By analyzing consecutive influenza virus exposures as monosubtypic homologous, monosubtypic heterologous, heterosubtypic, or heterotypic sequential infections we may identify immune mechanistic patterns that govern future responses. Ultimately, we want to study preimmunity and understand the mechanisms to guide future vaccine design and offer insight into an effective universal influenza vaccine. Although this has been the strategy of universal influenza vaccine development targeting the HA stalk domain [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], there are still many knowledge gaps regarding the mechanisms of immune imprinting and preimmunity. We have highlighted three areas of investigation: memory phase recovery, imprinting age, and memory B cell mechanisms. Findings from animal models of sequential influenza virus infection may be extrapolated to the knowledge gaps of human studies. Understanding how the human immune response changes over sequential influenza infections and vaccinations will inform the rational development of more efficacious vaccines and vaccination policies for the public.
