<p>We know that the interaction between the immune system and an evolving pathogen is more complex than embodied by OAS. Immune history is not simply composed of the host’s first influenza virus infection. Rather, the interaction between the immune system and influenza viruses is dynamic with each exposure. Each host-pathogen interaction shaping the individual immune landscape and, by extension, the immune landscape of the community (

Without detailing the immune mechanism, previous studies have indicated that the order of virus infections and the viruses’ antigenic relatedness between the viruses has significant impact on the adaptive immune cell population or antibody pools [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For example, secondary infection with a virus of the same lineage has been hypothesized to invoke antibodies directed toward the hemagglutinin HA head while a secondary infection of a different viral lineage will elicit antibodies targeting conserved viral regions, such as the HA stalk [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The constant circulation of a heterogeneous pool of influenza viruses allows for many possible permutations for viral infection order. In this review, we will analyze the order of viral exposures depending on the homology of the viruses. Specifically, we refer to these as (1) monosubytypic homologous, (2) monosubtypic heterologous, (3) heterosubtypic, and (4) Heterotypic sequential infections (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00122-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The influence of a previous influenza virus exposure on the outcome of a subsequent infection may be both beneficial and deleterious. A person’s first influenza infection is a significant event, the imprinting event, which creates the largest background pool of long-lasting immunological memory cells [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Subsequent infections lead to cumulative effects of influenza viruses on the immune background which shape future responses [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We propose that a person’s immune history of influenza virus infections should be known as preimmunity. The schematic shows how an individual’s immune landscape may evolve during seasonal exposures to influenza viruses and vaccinations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00122-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The imprinting event that occurs during early life exposure leads to virus-specific immune B cell and T cell memory clones that are long-lived. Specifically, for the humoral arm of the immune system, imprinting leads to the development of antibodies that target surface and internal viral epitopes specific to this first influenza virus which remain prominent throughout life [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most antibodies will target the immunologically-dominant HA molecule, but other viral antigenic epitopes may dominate in later infections [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The host immune composition varies with each infection in respect to antibody specificity and B cell longevity. Following a new influenza virus infection, the resulting immune constellation is dependent on the synergy between the pre-existing immune specificity and the characteristics of the next influenza virus infection (virus strain, subtype, lineage, or type).
