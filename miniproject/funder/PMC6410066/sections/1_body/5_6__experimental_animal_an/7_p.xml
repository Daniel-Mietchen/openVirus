<p>Although the human immune background is far more complex than that of experimental animal models, personal influenza virus exposure history can be deduced. As discussed previously, cross-referencing a personâ€™s birth year against the history of influenza A and B virus circulation we can surmise a personal preimmune complexion [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Following analysis, the authors concluded that reactivity of previously established B cell clones is dependent on the order of virus type and subtype exposures [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Severely ill patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 virus had high titers of low avidity serum antibodies which were previously generated from sH1N1 exposures. This study found that the fatal cases were marked by IC in the respiratory tract. The data suggested that antibodies previously generated from past seasonal influenza virus infections (MsHe infection) had a negative impact on disease progression during 2009 H1N1 infection. Looking at the B cell biology and source of the antibody responses, another study investigated the cell type responsible for antibody generation during 2009 H1N1 virus vaccination in humans [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There were two major findings of this study. The first was that people with low initial 2009 H1N1 antibody titers generated a broadly reactive antibody response directed at the HA stalk, whereas those with high 2009 H1N1 antibody pre-vaccination titers with a head directed response following vaccination. The stalk antibodies were polyreactive and their magnitude decreased during repeated 2009 H1N1 vaccination. The authors hypothesized these antibodies became less abundant due to the decreased accessibility of the HA stalk region which would allow for less cell stimulation leading to anergy of the antibody producing B cell clone. The second major finding was that the precursor for short-lived plasmablasts were memory B cells [
