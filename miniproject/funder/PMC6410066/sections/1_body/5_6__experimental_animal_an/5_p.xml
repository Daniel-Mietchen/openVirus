<p>In comparison, a recent report by Kosikova and colleagues investigated the antibody dynamics in a MsHo H3N2 virus drift study [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Repeated exposure to drifted H3 antigens affected antibody activity and reactivity was investigated in both humans and experimental preimmune animal studies [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Human sera were collected from infants (8–30 months of age) and adults (28–74 years of age) following seasonal influenza virus vaccination. The samples were subjected to HAI and microneutralization assays. Experimentally, male ferrets were infected every two weeks (MsHo, H3N2 -&gt; H3N2) starting at approximately four months of age. This age represents neither youth nor adulthood for ferrets since ferrets are considered infants prior to 8 weeks and adults after six months of age [

The evolving immune responses to drifting H3N2 virus was analyzed by comparing antibody reactivity following infection or vaccination with viruses of the currently drifting H3N2 clades 3C.2a, 3C.3a, 3c.1, and 1. The researchers found that sequential homologous H3N2 strain infections led to epitope narrowing of the elicited antibodies which complemented their human serology results. Together, these data suggest that preimmunity acquired by frequent exposure to H3N2 drifting viruses by homologous re-exposure leads to less broadly reactive antibodies. Taken together with the H1N1 MsHo drift study [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], the results suggest that humoral immune responses may differ according to the drifting subtype.
