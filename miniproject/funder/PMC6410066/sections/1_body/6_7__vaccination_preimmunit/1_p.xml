<p>Despite immune history, influenza viruses are a recurrent and as yet unsolved public health problem. These viruses cause millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths each year estimated at 500,000 people worldwide by the WHO [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Yearly influenza vaccination is recommended by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) of Canada, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, and the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most effective strategy for reducing influenza burden [

 <xref rid="B107-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The low effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine has been attributed to the frequent mutations in the virus which occurs through antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Aside from viral antigenic changes causing low vaccine effectiveness (VE), low VE has previously been linked by some researchers to repeated seasonal influenza vaccination in specific antigenically-defined influenza seasons [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These effects of repeated vaccination was first publicized in 1979. Data from a study following schoolboys found that subjects who were sequentially vaccinated for H3N2 virus had no statistically determined protective advantage compared to unvaccinated children during seasonal influenza virus circulation [

 <xref rid="B109-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Loss of protection due to repeated vaccination has been named the Hoskins Paradox referring to the lead author of the 1979 study. More recently, VE following sequential seasonal vaccination has been investigated in two independent reports [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. These reports use the Antigen Distance Hypothesis (ADH) as the metric to determine the influence of preimmunity acquired through vaccination in previous years against the current vaccine. The influence of vaccine-established preimmunity is determined by comparing the antigenic relatedness between the reference viruses of previous and current vaccines. ADH suggests that if there is minimal antigen relatedness between previous and current vaccination then there will be increased antigen interference from previous memory B cell clones. Conversely, increased antigenic diversity will permit the generation of new B cell clones and positive outcome for vaccine protection. In both reports the authors showed epidemiological evidence that repeated vaccination during seasons with antigenically-related vaccine reference strains led to a greater percentage of vaccinated people testing positive for influenza virus infections [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The evidence supporting the antigen distance hypothesis diverges from the findings of Monsalvo and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] who showed that previously existing low avidity antibodies that were elicited from large antigenic changes were deleterious during new antigenically-divergent 2009 H1N1 virus infections. It is possible that this discrepancy is due to differential immune mechanisms of antigenic distance initiated between vaccination and live virus infection. The antigenic distance hypothesis as a mechanism of reduced effectiveness for specific influenza seasons remains a hypothesis and is not presented here as leverage for skipping influenza virus vaccinations. More studies of vaccination effectiveness in other countries, as well as experimental studies directly testing the antigenic distance hypothesis is needed. Furthermore, there are numerous publications supporting the regular use of influenza vaccinations in children, adults, and pregnant women following rigorous scientific study. Results from these analyses support vaccine induced protection against severe disease following influenza virus infection, as well as improved neonatal outcomes when vaccination occurred during pregnancy [
