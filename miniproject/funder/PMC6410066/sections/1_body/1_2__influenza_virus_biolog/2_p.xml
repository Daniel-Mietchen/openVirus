<p>Both type A and B consist of eight negative-sense, single-stranded RNA segments: Polymerase acidic (PA/PA-X), Polymerase basic 1 (PB1/PB1-F2), Polymerase basic 2 (PB2), HA, nucleoprotein (NP), NA, matrix protein 1 and 2 (M1/M2), non structural protein 1 (NS1), and nuclear export protein (NEP/NS2) [
