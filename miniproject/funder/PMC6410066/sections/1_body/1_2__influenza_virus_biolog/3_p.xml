<p>The HA and NA [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Influenza A viruses are capable of moving between animal and human hosts, permitting a large degree of disease and destruction. For type A viruses there are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 through H18) and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (N1 through N11) [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] that combine to define the A virus subtype (e.g., H1N1). Extensive antigenic diversity exists within each subtype as each strain mutates during host infection. Influenza B virus has a more limited host range and has only been shown to infect humans, seals, and experimental animals such as ferrets [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Type B viruses are not categorized by subtypes but instead are defined by two lineages (B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage), each of which is also comprised of antigenically evolving strains [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The NA of both type A and B viruses has sialidase enzymatic activity which functions during viral budding and egress [
