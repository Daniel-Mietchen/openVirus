<p>Molecular analysis of HA showed that it is comprised of an immunodominant globular head domain distal to the viral envelope and a proximal membrane stalk domain [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The HA molecule binds sialic acids which can be in α2,3- or α2,6-linkage to galactose. Binding of HA to sialic acid-linked host proteins regulates virus cell entry [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The HA globular head is variable and frequently mutated. Since the host cell receptor binding region is located in the head domain, it is a target for antibodies enabling virus neutralization. The stalk domain is conserved among viral HA proteins and functions during host-virus membrane fusion leading to genome uncoating [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. There is considerable homology in the HA stalk among type A viruses which are classified into two groups. Group 1 is comprised of H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16 [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Antibodies targeting the stalk region have been shown to broadly block membrane fusion and viral infection across viruses per HA group [
