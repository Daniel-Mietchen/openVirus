<p>Previous studies investigating the immune re-encounter with influenza viral antigens or live virus infection are frequently designed with short recoveries of 14 to 28 days separating primary and secondary challenges [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. These time frames do not properly account for the actual immunological recovery. Although these studies offer insight into secondary immune responses, the interval of time between sequential infections or vaccinations does not accurately reflect the human immune condition of yearly viral challenge [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Enough recovery time (more than two months in animal studies) should be given to allow for nonspecific immune responses to subside. At this point only a small set of specific memory cells would be present at the time of secondary pathogen exposure. This design would more accurately reflect the seasonal exposures of influenza viruses in humans. Longer recovery times for animal experiments are costly in time and money which may be why they are rarely approached. We suggest that more studies examining re-exposure during the adaptive immune memory phase will uncover immune mechanisms relating influenza pathogenesis. Furthermore, since most studies are focused on the viral HA and the humoral responses targeting this protein, it will also be important that future studies give more attention to the alternative immune responses. Specific adaptive immune components of interest are CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, and memory NK cells [
 <xref rid="B68-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The major hurdle to understanding the responses of these alternative adaptive memory cells is the lack of immune correlates for their responses and functions. The standard methodology for assessing immune activation following influenza virus infection is the HAI (hemagglutinin inhibition) assay which is associated with B cell activity. Furthermore, this assay only determines the minimum concentration of serum antibodies required to inhibit a virus of interest from binding to sialic acids present on red blood cells [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The assay does not evaluate all of the possible viral targets of the humoral antibody responses or antibody functions, such as virus neutralization [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Basic discovery studies are needed to identify correlates of NK memory cell, CD8+ T cell, non-HA antibody reactivity, and protection.
