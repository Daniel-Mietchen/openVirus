<p>The influenza A virus was first identified as the etiological agent of human influenza in 1933 shortly after the advent of electron microscopy [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00122-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Prior to virus discovery, the agent responsible for influenza-like epidemics/pandemics such as the 1918 influenza pandemic were not readily determined [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The constructed timeline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00122-f003">Figure 3</xref>) starting in 1889 shows the history of influenza A and B virus circulation in the human population. There have been six presumptive pandemics caused by influenza A viruses since 1889 that have defined the immunological landscape of humans. The Russian pandemic of 1889 and the 1918 pandemic occurred prior to the discovery of the influenza virus [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The etiology of these disease outbreaks was determined by seroarcheological studies by sampling people who had lived prior to and during the time of the epidemics. Seroarcheology and molecular clock analysis suggested an H3N8 virus and an H1N1 virus as the etiological agent of the 1889 and 1918 pandemics, respectively [

 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. It wasn’t until the 1918 virus was sequenced (1997) then resurrected in 2005 that H1N1 was definitively shown to be the causative agent of the 1918 pandemic [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. It is estimated that the 1918 H1N1 virus caused 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide between 1918 and 1919, establishing it as the deadliest pandemic known to modern history. Sequencing has suggested that the virus has both avian and swine origins [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. After 1918 there were several introductions of H1N1 viruses into human circulation from zoonotic sources. Therefore, the H1N1 viruses which circulated until 1957 were not direct descendants of the original 1918 H1N1 virus but instead originated from other spillover events [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In 1957, H1N1 was replaced with an H2N2 virus during the Asian pandemic. This outbreak was responsible for 2 million deaths [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The H2N2 virus was usurped by the introduction of the influenza A virus subtype H3N2 of swine origin which emerged during the Hong Kong pandemic of 1968 [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The driving factor causing H2N2 virus replacement with H3N2 subtype has been hypothesized to be the population’s previous immunity to sub-immunodominant domains on the influenza virus, i.e., the HA stalk and the neuraminidase [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. H3N2 circulated as the only influenza A virus for nine years, until H1N1 resurfaced in 1977. A possible laboratory escape, the 1977 resurfacing of the H1N1 virus is referred to as the Children’s Pandemic since older individuals were protected due to preimmunity to H1N1 viruses [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Since 1977, H1N1 and H3N2 have co-circulated in humans.
