<p>Nonspecific effectors are mobilized for blocking viral replication, containing virus dissemination, and recruiting effector cells for viral clearance [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Since influenza viruses are transmitted through the respiratory route, the initial site of infection for influenza viruses is the respiratory epithelium [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Specifically, ciliated pseudostratified columnar respiratory epithelial cells from the trachea, bronchi, nasal cavity, and submucosal glands, as well as type I and II pneumocytes of the alveoli are targeted. After infecting the epithelium, the virus spreads to leukocytes such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and Natural Killer (NK) cells [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Infected cells sense viral PAMPS (pathogen associated molecular patterns) through cell specific PPRs (pattern recognition receptors) [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. There are three families of receptors that sense viral PAMPs: TLRs (toll-like receptors), RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene—I), and NOD-like (nucleotide oligomerization domain-like) receptors [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Stimulation of these receptors induces the expression IFN-α, chemokines, and other immune orchestrating proteins. These immune mediators induce an antiviral state by inhibiting viral spread and recruiting specific immune cells for viral clearance [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. NK cells aid in influenza viral clearance by recognizing and lysing influenza virus-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Alveolar macrophages phagocytose virus infected cells for antigen presentation. Both conventional and plasmacytoid DCs have a central role bridging innate immunity to the targeted adaptive immune responses during influenza virus infection [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Conventional DCs sit under the epithelium and lung parenchyma to continuously survey the airway environment with their dendrites [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Detection of influenza virus initiates DC up-regulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7 for migration to the draining lymph node [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the lymph node, DCs present viral antigen to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and B cells. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells differentiate into Th1 or Th2 cells depending on other exogenous signals (polarizing cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, IL-4). CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells up-regulate chemokine receptors (CXCR3 and CCR4) to home back to the lung to kill virus infected cells. Global gene expression analysis of influenza infection in ferrets has shown that the host immune responses are biphasic [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00122" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Early robust innate ISG (interferon stimulated genes) and chemokine response that were initially generated begin to shut down (day 7 post inoculation) as an adaptive immune phase becomes prominent. This “switch” is the elimination point of respiratory viral load and shutting down the inflammatory response, which contributes to lung pathogenesis [
