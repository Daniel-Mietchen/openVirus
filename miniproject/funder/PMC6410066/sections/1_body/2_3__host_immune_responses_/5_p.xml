<p>B cells are expanded rapidly, then decline as immunological memory is established. In the germinal centre, B cell specificity is refined for improved responses toward the pathogen. Refinement occurs by somatic hypermutation (SHM), class-switch recombination (CSR), and clonal selection [

Selected memory B cells are established for long-term circulation to protect against subsequent infections. They may be germinal center-dependent or germinal center-independent depending on how the cell developed [
