<p>SFSV has been described in an extended geographic area from southwestern Europe to the Middle East including northern Africa. SFSV epidemics were recorded in Italy, Cyprus, Turkey, and Ethiopia [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, seroprevalence studies have shown the presence of neutralizing antibodies in humans in France and Cyprus [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In Iraq, during an outbreak among US Army troops in 2007, IgM antibodies specific for SFSV were detected in convalescent sera [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], so far there are no data to support that the CFUV virus or genetic variants such as the Drin virus can cause disease in humans. The areas of circulation of viruses belonging to the SFSV phlebovirus species are wide enough to justify that efforts must be made to investigate the potential role of these viruses in human infections. Further seroprevalence studies may show indirect evidence of the circulation of the virus in humans. The fact that a single real-time RTâ€“qPCR assay is capable of detecting all viruses that are so far recognized as members of this group is an important asset for studies of clinical cohorts of febrile illness in countries where direct or indirect evidence of the presence of these viruses have been reported.
