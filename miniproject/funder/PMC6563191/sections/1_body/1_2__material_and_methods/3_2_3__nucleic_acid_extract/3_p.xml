<p>Nested PCRs were performed with a DreamTaq kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with Nphlebo2 and SFNV2 primers. The following cycle was used for the Nested-PCRs: 94 째C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 째C for 30 s, the annealing temperature for 45 s, and 72 째C for 30 s, with a final elongation step at 72 째C for 7 min.</p>
