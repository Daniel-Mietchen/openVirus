<p>To identify the sand fly species constitutive of the Drin virus positive pool, barcoding PCR was performed with 3 Î¼L of nucleic acid to amplify partial regions of the cytochrome 
 <italic>c</italic> oxidase I (
 <italic>COI</italic>) and cytochrome 
 <italic>b</italic> (
 <italic>Cytb</italic>) genes, respectively, as previously described [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The PCR products were purified and sequenced through NGS. The reads were compared with available sequences in the GenBank sequence database using CLC Genomic Workbench 11 software (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
