<p>A total of 2502 sand flies were tested for phlebovirus presence, 533 collected in 2015 (298 females and 244 males), and 1969 in 2016 (1064 females and 905 males) in seven different regions of Albania (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00469-f001">Figure 1</xref>). They were organized in a total of 118 pools (27 and 91 pools in 2015 and 2016, respectively) which were tested as described above. Pool #17, containing 24 male sand flies collected in 2015 in the village of Domaj, in the municipality of KukÃ«s, provided a PCR product of the expected size with polymerase Nphlebo primers [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The real-time RT-qPCR assay designed from CFUV L, Gc, and S RNA sequences was positive with Ct values &lt;29. Of the 118 pools that were studied, only Pool #17 was found to be positive. Genotyping the sand flies of the virus-positive Pool #17 by NGS analysis of the PCR product provided 6910 reads for the 
 <italic>COI</italic> gene and 397 reads for the 
 <italic>Cytb</italic> gene. All 7307 reads 100% matched the 
 <italic>P. neglectus</italic> sequences, and thus demonstrated that the 24 sand flies contained in Pool #17 belonged to the 
 <italic>P. neglectus</italic> species.
