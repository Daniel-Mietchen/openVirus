<p>Vero cells inoculated with supernatant corresponding to Pool #17 were examined daily for CPE. Eight blind passages were done, but no CPE was observed. In addition, each passage was tested for the presence of Drin virus RNA using the SFN, Nphlebo, and Lambert sets of primers; the results were consistently negative, indicating that the Drin virus was not isolated in cell culture. For this reason, we decided to try virus isolation by using intracerebral (IC) inoculation into suckling mice. A total of 25 baby mice were injected with sand fly homogenate supernatant with the attempt to isolate the Drin virus. None of the mice developed clinical signs, which suggested that the Drin virus was not replicating in their brain tissues. Baby mice were euthanized at 7 days post-IC injection, the brain was then collected postmortem, with nucleic acid extraction performed as described above and tested with different PCR assays. All results were negative, showing that the Drin virus had not been isolated.</p>
