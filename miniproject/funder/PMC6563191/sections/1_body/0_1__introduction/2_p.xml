<p>Most phleboviruses use sand flies as vectors [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Phlebovirus distribution and circulation peaks are closely related to vector presence and activity. Sand flies are broadly distributed in regions bordering the Mediterranean basin. They are abundant in peri-urban and rural environments, which are concentrated near human and domestic animal habitats [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, human populations are exposed to sand fly–transmitted diseases, among them phlebovirus-related diseases. For example, TOSV, which was isolated in Italy in 1971, is of major concern as it causes central nervous system infection leading to acute meningitis in humans, whereas the SFNV and SFSV only induce a transient febrile illness known as the “three-day fever”, “phlebotomus fever”, or “pappataci fever” [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00469" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Phleboviruses are emerging pathogens that raise veterinary and public health concerns. Recently, a large number of novel phleboviruses have been identified in the Mediterranean area and have been included in existing species or in the tentative ones detailed above.
