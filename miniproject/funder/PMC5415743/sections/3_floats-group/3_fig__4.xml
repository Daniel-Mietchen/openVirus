  <p>Texas county ZIKV risk assessment. 
   <bold>a</bold> Probability of an outbreak with at least two reported autochthonous ZIKV cases. 
   <bold>b</bold> The probability of epidemic expansion at the moment the second autochthonous ZIKV case is reported in a county. White counties never reach two reported cases across all 10,000 simulated outbreaks; light gray counties reach two cases, but never experience epidemics. 
   <bold>c</bold> Recommended county-level surveillance triggers (number of reported autochthonous cases) indicating that the probability of epidemic expansion has exceeded 50%. White counties indicate that fewer than 1% of the 10,000 simulated outbreaks reached two reported cases. All three maps assume a 20% reporting rate and a baseline importation scenario for August 2016 (81 cases statewide per 90Â days) projected from historical arbovirus data.
