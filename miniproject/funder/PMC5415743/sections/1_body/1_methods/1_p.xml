<p>Our risk-assessment framework is divided into three sections: (1) county-level epidemiological estimates of ZIKV importation and relative transmission rates, (2) county-specific ZIKV outbreak simulations, and (3) ZIKV risk analysis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). To demonstrate this approach, we estimate county-level ZIKV risks throughout the state of Texas for August 2016, given that, by May 2016, Texas experienced dozens of ZIKV importations without subsequent vector-borne transmission.
