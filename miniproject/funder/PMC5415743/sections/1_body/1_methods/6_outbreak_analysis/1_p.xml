<p>Our stochastic framework allows us to provide multiple forms of real-time county-level risk assessments as reported cases accumulate. For each county, we found the probability that an outbreak will progress into an epidemic, as defined above, as a function of the number of reported autochthonous cases. We call this 
 <italic>epidemic risk</italic>. To solve for epidemic risk in a county following the 
 <italic>x</italic>th reported autochthonous case, we first find all simulations that experience at least 
 <italic>x</italic> reported autochthonous cases, and then calculate the proportion of those that are ultimately classified as epidemics. For example, consider a county in which 1000 of 10,000 simulated outbreaks reach at least two reported autochthonous cases and only 50 of the 1000 simulations ultimately fulfill the two epidemic criteria; the probability of detecting two cases in the county would be 10% and the estimated epidemic risk following two reported cases in that county would be 5%. This simple epidemic classification scheme rarely misclassifies a string of small outbreaks as an epidemic, with the probability of such an error increasing with the importation rate. For example, epidemics should not occur when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> = 0.9. If the importation rate is high, overlapping series of moderate outbreaks occasionally meet the two epidemic criteria. Under the highest importation rate we considered (0.3 cases/day), only 1% of outbreaks were misclassified.
