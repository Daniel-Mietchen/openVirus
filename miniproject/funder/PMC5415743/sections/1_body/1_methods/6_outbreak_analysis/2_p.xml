<p>This method can be applied to evaluate universal triggers (like the recommended two-case trigger) or derive robust triggers based on risk tolerance of public health agencies. For example, if a policymaker would like to initiate interventions as soon as the risk of an epidemic reaches 30%, we would simulate local ZIKV transmission and solve for the number of reported cases at which the probability of an epidemic first exceeds 30%. Generally, the recommended triggers decrease (fewer reported cases) as the policymaker threshold for action decreases, (e.g. 10% versus 30% threshold) and as the local transmission potential increases (e.g.
