<p>The risk of ZIKV emergence following an imported case will depend on the likelihood of mosquito-borne transmission. For emerging diseases like ZIKV, the public health and research communities initially face considerable uncertainty in the drivers and rates of transmission, given the lack of field and experimental studies and epidemiological data, and often derive insights through analogy to similar diseases. For our case study, we estimated county-level ZIKV transmission potential by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> using a recently published model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], that derives some of its key parameters from DENV data. The utility of our framework depends on the validity of such estimates and will increase as our knowledge of ZIKV improves. However, we expect our results to be robust to most sources of uncertainty regarding ZIKV and DENV epidemiology, as they may influence the absolute but not relative county-level risks.
