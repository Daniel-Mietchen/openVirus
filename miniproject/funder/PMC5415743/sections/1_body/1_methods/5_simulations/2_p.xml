<p>To verify that our simulations do not aggregate cases from clear temporally separate clusters, we calculated the distribution of times between sequential cases (Additional file

In our simulated epidemics, almost all sequentially occurring cases occur within 14 days of each other, consistent with the CDC’s threshold for identifying local transmission events (based on the estimated maximum duration of the ZIKV incubation period) [
