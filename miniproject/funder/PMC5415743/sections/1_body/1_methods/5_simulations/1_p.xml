<p>For each county risk scenario, defined by an importation rate, transmission rate, and reporting rate, we ran 10,000 stochastic simulations. Each simulation began with one imported infectious case and terminated either when there were no individuals in either the 
 <italic>Exposed</italic> or 
 <italic>Infectious</italic> classes or the cumulative number of autochthonous infections reached 2000. Thus the total outbreak time may differ across simulations. We held 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> constant throughout each simulation, as we sought to model early outbreak dynamics over short periods (relative to the seasonality of transmission) following introduction. We classified simulations as either epidemics or self-limiting outbreaks; epidemics were simulations that fulfilled two criteria: reached 2000 cumulative autochthonous infections and had a maximum daily prevalence (defined as the number of current infectious cases) exceeding 50 autochthonous cases (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S6). The second criterion distinguishes simulations resulting in large self-sustaining outbreaks (that achieve substantial peaks) from those that accumulate infections through a series of small, independent clusters (that fail to reach the daily prevalence threshold). The latter occurs occasionally under low 
 <italic>R</italic>

 </sub>s and high importation rates scenarios.
