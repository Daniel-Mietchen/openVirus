<p>The resultant model thus follows a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission process stemming from a single ZIKV infection using a Markov branching process model (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4). The temporal evolution of the compartments is governed by daily probabilities of infected individuals transitioning between disease states. New cases arise from importations or autochthonous transmission (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S5). We treat days as discrete time steps, and the next disease state progression depends solely on the current state and the transition probabilities. We assume that infectious cases cause a Poisson distributed number of secondary cases per day (via human to mosquito to human transmission), but this assumption can be relaxed as more information regarding the distribution of secondary cases becomes available. We also assume infectious individuals are introduced daily according to a Poisson distributed number of cases around the importation rate. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Infectious</italic> cases are categorized into reported and unreported cases according to a reporting rate. We assume that reporting rates approximately correspond to the percentage (~20%) of symptomatic ZIKV infections [

Additionally, we make the simplifying assumption that reported cases transmit ZIKV at the same rate as unreported cases. We track imported and autochthonous cases separately, and conduct risk analyses based on reported autochthonous cases only, under the assumption that public health officials will have immediate and reliable travel histories for all reported cases [
