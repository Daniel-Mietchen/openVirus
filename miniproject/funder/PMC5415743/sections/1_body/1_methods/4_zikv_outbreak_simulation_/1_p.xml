<p>Assuming mosquito-borne transmission as the main driver of epidemic dynamics, to transmit ZIKV, a mosquito must bite an infected human, the mosquito must get infected with the virus, and then the infected mosquito must bite a susceptible human. Rather than explicitly model the full transmission cycle, we aggregated the two-part cycle of ZIKV transmission (mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito) into a single exposure period where the individual has been infected by ZIKV, but not yet infectious, and do not explicitly model mosquitos. For the purposes of this study, we need only ensure that the model produces a realistic human-to-human generation time of ZIKV transmission, and the simpler model is more flexible to disease transmission pathways. We fit the generation time of the ZIKV model to early ZIKV Epidemiological estimates, with further fitting details described in Additional file
