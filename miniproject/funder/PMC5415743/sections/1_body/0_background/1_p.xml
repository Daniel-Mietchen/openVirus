<p>In February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus (ZIKV) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Though the Public Health Emergency has been lifted, ZIKV still poses a great threat for reemergence in susceptible regions in seasons to come [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the US, the 268 reported mosquito-borne autochthonous (local) ZIKV cases occurred in Southern Florida and Texas, with the potential range of a primary ZIKV vector,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Of the 2487 identified imported ZIKV cases in the US through the end of August, 137 had occurred in Texas. Given historic small, autochthonous outbreaks (ranging from 4 to 25 confirmed cases) of another arbovirus vectored by 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti—</italic>dengue (DENV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], Texas was known to be at risk for autochthonous arbovirus transmission, and the recent outbreaks have highlighted the need for increased surveillance and optimized resource allocation in the states and the rest of the vulnerable regions of the Southern United States.
