<p>Previous risk assessments of ZIKV have provided static a priori assessments based on historical incidence and vector suitability, but they do not provide dynamic risk assessments as cases accumulate in a region. Here, we present a framework to support real-time risk assessment, and demonstrate its application in Texas. Our framework accounts for the uncertainty regarding ZIKV epidemiology, including importation rates, reporting rates, local vector populations, and socioeconomic conditions, and can be readily updated as our understanding of ZIKV evolves. To estimate current and future epidemic risk from real-time ZIKV case reports, the model incorporates a previously published method for estimating local ZIKV transmission risk and a new model for estimating local importation risk. Across Texasâ€™ 254 counties, we find that the estimated risk of a locally sustained ZIKV outbreak rises precipitously as autochthonous cases accumulate, and that counties at the southern tip of the Texas-Mexico border and in the Houston Metropolitan Area are at the highest risk for ZIKV transmission. This statewide variation in risk stems primarily from mosquito suitability and socio-environmental constraints on ZIKV transmission rather than heterogeneity in importation rates.</p>
