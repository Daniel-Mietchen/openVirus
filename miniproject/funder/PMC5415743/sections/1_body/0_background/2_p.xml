<p>As additional ZIKV waves are possible in summer 2017, public health professionals will continue to face considerable uncertainty in gauging the severity, geographic range of local outbreaks, and appropriate timing of interventions, given the large fraction of undetected ZIKV cases (asymptomatic) and economic tradeoffs of disease prevention and response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Depending on the ZIKV symptomatic fraction, reliability and rapidity of diagnostics, importation rate, and transmission rate, the detection of five autochthonous cases in a Texas county, for example, may indicate a small chain of cases from a single importation, a self-limiting outbreak, or a large, hidden epidemic underway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These diverging possibilities have precedents. In French Polynesia, a handful of ZIKV cases were reported by October 2013; 2 months later an estimated 14,000–29,000 individuals had been infected [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By contrast, Anguilla had 17 confirmed cases from late 2015 into 2016 without a subsequent epidemic, despite large ZIKV epidemics in surrounding countries [
