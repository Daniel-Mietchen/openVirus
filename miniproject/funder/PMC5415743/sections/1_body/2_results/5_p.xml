<p>To evaluate a universal intervention trigger of two reported autochthonous cases, we estimate both the probability of two reported cases in each county and the level of epidemic risk at the moment the trigger event occurs (second case reported). Assuming a baseline importation rate extrapolated from importation levels in March 2016 to August 2016, county

 </sub> scaled from a maximum of 1.5, and a 20% reporting rate, only a minority of counties are likely to experience a trigger event (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). While 247 of the 254 counties (97%) have non-zero probabilities of experiencing two reported autochthonous cases, only 86 counties have at least a 10% chance of such an event (assuming they experience at least one importation), with the remaining 168 counties having a median probability of 0.0038 (range 0.0005 to 0.087). Assuming that a second autochthonous case has indeed been reported, we find that the underlying epidemic risk varies widely among the 247 counties, with most counties having near zero epidemic probabilities and a few counties far exceeding a 50% chance of epidemic expansion. For example, two reported autochthonous cases in Harris County, correspond to a 99% chance of ongoing transmission that would proceed to epidemic proportions without intervention, with the rest of the Houston metropolitan also at relatively high risk ranging from 0 (Galveston) to 90% (Waller) (Fig.
