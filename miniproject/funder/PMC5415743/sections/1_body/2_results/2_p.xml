<p>ZIKV transmission risk is concentrated in southeastern Texas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), partially overlapping with regions of high importation risk (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Our county-level estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> range widely (from 0.8 to 3.1 for the highest-risk county), reflecting the uncertainty in socioeconomic and environmental drivers of ZIKV (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). We therefore analyzed the relative rather than absolute transmission risks. For purposes of demonstration, we assumed a plausible maximum county-level 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> of 1.5, which closely followed our median estimates, and scaled the transmission risk for each county accordingly. The following risk analyses can be readily refined as we gain more precise and localized estimates of ZIKA transmission potential.
