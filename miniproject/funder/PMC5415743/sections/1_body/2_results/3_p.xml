<p>Wide ranges of outbreaks are possible under a single set of epidemiological conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The relationship between what policymakers can observe (cumulative reported cases) and what they wish to know (current underlying disease prevalence) can be obscured by such uncertainty, and will depend critically on reporting rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Under a scenario estimated for Cameron County which experienced the only autochthonous ZIKV transmission in Texas and with a 20% reporting rate, ten linked and reported autochthonous cases correspond to 6 currently circulating cases with a 95% CI of 1â€“16 from inherent, early-stage outbreak stochasticity. From this wide range of outbreak trajectories, we can characterize time-varying epidemic risk as cases accumulate in a given county. We track the probability of epidemic expansion following each additional reported case in high and low reporting rate scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).
