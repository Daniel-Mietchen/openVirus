<p>Given that a universal trigger may signal disparate levels of ZIKV risk, policy makers might seek to adapt their triggers to local conditions. Suppose a policymaker wishes to design triggers that indicate a 50% chance of an emerging epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Under the baseline importation and reporting rates, an estimated 31 of the 254 counties in Texas are expected to reach a 50% epidemic probability, with triggers ranging from one (Harris County) to 21 (Jefferson County) reported autochthonous cases, with a median of two cases. Counties who detect cases simply due to high importation rates do not have triggers, and the magnitude of a trigger helps quantify a countyâ€™s absolute risk for an epidemic as a function of the reported autochthonous cases.
