<p>ZIKV importation risk within Texas is predicted by variables reflecting urbanization, mobility patterns, and socioeconomic status (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S3), and is concentrated in metropolitan counties of Texas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). In comparing the predictions of this model to out-of-sample data from April to September 2016, the model underestimated the statewide total number of importations (81 vs 151), but robustly predicted the relative importation rates between counties (β = 0.97,
