<p>These curves can support both real-time risk assessment as cases accumulate and the identification of surveillance triggers indicating when risk exceeds a specified threshold. For example, suppose a policymaker wanted to initiate an intervention upon two reported cases, this would correspond with a 49% probability of an epidemic if 10% of cases are reported, but only 25% if the reporting rate is doubled. Alternatively suppose a policy maker wishes to initiate an intervention when the chance of an epidemic exceeds 50%. In the low reporting rate scenario, they should act immediately following the third autochthonous reported case, but could wait until the eleventh case with the high reporting rate.</p>
