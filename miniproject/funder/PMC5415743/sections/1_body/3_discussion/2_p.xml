<p>Surveillance triggers--guidelines specifying situations that warrant intervention--are a key component of many public health response plans. Given the urgency and uncertainty surrounding ZIKV, 
 <italic>universal</italic> recommendations can be both pragmatic and judicious. To assist Texas policymakers in interpreting the two-case trigger for intervention guidelines issued by the CDC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we used our framework to integrate importation and transmission risks and assess the likelihood and implication of a two-case event for each of Texasâ€™ 254 counties, under a scenario projected from recent ZIKV data to August 2016. Across counties, there is enormous variation in both the chance of a trigger and the magnitude of the public health threat if and when two cases are reported. Given this variation, rather than implement a universal 
 <italic>trigger</italic>, which may correspond to different threats in different locations, one could design local surveillance triggers that correspond to a universal 
 <italic>risk threshold</italic>. Our modeling framework can readily identify triggers (numbers of reported cases) for indicating any specified epidemic event (e.g., prevalence reaching a threshold or imminent epidemic expansion) with any specified risk tolerance (e.g., 10% or 50% chance of that the event has occurred), given local epidemiological conditions. We found close agreement between the recommended two-case trigger and our 
 <italic>epidemic</italic> derived triggers based on a 50% probability of expansion. Of the 30 counties with derived triggers, the median trigger was 2, ranging from one to 21 reported autochthonous cases. These findings apply only to the early, pre-epidemic phase of ZIKV in Texas, when importations occur primarily via travel from affected regions outside the contiguous US.
