<p>These analyses highlight critical gaps in our understanding of ZIKV biology and epidemiology. The relative transmission risks among Texas counties appear fairly robust to these uncertainties, allowing us to identify high risk regions, including Cameron County in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Public health agencies might therefore prioritize such counties for surveillance and interventions resources. Given the minimal incursions of DENV and CHIKV into Texas over that past eleven years since the first DENV outbreak in Cameron County, and the high number of importations into putative hotspot counties without autochthonous transmission, we suspect that, if anything, we may be underestimating the socioeconomic and behavioral impediments to ZIKV transmission in the contiguous US. Our analysis also reveals the significant impact of the reporting rate on the timeliness and precision of detection. If only a small fraction of cases are reported, the first few reported cases may correspond to an isolated introduction or a growing epidemic. In contrast, if most cases are reported, policymakers can wait longer for cases to accumulate to trigger interventions and have more confidence in their epidemiological assessments. ZIKV reporting rates are expected to remain low, because an estimated 80% of infections are asymptomatic, and DENV reporting rates have historically matched its asymptomatic proportion [

Obtaining a realistic estimate of the ZIKV reporting rate is arguably as important as increasing the rate itself, with respect to reliable situational awareness and forecasting. An estimated 8–22% of ZIKV infections were reported during the 2013–2014 outbreak in French Polynesia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. While these provide a baseline estimate for the US, there are many factors that could increase (or decrease) the reporting rate, such as ZIKV awareness among both the public and health-care practitioners, or active surveillance of regions with recent ZIKV cases. Our analysis assumes that all counties have the same case detection probabilities. However, only 40 of the 254 Texas counties maintain active mosquito surveillance and control programs, potentially leading to differences in case detection rates and surveillance efficacy throughout the state [
