<p>Due to the lack of effective vaccine and antiviral treatment, vector control is considered as a useful measure towards prevention of dengue disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. DF epidemics in the different districts appeared not homogenous, due to the change of the transmission pattern of spatial and time [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the spatial clusters, socio-environmental factors at the new and smallest administrative unit (street level) and the temporal cluster at daily level in Guangzhou have not been explored in this epidemic regions. To help decision-makers or policy-makers in targeting the prevention and control areas and reduce the economic burden, vector control techniques could be selectively applied at high-risk areas or clusters of DF. Hence, this study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of DF using spatiotemporal scan technique at street-level[

 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], to identify the socio-environmental risk factors of DF and to explore the spread of DF over the study period for improving prevention and control of DF and guiding to future study.
