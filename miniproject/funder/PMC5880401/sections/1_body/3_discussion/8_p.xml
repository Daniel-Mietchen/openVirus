<p>In recent years, the impact of climate change on the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases has been studied in China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results showed significant variation in the spatial distribution of DF in Guangzhou and that the geographic range of notified cases has expanded in this city (from south towards north and concentrate on the southwestern Guangzhou city) over the study period. Previous study reveal the movement tracks of the centre of mass for annual incidence rate of DF at municipality level in China, showing that the geographic expansion of dengue epidemics, such as gradually shifting from southern China (Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan) to northeastern China (Fujian and Zhejiang) and southwestern China (Yunnan) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The associations between the spread of DF incidence rates and longitude and latitude were observed in this work, also demonstrated that DF has spread towards the southwestern Guangzhou city during the study period. Dengue is a complex disease and the spatiotemporal distribution involves socio-environmental factors, such as climate change, population movement, mosquito density and urbanization. Hence, future studies should include the impact of climatic and entomological factors on the transmission of DF in Guangzhou city.
