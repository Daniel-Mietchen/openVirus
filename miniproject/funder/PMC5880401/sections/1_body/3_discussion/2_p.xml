<p>This study detected spatial clusters of DF high risk regions in Guangzhou city and suggested the geographic range of notified dengue cases has significantly expanded over recent years. Relative importance of risk factors may vary across space and time. This finding will provide useful information for developing dynamic early warning system for DF transmission. We have performed stepwise logistic regression model as this technique was applied in the vector-borne diseases research. Our results demonstrated that old aged population (65+ years), floating population, low-education people and non-agriculture people were the potential determinants for the spread of DF.</p>
