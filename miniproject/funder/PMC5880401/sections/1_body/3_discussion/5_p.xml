<p>The results from temporal cluster analysis indicated that the DF clusters occurred mainly in autumn, particularly, in late August to early November. Indigenous DF cases peaked seasonally despite limited intra-annual climatic variability and seasonal fluctuations. In addition, the availability of immature densities of
