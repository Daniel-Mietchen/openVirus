<p>The results of this study suggested that DF incidence rates in the different districts appeared to be heterogeneous which was due to the changes in the transmission pattern of DF spatially and temporarily. A previous study has indicated that the prevention and control strategies towards DF will depend on high-risk and low-risk clusters [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] based on 2013 dengue surveillance data, which may improve our comprehension of the differences and socio-environmental factors on DF incidence rates. But in addition, few other studies have demonstrated that socio-demographic factors, such as population growth, levels of education, demographic structure and urbanization could influence the DF spread [

However, our research used a dynamic spatial and temporal analysis based on long term data (ie., January 2006 and December 2014) to detect the spatial clusters of DF and identify associated socio-environmental factors at a street level in Guangzhou. Moreover, Guangzhou was struck by an exceptionally severe outbreak in 2014, resulting in almost 40,000 laboratory-confirmed DF cases. This outbreak is the largest and most severe epidemic of dengue fever ever documented in China, with incidence rates exceeded the combined total of all previous years [
