Guangzhou, as a large urban center of the tropics, where crowded human populations, especially nonagricultural population, live in intimate association with equally large mosquito populations. This setting provides the ideal home for maintenance of the viruses and the periodic generation of epidemic strains. In this longitudinal study, the result indicated nonagricultural population was positively related with DF risk, the central urban area and the old city area were the high-risk areas, where most aged (65+ years) Guangzhou residents lived. The streets with high nonagricultural population in Guangzhou normally have higher population density and poor housing conditions and less environmental management.
