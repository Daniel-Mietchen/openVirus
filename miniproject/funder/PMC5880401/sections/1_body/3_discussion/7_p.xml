<p>We observed an interesting result in the epidemic patterns of DF incidence rates during the study period. If the first case occurred in early summer, i.e., June or July, large outbreaks often occurred. For example, large epidemics in 2006, 2012, 2013 and 2014 were initiated with the occurrence of first case in June, July, July and June respectively. Although there were not many DF cases in 2012, the longest cluster period of DF was observed. On the contrary, if the first case occurred too early and too late, the large outbreaks often could not be triggered. In 2007 and 2010 epidemics, the first case occurred in April whereas in 2008, 2009 and 2011 epidemics, the first case occurred in November, August and September. If the first case occurs too early, the local department of health may plan to provide early warnings of DF outbreaks and implement prevention and control measures, whereas if it occurred too late, the reduced density of mosquito and the capacity of virus loading could help to decrease the risk of a large DF outbreak. Although imported cases was considered as an important trigger for the DF outbreak in Guangzhou, scientists could not confirm whether or not the dengue outbreaks in Guangzhou were initially triggered by the imported cases [
