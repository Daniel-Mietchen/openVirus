<p>Previous studies have suggested that the accumulation of a susceptible population was essential to trigger DF epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, a large number of floating population may be more susceptible for DF transmission. Residents, especially the aged, have the habit of planting flowers or hydrophyte in flowerpots or in household courtyards in Guangzhou. Several studies have identified the vegetation and breeding mosquitoes to DF that â€œvegetation can provide resting or feeding sites for mosquitoes or can serve as a proxy for the presence of breeding sites." Water storage, containers with an abundance of organic matter (e.g. those used for striking plant cuttings) or those amongst foliage or under trees (e.g. discarded plastic). As such progeny have been linked to a greater risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These containers with water provide a suitable breeding condition for mosquitoes. The water landscape and afforest landscape around the houses were also a perfect breeding habitat for mosquitoes. In addition, the movement of aged population may be limited to house surroundings and nearby areas, thus, increasing the chances of exposing themselves to mosquitoes. People with low-education generally have lack of knowledge and practices on the prevention measures of DF. These people usually work as laborers and spend most of their time outside, this in turn, may have given the possibility of being bitten by the mosquitoes. Another possible reason could be that these people live in rented apartments where the sanitary conditions are sub-optimal, thus this may have increased the chances of mosquitoes breeding and exposure.
