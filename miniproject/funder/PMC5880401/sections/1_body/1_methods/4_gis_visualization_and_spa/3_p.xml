<p>Scanning window for the spatiotemporal scanning method is the spatial scan combining with temporal scan. The scan window is a cylinder. The base of the cylinder is circle which represents the spatial dimension, and the height of the cylinder represents the temporal dimension. The radius of the circle varied from zero to the maximum spatial cluster size of 50% of the population at risk which could avoid pre-selection bias. In this study, the heights of the cylinder were varied daily from zero to 1 year. The results with the statistical significance of 
 <italic>p</italic>-value were reported by Monte Carlo simulation replication at 9999. The maximum log likelihood ratio (LLR) calculated in Poisson distribution is considered as the most likely cluster.
