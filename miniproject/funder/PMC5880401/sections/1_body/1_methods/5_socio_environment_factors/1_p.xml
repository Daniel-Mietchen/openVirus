<p>Univariate logistic regression and a stepwise logistic regression model were conducted to explore the relationship between the socio-environmental risk factors and the street with DF cases at high risk and low risk. Dichotomous dependent variable was set based on relative risks (RRs) of each street from the purely spatial cluster analysis result. The streets with RRs ≥1 were assigned “1” and those with RRs &lt;1 were assigned “0”. The potential socio-environmental risk factors included at street-level were as following: percentage of people in each age-group; floating population; non-agriculture population; percentage of people with lower education (lower than undergraduate); percentage of different type communities (urban communities, urban-rural communities and rural communities) in all of the communities in each street. The floating population is defined as the people living in the street currently whose census registers were recorded in other street of the district in Guangdong province. There are two type of the census registers including agriculture and non-agriculture in China. The non-agriculture population was defined as the people whose census registers were recorded in the urban, not in the rural.</p>
