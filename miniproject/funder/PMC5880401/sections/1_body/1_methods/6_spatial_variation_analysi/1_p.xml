<p>The variations in the distribution of DF along the latitude and longitude of streets centroids were detected using Poisson model during the study period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006318.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To explore the difference of DF distribution in the last three years and the first six years, we divided the study period into two periods: period 1 is from 2006 to 2011 and period 2 was from 2012 to 2014. The dependent variable in this modeling was the differences of DF annual mean incidence rates of the all the streets which occurred DF epidemic between the period 1 and period 2 in Guangzhou.
