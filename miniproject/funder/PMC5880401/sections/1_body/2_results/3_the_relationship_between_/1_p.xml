<p>The results of univariate and step-wise logistic regression model analyses were presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006318.t002">Table 2</xref>. In the univariate analysis, the age-groups, the percentage of non-agricultural population and the urban-rural population per street had significant association with DF risk: 0–14 years (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75 to 0.94), 15–64 years (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.88 to 0.99), urban-rural communities (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.95 to 0.98) and rural communities (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93 to 0.97) had negative association with DF risk whereas 65+ years (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.39), nonagricultural population (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.04 to 1.07) and urban communities (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.05) had positive association with DF risk. After the stepwise variable selection, four variables were entered into the multivariate logistic regression model. The results demonstrated that DF was statistically significantly associated with population belonging to 65+ years (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.03), floating population (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.15), non-agricultural population (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.11) and low-education population (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.16).
