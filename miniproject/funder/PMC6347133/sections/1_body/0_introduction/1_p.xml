<p>South Africa has the highest tuberculosis (TB) incidence rate in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and the disease is the leading cause of death [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The estimated burden of disease differs significantly between provinces with the rate of microbiologically confirmed TB (in 2012) ranging from approximately 400/100,000/year in Limpopo Province to almost 1,200/100,000/year in KwaZulu-Natal [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, the drivers of the epidemic also differ between provinces due to variation in factors including HIV prevalence, levels of drug resistance, and the capacity of the health system to identify and treat TB [
