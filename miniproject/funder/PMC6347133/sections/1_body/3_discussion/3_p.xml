<p>The TIME model has been used previously to assess the TB epidemic in South Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but this was the first instance of the model being used at the sub-national level in South Africa. The previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] suggested that at a national level, the greatest impact could be achieved by scaling up screening of primary health clinic attendees. In contrast, our sub-national analysis suggests screening would only be the most effective strategy in 2 of the 3 provinces studied. The contrasting impact of the interventions in the provinces reflects that the TB epidemic in South Africa differs by province and that the responses need to take into account the provincial epidemiological context. They also highlight an important role for the use of sub-national planning tools.
