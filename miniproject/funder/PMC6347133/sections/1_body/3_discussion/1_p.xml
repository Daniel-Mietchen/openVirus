<p>All models predicted a continuing trend of decreasing TB incidence and mortality, consistent with the recent observed decrease in TB notifications in South Africa. The projected impacts of the interventions differed by province and appear to be mainly driven by differences in current reported coverage levels rather than differences in the underlying epidemiology. The absence of sub-national TB burden estimates and uncertainty in current activity coverage levels are important data gaps that should be addressed at the provincial level.</p>
