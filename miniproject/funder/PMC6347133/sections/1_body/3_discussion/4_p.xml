<p>Several studies have used modelling to look at the TB epidemic in South Africa and assess the impact of TB prevention and care interventions [

 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These studies used different models to assess the impact of different aspects of TB prevention and care interventions covering various time periods for their predictions, ranging from ten to 38 years. However, none of these analyses aimed to inform policy at the subnational level. Several modelling studies have looked at the TB epidemic at sub-national level in South Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Gilbert 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] looked at the impact of combinations of TB interventions over a ten-year period but the analysis was confined to the rural setting of Msinga sub-district in KwaZulu-Natal. Another group modelled the TB epidemic in the urban setting of the city of Cape Town in Western Cape which was underpinned by access to high quality TB notification and programmatic data [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While these models were able to characterise the epidemic in a single setting they did not compare the effect of interventions across provinces using the same modelling framework.
