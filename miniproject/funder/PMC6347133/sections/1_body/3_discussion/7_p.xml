<p>The TIME model includes the effect of HIV on TB but does not currently include other known risk factors for TB such as diabetes or smoking. Strategies to detect and prevent TB in these risk groups may form an important part of future efforts to control TB in South Africa. Future work could consider differences in the prevalence of diabetes and other risk factors between provinces when assessing the likely impact of strategies focussed on these risks groups. The scale-up of interventions illustrated the possible impact but did not provide specific details of how they could be implemented. These models were not meant to offer definitive estimates of future disease burden or intervention impact but instead to illustrate the effect of prioritising different components of TB prevention and care. In addition, we did not consider the resource or financial implications of scaling up these interventions in each province. Analysis of the costs and cost-effectiveness of different strategies at the province level will provide further evidence on which to base the sub-national planning of TB control activities. This is the focus on ongoing research by our group, incorporating province level impact estimates and differences in service costs at the subnational level.</p>
