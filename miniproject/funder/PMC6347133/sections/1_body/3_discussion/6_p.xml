<p>Several of the key parameters used in the models were not available at the provincial level and had to be calculated from various data sources which were of variable quality and completeness. This included national estimates of incidence and mortality which were themselves based on modelled data. The use of assumptions to derive provincial-level data resulted in estimates with great uncertainty which might not have reflected the reality on the ground. Certain estimates were derived assuming that parameter values were the same across provinces which may have masked the heterogeneity in the epidemiology and intervention coverage at provincial level. The greater scrutiny that was applied to TB data allowed gaps in quality and reporting to be highlighted. The routine programmatic data used to parameterise the models may have been of variable quality and completeness which varied by province. The models did not provide granular control over the TB care pathway and algorithms, resulting in crude estimates of what is in reality a complex process.</p>
