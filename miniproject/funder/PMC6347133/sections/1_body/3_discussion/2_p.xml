<p>The regional workshops and involvement of the provincial TB managers and their teams were critical components of the sub-national modelling process. They provided an opportunity for staff from the provincial TB programmes to have first-hand experience of the modelling planning tool and offered insights into the workings and requirements of the modelling process.
