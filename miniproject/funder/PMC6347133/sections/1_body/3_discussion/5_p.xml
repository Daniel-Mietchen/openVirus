<p>This analysis suggested that the scale-up of key interventions had the potential to significantly reduce TB incidence and mortality in all three provinces. The impact of the interventions was greatly affected by the baseline levels of the core activities of each intervention. Increasing coverage of TB screening (intervention #1) was predicted to have a substantial impact on incidence and mortality in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal compared to a very modest effect in Limpopo as the reported baseline coverage of Limpopoâ€™s TB screening was already high and close to the target value. Achieving the 90% screening target in Limpopo required an increase of 29% in coverage levels compared to Western Cape where the TB screening coverage had to increase almost nine-fold in order to reach target levels. This suggested that very different levels of resources may be required to achieve the targets in different settings.</p>
