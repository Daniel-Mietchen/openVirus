 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209320.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the baseline fit of TB notifications and incidence for the three provincial models. The model outputs match the observed trends in TB notifications in all three provinces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209320.g002">Fig 2B, 2D and 2F</xref>). The TB incidence model outputs fall within the uncertainty range of the estimated incidence for all three provinces (
