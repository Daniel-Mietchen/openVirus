<p>Following their peaks, all three models show a trend of decreasing incidence until 2019 followed by gradual decline until 2035, although the decline in Western Cape is smaller than those predicted for KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo. Under the baseline scenario from 2015 to 2035, the models suggest that the TB incidence will decrease by 46%, 49% and 22% for KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and Western Cape respectively (
