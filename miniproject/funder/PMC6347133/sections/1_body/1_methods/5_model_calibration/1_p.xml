<p>Each provincial model was fitted to the number of notified TB cases, estimated TB incidence for the years 2002 to 2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and notified MDR-TB cases from 2013 to 2015 (Personal Communication, Provincial TB managers, March 2016). There has been a large increase in TB screening in the last few years so the models were also fitted to TB screening data from 2013 to 2015 (Personal Communication, Provincial TB managers, March 2016). The model was manually calibrated by adjusting the screening rate, the effective contact rate and the relative rate of presentation of healthy individuals for screening (compared to those with TB).
