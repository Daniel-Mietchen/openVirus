<p>TB treatment outcomes data were obtained from national electronic TB register (ETR.net) reports. TB screening and testing data was derived from district health information system (DHIS) quarterly reports. Nationally, pre-treatment initial loss to follow-up (ILTFU, the proportion of those diagnosed with TB who did not start treatment) has been estimated at 17% [

However, these were defined as the proportion of new smear-positive patients who did not start treatment or whose treatment was interrupted for two or more months. To derive province level estimates for pre-treatment ILTFU among all TB cases we used the ratio of the provincial to national HST estimates to adjust the national ILTFU estimate of 17%. The baseline levels of these TB programmatic activities are shown in
