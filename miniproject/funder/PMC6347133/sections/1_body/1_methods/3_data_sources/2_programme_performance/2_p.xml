<p>While there is considerable uncertainty in the province level data, in particular screening numbers, we aimed to use data as reported by the provinces where possible. This allowed us to explore which input data were the key drivers of model projections and where efforts should be focussed on improving collection and reporting of data to allow better model estimates of intervention impact. To minimise the effect of misreporting of screening data we used data from subsequent steps in the diagnostic cascade (numbers of patients with symptoms, numbers tested for TB, etc.) to estimate province level values for the specificity and linkage to testing post screening.</p>
