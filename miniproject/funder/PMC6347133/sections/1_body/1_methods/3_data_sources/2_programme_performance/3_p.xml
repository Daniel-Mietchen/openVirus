<p>Three regional modelling workshops took place in June 2016 which were attended by members of provincial TB departments. These workshops built on two previously held national workshops in which the TIME modelling tool was showcased to the National TB Programme (NTP). In the regional workshops, draft versions of the provincial models were presented and attendees were provided the opportunity to work directly with the TIME model and discuss the available data and model assumptions. While the workshops did not follow a formal elicitation approach (e.g. Delphi Process) province TB data managers provided input and expert opinion on the quality, accuracy and representativeness of their local data, and identified important data gaps to address in the future. The draft models were updated based on these discussions.</p>
