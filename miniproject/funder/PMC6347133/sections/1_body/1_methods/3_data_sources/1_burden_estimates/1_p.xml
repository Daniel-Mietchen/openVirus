<p>Provincial notification data were obtained from national electronic TB register (ETR.net) reports. Provincial TB incidence was estimated using national TB notification data and the national TB incidence estimate from the WHO TB global report to derive a national case detection ratio (CDR), the proportion of incident TB cases that are notified to the TB programme [

In the absence of provincial-level CDR estimates, the national CDR was applied to the provincial notification data (assuming the CDR was the same in all provinces) to obtain an estimate of provincial TB incidence. While this is an obvious simplification, we chose to use this approach rather than introduce other assumptions into the model. TB mortality was derived using national vital registration (VR) data in combination with WHO mortality estimates to calculate the percentage of estimated deaths captured by VR systems [
