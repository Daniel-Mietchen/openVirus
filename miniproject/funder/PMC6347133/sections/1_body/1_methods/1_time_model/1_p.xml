<p>This work used the TIME module of the Spectrum suite (Version 5âˆ™54 Beta 3) [

 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The TIME model is a user friendly, age-structured, dynamic, compartmental transmission model of TB. The model includes three disease states: susceptible, latent infection, and active disease. The model is stratified by TB treatment history, smear status, multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) status and HIV. Smear-negative cases are assumed to be less infectious than those with smear-positive TB by a factor of 0.22 [
 <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The MDR-TB strata represents those with multi-drug resistant and rifampicin resistant TB, consistent with the reporting of these cases by WHO as a single group. The HIV positive population is stratified by CD4 count and time on ART. ART is assumed to reduce the risk of developing TB and the risk of HIV and TB associated mortality. As a component of Spectrum, TIME Impact automatically incorporates country data on TB (notifications, incidence estimates, mortality estimates etc.) from the Global TB Programme (GTB) at the World Health Organization, HIV estimates (HIV incidence and prevalence, ART coverage, ART eligibility thresholds) from the Aids Impact Model (AIM, a module of Spectrum) and demographic projections from DemProj (the demographic module in Spectrum). A full description of the TIME model can be found in the supplementary material of Houben et al.[
