<p>Intervention #1 modelled an increase in the proportion of primary health clinic attendees screened for TB. We assumed screening was based on cough triage, a shortened version of the WHO screening algorithm consisting of a single question which asks patients whether they have a cough for more than two weeks (or of any duration if they are known to be HIV-positive). Intervention #2 modelled an improved linkage to care for those diagnosed with TB. We assumed ILTFU was reduced by 80% by 2021 compared to baseline values. Intervention #3 assumed increased treatment success rates for drug-susceptible TB (to 85%) and drug-resistant TB (to 67%), based on the standard six and 24 month regimens respectively.</p>
