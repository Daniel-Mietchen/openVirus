Decisions on, and funding for, TB prevention and care policies are decentralised to the provincial governments and therefore, tools to inform policy need to operate at this level. We describe the use of a mathematical model planning tool at provincial level in a high HIV and TB burden country, to estimate the impact on TB burden of achieving the 90-(90)-90 targets of the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB. &#x0201c;TIME Impact&#x0201d; is a freely available, user-friendly TB modelling tool. In collaboration with provincial TB programme staff, and the South African National TB Programme, models for three (of nine) provinces were calibrated to TB notifications, incidence, and screening data. Reported levels of TB programme activities were used as baseline inputs into the models, which were used to estimate the impact of scale-up of interventions focusing on screening, linkage to care and treatment success. All baseline models predicted a trend of decreasing TB incidence and mortality, consistent with recent data from South Africa. The projected impacts of the interventions differed by province and were greatly influenced by assumed current coverage levels. The absence of provincial TB burden estimates and uncertainty in current activity coverage levels were key data gaps. A user-friendly modelling tool allows TB burden and intervention impact projection at the sub-national level. Key sub-national data gaps should be addressed to improve the quality of sub-national model predictions.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1110334</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (SA Modelling for Policy #OPP110334).

The estimated burden of disease differs significantly between provinces with the rate of microbiologically confirmed TB (in 2012) ranging from approximately 400/100,000/year in Limpopo Province to almost 1,200/100,000/year in KwaZulu-Natal [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition, the drivers of the epidemic also differ between provinces due to variation in factors including HIV prevalence, levels of drug resistance, and the capacity of the health system to identify and treat TB [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent modelling studies have shown that scaling up existing interventions in all of South Africa has the potential to greatly reduce TB incidence and mortality, and to be cost-effective [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the vast majority of modelling studies have focussed on the national level and have not addressed potential differences between provinces [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Evidence-based TB prevention and treatment strategies are agreed upon nationally and implemented by the provinces. The allocation of budgets to specific activities also takes place primarily at the provincial level. Provincial TB programmes are resource limited and often have to make decisions without information on the likely impact of different intervention options in their setting. With the introduction of additional ring-fenced TB funding (TB conditional grant) in 2017 [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the availability of an additional sub-national planning tool to project impact is highly desirable.</p><p>In this article we describe the application of TIME (Tuberculosis Impact Module and Estimates), a user friendly TB transmission model at sub-national level in South Africa. We used the model to estimate the impact on TB incidence and mortality from 2017 to 2035 of scale-up of TB screening, linkage and retention interventions to achieve the 90-(90)-90 TB targets of the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

The TIME model is a user friendly, age-structured, dynamic, compartmental transmission model of TB. The model includes three disease states: susceptible, latent infection, and active disease. The model is stratified by TB treatment history, smear status, multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) status and HIV. Smear-negative cases are assumed to be less infectious than those with smear-positive TB by a factor of 0.22 [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The MDR-TB strata represents those with multi-drug resistant and rifampicin resistant TB, consistent with the reporting of these cases by WHO as a single group. The HIV positive population is stratified by CD4 count and time on ART. ART is assumed to reduce the risk of developing TB and the risk of HIV and TB associated mortality. As a component of Spectrum, TIME Impact automatically incorporates country data on TB (notifications, incidence estimates, mortality estimates etc.) from the Global TB Programme (GTB) at the World Health Organization, HIV estimates (HIV incidence and prevalence, ART coverage, ART eligibility thresholds) from the Aids Impact Model (AIM, a module of Spectrum) and demographic projections from DemProj (the demographic module in Spectrum). A full description of the TIME model can be found in the supplementary material of Houben et al.[<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>TIME can be applied at sub-national level using local data. For this work, each province in South Africa was considered a separate unit assuming no mixing or migration between provinces. The models used provincial level AIM and demographic files supplied by UNAIDS.</p><p>Use of the model requires the user to provide input data reflecting current levels of TB control, including rates of screening, treatment outcomes and sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic algorithm.

In the regional workshops, draft versions of the provincial models were presented and attendees were provided the opportunity to work directly with the TIME model and discuss the available data and model assumptions. While the workshops did not follow a formal elicitation approach (e.g. Delphi Process) province TB data managers provided input and expert opinion on the quality, accuracy and representativeness of their local data, and identified important data gaps to address in the future.

The projected impacts of the interventions differed by province and appear to be mainly driven by differences in current reported coverage levels rather than differences in the underlying epidemiology. The absence of sub-national TB burden estimates and uncertainty in current activity coverage levels are important data gaps that should be addressed at the provincial level.</p><p>The regional workshops and involvement of the provincial TB managers and their teams were critical components of the sub-national modelling process. They provided an opportunity for staff from the provincial TB programmes to have first-hand experience of the modelling planning tool and offered insights into the workings and requirements of the modelling process. This fostered an understanding of the importance of good quality data and how changes in model inputs can greatly influence the outputs and predicted impact of what is being modelled. The process also highlighted to programme staff areas where strengthening data collection could improve future decision making.</p><p>The TIME model has been used previously to assess the TB epidemic in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but this was the first instance of the model being used at the sub-national level in South Africa. The previous work [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] suggested that at a national level, the greatest impact could be achieved by scaling up screening of primary health clinic attendees. In contrast, our sub-national analysis suggests screening would only be the most effective strategy in 2 of the 3 provinces studied. The contrasting impact of the interventions in the provinces reflects that the TB epidemic in South Africa differs by province and that the responses need to take into account the provincial epidemiological context. They also highlight an important role for the use of sub-national planning tools.</p><p>Several studies have used modelling to look at the TB epidemic in South Africa and assess the impact of TB prevention and care interventions [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These studies used different models to assess the impact of different aspects of TB prevention and care interventions covering various time periods for their predictions, ranging from ten to 38 years. However, none of these analyses aimed to inform policy at the subnational level. Several modelling studies have looked at the TB epidemic at sub-national level in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0209320.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Gilbert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] looked at the impact of combinations of TB interventions over a ten-year period but the analysis was confined to the rural setting of Msinga sub-district in KwaZulu-Natal. Another group modelled the TB epidemic in the urban setting of the city of Cape Town in Western Cape which was underpinned by access to high quality TB notification and programmatic data [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While these models were able to characterise the epidemic in a single setting they did not compare the effect of interventions across provinces using the same modelling framework.</p><p>This analysis suggested that the scale-up of key interventions had the potential to significantly reduce TB incidence and mortality in all three provinces. The impact of the interventions was greatly affected by the baseline levels of the core activities of each intervention. Increasing coverage of TB screening (intervention #1) was predicted to have a substantial impact on incidence and mortality in Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal compared to a very modest effect in Limpopo as the reported baseline coverage of Limpopo&#x02019;s TB screening was already high and close to the target value. Achieving the 90% screening target in Limpopo required an increase of 29% in coverage levels compared to Western Cape where the TB screening coverage had to increase almost nine-fold in order to reach target levels. This suggested that very different levels of resources may be required to achieve the targets in different settings.</p><p>Several of the key parameters used in the models were not available at the provincial level and had to be calculated from various data sources which were of variable quality and completeness. This included national estimates of incidence and mortality which were themselves based on modelled data. The use of assumptions to derive provincial-level data resulted in estimates with great uncertainty which might not have reflected the reality on the ground. Certain estimates were derived assuming that parameter values were the same across provinces which may have masked the heterogeneity in the epidemiology and intervention coverage at provincial level. The greater scrutiny that was applied to TB data allowed gaps in quality and reporting to be highlighted. The routine programmatic data used to parameterise the models may have been of variable quality and completeness which varied by province. The models did not provide granular control over the TB care pathway and algorithms, resulting in crude estimates of what is in reality a complex process.</p><p>The TIME model includes the effect of HIV on TB but does not currently include other known risk factors for TB such as diabetes or smoking. Strategies to detect and prevent TB in these risk groups may form an important part of future efforts to control TB in South Africa. Future work could consider differences in the prevalence of diabetes and other risk factors between provinces when assessing the likely impact of strategies focussed on these risks groups. The scale-up of interventions illustrated the possible impact but did not provide specific details of how they could be implemented. These models were not meant to offer definitive estimates of future disease burden or intervention impact but instead to illustrate the effect of prioritising different components of TB prevention and care. In addition, we did not consider the resource or financial implications of scaling up these interventions in each province. Analysis of the costs and cost-effectiveness of different strategies at the province level will provide further evidence on which to base the sub-national planning of TB control activities. This is the focus on ongoing research by our group, incorporating province level impact estimates and differences in service costs at the subnational level.</p><p>Ideally, the choice of how best to prioritise TB prevention and care activities within provinces should take into consideration the current levels of TB activities in order to assess where gaps exist. These choices rely on the reporting of high quality and accurate TB data, both on disease burden and programme performance. Incorrect reporting could result in focus being given to activities which may not offer much additional benefit in relation to the resources required to implement them. The use of provincial data and modelling provides insight into the provincial TB epidemics allowing for more attention to be given to the local level context where decisions are best taken on how to tackle the TB epidemic. To ensure the results of these and similar analyses can inform future TB programme efforts it is essential that long-term links are established and maintained between, policy makers, provincial TB programme staff and those generating research evidence. The success of the national TB think tank [<xref rid="pone.0209320.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] illustrates the potential for such collaboration.</p><p>A user-friendly modelling tool allows burden and intervention impact projection at the sub-national level.
