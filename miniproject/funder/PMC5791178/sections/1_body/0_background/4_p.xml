<p id="Par13">Colombia is considered a hyper-endemic country for DENV, registering more than 147,000 cases of dengue in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The recent arrival of CHIKV in 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and the subsequent entry of ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] into the country in 2015 have overwhelmed the Colombian health system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and have demonstrated the enormous need to improve the clinical definition of the diseases and reduce diagnostic errors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although the criteria for the clinical definition of patients with febrile syndrome because of DENV have been widely explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the lack of sufficient facilities to make an accurate viral diagnosis before the arrival of the new arboviruses created a diagnostic gap that has jeopardized the health of patients, even more so when the confirmation of cases, both of CHIKV and ZIKV, is performed by clinical definitions in regions that have already confirmed the circulation of these viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
