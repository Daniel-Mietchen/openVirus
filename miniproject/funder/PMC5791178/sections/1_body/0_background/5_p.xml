<p id="Par14">Furthermore, with the co-circulation of these three arboviruses (DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV) in Colombia and different regions of Latin America, an increase of the number of reports of co-infections with different clinical outcomes was unusual [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, to date, no information is available that establishes the prevalence of co-circulation and co-infection for these arboviruses in Colombia. Therefore, the objective of this study was to molecularly confirm the presence of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV and their co-infections in a cohort of patients with febrile syndrome consistent with dengue in the Colombian-Venezuelan region. Our results molecularly confirm the co-circulation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in equal dominance and with a significant prevalence of co-infection among them.
