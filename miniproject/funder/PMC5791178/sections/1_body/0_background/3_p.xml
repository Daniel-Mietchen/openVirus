 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Since to that these viruses are transmitted by the same vector, the co-circulation is frequent and, moreover, there is an increasing possibility of co-infection in those regions where the vector is present [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in the Pacific, Asia, and more recently in the Americas have demonstrated an association between these viruses and adverse neurological, motor, and teratogenic events; even some authors have postulated that the clinical outcome could be affected with the co-circulation of the three agents [
