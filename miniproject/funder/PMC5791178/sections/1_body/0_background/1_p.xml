<p id="Par10">Viruses transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses) are the causative agents of some of the most significant infectious diseases emerging in the world. Among these arboviruses are the dengue virus (DENV), the chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and the Zika virus (ZIKV), which all circulate in the same tropical and subtropical geographical regions. These three arboviruses cause diseases with similar clinical presentations in the initial stages and in which the diagnoses are made clinically, particularly in countries where dengue is endemic. Dengue (the disease caused by DENV) is the most significant epidemiological arbovirus worldwide [

The term Dengue, includes both non-apparent or silent forms of the disease, the non-severe clinical forms (dengue fever [DF]) and severe clinical forms (dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] and dengue shock syndrome [DSS]). Although this classification of Dengue is still in force, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed some years ago a new classification of the disease based on severity levels (severe and non-severe dengue). In the new classification, the non-severe dengue group includes patients who develop a self-limiting illness with fever, anorexia, nausea, rash, body aches, leucopenia and positive tourniquet test, and those patients who also have warning signs of developing severe dengue such as abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, liver enlargement and increased hematocrit with a rapid decrease in platelet count. The severe dengue group includes patients with severe plasma extravasation that can lead to hypovolemic shock or respiratory distress due to the accumulation of fluid in the lung, massive bleeding, and organ involvement (liver, heart or nervous system) [
