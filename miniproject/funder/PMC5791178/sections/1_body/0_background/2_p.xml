<p id="Par11">DENV and ZIKV belong to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, whereas CHIKV belongs to the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>. All of these viruses possess a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that encodes for both structural (forming part of the viral particle) and nonstructural (responsible for replication) proteins. The viral genome encodes three structural proteins, one of them being the envelope protein (E), which is the main inducer of neutralizing antibodies and is therefore responsible for classifying the virus into four serotypes: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 [
