<p id="Par24">The data were entered into a database in Excel. Subsequently, a descriptive analysis was performed of the included variables, estimating the measurements of frequency, central tendency, and dispersion for the quantitative variables and proportions for the qualitative variables.

Comparisons between groups were performed using tests for parametric or nonparametric data according to the analysis of normality (Shapiro-Wilk normality test). The proportions were compared using the Chi-squared test. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism® 7.01 for Windows™ (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In all cases, a
