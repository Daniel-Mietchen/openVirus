<p id="Par18">All of the samples were subjected to RNA extraction with the Qiagen extraction kit (QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of RNA was determined by spectrophotometric analysis in a NanoDrop® 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific®), and the quantified RNA was stored at − 70 °C until its use. The cDNA synthesis was performed with the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific®) following the manufacturer’s instructions, using a minimum of 0.5 μg of RNA and random primers for the retrotranscription. The cDNA was stored at − 70 °C until its use.</p>
