<p id="Par20">The samples that were positive for DENV by conventional PCR were processed for serotype identification by a multiplex PCR technique described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Similarly, the Maxima® Hot Start Green PCR Master Mix (2X) enzyme (Thermo Scientific®) was used with 10 μmol of each of the following primers: MD1 (F-5’-TCA ATA TGC TGA AAC GCG AGA GAA ACC G-3′), rTS1 (F-5’-CCC GTA ACA CTT TGA TCG CT-3′), mTS2 (F-5’-CGC CAC AAG GGC CAT GAA CAG TTT-3′), TS3 (F-5′-TAA CAT GAG ACA GAG C-3′), and rTS4 (F-5’-TTC TCC CGT TCA GGA TGT TC-3′) and 2 μl of the cDNA from each of the samples. These primers amplify regions present in the gene that encode for the C-prM protein; the sizes expected for each amplified region were 208 bp (DENV-1), 119 bp (DENV-2), 288 bp (DENV-3), and 260 bp (DENV-4). The thermal profile for the amplification was the same as that described for the conventional PCR of DENV. To perform PCR we used ProFlex 3 × 32-well PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific ®). The products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel stained with SYBR® Safe (Thermo Scientific®) under ultraviolet light using the MiniBIS® (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems) gel photo documentation system.
