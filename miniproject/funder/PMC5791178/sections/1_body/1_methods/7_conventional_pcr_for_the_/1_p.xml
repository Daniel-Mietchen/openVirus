<p id="Par21">A conventional PCR was also performed for the detection of the CHIKV genome. The Chik-1 (F-5′-TAA TGC TGA ACT CGG GGA CC-3′) and cChik-4 (F-5’-ACC TGC CAC ACC CAC CAT CGAC-3′) primers were used to amplify a region of the gene that encodes for the E protein, which has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The amplification was performed with the Maxima® Hot Start Green PCR Master Mix (2X) enzyme (Thermo Scientific®) using 10 μmol of each primer equally and 2 μl of the cDNA from each sample. The amplification conditions included the initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C (5 s), 64 °C (45 s), and 72 °C (30 s), with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. To perform PCR we used ProFlex 3 × 32-well PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific ®). The products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel using SYBR® Safe (Thermo Scientific®) in the MiniBIS® (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems) gel photo documentation system. The expected size of the PCR products was 427 bp. As positive control of CHIKV we used supernatants of culture infected with a clinical isolate [
