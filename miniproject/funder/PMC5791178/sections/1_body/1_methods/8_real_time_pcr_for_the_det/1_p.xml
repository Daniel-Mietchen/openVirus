<p id="Par22">Real-time PCR was used for the identification of ZIKV. The ZIKV1086 (F-5’-CCG CTG CCC AAC ACA AG-3′) and ZIKV1162c (F-5’-CCA CTA ACG TTC TTT TGC AGA CAT-3′) primers and the ZIKV1107-FAM (5’-FAM-AGC CTA CCT TGA CAA GCA GTC AGA CAC TCA A-3′) probe described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used. The amplification was performed with the Taqman® Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) system, for which 5 μmol of each primer, 2.5 μmol of the ZIKV1107-FAM probe, and 2 μl of the cDNA from each sample were used. The amplification conditions were as follows: activation for 2 min at 50 °C and initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles at 95 °C (15 s) and 60 °C (60 s). To perform the real-time PCR we used the QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific ®) and the cut-off Ct value was ≤39 based on different criteria, among which are CDC interpretation criteria, considering a specimen positive if primer sets showed amplification with cycle threshold (CT) values ≤38.5 [
