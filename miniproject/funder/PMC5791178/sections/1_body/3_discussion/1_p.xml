<p id="Par31">Our results regarding the simultaneous co-circulation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV and their co-infections clearly demonstrate the critical epidemiological situation in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and the increasing need to perform differential diagnosis in patients with acute febrile syndrome. All of the patients involved in our study met the basic criteria for dengue or acute febrile illness (temperature ≥ 37.8 °C for less than seven days; articular, retroocular, and/or extremities pain; rash; hemorrhage) [

Acute febrile syndrome is a common feature of several infections endemic arbovirus countries and although Dengue in the most common cause of “Febrile Syndrome” in Colombia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], viral (influenza virus, hepatitis A virus, B and C, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Mayaro virus and Hantavirus) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] or parasitic (Plasmodium vivax, P. falciparum) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], could be the cause for 47.78% of acute febrile syndromes. In ongoing studies we are using multiple approaches to try to explain and to reveal the etiological agent for those cases (data not shown). On the other hand, we believe that false negative results are less likely because all the participants enrolled had to be in acute stage of the disease, that is to say, fever no more than 7 days. Moreover, the samples were stored at the adequate temperature (− 70 °C) and the quality of RNA was confirmed by the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm (measured by spectrophotometry), being in all cases &gt; 2.0.
