<p id="Par37">Although it is not currently possible to speak of susceptibility by gender, our results are in complete agreement with various studies showing that the ratio of cases between women/men is generally at a ratio of 2/1 or 3/1 in DENV, CHIKV, or ZIKV infections. This relationship has been previously reported in Colombia for DENV infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], during the CHIKV outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and recently for ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as well as being previously reported internationally during other events, both endemic in the case of DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and epidemic in the case of CHIKV and ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This difference in the presentation of infection in women could be the result of socio-cultural practices that lead to greater medical consultation by women or more actual risk associated with the domestic behaviors of women and the domestic behavior of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], which favor an increased risk of exposure.
