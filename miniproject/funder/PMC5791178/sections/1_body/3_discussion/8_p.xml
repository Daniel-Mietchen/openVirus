<p id="Par38">Importantly, our study also found a higher prevalence of infection by ZIKV among women aged 20–40 years than has been reported for the rest of the country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and for other countries in the region during the current outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Taking into account the possible adverse effects associated with infection by ZIKV during pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], it is important to focus on prevention efforts in this age group to reduce unwanted pregnancies and to increase surveillance of such adverse events in pregnant women infected with ZIKV and their babies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].
