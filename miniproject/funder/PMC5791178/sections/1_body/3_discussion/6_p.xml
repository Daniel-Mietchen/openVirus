<p id="Par36">Our sampling began in the month of August 2015, a time period in which the entry of ZIKV into Colombia had not yet been reported. According to reports from the National Institute of Health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the first cases of ZIKV that were identified in our study occurred in the month of November 2015. The prevalence of ZIKV was found to reach 18.47%, with an attack rate of 36 cases/100,000 inhabitants, which is considerably lower than that reported for the entire department of Norte de Santander of 655 cases/100,000 inhabitants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Notably, the official data represent the total number of patients diagnosed for a clinical picture compatible with infection by ZIKV whereas our results present the number of laboratory-confirmed cases, which typically are presented in lesser number [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These differences are a result of the difficulties in the molecular diagnosis of ZIKV because of the low viral loads present in the serum of patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In agreement with the findings reported, in our study, the amplification “threshold cycle” of the qPCR was greater than 29.09.
