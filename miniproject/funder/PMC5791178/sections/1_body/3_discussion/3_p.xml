<p id="Par33">The prevalence of DENV in the population evaluated was 21.02%, with an attack rate of 41 cases per 100,000 population. These data are in stark contrast with other studies conducted in the country that have reported the presence of DENV in approximately 30% of patients with febrile syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and a cumulative incidence of cases ranging between 36.5 and 268.7 cases/100,000 inhabitants in different regions of Colombia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This low DENV detection rate can be explained by an increase in the number of cases of the other arboviruses studied, as it has been previously reported in India, where the prevalence of DENV decreased with the increase in cases of CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].
