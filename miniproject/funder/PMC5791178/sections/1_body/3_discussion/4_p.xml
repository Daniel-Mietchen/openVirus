<p id="Par34">As could be seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, there is an age-related decline in DENV disease. This phenomenon has been widely reported for Colombia with the highest incidence in individuals 5–14 years of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This epidemiological behavior could be explained by the high endemicity of the country, on which individuals acquires DENV Infection at young age with the subsequent immunity. For example, in Medellín (City located in a central region of Colombia) the 70% of the younger people (up to 21 years old) have antibodies against DENV due to primary infections acquired in childhood [

This same endemic epidemiological status could be expected in the next years for CHIKV and ZIKV in several Colombian municipalities due to the similarity of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV transmission cycle which bring on the possibility of endemic establishment of those arboviruses [
