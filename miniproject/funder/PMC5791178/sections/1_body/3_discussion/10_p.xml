<p id="Par40">The co-circulation of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV is a chance occurrence that has triggered alarms in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world, not only because of the difficulty of making an accurate clinical diagnosis, but because of the potential epidemiological effects of co-infections. Although some cases of co-infection among these arboviruses have recently been reported in Colombia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], our study is the first cross-sectional study that demonstrates the extent of the co-circulation and the possibilities of co-infection of these three arboviruses in Colombia, demonstrating that although there is an apparent dominance of infection by Chikungunya, the three agents co-circulate simultaneously in the evaluated region. A similar context has been previously described in India, where the simultaneous co-circulation of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV was demonstrated in equal proportions during 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and subsequently during 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], eliminating the possibility of displacement of any of the viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], as has been shown between different genotypes of DENV, both in the Americas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and in Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].
