<p id="Par42">The co-circulation and co-infection of these arboviruses has particular importance when one considers that diseases such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), which has an autoimmune component, are usually triggered by an infectious process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. GBS has been associated with infection by DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], CHIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], and ZIKV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] in our country, which could increase the risk of developing the syndrome, the mortality rates, and epidemiological complications. Notably, recent publications with clinical and histopathologic evidence of patients co-infected with DENV/CHIKV demonstrate that there may be an association between mortality and co-infection with these arboviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]; moreover, recent articles have demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, antibody-dependent potentiation in patients with anti-DENV antibodies who acquire the ZIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] or vice versa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].
