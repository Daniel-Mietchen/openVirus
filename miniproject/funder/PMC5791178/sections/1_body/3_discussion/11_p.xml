<p id="Par41">The reported prevalence of DENV/CHIKV co-infection varied from very low (2.8%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] to more than 10% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], which is consistent with the findings in our study (7.64%). However, although there are very few studies that present the prevalence of DENV/ZIKV or CHIKV/ZIKV co-infections, our results demonstrate a higher prevalence of DENV/ZIKV co-infection (6.37%) than that reported in Pernambuco, Brazil (2.6%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or in Nicaragua (1.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] and a lower prevalence of CHIKV/ZIKV co-infection (5.10%) than that recently reported in Bahia, Brazil (13.3%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but a similar prevalence of CHIKV/ZIKV to that reported in Nicaragua (4.6%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Finally, this is the first study that reports the prevalence of triple co-infection (1.9%) in South America, but the result is consistent with the recently reported prevalence in Central America (1.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].
