<p id="Par32">As it can be observed in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, there was in increase in cases from December through February. This increase can be due to the arrival of ZIKV to Colombia, because the first case was reported in October 2015 and the higher peak of the outbreak was observed from December through February [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Moreover, the increase too can be due to those months which coincide with holiday season in Colombia when the people who live in regions with low temperature (where there is not presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>) move to regions with higher temperature (with presence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>), increasing the possibilities of transmission of infection.
