<p id="Par30">The analysis of the sequences performed using BLAST and the on-line DENV, ZIKV &amp; CHIKV typing tool confirmed the circulation of the Asian/American genotype of DENV-2 with a homology of 99% with strains of DENV-2 previously reported in the region of Norte de Santander during 2005 (GQ868556). For DENV-3, the presence of genotype III displayed a 99% homology with strains previously reported in the north of Venezuela in 2007 (FJ898474). For DENV-1, the circulation of genotype V displayed a 98% homology with strains of DENV-1 previously reported in Colombia in 2008 (Santander - GQ868570) and in the Department of Sucre in 2009 (HM635907). The sequencing of CHIKV amplicons confirmed the presence of the Asian strain in Colombia and showed a 99% homology to different sequences previously reported from Colombia (KX496989, KU518343), Haiti (KX702402), Brazil (KU355832), Mexico (KT247385) and other countries from the Caribbean and Latin America.
