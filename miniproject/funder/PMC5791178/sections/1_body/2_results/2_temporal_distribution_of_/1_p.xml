<p id="Par27">As mentioned above, the samples were collected over a period of nine months; the highest number of cases (70.7%) during this period occurred between December 2015 and February 2016 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For DENV, two peaks were evident: a smaller peak between the months of September and October 2015 (18.2% of the total cases of dengue) and a higher peak between the months of December 2015 and February 2016 (81.8% of the total cases). CHIKV displayed different behavior, with cases more evenly dispersed throughout a large part of the period under review (September 2015 to February 2016). Finally, the first cases of ZIKV were confirmed beginning in December 2015, and a number of cases continued to be sustained until the end of the period evaluated.
