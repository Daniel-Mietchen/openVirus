<p id="Par28">The prevalence for DENV in the cohort of patients studied was 21.02% (95% CI: 14.65–27.39), which was confirmed by conventional PCR and real-time PCR; an attack rate of 40.99 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was also reported. The results of the serotyping by multiplex PCR showed that 30 samples (90.9%) belonged to DENV-2, two samples (6.1%) to DENV-1, and one sample (3.0%) to DENV-3. The mean age range of the infected population was 21.09 years (SEM 2.04), and women (72.7%) were more affected than men. The prevalence of CHIKV was 29.94% (95% CI: 22.77–37.10), which was confirmed by conventional PCR and sequencing; this corresponded to an attack rate of 58.38 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The mean age of the infected population was 21.09 years (SEM 2.34), and again the most affected population was women, with 59.6% of the positive cases occurring in women. Finally, the prevalence of ZIKV, confirmed by real-time PCR, was 18.47% (95% CI: 12.40–24.54), corresponding to an attack rate of 36.02 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Again, the population most affected was women (86.2%), but in contrast to what was found for DENV and CHIKV, the average age of the infected ZIKV population was statistically higher, with a mean of 29.72 years (SEM 2.09). The consolidated results of these analyses are shown in Table
