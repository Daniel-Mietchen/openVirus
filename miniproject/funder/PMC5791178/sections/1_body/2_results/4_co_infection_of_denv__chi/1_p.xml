<p id="Par29">In addition to the co-circulation of the three studied arboviruses, co-infection was also found among them. The prevalence of DENV/CHIKV co-infection was 7.64% (95% CI: 3.49–11.80), that of DENV/ZIKV was 6.37% (95% CI: 2.55–10.19), and that of CHIKV/ZIKV was 5.10% (95% CI: 1.66–8.54), with attack rates of 14.90, 12.42, and 9.93 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. Furthermore, three patients were found co-infected with all three viruses (prevalence of 1.91%; 95% CI: 0.00–4.05), corresponding to an attack rate of 4.96 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The mean age of the patients co-infected with either DENV/CHIKV, DENV/ZIKV, or CHIKV/ZIKV was 23.17 (SEM 4.57), 26.50 (SEM 2.35), and 30.13 (SEM 2.91) years, respectively, and that of the patients with the triple infection was 29.72 years (SEM 2.09). Except for the cases of DENV/CHIKV co-infection (in which both men and women were equally affected), women were more affected than men (with higher percentages reaching up to 87.5%). The consolidated results are shown in Table
