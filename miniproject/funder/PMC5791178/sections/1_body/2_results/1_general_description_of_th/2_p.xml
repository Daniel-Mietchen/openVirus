<p id="Par26">Of the 157 patients involved in the study, 82 (52.2%) were positive for one or more of the arboviruses studied and 75 (47.8%) were negative. The mean age of the patients who were negative was 19.91 years (SEM ± 1.69 years), and that of the patients with confirmed infection was 22.6 years (SEM ± 1.62 years). In the group of positive patients, 25 (30.5%) were men and 57 (69.5%) were women, whereas in the group of negative patients, 29 (38.7%) were men and 46 (61.3%) were women, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The age group with the highest percentage of infection by one or more of the arboviruses evaluated was adults between 20 and 30 years old (28.0%), followed by children less than 10 years old (26.8%) and juveniles up to 20 years old (19.5%). Finally, the least affected groups were adults older than 30 years (Table
