generalized. In the late 1980&#x02019;s and early 1990&#x02019;s, Uganda experienced a sharp
increase in the incidence of HIV cases, but due to several concerted prevention
efforts, followed by behavior change, HIV incidence reduced significantly [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2000, Uganda became the first country in
sub Saharan Africa to register success in reducing number of new cases of HIV [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the fortunes
reversed and subsequent studies started to show that HIV incidence was no longer
falling [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. More recent
studies now show the incidence is in fact very high in some groups such as fishing
populations [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0211084.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which spills over into the
general population [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The
factors responsible for this negative trend are poorly understood.</p><p>The potential reasons for this resurgence in HIV incidence may due to structural
factors and drivers, which are typically not amenable to individual level
interventions [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Structural
factors and drivers for HIV may be collectively defined as elements, other than
knowledge or awareness that influence risk and vulnerability to HIV infection,
though drivers specifically refer to a situation where an empirical association
within a target group has been established [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There is evidence that levels of knowledge
on HIV are generally high among countries with high HIV burden, but despite this,
structural factors, which are complex and entrenched in the moral, social and
cultural fabric of society strongly influence sexual behavior [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], often disregarding associated risk of HIV
acquisition. These structural drivers and factors have also been broadly defined by
some authors as &#x0201c;core social processes and arrangements, reflective of social and
cultural norms, values, networks, structures and institutions&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Uganda has had several
years of HIV prevention programs, however anecdotal evidence suggests structural
drivers and factors for HIV transmission have persisted.</p><p>Widow cleansing and inheritance [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and
stigma [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0211084.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been well documented
as drivers for HIV transmission While these and other drivers are well known, it is
not clear if they have persisted and may therefore be potentially responsible for
the rise in incidence of HIV in Uganda. In this regard, they have not been well
characterized in this resurgence of the epidemic. More studies need to be done to
identify and characterize these factors and drivers, and inform the design HIV
prevention approaches that target them. Typically, these factors are difficult to
tackle, require wider scale community engagement. Interventions at individual level
in this instance may not be beneficial, and instead more complex approaches to
delivering interventions are required. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these
factors is important.</p><p>To design interventions targeting these structural factors, researchers and policy
makers also need to understand the challenges faced in addressing these drivers. The
information will be used to design culturally sensitive interventions. Therefore,
the aim of this study was to determine the structural drivers of HIV transmission in
rural Uganda and the potential challenges in addressing these drivers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Data collection</title><p>Uganda has a total of 127 districts. We conducted a total of 35 focus group
discussions (FGDs) in 11 districts in northern, eastern and central regions of
the country, which cover 101 districts. Data were collected in the eleven
districts that were implementing the Strengthening Civil Society for Improved
HIV/AIDS (SCIPHA) and Orphans and Vulnerable children (OVC) service delivery
project. We designed an FGD guide to identify structural drivers of the HIV
epidemic, but also to explore the extent of the already known factors. The FGDs
comprised of 8&#x02013;12 community members and leaders, who were considered to have
some knowledge on societal issues related to HIV prevention and transmission. We
recruited and trained a team of 10 research assistants to collect the data. They
received 5 days of training to harmonize the methods and this included role
plays. We needed a large number of RAs in order to take care of the diversity in
languages spoken in the 3 regions where data were collected. The RAs had prior
experience in qualitative data collection and had a Bachelor&#x02019;s degree in
Humanities related subject. The FGD guides were then pilot tested in mock FGDs
and revised to remove the ambiguous questions.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Selection of participants</title><p>The FGDs were organized to include wide community member representation and
comprised men and women including local council leaders, opinion leaders, civil
servants such as teachers and police officers, shop keepers, elders and village
residents. Research assistants made contact with local village leaders namely
village chairpersons, community health workers and local government officials
who were asked to assist select potential study participants who were
knowledgeable community members. We targeted a wide variety of respondents to
avoid bias and obtain varied opinions. The research assistants made appointments
for the FGDs to be conducted at a local meeting point such as classroom or
community center. The FGDs were conducted in English and the area local
language, English for the educated participants (civil servants, teachers,
police officers among others) and local language among less or non-educated
community members and village residents. On average, the FGDs lasted one hour.
Transport reimbursement of the equivalent of 3 USD was given to the
participants. The transcripts conducted in local language were translated into
English.</p><p>The Joint Clinical Research Center implemented the SCIPHA project with funding
from Civil Society Fund. The SCIPHA was a 5-year project designed to increase
access and utilization of HIV/AIDS care, treatment and support services and at
the same time build capacity for Civil Society Organizations to deliver quality
HIV prevention, care and treatment services. The 11 districts were selected from
northern and central Uganda because these two regions had the highest prevalence
of HIV in the Uganda AIDS Indicator survey [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In central Uganda the districts were
Kalangala, Mpigi, Mityana, Kiboga, and in northern Uganda they were Gulu, Lira,
Amolatar, Katakwi, Moyo, Arua and Nebbi. As part of program implementation,
qualitative data were collected to inform project activities.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using thematic approach [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, the methodology involves both
deductive and inductive methods to generate and clarify themes, and finally
summarize them in a thematic map. To achieve this, audio recordings from the
FGDs were transcribed and read carefully, back and forth. Data were analyzed
manually. Texts were coded using a scheme that was prepared ahead of time. We
anticipated results to fall into three broad themes of gender issues,
socio-cultural and economic factors. However, emerging themes were allowed and
we included attitude as a new theme. The emergence of the themes was allowed to
let the data inform the analysis. The emergent codes included mobile phone,
internet and social media, television, condom beliefs, migration and
urbanization. Our study conduct and reporting of results are in compliance with
the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research or COREQ [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Study participants provided written informed consent and were assured the
information provided was confidential. For those who were not able to read and
or write, the consent form was read to them and they affirmed their
participation with a thumb print The study was submitted and approved by the
Joint Clinical Research Center Institutional Review Board and Uganda National
Council of Science and Technology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><p>From our findings, we first, present the structural drivers of HIV and these were
divided into three categories: Gender issues, socio-cultural, and economic drivers.
The fourth theme, attitudes and beliefs was considered as an individual level
factor. The gender issues identified were domestic violence, male involvement in
health care seeking and fertility issues. The socio-cultural drivers identified were
widow inheritance, funeral practices, traditional medical and circumcision
practices, stigma, discrimination, and mobile phone and internet use. The economic
drivers included unemployment and economic strife, and lastly migration and
urbanization. The individual factors include attitudes, beliefs and alcohol
consumption. We also present the motivation for engagement in these structural
drivers. These have been summarized and presented in a conceptual diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211084.g001">Fig 1</xref> below:</p><fig id="pone.0211084.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0211084.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Conceptual framework to explain the traditional and emerging structural

epidemic by FGD participants. Participants explained that whenever there is
a misunderstanding or domestic fights within the marital union, the male
partners leave the home to find new partners. Participants also mentioned
that women in abusive relationships are not able to negotiate the use of
condoms with their partners for fear of being abused further, are not able
to seek HIV services such as HIV testing, as one participant mentioned;
&#x0201c;<italic>You cannot ask your husband to go for an HIV test or use a
condom with you when you just had a fight</italic>. <italic>He will
become even more suspicious and end up beating you more</italic>&#x02026;&#x0201d;
FGD-22, female participant Katakwi district</p><p>Some participants attributed the problem of domestic violence to dowry and
bride price stating that some women felt trapped when the relationship
turned sour and were not able to leave because of the bride price that had
been paid to their families.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Male involvement in health care seeking</title><p>Women commonly seek permission from their husbands before they can access
health care. FGD participants mentioned that when some men discover they are
HIV positive, they prevent their wives from seeking HIV testing services or
even go for services for the prevention of mother to child transmission of
HIV for fear of their HIV status being discovered. As one participant
mentioned; &#x0201c;<italic>I think they (men) fear that if the woman tests HIV

woman loses her husband, the family allows the woman to select a new husband
from among the brothers or relatives of the deceased or the family selects
one of the relatives of the deceased to inherit the widow as their wife.
When the family selects the husband to inherit the widow, the selection is
done without consideration of the age differences. In our study districts,
the practice was described as common in northern Uganda and west Nile
region. Among the <italic>Acholi</italic> in northern Uganda, it is referred
to as &#x0201c;<italic>Lako dako</italic>&#x0201d; and among the <italic>Lugbara</italic> in
west Nile region, it referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>Okoviza</italic>&#x0201d; which can be
literally translated as &#x0201c;bringing the widow back into the clan&#x0201d;. The
inheritance typically proceeds without knowledge of the HIV status of the
deceased husband or wife or even that of the new husband and therefore poses
a risk of HIV transmission within the new partnership. FGD participant,

family but also is done to maintain the family line because
&#x02026;</italic>.<italic>the new husband will take care of the wife and
children of the deceased&#x0201d;</italic>. FGD-28 Male participant, Arua,
West Nile</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Funeral practices</title><p>Following the death of a family member, several African tribes perform a
ritual referred to as the last funeral rites to install a successor to the
deceased. In Northern Uganda, this is referred to as &#x0201c;<italic>guro
lyel</italic>&#x0201d;. The family of the deceased and the clan organize the
function in memory of deceased member or members who have passed on during a
given period of say two years. The function is organized to call the spirit
of the dead back so they restore their homes &#x0201c;<italic>iwongo tipu</italic>&#x0201d;,
to bring hope, happiness, peace and also seeking for the spirits
intervention in times of sickness and material need.</p><p>The belief is that failure to hold this ceremony, the spirits of the dead
will strike back and will manifest as family misfortune such as more deaths
and poor harvests. During these ceremonies, local tents
(<italic>bolo</italic>) partitioned into small rooms to accommodate
visitors are constructed. It is custom that a child should be conceived
during this ceremony to replace the dead. The <italic>bolo</italic> are
designed to facilitate sexual intercourse by both youth and adults, some
meeting for the first time, and in the process, exposing persons to risk of
HIV acquisition.</p><p>In central Uganda, the Baganda, a majority tribe has a ritual
&#x0201c;<italic>Okwalula abalongo</italic>&#x0201d; performed following the birth of
twins, literally translated as &#x02018;raising the twins&#x02019;. The ceremony brings
together relatives of the parents of the twins to celebrate the birth but
also verify paternity. Participants in the FGDs indicated the ceremony may
expose attendees to the risk of acquiring HIV.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>They engage in celebration including performance of sexually
provocative dances and sing obscene songs</italic>. <italic>The
ceremonies are private and often involve having sexual intercourse

district</p></disp-quote><p>In central Uganda, the FGD participants attribute the HIV epidemic to the
breakdown of the cultural traditions and family ties. For instance,
participants mentioned that young girls were taught good moral behaviors by
their aunties or &#x0201c;<italic>Ssengas</italic>&#x0201d; but currently this practice has
become less common. The young girls are not amenable to this advice because
they do not consider it modern enough to fit the current trendy life style
they lead.</p><p>In the same vein, participants mentioned the traditional family structure has
broken down in several communities because of orphan hood from death of
parents due to HIV leading to child headed households. Participants agreed
that previously the larger family or clan would take care of the young
family, but this seems to have changed because the traditional structures
have been stretched. They mentioned that children now have to fend for
themselves when their parents die often exposing the children to HIV:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>The eldest of the children takes responsibility of their

to delivery and child birth in rural areas. Mothers trust the TBAs as they
are members of the local community and are well known to them. However, FGD
participants observed some shortcomings with the practice of some TBAs which
involve use of non-sterilized equipment which may result in HIV
transmission:</p><p>Tattooing is traditionally practiced by placing cuts on someone&#x02019;s body in
order to treat an illness. FGD participants mentioned that for example when
someone complains of headaches, cuts are placed on the forehead and the cuts
rubbed with local herbs. The same razor blades are used to place cuts on
more than one. Similarly, in the northern Uganda region, the practice of
removing milk teeth of young babies aged between 4 and 6 months, referred to
as &#x0201c;<italic>kwanyo gi-dog</italic>&#x0201d; is common. FGD participants mentioned
that there is a belief that if milk teeth are not removed, they cause severe
fever which may cause death. Communities have practitioners who perform
these procedures and use the same unsterilized instruments including crude
ones like sharp knives or bicycle spokes between patients.</p><p>Traditional medical practice also involves the use of local instruments,
often non-sterilized to remove an object from the throat, &#x0201c;<italic>gi
dwon</italic>&#x0201d;. It is done among children and the same equipment can be
applied to several children without sterilization. The practice of
witchcraft is widespread in the region according to reports from several
in-depth interviews and FGDs. They reported that several people go to witch
doctors in pursuit of wealth. For some women, their intention is to find
avenues for getting a rich husband. The participants reported that witch
doctors take advantage of their clients and make claims that remedies for
their problems can only be delivered through sexual intercourse:</p><p>Participants believe some of these witch doctors may be responsible for a
significant number of HIV infections in the community. Participants also
mentioned that some witch doctors lure their HIV positive clients to stop
their antiretroviral therapy with promises of better treatment options.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;People with HIV abandon their drugs and go for herbs and when

entry in manhood. Mass circumcision of boys is conducted in traditional
ceremonies and accompanying rituals are performed to initiate these boys
into manhood. Participants were concerned that these ceremonies,
<italic>imbalu</italic>, are accompanied by mass celebration which
includes a lot of casual sexual contact among the attendees. Participants
also stated that following circumcision, the boys are forced to perform some
acts that may increase their risk for acquiring HIV infection.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;In Gishu culture</italic>, <italic>after circumcision</italic>,

living with HIV is still widespread. They mentioned that as a result of
this, that non-disclosure of HIV status is very common because of
uncertainty about effects of disclosing.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>In some communities</italic>, <italic>people fear to share
things like clothes</italic>, <italic>plates</italic>, <italic>cups

health workers known to them and would rather seek care from a far off
place, where they are not known. Study participants also mentioned that fear
of disclosure was affecting decision to initiate treatment and for those who
were already on treatment, their adherence was being affected by this
fear.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;Some patients hide their medicines when visitors come around

They mentioned that these in-laws are involved in their home affairs
especially when there is illness. Participants were concerned that the
mothers in-law ask a lot of questions about the health of their daughters
in-law especially following delivery, when they even come to stay with
them.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;There is no way a woman will swallow those medicines when the

participants agreed that these phones are being used to fuel high risk
sexual behavior. The phones make it easy for the youth to share pornographic
material, meet and have sex. The participants mentioned the youth now have
easy access to pornographic material and can be shared easily as one
participant mentioned:</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The students download pornographic movies onto their phones and

contributed in the influence of sexual behavior among young people. They
mentioned that some TV and radio programs provided information that was not
suitable for a young audience yet they were being aired during hours when
youth are listening or watching TV. The radio station invite sexually
experienced adult women (<italic>Sengas</italic>) to discuss these
topics.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>The Sengas discuss sexual matters openly</italic>,

and participants mentioned that poverty had caused youth to become desperate
and economically frustrated. Some youth will easily engage in commercial sex
work to make ends meet. In places with long distance truck drivers, such as
border towns, the respondents mentioned the number of commercial sex workers
(CSW) had also increased.</p><p>Similarly, in eastern Uganda, FGD participants mentioned that older women
recruit young girls into sex trade and act as middle men for the truckers.
The participants mentioned that commercial sex work is considered illegal
but seems to be on the increase as more people are getting drawn to the
practice. They mentioned that single mothers have been lured into sex work
in order to provide food and housing to their families and data indicated
that commercial sex workers are willing to take more risk if the client
offers more money.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>There is increased number of sex workers because of these [long

have sex with much older men and vice versa in search of a more comfortable

poverty, families having many children and not being able to provide for
them the basic needs.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>The young girls end up hooking older men and young boys with

participants cited examples of men who seek jobs away from home in fields
such as road construction and fishing. Discussants mentioned these men earn
money but are not able to spend it with their families, so they live a
reckless life.</p><p>There is rapid urbanization in Uganda with proliferation of trading centers
across rural areas of Uganda. Participants in the FGDs mentioned that rural
areas are getting exposed to events that were commonly reserved for urban
areas. For instance, discos and video halls are rapidly proliferating and
provide entertainment to rural dwellers. Respondents mentioned these provide
avenues for passing time but decried the potential repercussions.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;The karaoke discos are playing all the time and the videos show

presented to the public has changed drastically and the public now perceives
HIV as a less dangerous disease compared to before as one FGD participant
mentioned:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>In the 1980&#x02019;s the HIV messages on radio were very scaring and

changed and many persons with HIV/AIDS today do not look as sick as those
who were infected earlier in the epidemic as one participant mentioned:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;.<italic>the persons with HIV looked very scaring then and nobody

Nebbi district</p></disp-quote><p>In some situations, individuals are aware of the risks of HIV transmission,
but are not able to make the decision for safer sex because of certain
attitudes. For example, in some FGDs, discussants mentioned that men often
refuse to use condoms because of the attitude that sex using condoms is not
pleasurable. In the discussion, participants mentioned that these men will
have unprotected intercourse in high risk encounters like among commercial
sex workers under this pretext. As one participant stated;</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>To make the situation worse</italic>, <italic>they do not use
condoms when having sex [with sex workers] saying when one buys a
sweet</italic>, <italic>they do not lick it with the polythene
on</italic>&#x02026;&#x0201d; FGD-5, Male participant, Mpigi district.</p></disp-quote><p>Among the fishing communities, HIV prevention is even more complex because of
many other perceived competing risks. For instance, FGD participants
mentioned that at the end of every fish harvest, the fishermen celebrate to
mark the success. They buy alcohol and engage in sexual intercourse with
random partners. They consider the lake to be much more dangerous than HIV.
As one member pointed out;</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>They fear water more than HIV</italic>, <italic>[which] they
call a small organism that gives you a grace period to eat what you
have worked for and even prepare your will</italic>, <italic>but

eye</italic>&#x0201d; FGD-33, Male participant, Kalangala district</p></disp-quote><p>The fishing villages are dominated mostly by males, with women as a minority.
Study participants mentioned that there is competition for the fewer women
as sexual partners that it is very common for a woman to have multiple
sexual partners, creating a concurrent sexual partnership.</p><p>The FGDs revealed that among some tribes, there is resistance to the use of
condoms with the belief that certain sexual styles are not compatible with
use of condoms. The discussions also showed that in some communities, there
is a belief that having sexual intercourse with a person with disability
(PWD) brings blessings. This places PWD in a vulnerable position and
increases their risk for HIV.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Drug use and alcoholism</title><p>Most of the FGD participants agreed that alcohol consumption was very high
and is one of the potential drivers for HIV infection among youth, both
directly and indirectly. Alcohol is freely available and there are no
restrictions on access based on age category or opening and closing hours
for bars. Respondents mentioned that in the schools, both teachers and
students drink alcohol and end up in bars where they are exposed to high
risk sex, and as a respondent in northern Uganda mentioned, this may be
facilitated when schools are very close to bars and disco halls.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>But it is worse when the teacher comes to teach and he is
drunk</italic>, <italic>as pupils are caught up in laughter because

Participants mentioned the rampant use of other substances such as marijuana
and that it is common for motorcycle taxi (<italic>boda boda</italic>)
riders, who ride the motorcycles under the influence of these substances
lure or force their customers into having sex with them.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec029"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study has indicated that several structural factors and drivers of HIV exist in
rural Uganda, and are of a varied nature. These factors range from gender issues,
social cultural, traditional medicinal practices to economic factors. Our data
indicates these factors have persisted despite decades of HIV prevention. Some of
these factors have previously only been anecdotally reported. Our paper has explored
these traditional structural drivers but also sheds light on new ones that have
resulted from urbanization and modernization such as exposure to mobile phones and
the internet. These drivers are connected and intertwined in a complex web as
illustrated in our conceptual framework. However, they provide a basis for
integrated structural interventions, taking into consideration traditional HIV
prevention, care, treatment issues. Our paper also makes recommendations useful for
the design of these new interventions that may form the core of the next generation
of HIV prevention programming in order to achieve an HIV/AIDS free generation.</p><p>Our data shows significant homogeneity across the country in terms of drivers.
Regardless of the region, the factors that influence HIV appear to be the same.
Previously, other studies have documented structural factors and drivers of HIV
infection and results indicate some homogeneity and heterogeneity within and between
communities, tribes and countries among these drivers [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0211084.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Our study also shows the same in
comparison to these studies. For instance, while as transactional sex was common in
our study and several others, there are some peculiar practices such as
&#x0201c;<italic>kusomboka</italic>&#x0201d; or death cleansing which includes unprotected
sexual intercourse with a corpse which have been reported only in Tanzania[<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This finding implies that
design of interventions will require an understanding of the local drivers.</p><p>Our study also reveals the factors have a highly gendered stratification placing
women at a disproportionately higher risk for HIV infection compared to men. For
instance, in our data collection, women were reported as more likely to face higher
risk for HIV infection in situations of domestic violence, widow inheritance, last
funeral rites and traditional medical practices to treat female infertility. In
India, illiteracy of the woman and early marriage have been shown to be major
drivers of HIV infection in a multi state study in the south of the country [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In our study, participants indicated that stigmatization of HIV patients was still
common. The results on stigma have been conflicting. Some participants mentioned the
availability of treatment had &#x02018;normalized&#x02019; the disease to appear as any other. The
data suggesting a reduction in stigma agree with those from a recent study in Uganda
which showed there has been a reduction in stigma due to availability of ART[<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], however in this study, the
structural drivers of stigmatization such as gender inequalities were still common
and were a barrier to elimination of stigma. Another recent study in rural Uganda
[<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] has shown stigma may
persist despite availability of antiretroviral therapy, signifying stigma remains a
structural barrier to deal with.</p><p>Commercial sex work was mentioned as a common practice and was largely driven by
economics. A recent study in Malawi [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed the structural drivers of commercial sex work among young
adults were deprivation of food, housing and a desire for trendy items like clothing
and cellular phones. The participants in our study mentioned these same factors
drive young single mothers into commercial sex work. Although not mentioned in our
FGDs, other studies have found young people are also at risk for coercive sex if
they are from materially deprived households [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Several other studies across Africa [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have also showed a relationship between
material deprivation and high risk sexual behavior. Interventions for HIV prevention
among vulnerable groups should also include programs for economic empowerment and
job creation to reduce material deprivation and unemployment. As other authors have
suggested, an integrated approach to HIV prevention incorporating gender and
development programs is a necessity [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>Mobility and migration have been identified as structural drivers for HIV
transmission in Tanzania [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]
among a fishing population and in Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], among the youth. In our study, significant
mobility was noted among the fisher folk. Similar to the Tanzania study, our
findings among a fishing population indicate the same finding. Mobility is difficult
to tackle as a driver, but studies may be conducted to understand the socio-economic
factors that influence mobility, and prioritize those amenable to interventions for
action.</p><p>Interventions with the participation of local entities like local governments,
traditional and cultural leaders should be designed to target these structural
drivers. Studies need to be done to rigorously test feasible and promising
interventions such as one to keep adolescent girls in school in India [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], Safe Homes and Respect for
Everyone (SHARE) project in Uganda, a intervention against domestic violence which
has shown a reduction in physical and sexual intimate partner violence and a
corresponding reduction in HIV incidence [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0211084.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another such project, SASA!, also in
Uganda showed community level interventions can result in reduction of intimate
partner violence, high risk sexual behaviors and strengthening community based
structures to enhance these changes [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Evidence to suggest that structural interventions may be the solution has also been
observed in rural Uganda, where reduction in HIV incidence among adolescent girls
was attributed to increase enrollment in school [<xref rid="pone.0211084.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Such interventions will need to be scaled
up to realize sustained decreases in HIV incidence.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusion and recommendation</title><p>In conclusion, our study has outlined several structural drivers that have for long
been anecdotal, but also verifies other well-known drivers. Our data indicates these
drivers have persisted in the communities despite decades of HIV prevention. Many of
these drivers are very complex and intimately intertwined with cultural heritage and
local traditions and need to be tackled cautiously with knowledge of the modern and
promising interventions. Interventions need to be designed so they are cross cutting
given the broad range of drivers that our analysis has identified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0211084.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>COREQ Checklist for structural drivers and factors for HIV epidemic in
