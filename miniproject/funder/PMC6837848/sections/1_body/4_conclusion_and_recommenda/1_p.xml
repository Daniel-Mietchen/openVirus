<p>In conclusion, our study has outlined several structural drivers that have for long been anecdotal, but also verifies other well-known drivers. Our data indicates these drivers have persisted in the communities despite decades of HIV prevention. Many of these drivers are very complex and intimately intertwined with cultural heritage and local traditions and need to be tackled cautiously with knowledge of the modern and promising interventions. Interventions need to be designed so they are cross cutting given the broad range of drivers that our analysis has identified.</p>
