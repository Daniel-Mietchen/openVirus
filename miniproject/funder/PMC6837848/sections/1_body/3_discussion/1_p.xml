<p>Our study has indicated that several structural factors and drivers of HIV exist in rural Uganda, and are of a varied nature. These factors range from gender issues, social cultural, traditional medicinal practices to economic factors. Our data indicates these factors have persisted despite decades of HIV prevention. Some of these factors have previously only been anecdotally reported. Our paper has explored these traditional structural drivers but also sheds light on new ones that have resulted from urbanization and modernization such as exposure to mobile phones and the internet. These drivers are connected and intertwined in a complex web as illustrated in our conceptual framework. However, they provide a basis for integrated structural interventions, taking into consideration traditional HIV prevention, care, treatment issues. Our paper also makes recommendations useful for the design of these new interventions that may form the core of the next generation of HIV prevention programming in order to achieve an HIV/AIDS free generation.</p>
