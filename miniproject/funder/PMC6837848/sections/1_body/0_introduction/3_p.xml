In this regard, they have not been well characterized in this resurgence of the epidemic. More studies need to be done to identify and characterize these factors and drivers, and inform the design HIV prevention approaches that target them. Typically, these factors are difficult to tackle, require wider scale community engagement. Interventions at individual level in this instance may not be beneficial, and instead more complex approaches to delivering interventions are required. Therefore, a thorough understanding of these factors is important.
