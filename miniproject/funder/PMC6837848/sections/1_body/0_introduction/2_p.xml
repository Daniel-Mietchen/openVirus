<p>The potential reasons for this resurgence in HIV incidence may due to structural factors and drivers, which are typically not amenable to individual level interventions [

Structural factors and drivers for HIV may be collectively defined as elements, other than knowledge or awareness that influence risk and vulnerability to HIV infection, though drivers specifically refer to a situation where an empirical association within a target group has been established [

There is evidence that levels of knowledge on HIV are generally high among countries with high HIV burden, but despite this, structural factors, which are complex and entrenched in the moral, social and cultural fabric of society strongly influence sexual behavior [

These structural drivers and factors have also been broadly defined by some authors as “core social processes and arrangements, reflective of social and cultural norms, values, networks, structures and institutions” [
