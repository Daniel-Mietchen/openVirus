<p>Widow inheritance is a common practice among some tribes in Uganda. When a woman loses her husband, the family allows the woman to select a new husband from among the brothers or relatives of the deceased or the family selects one of the relatives of the deceased to inherit the widow as their wife. When the family selects the husband to inherit the widow, the selection is done without consideration of the age differences. In our study districts, the practice was described as common in northern Uganda and west Nile region. Among the

 <italic>Okoviza</italic>” which can be literally translated as “bringing the widow back into the clan”. The inheritance typically proceeds without knowledge of the HIV status of the deceased husband or wife or even that of the new husband and therefore poses a risk of HIV transmission within the new partnership.
