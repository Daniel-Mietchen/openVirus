<p>Following the death of a family member, several African tribes perform a ritual referred to as the last funeral rites to install a successor to the deceased. In Northern Uganda, this is referred to as “
 <italic>guro lyel</italic>”. The family of the deceased and the clan organize the function in memory of deceased member or members who have passed on during a given period of say two years. The function is organized to call the spirit of the dead back so they restore their homes “
 <italic>iwongo tipu</italic>”, to bring hope, happiness, peace and also seeking for the spirits intervention in times of sickness and material need.
