<p>In central Uganda, the Baganda, a majority tribe has a ritual “
 <italic>Okwalula abalongo</italic>” performed following the birth of twins, literally translated as ‘raising the twins’. The ceremony brings together relatives of the parents of the twins to celebrate the birth but also verify paternity. Participants in the FGDs indicated the ceremony may expose attendees to the risk of acquiring HIV.
