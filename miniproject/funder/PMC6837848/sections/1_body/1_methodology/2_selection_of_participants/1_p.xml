<p>The FGDs were organized to include wide community member representation and comprised men and women including local council leaders, opinion leaders, civil servants such as teachers and police officers, shop keepers, elders and village residents. Research assistants made contact with local village leaders namely village chairpersons, community health workers and local government officials who were asked to assist select potential study participants who were knowledgeable community members. We targeted a wide variety of respondents to avoid bias and obtain varied opinions. The research assistants made appointments for the FGDs to be conducted at a local meeting point such as classroom or community center. The FGDs were conducted in English and the area local language, English for the educated participants (civil servants, teachers, police officers among others) and local language among less or non-educated community members and village residents. On average, the FGDs lasted one hour. Transport reimbursement of the equivalent of 3 USD was given to the participants. The transcripts conducted in local language were translated into English.</p>
