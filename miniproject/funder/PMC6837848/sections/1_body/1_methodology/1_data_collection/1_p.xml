<p>Uganda has a total of 127 districts. We conducted a total of 35 focus group discussions (FGDs) in 11 districts in northern, eastern and central regions of the country, which cover 101 districts. Data were collected in the eleven districts that were implementing the Strengthening Civil Society for Improved HIV/AIDS (SCIPHA) and Orphans and Vulnerable children (OVC) service delivery project. We designed an FGD guide to identify structural drivers of the HIV epidemic, but also to explore the extent of the already known factors. The FGDs comprised of 8–12 community members and leaders, who were considered to have some knowledge on societal issues related to HIV prevention and transmission. We recruited and trained a team of 10 research assistants to collect the data. They received 5 days of training to harmonize the methods and this included role plays. We needed a large number of RAs in order to take care of the diversity in languages spoken in the 3 regions where data were collected. The RAs had prior experience in qualitative data collection and had a Bachelor’s degree in Humanities related subject. The FGD guides were then pilot tested in mock FGDs and revised to remove the ambiguous questions.</p>
