  <meta-value>Data and transcripts are available on request, however, given the qualitative nature of the data, there are restrictions on the distribution. There are significant identifiers in the long transcripts of data including names of places and positions of persons, which renders it difficult to edit and share. Additional permission to access the data will be obtained from the research ethics committee at Joint Clinical Research Center. Please send an email to
