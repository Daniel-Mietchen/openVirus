  <title>Illustration of the effects of ART homophily on HIV exposure in a population.</title>
  <p>HIV-negative individuals appear in empty circles, while people living with HIV (PLWH) are represented by triangles. ART patients appear in blue triangles, whereas other (untreated) PLWH appear in red triangles. In panel A) the network is formed at random, in panel B) the network is formed based on ART homophily: all HIV-negative individuals are connected only to the one PLWH not on ART, and the 3 ART patients are connected together in an ART cluster.</p>
