  <title>Derivation of model equations and outcomes.</title>
  <p>The probability of HIV transmission per sex act when the HIV-positive partner is on ART (
   <italic>t</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>ART</italic>
   </sub>) can be derived from the incidence rate ratio (
   <italic>r</italic>) in serodiscordant couples on vs off ART. From the model equations, the population-level impact of ART on HIV incidence can be calculated, in the case of random mixing, as well as in the case of serosorting and ART clustering.
