  <title>The effect of ART homophily and serosorting on the population-level impact of ART on HIV incidence, by levels of HIV prevalence (
   <italic>h</italic>), fraction of PLWH who are aware of their HIV status (
   <italic>d</italic>) and intra-couple effectiveness of ART (
   <italic>r</italic>).
  </title>
  <p>Contour lines indicate the impact of ART on HIV incidence in the absence of ART clusters (
   <italic>m</italic> = 0). Color-coding indicates the modification factor of ART clusters: the factor by which the ART impact on HIV incidence increases (&gt; 1 in blue) or decreases (&lt; 1 in red) when comparing the case of 
   <italic>m</italic> = 1 to the case of 
   <italic>m</italic> = 0. For example, in the darkest blue areas, the impact of ART on HIV incidence is 50% greater in the presence of perfect ART homophily (
   <italic>m</italic> = 1) than it would have been if networks were formed without any ART homophily (
   <italic>m</italic> = 0). The uptake of ART among diagnosed PLWH (
   <italic>a</italic>) was fixed at 50% in all model scenarios shown.
