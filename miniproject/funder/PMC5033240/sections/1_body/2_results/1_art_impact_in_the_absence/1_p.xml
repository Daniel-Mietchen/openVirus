<p>In sexual networks without ART-homophily (
 <italic>m</italic> = 0), in our model, the impact of ART on HIV incidence only depends on the proportion of PLWH aware of their status (
 <italic>d</italic>), ART uptake (
 <italic>a</italic>) the intra-couple ART effectiveness (
 <italic>r</italic>), and the extent of serosorting among PLWH (
 <italic>n</italic>). The annual number of partners (
 <italic>p</italic>), the average number of unprotected sex acts per relationship (
 <italic>s</italic>) and the per sex act probability of HIV transmission (
 <italic>i</italic>) do not affect the impact of ART on HIV incidence in this model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This does not mean that these parameters do not influence HIV incidence. Indeed, HIV incidence increases with increasing values of 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>s</italic> and 
 <italic>i</italic>, but the relative change in HIV incidence when comparing scenarios with and without ART is unaffected. Henceforth, these parameters were not included in the multi-way analysis (
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Serosorting among PLWH reduces the impact of ART on HIV incidence. In particular, when 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, all the partnerships formed between HIV-negative people and PLWH are necessarily with undiagnosed PLWH. In this context, the impact of ART drops to zero.
