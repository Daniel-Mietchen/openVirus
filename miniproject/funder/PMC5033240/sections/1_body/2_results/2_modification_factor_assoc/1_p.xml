 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g004">Fig 4</xref> indicates that the modification factor associated with 
 <italic>m</italic>, i.e. the relative change in the impact of ART that results from the presence of ART homophily, depends on HIV prevalence (
 <italic>h</italic>), the fraction of PLWH aware of their status (
 <italic>d</italic>), and adherence to ART (
 <italic>r</italic>), but not on other model parameters. In particular, the modification factor appears largest in settings where adherence to ART is low. Changes in the prevalence of serosorting among PLWH, on the other hand, have no effects on the modification factor associated with ART homophily.
