<p>Analysis of the modelâ€™s equations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163159.s001">S1 File</xref>) suggests that ART clusters will weaken the prevention benefits of ART if the subpopulation of undiagnosed PLWH is larger than 
 <italic>r</italic> times the combined size of the subpopulations of HIV-negative people and undiagnosed PLWH. Conversely, ART clusters will augment the impact of ART on HIV incidence if the opposite is the case. The strongest synergistic effect of ART homophily on the impact of ART on HIV incidence is thus achieved when 
 <italic>r</italic> is very large, 
 <italic>h</italic> is small and 
 <italic>d</italic> is large, i.e. low ART adherence in a population with low HIV prevalence but a high fraction of PLWH being diagnosed. On the other hand, ART homophily can reduce the prevention benefits of ART if it occurs in a context of high HIV prevalence where not many PLWH are diagnosed (small 
 <italic>d</italic>), but treatment effectiveness is excellent (small 
 <italic>r</italic>).
