<p>In populations with HIV prevalence â‰ˆ 1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g005">Fig 5</xref>), ART homophily thus increases the impact of ART on HIV incidence relative to a baseline without ART-homophily for virtually all combinations of model parameters. ART homophily particularly improves the impact of ART on HIV incidence, however, if ART patients do not strictly adhere to treatment. For example, in settings with low ART adherence among ART patients (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.34), ART homophily increases the impact of ART on HIV incidence by close to 50%, regardless of other model parameters. On the other hand, if adherence is high (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.04), then ART homophily only increases the impact of ART by 10% relative to a situation in which networks are formed at random.
