<p>Similar results are obtained in populations with HIV prevalence ≈ 10%, but the potential effects of ART homophily on the population-level impact of ART vary more widely when HIV prevalence ≈ 35% (
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In such hyper-endemic populations, ART homophily may also improve the impact of ART on HIV incidence when adherence to ART is low. For example, in contexts with high proportions of PLWH aware of their infection, but low adherence to ART (upper right corner), then ART homophily increases the impact of ART by close to 50% relative to similar contexts in which networks would be formed at random with respect to ART status. On the other hand, if ART adherence is high, then the emergence of ART clusters can reduce the expected impact of ART on HIV incidence. For example, in populations where a limited proportion of PLWH are diagnosed, ART homophily may reduce the impact of ART by close to 25% (lower left corner).
