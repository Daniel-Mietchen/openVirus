 <italic>Values of model parameters</italic>: We considered three HIV prevalence levels (1%, 10% and 35%). The case where 
 <italic>h</italic> = 1% represents situations typical of concentrated epidemics, whereas 
 <italic>h</italic> = 35% represents situations common in certain demographic strata of hyperendemic settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Percentages of PLWH that are aware of their HIV status (
 <italic>d</italic>) and ART uptake among these diagnosed PLWH (
 <italic>a</italic>) ranged from 50% to 90% [
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], under the assumption of immediate, unconditional access to ART, as currently being piloted in TasP trials [
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The upper bounds for the ranges of 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic> in our model are also consistent with the new 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets for ART scale-up. The range of values for (
 <italic>r</italic>), i.e. the reduction in HIV incidence in serodiscordant couples associated with ART, was derived from a recent systematic review of prospective studies of the effect of ART on HIV transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contexts of high adherence to ART, the incidence of HIV in serodiscordant couples in which the PLWH is on ART, is reduced by 96% (i.e. 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.04) compared to similar couples in which the PLWH has not initiated ART. In contexts of low adherence to ART, the incidence of HIV in such serodiscordant couples is only reduced by 66% (i.e. 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.34). There are currently no quantitative data on the extent of serosorting in generalized epidemics in heterosexual networks, or on the level of ART homophily in sexual networks. We thus analyzed situations in which the parameters 
 <italic>n</italic> and 
 <italic>m</italic> vary between 0 (no homophily) and 1 (perfect homophily).
