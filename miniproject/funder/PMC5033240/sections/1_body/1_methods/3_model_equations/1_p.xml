<p>In serodiscordant couples, when the HIV-positive partner is not on ART, the per-partnership probability of HIV transmission, noted 
 <italic>t</italic>, is 1 − (1 − 
 <italic>i</italic>)
 <sup>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sup>. When the HIV-positive partner is on ART, this probability, noted 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ART</italic>
 </sub>, is reduced because of the factor 
 <italic>r</italic>. It is then equal to 1 − (1 − 
 <italic>i</italic>)
 <sup>
  <italic>rs</italic>
 </sup>. The rates at which HIV-negative people form relationships with diagnosed PLWH on and off ART are 
 <italic>phda</italic>(
 <italic>m</italic> − 1)(
 <italic>n</italic> − 1) and 
 <italic>phd</italic>(1 − 
 <italic>a</italic>)(1 − 
 <italic>n</italic>) respectively. The rates of relationship formation with other HIV-negatives and undiagnosed PLWH are proportional to the size of the populations of HIV-negatives and undiagnosed PLWH: 1 − 
 <italic>h</italic> and 
 <italic>h</italic>(1 − 
 <italic>d)</italic>, respectively. Taken together, these four rates sum to 
 <italic>p</italic>, the annual number of partners that individuals have in our model. The HIV incidence rate, 
 <italic>I</italic>, can then be calculated from these partner turnover rates and their associated per-partnership probabilities of HIV transmission (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163159.s001">S1 File</xref>). Lastly, the population-level impact of ART on HIV incidence, 
 <italic>I</italic>/
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>noART</italic>
 </sub> − 1, is defined as the relative change in the HIV incidence rate, associated with ART. In this formulation, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>noART</italic>
 </sub> is calculated as 
 <italic>I</italic> except that none of the PLWH are on ART (
 <italic>a</italic> = 0).
