<p>Model parameters include the population prevalence of HIV (noted 
 <italic>h</italic>), the fraction of PLWH who know that they are HIV-positive (
 <italic>d</italic>), the uptake of ART among diagnosed PLWH (
 <italic>a</italic>) and the reduction in HIV transmission associated with ART in serodiscordant couples (
 <italic>r</italic>). The coverage of ART, i.e. the proportion of PLWH who are on ART is defined as 
 <italic>da</italic>. We define 
 <italic>r</italic> as the HIV incidence in serodiscordant couples in which the infected partner has initiated ART divided by the HIV incidence among serodiscordant couples in which the infected partner has not initiated ART. It is thus an incidence rate ratio: the lower the value of 
 <italic>r</italic>, the larger the reduction in HIV incidence associated with ART in serodiscordant couples. The value of 
 <italic>r</italic> depends primarily on the extent to which the infected partner in the couple adheres to ART. The model also accounts for the average number of partners per time unit (
 <italic>p</italic>), the average number of unprotected sex acts per partnership (
 <italic>s</italic>), and the average HIV transmission probability per unprotected sex act (
 <italic>i</italic>).
