<p>The key parameters describing sexual networking patterns in this interacting population are 
 <italic>n</italic>, the degree of serosorting and 
 <italic>m</italic>, the degree of ART homophily. Both parameters vary between 0 and 1. When 
 <italic>n</italic> = 
 <italic>m</italic> = 0, relationships in the population are formed at random with respect to HIV status and ART status. This means that relationships between different population subgroups are formed proportionately to the prevalence of each of these subgroups in the population. When 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1 and 
 <italic>m</italic> = 0, diagnosed PLWH exclusively form partnerships with other diagnosed PLWH, but among those, PLWH on ART do not preferentially seek partners who are also on ART. Instead, partnerships between PLWH who are on and off ART are formed proportionately to the relative size of these groups. When 
 <italic>m</italic> = 1, ART patients exclusively form partnerships with other ART patients, resulting in the emergence of ART clusters that are separated from the rest of the sexual network, as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g002">Fig 2B</xref>. When 0 &lt; 
 <italic>n</italic> &lt; 1, diagnosed PLWH have preferences for being in relationships with other diagnosed PLWH, but still have a proportion of their relationships with other PLWH who are not yet aware of their status and with HIV-negative people. Likewise, when 0 &lt; 
 <italic>m</italic> &lt; 1, ART patients have preferences for being in relationships with other ART patients, but still have a proportion of their relationships with others who are not ART patients.
