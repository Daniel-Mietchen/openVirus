<p>We developed a static mathematical model for the population-level impact of ART on HIV incidence. The model population contains four interacting subgroups: HIV-negative individuals, PLWH who are unaware of their infection (and thus are not treated and remain infective), PLWH who are aware of their infection but are not treated (and thus remain infective), and PLWH who are on ART (“ART patients”). The latter group becomes less infective but the suppressive effect of ART on infectivity depends on their level of adherence to ART (see below).</p>
