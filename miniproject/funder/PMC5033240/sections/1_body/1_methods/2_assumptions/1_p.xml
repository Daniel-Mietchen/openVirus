<p>To simplify the analysis, we assumed that there are no differences in infectivity between PLWH who are aware or unaware of their HIV-positive status if they are not treated. Similarly, the infectivity of ART patients depends solely on their level of adherence to ART. We further assumed no risk compensation: ART initiation does not lead to changes in the number of sexual partners individuals have, nor does it affect condom use or other determinants of the HIV transmission process within couples. Finally, we assumed homogeneity in sexual activity: every member of the population has the same number of partners and each sexual partnership entails the same number of sex acts.</p>
