<p>Finally, we conducted a multi-way analysis to identify the epidemiological and programmatic conditions under which ART homophily may enhance or reduce the impact of ART on HIV incidence. Specifically, we calculated the modification factor associated with ART homophily for each combination (
 <italic>h; d; a; r; n</italic>) of HIV prevalence (
 <italic>h</italic>), HIV diagnosis (
 <italic>d</italic>), ART uptake (
 <italic>a</italic>) intra-couple effectiveness of ART (
 <italic>r</italic>), and serosorting (
 <italic>n</italic>) defined in 
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Since the parameters 
 <italic>d</italic> and 
 <italic>r</italic> are allowed to vary over a range of values, the results from the multi-way analysis are presented as contour plots.
