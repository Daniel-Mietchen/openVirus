<p>Our goal in this exploratory model is to assess whether the addition of a parameter describing a previously understudied sexual networking pattern (i.e., ART homophily) might modify the impact of ART on HIV incidence. We thus do not seek to characterise the dynamics and steady state properties of the HIV transmission system described above.</p>
