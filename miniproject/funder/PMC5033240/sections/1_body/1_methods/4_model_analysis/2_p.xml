<p>We began by conducting a one-way analysis to assess how each model parameter relates to the population-level impact of ART under the assumption of random mixing with respect to ART status (
 <italic>m</italic> = 0). We then explored how the presence of ART homophily modifies the impact of ART on HIV incidence. To do so, we computed the impact of ART on HIV incidence (

 <italic>I</italic>

 </sub> âˆ’ 1) under 2 scenarios: a baseline scenario without any ART-homophily (m = 0) and a test scenario with perfect ART homophily (m = 1). The ratio of these two estimates of ART impact is the modification factor associated with ART homophily. When it is above 1, ART homophily enhances the impact of ART on HIV incidence, compared to a situation in which ART patients select partners at random. When this modification factor is below 1, then ART homophily reduces the impact of ART on HIV incidence. We conducted another one-way analysis to assess how each model parameter listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> affects this modification factor.
