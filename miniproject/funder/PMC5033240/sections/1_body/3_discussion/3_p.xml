<p>In concentrated epidemics and in generalized epidemics where HIV prevalence is no more than 10%, ART homophily enhances the impact of ART on HIV incidence. On the other hand, the impact of ART clusters may be more complex in hyperendemic settings where the HIV prevalence among certain gender-age strata may reach or even exceed 35% [

 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In such settings, ART homophily also enhances the impact of ART on HIV incidence when HIV status awareness among PLWH (
