<p>In contrast, in hyperendemic settings where HIV status awareness (and hence ART coverage) is low but adherence to ART is high, ART homophily may reduce the impact of ART on population-level HIV incidence. In this scenario, highly-adherent ART patients (who are significantly less infective than other PLWH) would have helped interrupt chains of HIV transmission in sexual networks connected to HIV-negative individuals. Instead, because of ART clusters, HIV-negative individuals are more likely to come into contact with undiagnosed (and untreated) and thus more infective PLWH. Since the combination of high ART adherence and low ART coverage characterizes most current ART programmes in sub-Saharan countries, ART may at the moment have a lower impact on HIV incidence than estimated by standard mathematical models without ART homophily [
