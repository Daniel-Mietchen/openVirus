<p>ART homophily has not been considered in existing investigations of sexual networking during the course of ART scale-up. Instead, most mathematical models of TasP have considered that sexual networks were formed either at random, or by mixing between different pre-defined risk groups (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Empirical investigations of sexual networks have mainly focused on preferences for partners of the same age, gender, educational level or ethnic group [

 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the subpopulation of men who have sex with men, another form of homophily called “serosorting” has also been extensively investigated [
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163159.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This is a behavioural strategy in which individuals preferentially select partners of the same HIV serostatus as them, so as to limit HIV transmission risks while possibly enabling unprotected sex.
