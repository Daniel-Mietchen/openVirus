<p>Even if ART does not lead to risk compensation, other feedback loops may emerge in the complex causal system linking ART scale-up and HIV incidence. In particular, increasing ART availability may affect the process of partnership selection/dissolution through which sexual networks are formed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g001">Fig 1</xref>). For example, during the course of ART scale-up, ART patients may increasingly seek to form new relationships with other ART patients. Similarly, relationships between two ART patients may be less likely to dissolve than other relationships in which only one of the two partners is an ART patient. We call this phenomenon “ART homophily”.
