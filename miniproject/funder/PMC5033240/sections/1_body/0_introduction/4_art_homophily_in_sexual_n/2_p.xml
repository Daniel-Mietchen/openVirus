<p>Qualitative studies have documented several psychosocial mechanisms that may lead to such relationship dynamics. For an ART patient, ART homophily may indeed reduce fear for further HIV transmission [

Finally, in a number of ART programmes, ART patients frequently interact with each other during dedicated ART clinics, in support groups or in various income-generating activities [
