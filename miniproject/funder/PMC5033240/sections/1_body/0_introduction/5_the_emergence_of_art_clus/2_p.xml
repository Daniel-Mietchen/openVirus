<p>ART clusters should not be confused with HIV transmission clusters. The latter typically refer to PLWH who share similar HIV genome sequences, as a result of being closely related in the HIV transmission network. ART clusters, on the other hand, may include relationships between PLWH who are very far removed from one another in the transmission network. Hence, ART clusters may connect PLWH whose HIV genome sequences are highly dissimilar.</p>
