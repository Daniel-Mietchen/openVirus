<p>Despite this lack of attention, ART homophily has the potential to profoundly modify the structure of sexual networks, and as a result the level of exposure to HIV among HIV-negative individuals in the population. In the absence of ART homophily (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), ART patients are likely disseminated throughout the sexual network and may come into contact with both untreated PLWH and HIV-negative individuals. In the presence of ART homophily however, ART patients may form “ART clusters”, which are subsets of the sexual network in which the density of ART patients is much higher than in the rest of the network. In the extreme case where ART patients only form relationships with other ART patients, these clusters may become disconnected from the rest of the network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As ART clusters emerge, the extent of sexual contact between ART patients and other population members declines. At the same time, the number of relations between untreated (and thus likely more infectious) PLWH and HIV-negative individuals may increase to offset the reduced availability of ART patients to form new relationships with members of the other population groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163159.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). If the level of exposure to HIV changes in a population during the course of ART scale-up as a result of ART homophily, then the impact of ART on HIV incidence may be modified.
