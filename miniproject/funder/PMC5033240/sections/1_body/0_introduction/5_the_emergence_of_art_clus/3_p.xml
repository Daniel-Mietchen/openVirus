<p>We constructed an exploratory mathematical model of the impact of ART on HIV incidence that includes the possibility of ART homophily. This is not a formal network model, nor does it aim to describe the long-term dynamics of an epidemic. Instead, we solely used this model to assess whether the emergence of ART homophily in sexual networks may affect the effectiveness of ART in preventing HIV infections.</p>
