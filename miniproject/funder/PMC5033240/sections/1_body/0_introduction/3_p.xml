<p>The effects of ART on HIV incidence may also depend on changes in sexual networking dynamics during the course of ART scale-up. The Health Belief Model [

Neither ART patients, nor HIV-negative individuals living in communities where ART becomes available, seem to increase the number of their sexual partners, for example [
