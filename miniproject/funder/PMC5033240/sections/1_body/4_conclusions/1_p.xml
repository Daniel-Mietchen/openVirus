<p>We show that ART homophily in sexual networks can significantly modify the population-level impact of ART on HIV incidence, even in the absence of risk compensation. But the magnitude and the direction of this modification depends on many other variables: HIV prevalence, coverage of HIV testing and ART, ART adherence and the level of serosorting. Our results suggest that the mathematical models that are being used to estimate the current and future impact of TasP programmes should be amended to take into account the possible emergence of ART clusters in sexual networks during the course of ART scale-up. This inclusion would yield a better estimation of expected reductions in HIV incidence due to accelerated access to ART, as well as a better understanding of observed time trends in HIV incidence after ART scale-up. In contexts where ART clusters could enhance the impact of ART on HIV incidence (e.g. low prevalence settings), measures to promote the formation of ART clusters (e.g. by organising ART initiation and post-initiation follow-up for couples) could constitute useful complementary interventions in combination HIV prevention programmes.</p>
