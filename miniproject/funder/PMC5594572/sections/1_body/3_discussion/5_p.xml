<p>Time horizons and modeling step sizes in the full-text articles were diverse and are subject to disease characteristics and research objectives. There is no standard approach on the number of stochastic realizations, which seems model specific and requires sensitivity analysis. Models focusing on key factors of between-host dynamics in large populations with homogeneous mixing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] will not produce much stochastic variability and require fewer realizations compared to simulations combining complex social mixing clusters, adaptive behavior, within-host dynamics and medical backgrounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. One of the most frequent criticisms of IBMs is that “they can be calibrated to say anything” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is partly a result of not capturing the difference between the calibration of IBMs and equation-based models. The latter have usually fewer parameters, which have to be evaluated by calibrating the full model to observed data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. IBMs, in contrast, are constructed bottom-up, which allows to select parameters independently based on census data, mobility patterns, serotype distribution, social contact behavior, natural history of a disease, etc. As such, a limited number of particularly uncertain parameters has to be calibrated by fitting the model to observed prevalence and/or incidence of disease states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. IBM calibration has been performed with genetic algorithms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], maximum likelihood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] or Bayesian procedures with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A limitation of the IBM approach is that the basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), corresponding to the number of secondary cases caused by a single (typical) infection in a totally susceptible population, cannot be attributed directly but has to be derived from model output. R
 <sub>0</sub> has been estimated in IBM studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>] by the average number of secondary cases from a randomly selected individual in a fully susceptible model population based on multiple realizations. Parameterization and calibration needs to be documented well. Model presentation should preferably be accompanied by an assessment of the goodness of fit to observed data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Another convincing way to show that your ABM has been calibrated without bias and produces useful general results is to analyze it thoroughly after calibration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Ideally, each model should be analyzed systematically to understand the impact of model assumptions and parameters on the results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Parameter values can be drawn from a pre-computed design (e.g., Latin Hypercube) or at random from a distribution. Emulation techniques are promising to capture complex simulators’ behavior in order to improve engaged and perhaps more rapid policy making [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Given the lack of standards, it is crucial to fully describe the methods and experimental design in the context of the model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Unfortunately, we were not able to recapture all model characteristics and study designs from our full-text subset. This stresses the need for the ODD protocol with shorthand conventions and a syntax that modelers can understand intuitively such that the methodology can be converted directly into an executable simulator [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
