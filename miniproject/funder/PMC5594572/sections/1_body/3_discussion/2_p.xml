<p>Modeling frameworks, such as STDSIM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], EMOD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] and EPISIMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] exist but are limited in that their application depends heavily on specific input data. Indeed, it is difficult to create or maintain generic models that incorporate many modeling options and still manage the computational burden. Nonetheless, given the high programming burden, transparent reuse of models increases confidence in their approach and generated results. Making IBM code open-source (e.g., FluTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and FRED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]) is also useful to validate model outcomes, to inspire future modeling projects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and to expand model exploration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. Consistent “branding” of the IBM, with a proper acronym, is practical to link studies and consolidate intellectual ownership of freely accessible source code.
