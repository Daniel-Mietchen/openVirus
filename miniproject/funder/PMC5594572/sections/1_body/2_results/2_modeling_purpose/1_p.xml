<p>Among the 698 included studies, we observed an absolute increase in the annual number of IBM publications (38 to 115 from 2006 to 2016) and the diversity of disease-topics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Most papers in our selection are on unspecified close-contact diseases (27%), closely followed by influenza (23%). Many studies in the latter group were published shortly after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A similar event-related trend is observed for Ebola in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and for bioterrorism subjects, with 13 studies between 2006 and 2013, expressing the rising concerns over smallpox [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], anthrax [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and pneumonic plague [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents an overview of the different topics, modeling purposes and study characteristics. We observed that models for general close-contact diseases are mostly used to describe methodology and transmission dynamics. In contrast, many studies on influenza are conducted to control seasonal or pandemic outbreaks with vaccination programs or social distancing such as isolation and school closures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In recent years, we observe a shift for the use of IBMs from methodological (43% to 19%) to application and intervention-related purposes (21% to 44%). This is entangled in the rising number of articles on the transmission and control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), malaria, tuberculosis and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Studies on sexually transmitted infections increasingly tend to evaluate screening strategies in the general population, compared to previous studies focusing on prevention measures for men who have sex with men or injecting drug users. We observed an accelerating trend in economic analyses using an IBM from 1 study in 2006 up to 20 in 2015. Malaria is the dominant topic for vector-borne disease models, covering drugs and vector control but also, more recently, potential malaria vaccination options [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Dengue has also been modeled using IBMs, though usually with the primary aim to understand the transmission dynamics, pathogenicity and epidemiology rather than to inform policy makers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Many other diseases have also occasionally been modeled using IBMs including the respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and cholera [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. IBM studies on vaccine-preventable childhood diseases appeared in 2008 for measles and pneumococcus, accumulating to 24 studies by the end of 2015 covering meningococcus, varicella, polio, pertussis and hepatitis A (see “
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Full-text analysis</xref>” subsection for more details).
