<p>Methodological papers, not applied to a specified close-contact infection, mostly describe the conceptual usage of an IBM to simulate heterogeneous disease dynamics and targeted intervention strategies. Other studies were published on validation procedures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] but also with data generated by other models, such as deterministic ordinary differential equation models [
