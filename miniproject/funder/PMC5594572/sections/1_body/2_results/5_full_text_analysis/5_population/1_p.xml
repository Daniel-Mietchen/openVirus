<p>The population sizes ranged from 38 infants in a hospital setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] up to 48 million inhabitants of England and Wales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. The dynamics regarding age and social mixing in the population were modeled static (i.e. constant) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] or dynamic (with ageing, mortality, newborns, weddings) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Ajelli and Merler [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>] were exceptional in that they provided an explicit approach to model household dynamics over time to enable IBM simulations on long time-scales.
