<p>We retrieved 2 papers that explored methodology to incorporate heterogeneous interactions in a (geo)spatial context [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Eight papers elaborated on transmission dynamics, focusing on the influence of social mixing patterns or within-host dynamics [
