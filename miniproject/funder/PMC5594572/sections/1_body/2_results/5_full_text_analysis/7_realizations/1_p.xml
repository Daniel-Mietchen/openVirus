<p>For stochastic IBMs, one initial condition can lead to different outcomes so multiple realizations are highly recommended. The number of realizations for each parameter set to quantify the uncertainty on the results varied in our search from 3x [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], 10x [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] and 100x [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>] up to 1000x [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. For five papers, we were not able to retrieve the number of realizations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].
