<p>We discerned 3 main reasons for choosing an IBM for these childhood diseases. Firstly, to model heterogeneous between-host interactions regarding social mixing behavior, age, demography, clustering, compliance to mitigation strategies and spatial distribution (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]). Secondly, to model heterogeneous within-host processes in combination with between-host interactions (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]). For instance, Choi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] analyzed serotype replacement and developed an IBM to track the multitude of possible vaccine states and dose combinations, which was too complex to capture in a compartmental model framework. Thirdly, to obtain stochastic individual-level information on the disease burden to inform economic analysis or other post-processing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>].
