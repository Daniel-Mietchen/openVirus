<p>The amount of missing information on the platform or other technical details is noteworthy, especially when the model is not described elsewhere or open-source. Two papers provide a model name, FRED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and EMOD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], and one states that the source code is available on request [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. In some papers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], model characteristics such as population size, time horizon, step size or number of realizations had to be retrieved from the “
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>” or “
 <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>” sections or from figure captions.
