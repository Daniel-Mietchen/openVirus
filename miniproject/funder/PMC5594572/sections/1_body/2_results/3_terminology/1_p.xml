<p>We observed a variety of descriptions for models simulating transmission events between humans at the individual-level. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates the presence of query terms in all unique hits and for the selected subset of IBMs for infectious disease transmission. The positive predictive value represents the proportion of positive results that are truly positive (i.e. the proportion of query records included after screening). We also estimated the sensitivity, namely the probability of detection, as the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such. Of the 698 included studies, 12 did not contain “model” in their title, abstract or keywords. To describe the individual-level characteristics, ABM and IBM were mainly used, followed by CA or micro-simulation (though with different spelling variations). Other terminology that covered our definitions included “individual-level model” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], “individually based SIR model” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], “small world network” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], “large-scale stochastic simulation” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], “equation free approach” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] or other variants of “stochastic models” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. General keywords gave many false positive hits though still resulted in 124 papers that did not use the most common terminology in their abstract, title or keywords. None of our disease related query terms were used by the complete set of IBM papers on infectious disease transmission and a low positive predicted value was observed. Firstly, the term “disease” is also valid for chronic and lifestyle diseases. Secondly, we needed to include general terms such as “transmi*” or “epidem*” to capture papers only describing their specific disease topic like influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] or dengue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Unfortunately, “transmi*” caused many false positive hits for research on power markets, sensors and information networks.
