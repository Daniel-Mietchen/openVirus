<p>Based on their acronym, some models were identified as having been applied multiple times, for example STDSIM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], EPISIMS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], EMOD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], ONCHOSIM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], HPV-ADVISE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], FRED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and the Openmalaria platform [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This non-exhaustive list covers models for airborne, sexually transmitted, parasitic and vector-borne diseases. With such consistent acronyms, one can link studies for different diseases, such as STDSIM developed for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] but used for HPV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and herpes simplex [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] or FRED implemented for influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and recently used for measles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], or EMOD used for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In addition, we identified studies that were published by the same authors but links with previous research were not mentioned, at least not in the abstract. Based on authorship, research institute and project names, we could also link other studies to the Openmalaria platform [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] and FRED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Providing IBM code open-source to the research community is not common practice but exists, for example with FluTE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and FRED [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].
