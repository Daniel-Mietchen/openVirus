<p>Using the online databases PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 5520 unique articles published between 2006-2015 matching the search criteria listed in the “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>” section. Our query included many general descriptions for IBMs and infectious disease transmission to decrease the number of false negative hits. Based on title, abstract and keyword screening with predefined eligibility criteria (see “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>”), we excluded 4761 articles. More specifically, we excluded over 800 articles on a different topic (stock markets, oncology, engineering, non-human, etc.) and many more with a stochastic model but not at the individual-level. Other infectious disease IBMs did not include transmission events. We analyzed full-texts for 100 abstracts containing an unclear or incomplete model description and excluded 62 of them. Finally, we obtained 698 studies using an IBM to simulate infectious disease transmission. The adapted PRISMA diagram of the screening process with inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. In this main text, we describe and discuss general findings and provide the complete set of references with study characteristics as Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.
