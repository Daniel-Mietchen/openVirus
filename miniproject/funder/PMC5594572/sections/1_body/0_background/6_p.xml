<p>Describing the methodology of an IBM is more difficult compared to compartmental models, which often can be formulated in the general language of mathematics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Published IBM methodology is often incomplete or ambiguous and therefore less accessible or reproducible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In 2006, a board of 28 modelers developed and tested a generic format to document IBM research consisting of three blocks: Overview, Design concepts, and Details (ODD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The primary objective was to make model descriptions more understandable and complete. The “Overview” should provide readers the modeling focus, resolution and complexity based on the declaration of the model entities and the scheduling of the processes. The “Design Concept” describes the general approach to establish a link with emergence, the type of interactions and if/how stochasticity is considered. The “Details” section should contain all information required to completely reimplement the model and run the baseline simulations. In 2010, the ODD protocol has been revised and was used in at least 50 publications though still many papers lacked a standard approach to describe the IBM [
