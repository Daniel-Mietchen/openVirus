<p>Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases are usually modeled at the population-level with a compartmental model, and less frequently till now at the individual level with an individual-based model (IBM). A compartmental model tracks changes in compartments without specifying which individuals are involved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Compartmentalization typically reflects health states relevant for transmission (e.g., susceptible, infectious and recovered), though more partitioning is possible according to age and/or other relevant host characteristics. Heterogeneous and temporal behavior is modeled through incorporation of relevant time-dependent social mixing, community structures and seasonality, relevant for infectious disease dynamics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Process dynamics are captured in transition rates, representing the rate by which an average individual transitions between compartments. IBMs work bottom-up, with population-level behavior emerging from the interactions between autonomous individuals and their environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. They allow the history of every individual to be tracked and network structures to be explicitly represented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Each individual has a unique set of attributes or state variables that can change through time including spatial location, physiological traits and/or social behavior [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As such, IBMs allow a high degree of heterogeneity for the creation, disappearance and movement of a finite collection of discrete interacting individuals [
