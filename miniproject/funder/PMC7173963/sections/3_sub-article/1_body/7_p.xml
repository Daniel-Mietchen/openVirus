<p>The study by Dupont and colleagues describes a novel role for induction of Siglec-1, which occurs upon 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, in the transfer of HIV-1 to macrophages through the use of tunnelling nanotubes (TNT). The authors have built upon an earlier article (Souriant et al., 2019) which demonstrated that the IL-10/STAT3 axis is involved in 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-mediated TNT formation and subsequent HIV-1 transfer in human macrophages.
