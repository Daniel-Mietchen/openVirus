<p>Tuberculosis and HIV infection occur in lethal synergy, especially in regions such as Southern Africa and the collision between these two epidemics poses numerous public health and clinical management challenges. Despite the notable prevalence of such co-infections, the molecular basis of how the two disease causing agents combine to drive pathogenesis and further spread remains largely elusive. Your demonstration that the induction of Siglec-1, which occurs upon 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, is associated with the transfer of HIV-1 to macrophages, through the use of tunnelling nanotubes (TNT), represents a notable advance for the field. This work creates new avenues for further delineating how these two pathogens modulate immunity. Further insight on this process will allow for the development of synergistic therapeutic options, that reduce mortality and paradoxic side-effects that current prevail in individuals who are co-infected with TB and HIV.
