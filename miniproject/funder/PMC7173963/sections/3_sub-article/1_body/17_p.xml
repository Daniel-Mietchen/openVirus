<p>3) You demonstrated that Siglec-1 expression correlated positively with a greater length and high cargo of HIV-1 and mitochondria, arguing for a functional capacity of Siglec-1+ TNT to transfer material to recipient cells over long distances (subsection “Siglec-1 localization on thick TNT is associated with their length and HIV-1 cargo”). It is also stated that the "decreasing tendency for the capacity of Siglec-1-depleted cmMTB-treated macrophages to transfer mitochondria to recipient cells compared to controls (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F), alludes to a possible defect in mechanisms involved in intercellular material transfer including through thick TNT". Given this function, one could envisage that Siglec-1 can alter cell-to-cell transfer of mitochondria by TNT, even irrespective of HIV-1 infection, altering the metabolism of the recipient cell. This point can be expanded in the Discussion.</p>
