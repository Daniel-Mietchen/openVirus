  <title>Inactivation of Siglec-1 by siRNA-mediated gene silencing does not affect the expression of M(IL-10) markers in cmMTB-treated cells (Related to Figure 4â€”figure supplement 1A).</title>
  <p>Monocytes from healthy subjects were transfected with siRNA targeting of Siglec-1 (siSiglec-1, black) or not (siCtrl, white). A day after, monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with cmMTB for 3 days. Vertical scatter plots showing the median fluorescent intensity (MFI, upper panels) of Siglec-1, CD16 and CD163, and the percentage of cells expressing Siglec-1, CD16 and CD163 (lower panels). Each circle represents a single donor and histograms median values. n=3 donors.</p>
