  <title>Immunofluorescence analysis of cmMTB-treated cells positive for Siglec-1.</title>
  <p>For 3 days, monocytes were differentiated into macrophages either with cmCTR (white) or with cmMTB in the presence of an IFNAR-2 blocking (α-IFNAR, stripped) or control (α-IgG, black) antibodies. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed and the percentage of cells positive for intracellular Siglec-1 were quantified. n=4 donors.</p>
