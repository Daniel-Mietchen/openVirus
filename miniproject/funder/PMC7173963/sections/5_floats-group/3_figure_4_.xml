  <title>The exacerbation of HIV-1 infection and spread in macrophages treated with cmMTB requires Siglec-1.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Experimental design. Monocytes from healthy subjects were transfected with siRNA targeting of Siglec-1 (siSiglec-1, black) or not (siCtrl, white). A day after, monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with cmMTB for 3 days. Cells were then infected with HIV-1-ADA (blue protocol) to measure the formation (
   <bold>B</bold>) and length (
   <bold>C</bold>) of TNT at day 7, or assess HIV-1 production and multinucleated giant cell (MGC) formation at day 14 (
   <bold>F–G</bold>). In parallel, cells were either infected with HIV-NLAD8-VSVG or labelled with mitoTracker to measure the transfer (red protocol) of HIV-1 (
   <bold>D</bold>) or mitochondria (
   <bold>E</bold>), respectively. (

    <p>(
     <bold>A–D, F–G</bold>) Monocytes from healthy subjects were transfected with siRNA targeting of Siglec-1 (siSiglec-1, black) or not (siCtrl, white). A day after, monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with cmMTB for 3 days. (
