  <p>(
   <bold>A–D</bold>) For 3 days, human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with cmCTR (white) or cmMTB (black) supernatants. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Heatmap from a transcriptomic analysis (GEO submission GSE139511) illustrating the top 60 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between cmCTR- or cmMTB-cells. Selection of the top DEGs was performed using an adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, a fold change of at least 2, and a minimal expression of 6 in a log
   <sub>2</sub> scale. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the complete linkage method and the Pearson correlation metric with Morpheus (Broad Institute). Interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) are labelled with an asterisk and Siglec-1 is indicated in red. (
   <bold>B–D</bold>) Validation of Siglec-1 expression in cmMTB-treated macrophages. Vertical scatter plots showing the relative abundance to mRNA (
   <bold>B</bold>), median fluorescent intensity (MFI) (
   <bold>C</bold>), and mean number of Siglec-1 antibody binding sites per cell (
   <bold>D</bold>). Each circle represents a single donor and histograms median values. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Representative immunohistochemical images of Siglec-1 staining (brown) in lung biopsies of healthy, SIV infected (SIV), active TB (ATB), and co-infected (ATB-SIV) non-human primates (NHP). Scale bar, 100 µm. Insets are 2x zoom. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Vertical Box and Whisker plot indicating the distribution of the percentage of Siglec-1
   <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages in lung biopsies from the indicated NHP groups. Quantification analysis from n = 800 alveolar macrophages grouped from three independent animals per NHP group. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Vertical scatter plots displaying the number of cells that are positive for Siglec-1 per mm² of lung biopsies from the indicated NHP groups. Each symbol represents a single animal per NHP group. (
   <bold>H</bold>) Correlation between Siglec-1
   <sup>+</sup> cells per mm² of lung tissue and the pathological score for healthy (white circle), SIV
   <sup>+</sup> (white triangles), latent (black circle) or active (black square) TB, and SIV
   <sup>+</sup> with latent (grey circle) or active (grey square) TB. Each symbol represents a single animal per NHP group. Mean value is represented as a black line. Statistical analyses: Two-tailed, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (
   <bold>B–D</bold>), Mann-Whitney unpaired test (
   <bold>F–G</bold>), Spearman correlation (
   <bold>H</bold>). *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. ns: not significant. See

    <p>(
     <bold>A–D</bold>) For 3 days, human monocytes were differentiated into macrophages with cmCTR (white) or cmMTB (black) supernatants. (
     <bold>A</bold>) (
     <italic>Left</italic>) Gene set enrichment plot of the interferon alpha (IFNα) response (hallmark collection of MSigDB). This plot shows the distribution of the barcode between macrophages exposed to cmCTR (red) 
     <italic>versus</italic> cmMTB (blue) supernatants. Each bar of the barcode corresponds to a signature gene of the gene set. The skewing to the right indicates enrichment in macrophages exposed to cmMTB 
     <italic>versus</italic> cmCTR supernatant of genes up-regulated in response to IFNα. (
     <italic>Right</italic>) Gene set enrichment plot of the IFNγ response (hallmark collection of MSigDB). (
     <bold>B</bold>) Flow cytometry gating strategy to assess Siglec-1 cell-surface expression in human macrophages exposed to cmCTR (white) and cmMTB (black). (
     <italic>Left</italic>) Based on size (FSC-A) and granularity (SSC-A), a gate was created to separate human macrophages from cell debris and dying cells. Macrophages were then subjected through a second gate based FSC Area and Height Scaling (FSC-A and FSC-H) to separate singlets from doublets. (
     <italic>Right</italic>) Based on the singlet gate, the histogram plot illustrates Siglec-1 expression that is higher in cmMTB- (black) than in cmCTR-treated (white) macrophages. (
     <bold>C</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence of Siglec-1 intracellular staining (green), actin (red) and nuclei (blue) after 3 days of monocyte conditioning with cmMTB. Scale bar, 10 μm. (
     <bold>D</bold>) Vertical scatter plot showing the quantification of Siglec-1 intracellular staining in cmCTR- or cmMTB-treated cells in the presence of an IFNAR-2 blocking (α-IFNAR) or control (α-IgG) antibodies during cell conditioning. Each circle represents a single donor and histograms median value. (
     <bold>E</bold>) Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Siglec-1 cell-surface expression in human macrophages exposed to cmCTR and infected with HIV-1 assessed by flow cytometry. The histogram plot illustrates Siglec-1 expression that increases within days post-HIV-1 infection of cmCTR-macrophages. Statistical analyses: Two-tailed, Wilcoxon signed-rank test (
     <bold>D</bold>). *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ns: not significant.
