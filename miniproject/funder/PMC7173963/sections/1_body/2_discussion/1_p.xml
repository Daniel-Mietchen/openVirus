<p>In this study, we investigated potential mechanisms by which Mtb exacerbates HIV-1 infection in macrophages, and uncovered a deleterious role for Siglec-1 in this process. These findings have different contributions to our understanding of this receptor in the synergy between Mtb and distinct retroviral infections, and also for TNT biology in host-pathogen interactions.</p>
