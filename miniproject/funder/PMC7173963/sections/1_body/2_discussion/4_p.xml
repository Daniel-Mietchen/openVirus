<p>In conclusion, our study identifies Siglec-1 as a key factor involved in the exacerbation of HIV-1 infection in macrophages conditioned by cmMTB. It is worth noting that we have previously reported that a loss-of-function variant in Siglec-1 in the human population does not conclusively establish a role for this receptor in AIDS progression, even though ex vivo experiments demonstrated that cells from these individuals were functionally null or partially defective for Siglec-1 expression along with poor HIV-1 capture and transmission (

While this may be counterintuitive for proposing Siglec-1 as a therapeutic target to limit viral dissemination in the co-infection context, there are several challenges to the study of Siglec-1 variants, such as limited cohort size, the lack of complete clinical records, and the restriction to study only off-therapy periods, among others (

Therefore, there is a strong need for future work targeting Siglec-1 to unveil its in vivo contribution of the mononuclear phagocyte system to HIV-1 pathogenesis to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of this receptor. Beyond the infectious disease context, our study also sheds light on a new homeostatic function for Siglec-1 in human macrophages, such as intercellular communication facilitated by TNT. We argue that Siglec-1 localization on thick TNT has a physiological significance to macrophage biology in health and disease.
