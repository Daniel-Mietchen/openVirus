<p>Another aspect worth highlighting is the impact that Siglec-1 expression has in the capture and transfer of HIV-1 by M(IL-10) macrophages, in particular in the context of TNT. First, we reported that Siglec-1 is located on MT-positive thick (and not on thin) TNT, correlating positively with increased length and HIV-1 cargo. To our knowledge, no receptor has been described so far to be present mainly on thick TNT, making Siglec-1 an unprecedented potential marker for this subtype of TNT (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dupont et al., 2018</xref>). Second, viral uptake assays demonstrated the functional capacity of Siglec-1, including on thick TNT, to interact with viral-like particles bearing sialylated lipids; loss-of-function approaches showed Siglec-1 is important in the capture of these viral particles. Third, Siglec-1 depletion correlated with a decrease in thick TNT length, but had no effect in the total number of thick TNT. This suggests that, while the IFN-I/STAT1 axis is responsible for Siglec-1 expression in M(IL-10) macrophages, it does not contribute to TNT formation. This is line with our previous report where TNT formation induced by TB-associated microenvironments depended on the IL-10/STAT3 axis (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Concerning the shortening of thick TNT length, we infer that it may reflect a fragile state due to an altered cell membrane composition in the absence of Siglec-1; TNT are known for their fragility towards light exposure, shearing force and chemical fixation (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>). We hypothesize that the longer the TNT is, the more rigidity it requires to be stabilized. Cholesterol and lipids are known to increase membrane rigidity (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Redondo-Morata et al., 2012</xref>) and are thought to be critical for TNT stability (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lokar et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Thayanithy et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the presence of Siglec-1 in thick TNT may affect the cholesterol and lipid composition 
 <italic>via</italic> the recruitment of GM1/GM3 glycosphingolipid-enriched microvesicles (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Halász et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, TNT formation depends on GM1/GM3 ganglioside and cholesterol content (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kabaso et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lokar et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Osteikoetxea-Molnár et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Tóth et al., 2017</xref>). Since GM1 and GM3 glycosphingolipids are 
 <italic>bona fide</italic> ligands for Siglec-1 (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Puryear et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> thick TNT exhibit a higher lipid and cholesterol content, and hence an increase of membrane rigidity that favors the stability of longer TNT. Fourth, Siglec-1-depleted donor macrophages were less capable to transfer HIV-1, and to some extend mitochondria, to recipient cells. While infectious synapse and exososome release are mechanisms attributed to Siglec-1 that contribute to cell-to-cell transfer of HIV-1 (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bracq et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Gummuluru et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2014</xref>), they accomplish so extracellularly. Here, we speculate that Siglec-1 participates indirectly in the intracellular HIV-1 transfer 
 <italic>via</italic> TNT as a tunnel over long distance, suggesting that factors affecting TNT rigidity favor distal viral dissemination while ensuring protection against immune detection. Independent of HIV-1 infection, we also noticed that cmMTB-treated cells depleted for Siglec-1 displayed a decreasing tendency to transfer mitochondria among them. As TNT-transferred mitochondria are known to alter the metabolism and functional properties of recipient cells under steady state conditions or in the cancer context, it implies that Siglec-1 may also influence key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate and lipid metabolism, among others (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hekmatshoar et al., 2018</xref>). This is important because, for example, the gain of cancer drug resistance is directly associated to TNT-mediated mitochondria transfer, thus Siglec-1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome cancer cell drug resistance. Finally, the depletion of Siglec-1 abrogated the exacerbation of HIV-1 infection and production induced by TB in M(IL-10) macrophages. This is likely to result from an accumulative effect of deficient capture and transfer of HIV-1 in the absence of Siglec-1. However, these results do not discern the specific contribution of Siglec-1 to the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 
 <italic>via</italic> TNT from that obtained through other mechanisms (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bracq et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies will address whether the contribution of Siglec-1 to cell-to-cell transfer mechanisms has an impact in Mtb dissemination (
