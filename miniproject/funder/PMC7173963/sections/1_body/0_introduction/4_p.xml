<p>In this study, global mapping of the M(IL-10) macrophage transcriptome revealed Siglec-1 (CD169, or sialoadhesin) as a potential factor responsible for HIV-1 dissemination in the co-infection context with TB. As a type-I transmembrane lectin receptor, Siglec-1 possesses a large extracellular domain composed of 17 immunoglobulin-like domains, including the N-terminal V-set domain, which allows the

 <italic>O</italic>- and 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans and glycolipids, such as those surface-exposed in HIV-1 and SIV particles (

 <italic>e.g.</italic> macrophages and dendritic cells) and participates in HIV-1 transfer from myeloid cells to T cells, as well as in the initiation of virus-containing compartment (VCC) formation in macrophages (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Sewald et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, HIV-1 and other retroviruses have evolved the capacity to hijack the immune surveillance and housekeeping immunoregulatory functions of Siglec-1 (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we investigate how Siglec-1 expression is induced by TB, and the role it has in the capture and transfer of HIV-1 by TB-induced M(IL-10) macrophages, in particular in the context of TNT.
