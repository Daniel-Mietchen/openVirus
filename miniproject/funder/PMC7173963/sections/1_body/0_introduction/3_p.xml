<p>Macrophages are key host cells for Mtb (

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Using relevant in vitro and in vivo models, we showed that TB-associated microenvironments activate macrophages towards an M(IL-10) profile, distinguished by a CD16

 <sup>+</sup> phenotype. Acquisition of this phenotype is dependent on the IL-10/STAT3 signaling pathway (

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). At the functional level, we demonstrated that TB-associated microenvironments stimulate the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNT), membranous channels connecting two or more cells over short to long distances above substrate. TNT are subdivided in two classes based on their thickness and cytoskeleton composition: ‘thin’ TNT (&lt;0.7 μm in diameter) containing F-actin, and ‘thick’ TNT (&gt;0.7 μm in diameter) are enriched in F-actin and microtubules (MT) (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Thick TNT are functionally distinguished by the transfer of large organelles, such as lysosomes and mitochondria (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Eugenin et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>). While the contribution for each TNT class to HIV-1 pathogenesis has not been explored (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Eugenin et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hashimoto et al., 2016</xref>), we reported that total inhibition of TNT formation in M(IL-10) macrophages resulted in the abrogation of HIV-1 exacerbation induced by Mtb (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Factors influencing TNT function in M(IL-10) macrophages remain unknown at large.
