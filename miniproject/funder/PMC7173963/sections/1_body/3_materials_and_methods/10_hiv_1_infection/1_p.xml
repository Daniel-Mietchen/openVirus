<p>For HIV-1 infection, at day 3 of differentiation, 0.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> human monocytes-derived macrophages (hMDM) were infected with HIV-1 ADA strain (or as indicated otherwise) at MOI 0.1. HIV-1 infection, and replication were assessed at 10-day post-infection by measuring p24-positive cells by immunostaining and the level of p24 released in culture media by ELISA. For the infection and TNT quantification at day six post-infection, the same protocol was used. For HIV-1 transfer, higher MOI of HIV-1 VSVG pseudotyped NLAD8 virus was used, as described below (see section 
 <italic>HIV-1 and cell-to-cell transfer</italic>) and in 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al. (2019)</xref>.
