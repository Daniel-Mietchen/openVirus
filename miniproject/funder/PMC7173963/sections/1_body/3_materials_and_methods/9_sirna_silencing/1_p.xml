<p>Targeted gene silencing in monocytes was performed using reverse transfection protocol as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Troegeler et al., 2014</xref>). Shortly, human primary monocytes were transfected with 200 nM of ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting Siglec-1 (Horizon Discovery) or non-targeting siRNA (control) using HiPerfect transfection system (Qiagen). After a four-hr post-transfection, cells were allowed to rest for 24 hr in RPMI-1640 medium, 10% FBS, 20 ng/mL of M-CSF, before addition of cmMTB media (40% vol/vol). After three additional days of conditioning, cells were infected with HIV-1 ADA or HIV-1- NLAD8-VSV-G strain, and kept in culture for 10 more days or 48 hrs, respectively. Validation of gene silencing was done after three days post-transfection, and this protocol led to the efficient depletion of Siglec-1 ranging between 50 to95%, as measured by flow cytometry.
