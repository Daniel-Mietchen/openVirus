<p>HIV-VLP stock (GFP VLP) was generated by transfecting the molecular clone pGag-eGFP obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. HEK-293 T cells were transfected with calcium phosphate (CalPhos, Clontech) in T75 flasks using 30 μg of plasmid DNA. Supernatants containing VLP were filtered (Millex HV, 0.45 μm; Millipore) and frozen at −80°C until use. The p24 Gag content of the VLP was determined by an ELISA (Perkin-Elmer).</p>
