<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tulane University, New Orleans, LA and were performed at the Tulane TNPRC, and under approval from IACUC (project numbers P3733, P3794, P3373 and P3628). They were performed in strict accordance with NIH guidelines. The twenty adult rhesus macaques used in this study (

Nine weeks later, a subgroup of the animals was additionally intravenously injected with 300 TCID50 of SIVmac239 in 1 mL saline, while controls received an equal volume of saline solution. Euthanasia criteria were presentation of four or more of the following conditions: (i) body temperatures consistently greater than 2 °F above pre-infection values for three or more weeks in a row; (ii) 15% or more loss in body weight; (iii) serum CRP values higher than 10 mg/mL for three or more consecutive weeks, CRP being a marker for systemic inflammation that exhibits a high degree of correlation with active TB in macaques (
