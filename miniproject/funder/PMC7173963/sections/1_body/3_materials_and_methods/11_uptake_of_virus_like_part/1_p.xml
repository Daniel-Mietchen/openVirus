 <sup>Gag</sup> HIV-1
 <sub>Gag−eGFP</sub> VLP (GFP VLP). Briefly, monocytes transfected (or not) with control siRNA, or with siRNA directed against Siglec-1, and differentiated for 3 days in cmCTR or cmMTB, were washed once with PBS prior to addition of 2 ng/mL of GFP VLP. Binding was performed during 3.5 hr at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cells were then detached with cell dissociation buffer (Gibco) and prepared for flow cytometry analysis on a BD LSRFortessa (TRI-Genotoul platerform). Same experiment was also performed blocking monocyte-derived macrophages at RT for 15 min with 10 μg/mL of mAb α-Siglec-1 7–239 (Abcam), IgG1 isotype control (BD Biosciences) or leaving cells untreated before VLP addition.
