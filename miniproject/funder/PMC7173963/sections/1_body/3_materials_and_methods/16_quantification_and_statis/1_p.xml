<p>Information on the statistical tests used and the exact values of n (donors) can be found in the Figure Legends. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). Two-tailed paired or unpaired t-test was applied on data sets with a normal distribution (determined using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), whereas two-tailed Mann-Whitney (unpaired test) or Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank tests were used otherwise. p&lt;0.05 was considered as the level of statistical significance (*p≤0.05; **p≤0.005; ***p≤0.0005; ****p≤0.0001).</p>
