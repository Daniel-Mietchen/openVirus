<p>As HIV-1 infection induces macrophages fusion into MGC (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Vérollet et al., 2010</xref>), the number of infected cells largely underestimates the rate of infection. Thus, to better reflect the rate of infection, we quantified the percentage of MGC. Using semi-automatic quantification with homemade Image J macros, allowing the study of more than 5,000 cells per condition in at least five independent donors, we assessed these parameters.
