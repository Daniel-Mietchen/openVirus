<p>Cells were fixed with PFA 3.7%, Sucrose 30 mM in PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were saturated with blocking buffer (PBS-BSA 1%). Depending on the experiments, cells were permeabilized as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>) with Triton X-100 0.3% for 10 min (or not), and then stained for 2 hrs with the primary antibody: anti-Siglec-1 (10 µg/mL, Novus Biologicals). Cells were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 hr: Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 or 647 Goat anti-Mouse IgG (2 µg/mL, Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were then permeabilized, washed in PBS before saturation with 0.6 µg/mL mouse IgG2 diluted in Dako Antibody Reducing Background buffer (Dako) for 30 min. Intracellular proteins were then stained with anti-Gag KC57 RD1 antibody (1/100, Beckman Coulter) and/or anti-α-tubulin (5 µg/mL, Abcam) for 2 hrs. Cells were washed and finally incubated with Alexa Fluor 488, 555 or 647 Goat anti-Mouse, or Goat anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (2 µg/mL, Cell Signaling Technology), Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 Phalloidin (33 mM, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Wheat Germ Agglutinin (CF350 WGA, Thermofischer) and DAPI (500 ng/mL, Sigma Aldrich) in blocking buffer for 1 hr. Coverslips were mounted on a glass slide using Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako) and visualized with a spinning disk (Olympus), a Zeiss confocal LSM880 with Airyscan or a FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus).
