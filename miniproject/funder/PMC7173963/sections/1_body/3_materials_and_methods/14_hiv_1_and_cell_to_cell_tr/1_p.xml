<p>Freshly isolated CD14
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes from HS transfected with siRNA against Siglec-1 (or siRNA control) were allowed to adhere in the absence of serum (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/6-well in 1.5 mL). After 4 hr of culture, RPMI-1640 supplemented with 20 ng/mL M-CSF and 20% FBS were added to the cells (vol/vol). After 24 hr, cells were conditioned with cmMTB media. At day 4, 120 ng p24 of a HIV-1 NLAD8 strain pseudotyped with a VSVG envelope was used to infect half of the cells, kept in culture for two more days. At day 6, before co-culture, uninfected cells were stained with CellTracker Green CMFDA Dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For mitochondria transfer, half of the macrophages were pre-stained with Green CellTracker, and the other half, uninfected, was stained with mitoTracker Deep-Red prior to co-culture. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>/Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and stained for 30 min with 500 ng/mL CellTracker or mitoTracker, before washing with RPMI-1640 10% FBS. HIV-1
 <sup>+</sup>(or mitoTracker
 <sup>+</sup>) and CellTracker
 <sup>+</sup> cells were then detached using accutase (Sigma) and co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio on glass coverslips in 24-well.
