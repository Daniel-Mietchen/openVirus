<p>To determine Siglec-1 expression, we applied a quantitative FACS assay. Briefly, cmCTR- and cmMTB-treated macrophages were detached using Accutase solution (Gibco) for 10 min at 37°C, washed, blocked with 1 mg/mL human IgG (Privigen, Behring CSL), and stained with mAb 7–239 α-Siglec-1-PE or matched isotype-PE control (Biolegend) at 4°C for 30 min. The mean number of Siglec-1 mAb binding sites per cell was obtained with a Quantibrite kit (Becton Dickinson) as previously described (
