<p>Staining of conditioned macrophages was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Adherent cells were harvested after 5 min incubation in trypsin 0.05% EDTA (Gibco) and washes with PBS (Gibco). After 10 min centrifugation at 320 g, pellets were resuspended in cold staining buffer (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% FBS) with fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (See Key ressources Table) and, in parallel, with the corresponding isotype control antibody using a general concentration of 1 µg/mL. After staining, cells were washed with cold staining buffer, centrifuged for 2 min at 320 g at 4°C, and analyzed by flow cytometry using BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, TRI Genotoul plateform) and the associated BD FACSDiva software. Data were then analyzed using the FlowJo_V10 software (FlowJo, LLC). Gating on macrophage population was set according to its Forward Scatter (FSC) and Size Scatter (SSC) properties before doublet exclusion and analysis of the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each staining.
