<p>Mtb H37Rv strain was grown in suspension in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% albumin-dextrose-catalase (ADC, Difco) and 0.05% Twen-80 (Sigma-Aldrich) (

 <sub>2</sub>, CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> free, Gibco). Twenty passages through a 26 G needle were done for dissociation of bacterial aggregates. Bacterial suspension concentration was then determined by measuring OD
 <sub>600</sub>, and then resuspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS for infection.
