<p>Paraffin embedded tissue samples were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histomorphological analysis. Different antigen unmasking methods where used on tissue slides for immunohistochemical staining, which was performed using anti-CD163 (Leica/Novocastra), anti-Siglec-1 (Novus Biologicals) and anti-pSTAT1 (Cell Signaling Technology). Sections were then incubated with biotin-conjugated polyclonal anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies, followed by the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method (Vector Laboratories). Finally, sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Slides were scanned with the Panoramic 250 Flash II (3DHISTECH). Virtual slides were automatically quantified for macrophage distribution as previously described (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining of the sections was performed as described above, and followed by anti-mouse IgG isotype specific or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies labelled with Alexa488 and Alexa555 (Molecular Probes). Samples were mounted with Prolong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and examined using a 60x/1.40N.A. objective of an Olympus spinning disk microscope.
