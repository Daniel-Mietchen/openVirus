<p>Human monocytes were isolated from healthy subject (HS) buffy coat (from EFS) and differentiated towards macrophages as described (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were recovered by gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). CD14
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes were then isolated by positive selection magnetic sorting, using human CD14 Microbeads and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were then plated at 1.6 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per 6-well and allowed to differentiate for 5–7 days in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich) and human M-CSF (20 ng/mL) Peprotech) before infection with Mtb H37Rv for conditioned-media preparation. The cell medium was renewed every 3 or 4 days.
