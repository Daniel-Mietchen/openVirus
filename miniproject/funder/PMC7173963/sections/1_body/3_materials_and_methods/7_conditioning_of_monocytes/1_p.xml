<p>Human CD14
 <sup>+</sup> sorted monocytes from HS buffy coat were allowed to adhere in the absence of serum (0.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells / 24-well in 500 µL) on glass coverslips, and then cultured for 3 days with 40% dilution (vol/vol) of cmCTR or cmMTB supplemented with 20% FBS and M-CSF (20 ng/mL, Peprotech). Blocking IFNAR receptor was performed by pre-incubation with mouse anti-IFNAR antibody (20 µg/mL, Thermo Fischer Scientific) in a 200 μL for 30 min prior to conditioning. After 3 days, cells were washed and collected for phenotyping.
