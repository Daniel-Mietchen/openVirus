<p>Conditioned-media from Mtb-infected macrophages (cmMTB) has been reported previously (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lastrucci et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Succinctly, hMDM were infected with Mtb H37Rv at a MOI of 3. After 18 hr of infection at 37°C, culture supernatants were collected, sterilized by double filtration (0.2 µm pores) and aliquots were stored at −80°C. We then tested the capacity of individual cmMTB to differentiate freshly isolated CD14
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes towards the M(IL-10) cell-surface marker phenotype, as assessed by FACS analyses. Those supernatants yielding a positive readout were then pooled together (5–10 donors) to minimize the inter-variability obtained between donors. Control media (cmCTR) was obtained from uninfected macrophage supernatant. When specified, IL-10 was eliminated from cmMTB by antibody depletion as described previously (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lastrucci et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). The depletion was verified by ELISA (BD-Bioscience), according to manufacturer’s protocol.
