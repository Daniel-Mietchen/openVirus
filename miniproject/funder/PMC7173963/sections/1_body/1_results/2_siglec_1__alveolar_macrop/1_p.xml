<p>NHP has been an invaluable in vivo model to better understand the role of macrophages in SIV/HIV pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Merino et al., 2017</xref>). Considering Siglec-1 binds sialylated lipids present in the envelop of HIV-1 and SIV (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Puryear et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the presence of Siglec-1 positive alveolar macrophages in lung biopsies obtained from different NHP groups: (i) co-infected with Mtb (active or latent TB) and SIV, (ii) mono-infected with Mtb (active or latent TB), (iii) mono-infected with SIV, and (iv) healthy (

 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages in the lungs of healthy NHP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Strikingly, we noticed a massive abundance of these cells in co-infected NHP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Concerning the overall abundance of Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> leukocytes in lungs, we observed a significant increase in all infected NHP in comparison to healthy, with a higher tendency in active TB or co-infected NHP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In fact, the number of Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> leukocytes correlated positively with the severity of NHP pathology (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> cells were identified as alveolar macrophages.
