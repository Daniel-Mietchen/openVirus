<p>TNT formation is responsible for the increase in HIV-1 spread between human macrophages in TB-associated microenvironments (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate whether Siglec-1 expression is involved in this process, we first examined its localization in the context of TNT formed by cmMTB-treated cells infected by HIV-1. We observed that Siglec-1 is localized mainly on microtubule (MT)-positive thick TNT, and not on thin TNT (

 <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Semi-automatic quantification of hundreds of TNT showed that about 50% of thick TNT were positive for Siglec-1 (

 <sup>+</sup> thick TNT (

 <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). In addition, these thick TNT also contained large organelles such as mitochondria (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Onfelt et al., 2006</xref>). In general, we also noticed that the incidence of Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> thick TNT between HIV-1 infected macrophages persisted for more than one week upon HIV-1 infection (
