<p>Siglec-1 is an ISG whose expression is induced by IFN-I in myeloid cells (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Hartnell et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to viral infection, IFN-I is also induced in TB and known to mainly play a detrimental role (

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Siglec-1 expression has not been described in the TB context or in co-infection with retroviruses such as SIV or HIV-1, therefore we assessed whether IFN-I stimulates Siglec-1 expression in TB-associated microenvironments. First, we found that cmMTB contains high amounts of IFN-I compared to cmCTR (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a modest, albeit significant, induction of Siglec-1 expression in cells treated with interleukin 10 (IL-10), a cytokine we have previously shown to be abundant in cmMTB (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lastrucci et al., 2015</xref>) and that renders macrophages highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). However, IL-10 depletion had no effect on Siglec-1 expression by cmMTB-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, blocking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR-2) during cmMTB treatment fully abolished the expression of Siglec-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating that IFN-I is the responsible factor for Siglec-1 up-regulation in cmMTB-treated cells.
