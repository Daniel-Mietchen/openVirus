<p>IFN-I binding to IFNAR leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor STAT1, whose role is essential for transcription of ISG (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014</xref>). We thus examined the status of STAT1 activation in co-infected NHP lung tissue. Histological staining of serial sections of co-infected lungs revealed that zones rich in Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> leukocytes also exhibited positivity for nuclear phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and the abundance of these two markers strongly correlated with the active status of TB in the different NHP groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Moreover, we found that the majority of Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages were also positive for nuclear pSTAT1 in the infected NHP groups compared to healthy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). In fact, there was a higher number of pSTAT1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages in TB-SIV co-infected lungs when compared to those from mono-infected NHP and this number directly correlates with the number of Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages (
