<p>TB-induced M(IL-10) macrophages are highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and spread (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). To assess the global gene expression landscape in these cells, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis (GEO submission GSE139511). To this end, we employed our published in vitro model (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lastrucci et al., 2015</xref>), which relies on the use of conditioned medium from either mock- (cmCTR) or Mtb-infected (cmMTB) human macrophages. As we described and observed before and herein, cmMTB-treated cells were positive for the M(IL-10) markers (CD16
 <sup>+</sup>CD163
 <sup>+</sup>MerTK
 <sup>+</sup> and phosphorylated STAT3), and displayed a high rate of HIV-1 infection, as compared to those treated with cmCTR (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lastrucci et al., 2015</xref>). A distinct 60 gene-transcript signature was defined in cmMTB-treated cells, using a combination of the expression level, statistical filters and hierarchical clustering; 51 genes were up-regulated and nine genes were down-regulated in cmMTB- compared to cmCTR-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We compared expression data of cmMTB- and cmCTR-treated cells to public genesets available from MSigDB (Broad Institute) using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) algorithm (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, a significant fraction of genes that were up-regulated in response to interferon (IFN) type I (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> IFNα) and II (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> IFNγ), were also found, as a group, significantly up-regulated in cmMTB-treated cells in comparison to control samples (FDR q-value:&lt;10
 <sup>-3</sup>). IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) usually exert antiviral activities (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">McNab et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>) and cannot be inferred as obvious candidates to facilitate HIV-1 infection. However, among this ISG signature, the up-regulation of Siglec-1 (7.4-fold, adjusted p-value of 0.0162) in cmMTB-treated cells captured our attention due to its known role in HIV-1 pathogenesis (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed a high Siglec-1 expression in cmMTB-treated macrophages at the mRNA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) levels. This effect was superior to the level obtained in HIV-1-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Particularly, cmMTB-treated macrophages displayed high density of Siglec-1 surface expression applying a quantitative FACS assay that determines the absolute number of Siglec-1 antibody binding sites per cell (
