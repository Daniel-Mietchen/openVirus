<p>To evaluate a functional role for Siglec-1 in the susceptibility of macrophages to HIV-1 infection and spread induced by TB, Siglec-1 was depleted in cmMTB-treated cells by siRNA-mediated gene silencing (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While this depletion did not affect the total number of thick TNT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we observed a 2-fold shortening of thick TNT in cells lacking Siglec-1 when compared to control cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Then, we performed a viral uptake assay in these cells using HIV-1-Gag-eGFP virus-like particles (GFP VLP) lacking the viral envelope glycoprotein but bearing sialylated lipids that interact with Siglec-1 on myeloid cells (

 <sup>+</sup> thick TNT (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We confirmed this functional observation using a blocking monoclonal antibody against Siglec-1, showing that this receptor is involved in HIV-1 binding in cmMTB-treated cells (
