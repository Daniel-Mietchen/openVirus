<p>We then assessed the role of Siglec-1 in HIV-1 transfer between macrophages, as this receptor is also important for the transfer of the virus to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Puryear et al., 2013</xref>). We used an established co-culture system between cmMTB-treated macrophages that allows the transfer of the viral Gag protein from infected (donor, Gag
 <sup>+</sup>, red) to uninfected (recipient, CellTracker
 <sup>+</sup>, green) cells over 24 hr (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Of note, since Siglec-1 facilitates the infection of macrophages (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), we used VSV-G pseudotyped viruses to avoid any effect on HIV-1 primo-infection. Like this, we ensured the viral content was equal in cells at the time of the co-culture despite the loss of Siglec-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The siRNA-mediated depletion of Siglec-1 significantly diminished the capacity of cmMTB-treated macrophages to transfer HIV-1 to recipient cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that this receptor is involved in the macrophage-to-macrophage viral spread (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Souriant et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, there was a decreasing tendency for the capacity of Siglec-1-depleted cmMTB-treated macrophages to transfer mitochondria to recipient cells compared to controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), alluding to a possible defect in mechanisms involved in intercellular material transfer including through thick TNT (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we showed that silencing Siglec-1 expression in cmMTB-treated cells abolished the exacerbation of HIV-1 infection and production, as well as the enhanced formation of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) (
