<p>We agree with the reviewers in pointing out the need to confirm this issue. Originally, we decided to quantify specifically alveolar macrophages based on their location (within the alveolus), morphology (mononuclear cells with a large cytoplasm), and our previous characterization of these cells that are CD68
 <sup>+</sup>CD163
 <sup>+</sup> (Lastrucci et al., 2015; Souriant et al., 2019). As the reviewers correctly point out, these quantifications were provided in the original Figure 1F (Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages) and Figure 2H (pSTAT1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages) based on a single representative NHP. In addition, we also provided the quantification of both Siglec-1+ (original Figure 1G) and pSTAT-1 (original Figure 2F) found in the whole lung parenchyma tissue (per mm
 <sup>2</sup>) and based on a single representative NHP. On this latter point, although we previously determined most leukocytes are CD68
 <sup>+</sup>CD163
 <sup>+</sup> (Lastrucci et al., 2015; Souriant et al., 2019), we did not expect all leukocytes to be only the macrophages in question, specifically for the pSTAT1 marker that is ubiquitously activated in most leukocytes during an infection context. Therefore, we were not surprised that pSTAT-1
 <sup>+</sup> leukocytes (per mm
 <sup>2</sup>) were strongly present in the ATB group compared to ATB-SIV, as tuberculosis is well known to activate the IFN-I/STAT-1 signalling pathway (Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018).
