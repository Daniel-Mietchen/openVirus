<p>Likewise, we performed a similar quantification analysis of the cumulative number of lung parenchyma tissue cells that are positive for pSTAT1 (revised Figure 2F), and we still confirmed that lung parenchyma tissue Siglec-1
 <sup>+</sup> leukocytes are highly abundant in the ATB group compared to the co-infected one. As the main message of our study is that a tuberculosis-associated environment leads to the upregulation of Siglec-1, and thus to susceptibility in the context of HIV-1 co-infection, we argue the results obtained in the lung parenchyma (in combination to those found in alveolar macrophages) are coherent and support our hypothesis.
