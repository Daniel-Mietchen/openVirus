<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concern on this matter. First, we addressed this issue in our original research article where we optimized an siRNA-mediated gene silencing method in primary human macrophages, dendritic cells and monocytes (Troegeler et al., 2014). In this protocol, the used of ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool (according to Dharmarcon Inc instructions) for various genes were demonstrated to: i) specifically inactivate the desired gene of interest without affecting the expression of other related genes, ii) no effect on cell death, iii) no effect in the mononuclear phagocyte maturation and activation status, and iv) no effect on the mononuclear phagocyte capacity to phagocytose and migrate in different 3D environments. Second, the results obtained for Siglec-1 depletion by siRNA-mediated gene silencing were also validated using an alternate method based on blocking antibodies (see Figure 4—figure supplement 4D and E). Within this context, there is no cross-reaction of this monoclonal antibody with the closest molecules to Siglec-1, which are Siglec-5 and Siglec-7 (Perez-Zsolt et al., 2019, 10.1038/s41564-019-0453-2). Finally, we decided to measure other markers that are important to characterized the M(IL-10) phenotype induced by the cmMTB-treated in cells depleted for Siglec-1 by siRNA-mediated gene silencing. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, while Siglec-1 expression is reduced cmMTB-treated cells from three independent donors, the expression of the CD16 and CD163 markers remained unchanged. Altogether, these results indicate that our siRNA-mediated gene silencing method applied to reduce the expression of Siglec-1 is unlikely to have off-target activity.
