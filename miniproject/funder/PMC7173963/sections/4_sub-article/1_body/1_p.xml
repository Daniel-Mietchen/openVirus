<p>We agree with the reviewers in pointing out the need to confirm this issue. First, it has been previously demonstrated that the IFNAR-2 blocking antibody reduces both the percentage of induction and level of expression of Siglec-1 triggered by the plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Pino et al., 2015). Second, as illustrated now in revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, the IFNAR-2 blocking antibody reduces the percentage of cmMTB-treated macrophages expressing Siglec-1, complementing the overall inhibition of the induction and level of expression of Siglec-1 in these cells (Figure 1C-D), as measured by flow cytometry analysis. Modifications to the revised manuscript have been annotated to incorporate Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. Last, we performed additional experiments to measure the intracellular levels of Siglec-1 expression in cmMTB-treated cells by an immunofluorescence approach. Results confirmed that, as opposed to cmCTR treatment, cmMTB increases the intracellular levels of Siglec-1 expression (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Upon blocking of the IFNAR-2, we observed a decreasing tendency in the percentage of cell expressing Siglec-1 intracellularly (

Collectively, these observations indicate that IFNAR inhibition leads to both decreased levels of expression (extra- and intracellularly) of Siglec-1 and a lower percentage of cells expressing this receptor as induced by cmMTB treatment.
