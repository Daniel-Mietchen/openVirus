 <p>2) Are Mtb-derived factors required for Siglec1-mediated HIV-1 transfer phenotype? An earlier study by some of the authors (Martinez-Picado et al., 2016) showed that lack of Siglec1 in HIV-1 infected patients does not have impact in HIV-1 acquisition or AIDS outcome. This original article has not been discussed in the present manuscript and could be important since the authors suggest Siglec1 as a new potential therapeutic target to limit viral dissemination. Please consider these findings and discuss them appropriately.</p>
