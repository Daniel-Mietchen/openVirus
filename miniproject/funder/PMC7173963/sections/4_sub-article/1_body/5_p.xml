<p>We appreciate the reviewersâ€™ suggestion. It is worth mentioning that decreasing tendency of mitochondrial transfer among cmMTB-treated cells depleted for Siglec-1 occurs in the absence of HIV-1 infection (Figure 4E). The fact that TNT-mediated mitochondria transfer is known to mediate metabolic changes in recipient cells, we intend to dissect whether Siglec-1 is responsible for modulating key energy-based metabolic pathways in recipient cells, such as aerobic glycolysis, pentose phosphate and lipid metabolism. This fascinating issue could have strong consequences to heath and disease beyond the infectious disease context. For this reason, as suggested by reviewers, we have now included a brief discussion in the revised text (Discussion, last paragraph).</p>
