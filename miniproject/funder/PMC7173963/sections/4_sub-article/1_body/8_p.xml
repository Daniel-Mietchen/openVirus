<p>Nevertheless, we decided to now provide a more robust quantification analysis based on the cumulative number of alveolar macrophages that are positive for Siglec-1 (revised Figure 1F), pSTAT1 (revised Figure 2H, top), or both markers (revised Figure 2H, bottom), grouped from three independent animals for each NHP group. Moreover, we also provide the raw quantification for each image field containing the lung alveoli that was obtained from the three independent animals per NHP group to give the reviewer a general idea of the correlation found in alveolar macrophages that are positive for either Siglec-1 and pSTAT1 (

 <sup>+</sup>pSTAT1
 <sup>+</sup> alveolar macrophages in the co-infected NHP group compared to the others.
