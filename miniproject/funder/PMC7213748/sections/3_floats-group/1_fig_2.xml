 <caption>
  <title>The reported ZIKV cases, excess (or surplus) GBS cases and GBS-to-ZIKV ratio in the NE region of Brazil from January 2015 to November 2016.</title>
  <p>The red dotted line represents weekly ZIKV disease cases, the dark blue dotted line represents weekly surplus GBS cases and the light blue bars are GBS-to-ZIKV ratios. The CHIKV outbreak of 2016 is denoted with different shades of green according to number of weekly cases. The GBS-to-ZIKV ratios are not plotted for the initial few weeks as the scale of the ZIKV data is not large enough to compute a meaningful ratio.</p>
