<p>We considered different values of 
 <italic>θ</italic> (proportion of symptomatic cases) and 
 <italic>η</italic> (infectivity scale of asymptomatic) in this study. It is worth noting that 
 <italic>η</italic> is a parameter that was overlooked previously. The values of 
 <italic>θ</italic> we used, and our estimated IAR are in line with previous studies, e.g. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] in Martinique. According to Cousien 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] as well as the key literature they refer to, “the proportion of asymptomatic infections (40% with 95%CI of 23-56%) was low compared with previous estimates from a Yap island outbreak (80%) or among pregnant women in French Guiana (77%). However, it was consistent with estimates obtained in a household investigation in Puerto Rico (43%), a sero-survey in French Polynesia (50%), a survey among blood donors Martinique (45%), and the reanalysis of surveillance data from French overseas territories (&lt;50%).” Our current setting of 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.5 and 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.2, i.e., asymptomatic of 50% and 80% respectively, are consistent with these previous studies, and cover the indicated range.
