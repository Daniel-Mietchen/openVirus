<p>Continuing further, we now attempt to estimate the reporting rate of ZIKV. We argue that the reporting rate of ZIKV disease increased dramatically around February and March of 2016, as suggested also in the literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the data for the second wave of ZIKV in 2016 is more reliable than that of the first. Taking the maximum of the second ZIKV wave divided by the maximum of the GBS wave, we find the ratio between the two diseases is 436; i.e., 1 GBS case per 436 reported ZIKV cases. However, our model fitting finds a ratio between GBS and symptomatic ZIKV cases as 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.000061, or 1 GBS case per 16,400 ZIKV symptomatic cases. Thus, we can conclude that the reporting ratio of symptomatic ZIKV cases is roughly 16, 400/436 ≈ 38. Namely, for every 38 symptomatic ZIKV cases, there was 1 case reported, over the second wave in 2016. Hence we arrive at an estimate for the reporting ratio of ZIKV, namely 1:38. Moreover, as mentioned, when taking this reporting ratio into account our estimated IAR falls in the reasonable range 22% to 28% for the two waves.
