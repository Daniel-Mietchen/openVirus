<p>The epidemiological modelling approach used in this paper (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0007502.e004">Eq (1)</xref>), is based on the assumption that populations are mixing homogeneously and climate variables are spatially homogeneous over NE Brazil. We discuss our justification in using these assumptions in great depth in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007502.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The assumption of mixing populations in a region this size is often considered a workable approximation for epidemiological models given modern commuting patterns, given the robustness of the SIR modelling approach, and given the ability of an infection to rapidly spread through a large set of cities that are even weakly connected within a country. The same approach has been used in many related papers and appears to be successful when used with care. Previous studies in large populations, such as measles in England and Wales (population size 50 million [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]), have yielded acceptable results. Our modelling framework (the temperature function and using GBS as a proxy for ZIKV) would work better if more data were available at the city or state level, but currently this is not obtainable.
