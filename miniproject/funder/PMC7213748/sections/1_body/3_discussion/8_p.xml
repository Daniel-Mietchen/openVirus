 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows the dynamics in a time of these two conditions are almost identical apart from a delay of 23 weeks and differing otherwise by a scale factor. The remarkable similarity in the different epidemic time series allows us to compare the rates of GBS cases to those of microcephaly. By examining the peak heights of the two diseases, the ratio between them is 6.1 (maximum of microcephaly divided by maximum of GBS wave), which corresponds to 1 GBS case for every 6.1 microcephaly cases. If we make the reasonable assumption that the reporting rate of both conditions is similar, it is clear that GBS is a much rarer disease than microcephaly. Nevertheless, we still chose to predict ZIKV cases based on GBS rather than microcephaly cases, because of problems in the correct reporting of microcephaly over the study period. For example, the criteria for identifying microcephaly changed dramatically at different times over the two year period and in different areas, making the reporting coverage highly unstable. Moreover, previous to this period, reporting was not compulsory nor was there consistently defined criteria for identifying the condition.
