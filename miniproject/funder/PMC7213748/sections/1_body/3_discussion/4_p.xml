<p>Based on the parallel between cases of ZIKV disease and cases of GBS (eg., as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we have proposed a ZIKV model that is calibrated on case data of GBS. ZIKV case numbers are obtained by scaling up from GBS. The advantage of this practice is that the GBS case numbers are more trustworthy and reliable compared to numbers obtained through surveillance of ZIKV where there is much scope for errors in the reporting rate. Our model considers heterogeneity in symptomatic and asymptomatic ZIKV infections (i.e., 
 <italic>θ</italic> and 
 <italic>η</italic>) as well as the local mosquito population (
 <italic>m</italic>). Model (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0007502.e004">1</xref>) was fitted to the reported excess GBS cases time series with different sets of parameters for symptomatic proportion (
 <italic>θ</italic>) and asymptomatic infectivity (
 <italic>η</italic>).
