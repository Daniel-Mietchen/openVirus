<p>A careful discussion on the limitations of aggregating the weather data, as used in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007502.s001">S1 Text</xref>. There we explain that our approach in which data is spatially aggregated was inspired from the success of de Oliveira 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in studying Zika virus and its impact on human populations including microcephaly numbers and its relation to GBS. Their analysis heavily relies on the property that there is coherence in the dynamics of infectives and microcephaly populations when aggregated over all NE Brazil. That is the spatially averaged data generates a coherent and meaningful signal in time. We also demonstrate that spatial climate homogeneity, the assumption behind spatial aggregation, is a reasonable approximation according to recent literature on the climate distribution of NE Brazil.
