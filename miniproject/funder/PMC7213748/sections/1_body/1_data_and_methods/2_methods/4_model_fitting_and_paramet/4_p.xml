<p>The term 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is the time delay between the occurrence of weather factors and their effects on the GBS epidemic. It contains the lagged effect on the local mosquito population, the progress from ZIKV to GBS development and any reporting delay. Previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] suggest there exists a time delay of at least 3 weeks between the exposure of patients to ZIKV and the development of GBS (i.e., an incubation period plus a typical reporting delay). For the mosquito, the life cycle progresses from an egg to an adult, and maturity takes approximately 8-10 days [

 <sub>0</sub> = 3 × 7 + (8 + 10)/2 = 30 days.
