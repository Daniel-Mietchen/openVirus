<p>Brazil has a territory of more than 8.5 million km
 <sup>2</sup> and is one of the largest countries in the world with an estimated population of 211 million [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The Northeastern (NE) region of Brazil is one of five regions, and has an area of 1.6 million km
 <sup>2</sup>. The region has a population of 57 million, but 75% of the population live in the major cities of the coastal area which stops at the Atlantic on the East. While larger Brazil exhibits spatially heterogeneous climate trends, a large part of the heterogeneity can be attributed to its five relatively homogeneous climate regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We are interested in the NE Brazil climate region, which temporally has a known seasonal cycle in terms of climate variables, e.g., temperature and rainfall, that impresses itself over all the region, and is relatively spatially uniform especially over the coastal areas.
