<p>We fit model (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0007502.e004">1</xref>) based on the reported excess GBS cases time series shown by the dark blue dotted line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref>. This was repeated for different sets of baseline parameters, with several different (possible) values of 
 <italic>η</italic> (asymptomatic ZIKV relative infectivity) and 
 <italic>θ</italic> (proportion of symptomatic ZIKV infections) considered. The 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.5 simulations correspond to a 1:1 ratio of the symptomatic to asymptomatic ZIKV infection of [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Simulations with 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.2 correspond to the 4:1 ratio of the symptomatic to asymptomatic ZIKV infection of [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
