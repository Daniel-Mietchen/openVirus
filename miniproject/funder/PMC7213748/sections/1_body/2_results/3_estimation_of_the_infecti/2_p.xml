<p>To calculate the number of ZIKV cases and the IAR, we use the estimate obtained for 
 <italic>ρ</italic> (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.00061—ratio of reported GBS to symptomatic ZIKV), and denote the ZIKV symptomatic ratio as 
 <italic>θ</italic>, as before. 
 <italic>ρ</italic> can be estimated from the model. Then, the number of ZIKV cases equals (the number of reported GBS) ÷ [reported GBS/symptomatic ZIKV] ÷ (ZIKV symptomatic ratio), which is the number of the reported GBS/
 <italic>ρ</italic>/
 <italic>θ</italic>. The IAR equals the number ZIKV cases ÷ the total population in the NE Brazil.
