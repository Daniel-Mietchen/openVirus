<p>The estimates of the GBS/ZIKV ratio 
 <italic>ρ</italic> and the IAR are summarised in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. For the ZIKV symptomatic ratio parameter, 
 <italic>θ</italic>, we follow the previous serological study conducted in French Polynesia that found the asymptomatic: symptomatic case ratio as 1: 1 in the general population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, 
 <italic>θ</italic> is set at 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.5 for the scenarios in the main results section. But with thus setting (
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.5), the estimation of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> is found to sit roughly at 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.000063 (= 0.0063%). This appears to hold even if 
 <italic>η</italic>, the relative infectivity of the asymptomatics, is changed over the interval (0, 1). Estimates of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> thus appear to be reasonably insensitive to the change of relative infectivity of the asymptomatics (
 <italic>η</italic>). However, 
 <italic>ρ</italic> is sensitive to the change of the symptomatic proportion of ZIKV infections (
 <italic>θ</italic>). Setting 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.2 gives 
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.00013, but as 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> reveals, this result is also relatively insensitive to changes in 
 <italic>η</italic>.
