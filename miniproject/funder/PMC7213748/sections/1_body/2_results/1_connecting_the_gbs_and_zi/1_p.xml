 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g001">Fig 1</xref> plots the time series of ZIKV cases and GBS from the period April 1 of 2015 to March 31 of 2016. The data are an aggregation of the six countries Columbia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, and Venezuela as well as the Bahia State in Brazil. These time series demonstrate the tight connection between the reported ZIKV disease and GBS, whose case numbers closely mimic one another in time. The connection is the basis of our method for estimating ZIKV cases from GBS reports, which as we have discussed, are by their nature, reasonably reliable records.
