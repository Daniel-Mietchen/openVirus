<p>The Zika virus (ZIKV) was first identified in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and within a few years was found spreading in human populations of Nigeria [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Transmitted through the bites of mosquito vectors (usually of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus), ZIKV is an arbovirus from the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other transmission routes have also been found (materno-fetal, sexual transmission, and via blood transfusion) but they are less common [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By the 1970s, the virus was circulating widely in West Africa, although it was considered a relatively mild human infection that generally results in only fever, rash and possibly conjunctivitis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By 2007, the virus had escaped Africa to the island of Yap in Micronesia where, according to some estimates, it infected up to 75% of the island population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ZIKV reached Polynesia in 2013, and at least by 2015, it had invaded Brazil and then very quickly the rest of South America where it reached epidemic levels [
