<p>However, it seems a reasonable approximation to assume that the number of GBS cases per ZIKV infected individual should remain constant in time, and that the reported GBS cases are relatively well reported over time. The reporting criteria of GBS should be relatively accurate and stable owing to the distinct identifiable and severe clinical features of GBS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. By assuming the GBS-ZIKV risk ratio is constant, we attempted to fit an epidemic model and infer this ratio based on the GBS cases time series. Because of the co-circulation of both dengue fever and ZIKV during the two waves, misdiagnoses of ZIKV could occur [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], especially given both diseases have similar symptoms. Nevertheless, no GBS induced DENV was reported in the 2015 and 2016 years. Thus, the large-scale ZIKV outbreak was the major source of the excess GBS cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. For these reasons, we use the excess GBS cases time series to infer the pattern of ZIKV outbreak and the overall IAR of ZIKV in Northeastern Brazil.
