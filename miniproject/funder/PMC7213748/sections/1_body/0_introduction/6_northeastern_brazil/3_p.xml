<p>Our work is based on the fact that it is difficult to estimate the infection attack rate (IAR) of ZIKV directly from the reported ZIKV cases time series given the non-constant reporting efforts over 2015 and 2016. In the literature, estimates of the IAR of ZIKV in Brazil (especially Northeast Region of Brazil) vary from less than 20% to more than 60%, and thus appear inconclusive. A summary table is provided in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007502.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Most previous works were based on unreliable ZIKV surveillance data. In this work, we aim to use the relatively reliable GBS data in NE Brazil to infer the ZIKV epidemic.
