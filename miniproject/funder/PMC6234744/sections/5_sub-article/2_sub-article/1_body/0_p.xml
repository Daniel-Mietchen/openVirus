 <bold>The study is a nice examination of the complexity and scope of RV circulation. It adds to an established but growing literature acknowledging that “rhinovirus” is not one virus, but a large group of distinct viruses capable of apparently independent co-circulation. This circulation includes the majority of genotypes (types) at a single location over time using molecular methods augmented with sequencing. The paper notes some important aspects for further study.</bold>
