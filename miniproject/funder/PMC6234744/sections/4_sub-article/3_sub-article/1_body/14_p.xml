<p>The reviewer is correct that the reason for considering as negative samples with Ct&gt;=35.0 was not explained in ref 27. We apologize for this oversight. The cut-off value of Ct 35.0 was given in the paper describing the protocol that this study followed (Hammitt et al. 2011), Â but the rationale for setting the cut-off at 35.0 was not given. The reference for this paper has now been added to the manuscript on Laboratory procedures section. In addition, experience has shown us that VP4/VP2 RT-PCR often (95%) fails for samples with Ct &gt; 35.0.</p>
