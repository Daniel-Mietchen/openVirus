<p>We are aware of one other study showing multiple typical mini-epidemics (Sansone et al. 2013).The study demonstrates that simultaneous and successive epidemics caused by different HRV types contributed to high HRV incidence and enabled HRV to remain in the local population for extended periods. We have added text in the Discussion section (page14) to this effect.</p>
