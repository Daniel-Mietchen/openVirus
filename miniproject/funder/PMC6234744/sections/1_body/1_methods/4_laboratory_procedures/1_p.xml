<p>Viral RNA was extracted from each sample using QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California, USA, Catalog number: 52906) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Diagnostic PCR was performed to confirm the presence of HRV genetic material using real-time RT-PCR with the following primers and probes; forward primer (TGGACAGGGTGTGAAGAGC, reverse primer (CAAAGTAGTCGGTCCCATCC) and probe (VIC-TCCTCCGGCCCCTGAATG-TAMRA) (Applied Biosystems, United Kingdom, Catalog number 00-45-0818, 00-45-0819 and 00-45-0820) targeting the 5’ UTR using the following thermocycling conditions; 20 min at 50°C for reverse transcription, 5 min for 95°C for polymerase activation and 40 cycles of 15s at 95°C and 30s at 60°C as previously described

 </sup>. The PCR runs included positive control (of known DNA copies) of the targeted 5’UTR product generated in-house. Samples were quantified based on comparison to the positive control sample. Samples were considered positive if Ct value &lt;= 35.0

 </sup>. To amplify VP4/VP2 coding region was amplified for the HRV-positive samples, we used a single step PCR adapted from a nested VP4/VP2 -PCR assay previously described

 </sup>. Forward primer OS (CCGGCCCCTGAATGYGGCTAA) and reverse primer IAS (TCWGGHARYTTCCAMCACCANCC) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom, catalog number 00-45-0816 and 00-45-0817) were used in a RT-PCR reaction using Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Valencia, Catalog number: 210212). Thermocycling conditions were set as follows: Reverse transcription of the RNA to cDNA at 50°C for 30 minutes, in-activation of reverse transcriptase and activation of Taq polymerase at 95°C for 15 minutes. This was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 minute, annealing at 60°C for 1 minute and strand extension at 72°C for 1 min and final incubation/extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. Purified PCR products were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA, Catalog number 4337455) using the PCR primers in both forward and reverse direction in an ABI Prism 3130×l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).
