<p>Between December 2015 and November 2016 inclusive, a total of 5750 participants were recruited and NPS samples collected from 5744 (99.9%) participants as shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Of the 5744 samples collected, 5741 (99.9%) were tested for HRV. HRV was detected in 1057 (18.5%) of the samples tested. Of the 1057, 817 (77.3%) were successfully amplified and sequenced for the VP4/VP2 genomic region; the remaining 240 (22.7%) samples either totally failed amplification or had short consensus sequences recovered (&lt;300 nucleotides) and were not included in phylogenetic analysis.
