<p>HRV circulated throughout the study period as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>. All HRV species were detected in all months except in December 2015 when only A and C were detected, although fewer samples were collected in this month. HRV incidence peaks were observed in August, September and October, while troughs were observed in December 2015 and January 2016, which was likely due to fewer samples collected in the first two months of the study. Despite HRV-C being the most prevalent, there was a varying dominance between HRV-A and HRV-C with time ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). HRV species A appeared dominant in December, January, February, May, June, July, October and November while HRV species C dominated in the months of March, April, August and September (
