  <p>The PRNT conducted on 40 representative patient sera against DENV-1 and DENV-2. Patient sera were diluted in 1:25 and incubated with 20–40 PFUs of DENV-1 or DENV-2 for 1-h at 37 °C. Each virus-serum mixture was then inoculated onto Vero cell monolayer and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> for 1-h. After virus adsorption, inoculums were removed from the cells, which was followed by the addition of CMC overlay medium. Plates were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub> for four days. The viral plaques were then detected and visualized via focus formation assay. The percentage of plaque reduction was calculated relative to the number of plaques in the virus controls
