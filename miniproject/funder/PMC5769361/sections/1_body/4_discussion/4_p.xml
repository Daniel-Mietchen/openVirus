<p id="Par53">Despite having relatively low incidence of reported dengue cases in Segamat district, an overwhelming 86.6% of participants had serological evidence of previous DENV exposure, out of which 11.2% were recent exposures. This discrepancy could be attributed to the dengue notification system in Malaysia, which is based on passive reporting and may not reflect the actual disease burden due to underreporting, misreporting [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the failure to capture subclinical infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This disparity is further supported by the finding that, overall, only 12.9% of participants with serological evidence of dengue exposure had recollection of having had a dengue infection. They were not diagnosed clinically by a healthcare professional, as they were either asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms not necessitating medical attention or hospitalization. The nonspecific nature of symptoms misattributing it to other febrile illnesses may partly account for this [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our findings suggest a possibility that a high number of subclinical dengue cases are present in this community. This corroborates the iceberg phenomena that most dengue infections are clinically unapparent and are consistent with high rates reported in countries such as Singapore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], South India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and Saudi Arabia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].
