<p id="Par58">A limitation of dengue serological surveys is the known cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as JE and yellow fever. However, the high IgG seropositivity in our study most likely reflects the actual prevalence of DENV in the studied community, as there have been no reported cases of JE in Segamat district. Furthermore, other flaviviruses such as yellow fever and West Nile virus have never been reported or recognized in Malaysia, and each of the participants were explicitly asked whether they had been vaccinated for yellow fever or JE virus. In addition, this study was conducted prior to the introduction of Zika virus and there have been no reported cases of Zika virus infections in the Segamat district. Most convincingly, the PRNT assay performed on random samples of IgG-positive sera showed that the detected antibodies were indeed specific to DENV.</p>
