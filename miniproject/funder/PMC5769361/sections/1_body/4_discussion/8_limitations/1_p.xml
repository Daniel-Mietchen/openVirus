<p id="Par57">The key limitation we faced in this study was the relatively small sample size from a single study site (with three sub-sites). However, this pilot study was conducted to ascertain DENV seroprevalence in an ostensible population, rather than establishing generalizable seroprevalence rates. Furthermore, despite the relatively small number, there was a very high exposure of the studied population to DENV, providing evidence for the need to perform larger-scale prospective longitudinal studies, and perhaps even revising the current surveillance system.</p>
