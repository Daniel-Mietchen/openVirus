<p id="Par55">Studies have shown an association between water storage in containers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and past dengue infections. Although this factor was not measured in our study, all households in our study sites have availability of pipe water and sewage system, reducing the need to store water in containers, which are potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes. A notable finding was that 75.3% of participants in the rural site had been exposed to dengue, with no difference between the rural, urban, or semi-urban sites. Although previously regarded a disease of urban areas in Malaysia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], recent studies suggest its extent to rural population as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Population mixing facilitated by the efficiency of modern transportation networks, growing vector population, and changes in the usage of agricultural land in rural areas have contributed to homogeneousness in dengue risk between urban and rural areas [
