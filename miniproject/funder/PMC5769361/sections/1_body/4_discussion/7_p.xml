<p id="Par56">Serological evidence of recent infection was noted in 11.2% of participants. These rates were comparable to those in Venezuela [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereas higher rates were reported in South India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Conversely a study conducted in Singapore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported only 2.6% of recent infections. Contrary to the association of age with past DENV infection, recent infection did not display age differences. Chinese ethnicity, housing type, study site, and family history were associated with recent dengue infection in the univariate analysis. It seems likely that this pattern resulted from recent outbreaks with silent transmission of DENV in urban and semi-urban study sites that are populated predominantly by the Chinese. However, none of these factors remained significant predictors of recent infection in the multivariate analysis.
