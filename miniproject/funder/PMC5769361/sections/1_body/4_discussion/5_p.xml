<p id="Par54">The multivariate analysis showed that the older age was the only factor associated with past DENV infections. The prevalence of IgG antibodies increased with increasing age, with &gt;98% of the population having been exposed to dengue after the age of 55Â years. Several studies have shown an association between age and IgG dengue seropositivity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], consistent with the long-term persistence of anti-DENV IgG once a person is infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The increased seroprevalence with age suggests that the longer a person resides in an endemic area, the higher the chance of being infected by DENV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Ethnicity and being of the male sex, which have previously been reported as risk factors for past DENV infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], were not found to be associated in our analysis and other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Concurring with several studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we found no statistical association between past DENV infections and occupation. Although lower educational attainment was associated with higher seroprevalence, it did not remain a significant risk factor after controlling for other risk factors. Previous studies have shown a differing relationship when assessing the impact of income, education, structural housing condition, overcrowding, and socioeconomic status on DENV infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although some studies have shown an inverse association between DENV infections and socioeconomic status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], other studies showed no clear association [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The type of housing, which was either single-story or double-story terrace, did not determine seropositivity. In a Malaysian study, the incidence of dengue was higher in areas with interconnected houses (terrace houses, apartments, and flats) as compared to independent houses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], although such a comparison was not possible in our study as all participants lived in terrace houses.
