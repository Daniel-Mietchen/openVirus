<p id="Par51">The high seroprevalence found in this study mirrors another nationwide cross-sectional study conducted in Malaysia, in which 91.6% of healthy adults aged 35–74 years were DENV seropositive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, studies conducted amongst the urban population attending primary health clinics in Malaysia reported lower rates, ranging between 61% and 67% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While the seroprevalence rates in our study were higher compared to those amongst adults in Singapore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Pakistan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and South India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have reported higher rates, with almost universal exposure to DENV.
