<p id="Par22">The aim of this pilot study was to determine the seroprevalence of DENV infections in a healthy adult population in a rural district in Southern Malaysia, and to identify factors associated with seropositivity. As a pilot study, the aim was not to establish generalizable seroprevalence rates, but to ascertain seroprevalence levels in an ostensibly healthy population.</p>
