<p id="Par21">With the changing epidemiology of DENV infections in Malaysia, it has become increasingly important to obtain up-to-date seroprevalence data to further understand the distribution and burden of DENV infections. Seroprevalence studies help identify populations previously infected by dengue. This is important because the lifelong immunity developed after infection with one of the four DENV serotypes is type-specific; secondary infection by heterologous serotype is frequently, but not exclusively, associated with severe dengue manifestations [
