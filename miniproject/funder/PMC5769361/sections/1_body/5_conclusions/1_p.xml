<p id="Par60">Data from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence that people of the Segamat rural community in Southern Malaysia had a very high previous exposure to DENV. Despite this, below 13% of participants recalled having dengue in the past, suggesting a potentially large reservoir of subclinical infection with unrecognized transmission lurking in this community, undetected by the official surveillance system. Future larger-scale studies should be conducted, as the findings have implications for enumerating disease burden, hypothesizing effects on DENV vaccine efficacy and uptake, determining disease severity and transmission dynamics, and identifying high-risk areas to target dengue prevention and control activities [
