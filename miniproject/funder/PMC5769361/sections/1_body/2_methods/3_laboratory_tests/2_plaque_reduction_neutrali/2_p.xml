<p id="Par33">The PRNT was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with some modifications. Virus strains used were DENV-1 (TM100; Acc: KU666942) and DENV-2 (TM213; Acc: KU666947) isolated from dengue-infected patients in Johor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The PRNT was conducted in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells). A total of 96 patient sera together with DENV-1 and DENV-2 positive and negative sera were heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and diluted at single dilution of 1:25 using an infection medium (1× MEM containing 2% inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic, and 1% HEPES) as the diluent. An equal volume of diluted dengue virus (DENV-1 or DENV-2) was added to each of the patient sera and controls at the final virus concentration of 20–40 plaque-forming units (PFUs)/0.1 ml. The virus-serum mixtures were mixed well and then incubated at 37 °C for 1-h. Following this, 100 μl of the virus-serum mixture was added to the fully confluent Vero cell monolayers (in 24-well tissue culture plates) and incubated for another hour at 37 °C. Following incubation, inoculum was removed from the cells and 1 ml of 2% CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) overlay medium was added into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for four days. The virus controls were diluted to the final concentration of 20–40 PFUs/0.1 ml.
