<p id="Par35">The PRNT
 <sub>70</sub> titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest original serum dilution including the 1:2 dilution factor that was introduced by adding an equal volume of virus to the diluted serum during the neutralization step, in which viral plaque is reduced by 70% when compared to the average plaque count of virus control. In this study, a PRNT
 <sub>70</sub> titer of â‰¥50 to both DENV-1 and DENV-2 or to either DENV-1 or DENV-2 alone was considered positive for DENV.
