<p id="Par34">On day 4 post-infection, focus formation assay involving immunostaining of DENV was performed. Briefly, the overlay medium was removed and cell monolayers were fixed with cold 80% acetone for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with a blocking buffer (wash buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 45 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody, a mouse monoclonal DENV type 1, 2, 3, and 4 antibody (GeneTex, Inc., CA, USA) at 37 °C for 1-h. A secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), was added onto fixed cells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1-h. The foci (viral plaques) were visualized using NBT (nitrotetrazolium blue chloride) and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) substrate system (Bio Basic, Inc., NY, USA), and the number of plaques were counted. Serum samples were tested simultaneously against each DENV strain; each serum was tested once at one dilution of 1/50. A PRNT
 <sub>70</sub> at 1/50 dilution cut-off was chosen to ensure that cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses could be ruled out.
