<p id="Par30">Three serological tests were performed to detect DENV antibodies. All were enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. First, serum samples were tested using Panbio® Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), which detects immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at levels indicative of past exposure to dengue. Second, serum samples were tested using Panbio® Dengue IgG Capture ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). This kit provides serological evidence of recent secondary DENV infections as it detects only high IgG levels (titers ≥1:2560), thereby distinguishing them from any past infections. Third, serum samples were tested using Panbio® Dengue IgM Capture ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), with positive values indicative of recent primary DENV infections.</p>
