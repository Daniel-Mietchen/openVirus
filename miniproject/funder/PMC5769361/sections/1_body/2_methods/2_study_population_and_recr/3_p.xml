 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An open invitation was sent to eligible participants through flyers dropped to their homes and was followed up with visits by SEACO data collectors to confirm participation and provide information sheets ahead of consent. Participants were then invited on a specified date to the community hall. A total of 308 agreed to participate, however, 31 did not show up. The final sample was therefore 277 (consisting of 202 Malay and 75 Chinese) participants; i.e. 83% of the target sample.
