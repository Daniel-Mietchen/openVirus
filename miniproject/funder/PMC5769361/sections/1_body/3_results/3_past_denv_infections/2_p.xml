<p id="Par44">Seropositivity generally increased with age, rising from 48.5% in the age group &lt;25 years to more than 85% in age group of &gt;45 years (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The highest prevalence (89.2%) was noted amongst participants in the age group of 45–54 years. Non-married participants had significantly lower seropositivity rates (54.3%) compared to those who were married or divorced/separated. Seropositivity was inversely related to the level of education. It was highest amongst participants who never attended school or had a primary level education (86.6%) and lowest amongst those who attended college or university (60.5%) (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). No significant differences were detected between seropositivity and sex, ethnicity, occupation, or comorbidity. Students had lower seroprevalence (45.5%) compared to the employed, unemployed, and housewives who had higher rates in the range of 72–78%; however, the differences were not statistically significant. There was no difference in seropositivity amongst participants residing in the urban (76.7%), semi-urban (74.1%), or rural sites (75.3%) or between the types of houses they resided in (single-story verses double-story terrace). Similarly, history of family members with dengue did not determine seropositivity, with only 20.1% (42/209) of participants with past dengue infections reporting a family history of dengue.
