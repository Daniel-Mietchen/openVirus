<p id="Par41">Serological evidence of previous exposure to DENV as denoted by a positive dengue anti-IgG indirect ELISA was identified in the serum samples of 240 (86.6%) participants (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 83–91%). Of the participants aged ≤24 years, 60.6% were DENV seropositive; this rose to 98.3% for participants aged ≥55 years. Of the 240 positive serum samples, 22 tested positive for high-titer IgG and another 11 were positive for IgM, indicating recent DENV infections. Two of the 33 samples were positive for both high-titer IgG and IgM. Thus, in total 11.2% (31/277) of participants (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 7–15%) had serological evidence of recent DENV infection and 75.5% (209/277) of participants (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 70–81%) had evidence of a past DENV infection. As expected, all samples tested positive for high-titer IgG were also positive for dengue anti-IgG indirect ELISA. None of the serum samples with recent DENV infections tested positive for NS1 antigen.
