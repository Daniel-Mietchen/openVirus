<p id="Par42">All 96 randomly selected samples showed at least 50% plaque reduction for both DENV-1 and DENV-2 or either DENV-1 or DENV-2. The PRNT conducted on 40 of these samples is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. However, to further minimize cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses, a more stringent value of at least 70% plaque reduction (PRNT
 <sub>70</sub>) for both DENV-1 and DENV-2 or either DENV-1 or DENV-2 was considered positive or specific to DENVs. All the tested sera samples showed a PRNT
 <sub>70</sub> titer ≥50, indicating they were indeed specific to DENV antibodies. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> are representative images of PRNT showing neutralisation along with the positive and negative controls.
