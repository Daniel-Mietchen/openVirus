<p id="Par47">Seroprevalence was significantly higher in the Chinese ethnic group (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.019). Although the three study sites had similar seroprevalence rates for past DENV infections, participants living in the urban and semi-urban sites, where the Chinese predominate, had higher serological evidence of recent infection compared to the rural site, which is populated predominantly by Malays (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.095). Participants living in double-story terrace houses had significantly higher rates of recent DENV infections compared to those living in single-story terrace houses (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.034). There was a significantly higher prevalence of recent DENV infection in participants who reported having family members with a diagnosis of dengue fever (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017); with 38.7% (12/31) reporting a family history. Contrary to past infections, there was no difference in seroprevalence amongst participants with recent infections in the various age groups. Similarly, sex, marital status, occupation, education level, and comorbidity were not risk factors for recent DENV infections.
