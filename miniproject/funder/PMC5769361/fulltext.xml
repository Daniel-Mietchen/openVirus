Despite this, information pertaining to the extent of transmission of dengue virus (DENV) in the rural community is lacking. This community-based pilot study was conducted to establish DENV seroprevalence amongst healthy adults in a rural district in Southern Malaysia, and to identify influencing factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this study undertaken between April and May 2015, a total of 277 adult participants were recruited from households across three localities in the Sungai Segamat subdistrict in Segamat district. Sera were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Panbio&#x000ae; Dengue Indirect IgG ELISA/high-titer capture) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (Panbio&#x000ae;) antibodies. The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was conducted on random samples of IgG-positive sera for further confirmation. Medical history and a recall of previous history of dengue were collected through interviews, whereas sociodemographic information was obtained from an existing database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The overall seroprevalence for DENV infection was 86.6% (240/277) (95% <italic>CI</italic>: 83&#x02013;91%). Serological evidence of recent infection (IgM/high-titer capture IgG) was noted in 11.2% (31/277) of participants, whereas there was evidence of past infection in 75.5% (209/277) of participants (indirect IgG minus recent infections). The PRNT assay showed that the detected antibodies were indeed specific to DENV. The multivariate analysis showed that the older age group was significantly associated with past DENV infections. Seropositivity increased with age; 48.5% in the age group of &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;years to more than 85% in age group of &#x0003e;45&#x000a0;years (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). No associations with occupation, study site, housing type, comorbidity, educational level, and marital status were observed, although the latter two were statistically significant in the univariate analysis. None of the studied factors were significantly associated with recent DENV infections in the multivariate analysis, although there was a pattern suggestive of recent outbreak in two study sites populated predominately by Chinese people. The majority of infections did not give rise to recognizable disease (either asymptomatic or nonspecific symptoms) as only 12.9% of participants (31/240) recalled having dengue in the past.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The predominantly rural community under study had a very high previous exposure to dengue. The finding of a high proportion of unreported cases possibly due to subclinical infections underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and control methods. This finding also has implications for measuring disease burden, understanding transmission dynamics, and hypothesizing effects on DENV vaccine efficacy and uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40249-017-0384-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Dengue virus</kwd><kwd>Rural</kwd><kwd>Community-based study</kwd><kwd>Seroprevalence</kwd><kwd>Subclinical infection</kwd><kwd>Malaysia</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Infection and Immunity Cluster of the Tropical Medicine and Biology Platform of Monash University Malaysia</institution></funding-source><award-id>5140762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Sharifah Syed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Dengue-DSTIN-Flagship MOSTI </institution></funding-source><award-id>NIBM/11-16/008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Sharifah Syed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>SEACO</institution></funding-source><award-id>2500047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allotey</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Multilingual abstracts</title><p id="Par16">Please see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for translations of the abstract into the five official working languages of the United Nations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">In recent decades, dengue virus (DENV) infections have become a major public health concern with an unprecedented geographic expansion worldwide. Infection with any of the four serotypes (DENV-1 &#x02013; 4) belonging to the <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus of the Flaviviridae family can result in clinical manifestations ranging from undifferentiated fever, classical dengue fever, to severe sometimes fatal manifestations characterized by hemorrhage and shock, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">It is estimated that there are 390 million DENV infections globally per year, of which 75% are subclinical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Asian countries bear a disproportionately high burden of DENV infections, accounting for 70% of all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dengue poses a substantial economic and disease burden in Southeast Asia, with an estimated annual average of 214&#x02009;000 (range: 120&#x02009;000&#x02013;299&#x02009;000) disability-adjusted life years lost and an overall annual economic burden of US$950 million (range: US$610&#x02013;1384 million) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Malaysia has experienced an exponential increase in dengue cases despite having well-established dengue control measures. The dengue incidence in Malaysia increased precipitously from 31.6 cases/100&#x02009;000 in 2000 to 361 cases/100&#x02009;000 in 2014, i.e. an 11-fold rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Environmental changes such as rising temperatures, increased rainfall, accelerated urbanization and industrialization, population growth, and poor waste and water management, which leads to the proliferation of mosquito species (<italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>A. albopictus</italic>) that transmit DENV, are all possible reasons for the upsurge of dengue cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Dengue has now become hyperendemic in many countries including Malaysia with all four DENV serotypes co-circulating, with fluctuations of the dominant serotypes over time and location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In recent years, there has been a shift observed in the age distribution of dengue cases toward older age groups, involving adults in the productive age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Another notable shift is the rise in dengue incidence in rural areas, which is gradually approaching the high levels observed in urban communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">With the changing epidemiology of DENV infections in Malaysia, it has become increasingly important to obtain up-to-date seroprevalence data to further understand the distribution and burden of DENV infections. Seroprevalence studies help identify populations previously infected by dengue. This is important because the lifelong immunity developed after infection with one of the four DENV serotypes is type-specific; secondary infection by heterologous serotype is frequently, but not exclusively, associated with severe dengue manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Seroprevalence studies reveal subclinical DENV infections, as the majority of the infections are subclinical and case reporting underestimates the true rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Patients with subclinical infections can contribute to the overall DENV transmission cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, estimating both clinical and subclinical infections provides reliable information to support modeling for future vaccine demand and delivery strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The aim of this pilot study was to determine the seroprevalence of DENV infections in a healthy adult population in a rural district in Southern Malaysia, and to identify factors associated with seropositivity. As a pilot study, the aim was not to establish generalizable seroprevalence rates, but to ascertain seroprevalence levels in an ostensibly healthy population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study area</title><p id="Par23">The study was conducted in the catchment area of the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO), a Malaysian-based health and demographic surveillance site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The SEACO has enumerated the population of five subdistricts in the Segamat district of Johor state, Southern Peninsular Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Embedding this pilot within the SEACO facilitated the identification of a sampling frame and provided the opportunity for linkage of the data to the existing sociodemographic information in the SEACO database.</p><p id="Par24">This study was restricted to Sungai Segamat, the subdistrict identified by the health department as having the highest number of reported dengue cases over the last five years. Participants were recruited from three localities (villages) within the Sungai Segamat subdistrict representing rural, urban, and semi-urban communities. Based on notified dengue cases, the three study localities had been identified as the dengue epicenter in the Sungai Segamat subdistrict since 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study population and recruitment</title><p id="Par25">The comprehensive study protocol has previously been described by Jahan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and is briefly described here. Essentially, this study extended slightly over a one-year period and consisted of four phases of data and blood collection. The first phase was undertaken between April and May 2015. Herein, we report on the first phase only, which provides information on the seroprevalence of dengue in the studied community.</p><p id="Par26">As recent dengue studies in Malaysia show a shifting age distribution toward infections amongst adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], we recruited healthy adults aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years living in the Sungai Segamat subdistrict. The exclusion criteria included: presence of fever (infrared forehead thermometer &#x02265;37.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C at time of recruitment), history of yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination/disease, pregnant women, and patients with terminal illness, organ failure, mental illness, cancer, and/or underlying bleeding disorders.</p><p id="Par27">The target sample was based on a sample size calculation of 333 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An open invitation was sent to eligible participants through flyers dropped to their homes and was followed up with visits by SEACO data collectors to confirm participation and provide information sheets ahead of consent. Participants were then invited on a specified date to the community hall. A total of 308 agreed to participate, however, 31 did not show up. The final sample was therefore 277 (consisting of 202 Malay and 75 Chinese) participants; i.e. 83% of the target sample.</p><p id="Par28">The data and blood collection was done at the local community hall. Firstly, a medical history was obtained from all participants, including a prior diagnosis of dengue, when the diagnosis was made, and whether the participant was hospitalized. All interviews were captured through a structured questionnaire using an Open Data Kit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opendatakit.org/">https://opendatakit.org/</ext-link>) on an Android mobile device. Sociodemographic details such as age, sex, ethnicity, place of residence, marital status, highest education level, and occupation were obtained from the existing SEACO database.</p><p id="Par29">Following the interview, a 5&#x000a0;ml blood sample was drawn from each participant by trained phlebotomists and collected in BD Vacutainer&#x000ae; blood collection tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), using a clot activator and gel separator. Proper storage and transportation of these blood samples from the community hall to the laboratory followed a standard protocol, as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Laboratory tests</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>DENV serology</title><p id="Par30">Three serological tests were performed to detect DENV antibodies. All were enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. First, serum samples were tested using Panbio&#x000ae; Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), which detects immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at levels indicative of past exposure to dengue. Second, serum samples were tested using Panbio&#x000ae; Dengue IgG Capture ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). This kit provides serological evidence of recent secondary DENV infections as it detects only high IgG levels (titers &#x02265;1:2560), thereby distinguishing them from any past infections. Third, serum samples were tested using Panbio&#x000ae; Dengue IgM Capture ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia), with positive values indicative of recent primary DENV infections.</p><p id="Par31">Serum samples were classified as negative if they tested negative on all three ELISA tests. They were classified as a recent infection if the samples tested positive for either immunoglobulin M (IgM) or high-titer IgG. They were classified as a past infection based on the Panbio&#x000ae; Indirect ELISA IgG, but not high-titer IgG ELISA tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. All serum samples showing recent infection were tested for NS1 antigen using Panbio&#x000ae; Dengue Early ELISA (Alere, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)</title><p id="Par32">An additional confirmatory test was performed using the PRNT on 96 out of 240 random samples of Panbio&#x000ae; Indirect ELISA IgG-seropositive serum. The PRNT is considered the gold standard for detecting serotype-specific DENV antibodies and has been widely used to measure specific DENV neutralizing antibodies, especially in studies evaluating the immunogenicity of dengue vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As PRNT is highly laborious, we validated the serum samples against two DENVs only i.e. DENV-1 and DENV-2, as these two were the dominant circulating DENV serotypes in Johor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The PRNT was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], with some modifications. Virus strains used were DENV-1 (TM100; Acc: KU666942) and DENV-2 (TM213; Acc: KU666947) isolated from dengue-infected patients in Johor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The PRNT was conducted in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells). A total of 96 patient sera together with DENV-1 and DENV-2 positive and negative sera were heat inactivated at 56&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min and diluted at single dilution of 1:25 using an infection medium (1&#x000d7; MEM containing 2% inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic, and 1% HEPES) as the diluent. An equal volume of diluted dengue virus (DENV-1 or DENV-2) was added to each of the patient sera and controls at the final virus concentration of 20&#x02013;40 plaque-forming units (PFUs)/0.1&#x000a0;ml. The virus-serum mixtures were mixed well and then incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1-h. Following this, 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l of the virus-serum mixture was added to the fully confluent Vero cell monolayers (in 24-well tissue culture plates) and incubated for another hour at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Following incubation, inoculum was removed from the cells and 1&#x000a0;ml of 2% CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) overlay medium was added into each well. The plates were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for four days. The virus controls were diluted to the final concentration of 20&#x02013;40 PFUs/0.1&#x000a0;ml.</p><p id="Par34">On day 4 post-infection, focus formation assay involving immunostaining of DENV was performed. Briefly, the overlay medium was removed and cell monolayers were fixed with cold 80% acetone for 10&#x000a0;min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with a blocking buffer (wash buffer containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 45&#x000a0;min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody, a mouse monoclonal DENV type 1, 2, 3, and 4 antibody (GeneTex, Inc., CA, USA) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1-h. A secondary antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA), was added onto fixed cells and the plates were incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 1-h. The foci (viral plaques) were visualized using NBT (nitrotetrazolium blue chloride) and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3&#x02032;-indolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) substrate system (Bio Basic, Inc., NY, USA), and the number of plaques were counted. Serum samples were tested simultaneously against each DENV strain; each serum was tested once at one dilution of 1/50.

In fact, there were only five reported cases of dengue from the three study sites in 2014 based on the official system of notification obtained from the Segamat District Public Health Office database: urban (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), rural (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0), and semi-urban (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) sites.</p><p id="Par53">Despite having relatively low incidence of reported dengue cases in Segamat district, an overwhelming 86.6% of participants had serological evidence of previous DENV exposure, out of which 11.2% were recent exposures. This discrepancy could be attributed to the dengue notification system in Malaysia, which is based on passive reporting and may not reflect the actual disease burden due to underreporting, misreporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and the failure to capture subclinical infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This disparity is further supported by the finding that, overall, only 12.9% of participants with serological evidence of dengue exposure had recollection of having had a dengue infection. They were not diagnosed clinically by a healthcare professional, as they were either asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms not necessitating medical attention or hospitalization. The nonspecific nature of symptoms misattributing it to other febrile illnesses may partly account for this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our findings suggest a possibility that a high number of subclinical dengue cases are present in this community. This corroborates the iceberg phenomena that most dengue infections are clinically unapparent and are consistent with high rates reported in countries such as Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], South India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and Saudi Arabia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The multivariate analysis showed that the older age was the only factor associated with past DENV infections. The prevalence of IgG antibodies increased with increasing age, with &#x0003e;98% of the population having been exposed to dengue after the age of 55&#x000a0;years. Several studies have shown an association between age and IgG dengue seropositivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], consistent with the long-term persistence of anti-DENV IgG once a person is infected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

Ethnicity and being of the male sex, which have previously been reported as risk factors for past DENV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], were not found to be associated in our analysis and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Concurring with several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], we found no statistical association between past DENV infections and occupation. Although lower educational attainment was associated with higher seroprevalence, it did not remain a significant risk factor after controlling for other risk factors. Previous studies have shown a differing relationship when assessing the impact of income, education, structural housing condition, overcrowding, and socioeconomic status on DENV infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Although some studies have shown an inverse association between DENV infections and socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], other studies showed no clear association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The type of housing, which was either single-story or double-story terrace, did not determine seropositivity. In a Malaysian study, the incidence of dengue was higher in areas with interconnected houses (terrace houses, apartments, and flats) as compared to independent houses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], although such a comparison was not possible in our study as all participants lived in terrace houses.</p><p id="Par55">Studies have shown an association between water storage in containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and past dengue infections. Although this factor was not measured in our study, all households in our study sites have availability of pipe water and sewage system, reducing the need to store water in containers, which are potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes. A notable finding was that 75.3% of participants in the rural site had been exposed to dengue, with no difference between the rural, urban, or semi-urban sites. Although previously regarded a disease of urban areas in Malaysia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], recent studies suggest its extent to rural population as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Population mixing facilitated by the efficiency of modern transportation networks, growing vector population, and changes in the usage of agricultural land in rural areas have contributed to homogeneousness in dengue risk between urban and rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Serological evidence of recent infection was noted in 11.2% of participants. These rates were comparable to those in Venezuela [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], whereas higher rates were reported in South India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Conversely a study conducted in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] reported only 2.6% of recent infections. Contrary to the association of age with past DENV infection, recent infection did not display age differences. Chinese ethnicity, housing type, study site, and family history were associated with recent dengue infection in the univariate analysis. It seems likely that this pattern resulted from recent outbreaks with silent transmission of DENV in urban and semi-urban study sites that are populated predominantly by the Chinese. However, none of these factors remained significant predictors of recent infection in the multivariate analysis.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par57">The key limitation we faced in this study was the relatively small sample size from a single study site (with three sub-sites). However, this pilot study was conducted to ascertain DENV seroprevalence in an ostensible population, rather than establishing generalizable seroprevalence rates. Furthermore, despite the relatively small number, there was a very high exposure of the studied population to DENV, providing evidence for the need to perform larger-scale prospective longitudinal studies, and perhaps even revising the current surveillance system.</p><p id="Par58">A limitation of dengue serological surveys is the known cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as JE and yellow fever. However, the high IgG seropositivity in our study most likely reflects the actual prevalence of DENV in the studied community, as there have been no reported cases of JE in Segamat district. Furthermore, other flaviviruses such as yellow fever and West Nile virus have never been reported or recognized in Malaysia, and each of the participants were explicitly asked whether they had been vaccinated for yellow fever or JE virus. In addition, this study was conducted prior to the introduction of Zika virus and there have been no reported cases of Zika virus infections in the Segamat district. Most convincingly, the PRNT assay performed on random samples of IgG-positive sera showed that the detected antibodies were indeed specific to DENV.</p><p id="Par59">Certain amount of recall bias is expected when interviewing people about past diagnosis of dengue. However, this is likely to be minimal because in a dengue endemic country, vigilance and awareness about dengue is expected to be higher.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par60">Data from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence that people of the Segamat rural community in Southern Malaysia had a very high previous exposure to DENV. Despite this, below 13% of participants recalled having dengue in the past, suggesting a potentially large reservoir of subclinical infection with unrecognized transmission lurking in this community, undetected by the official surveillance system. Future larger-scale studies should be conducted, as the findings have implications for enumerating disease burden, hypothesizing effects on DENV vaccine efficacy and uptake, determining disease severity and transmission dynamics, and identifying high-risk areas to target dengue prevention and control activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This study also provides valuable information that can inform public information campaigns about exposure to dengue.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec20"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par66">
