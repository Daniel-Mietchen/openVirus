<p id="Par81">There is a sufficient number of studies regarding barriers to HIV care engagement and treatment among PWID in Ukraine. Most of them describe effective integration of health services as a way to improve multiple healthcare outcomes among PWID, including retention in HIV care and TB treatment [

According to the results of our study, case managers, most of whom are peers and represent the group of “former” PWID, do not provide any specific consultations or actions to improve their clients’ access to OST, as this activity is not a part of the case managers’ working algorithm. At the same time, many disparities of case managers’ work related to the fact that their clients are drug dependent, which may influence their motivation to engage in HIV care—or at the level of everyday life interactions—to come on time for meetings with the case manager, to answer phone calls, to be able to wait in line to see a doctor, to communicate adequately, etc. S. McGill, in her PhD work on the impact of the Global Fund programs on HIV prevention policy and services in Ukraine in 2003–2012, declared that “the nomenclature of prevention services and the number of people to be covered were already pre-determined, and NGOs could neither define the needs for prevention services, nor choose services themselves” [

Confirming McGill’s thesis, we can add that the nomenclature of treatment services provided by NGOs in Ukraine is also pre-determined by the frames of a concrete intervention developed by the donor. This phenomena of pre-determined results and frames of activity can be interpreted as some of the barriers to healthcare integrity as it aimed at achieving a goal within pre-determined frames and reproduce rigidity of post-soviet systems but already on the level of NGOs [
