<p id="Par80">We assume that considering a positive outcome of intervention aimed at accelerating HIV treatment among PWID as a number of PWID initiated into ART is not productive without considering the number of PWID adhering to HIV treatment and having their viral load suppressed. Unfortunately, we have not found any open data or statistics regarding the number of PWID adhering to ART in Ukraine, as well as any qualitative studies that would explore the whole process—starting from HIV care engagement to promoting ART adherence among PWID in Ukraine. It is also a limitation of our study because the intervention finishes at the level of ART initiation and does not monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the intervention ahead of the number of people who are taking part in the intervention and start taking ART. According to literature on performance-based financing, implementation of performance-based payment policy may reinforce certain forms of “wrong” behavior such as “gaming,” i.e., activity that facilitates the attainment of the targets without contributing to a real or intended improvement in health outcomes [

The existing system of the intervention results evaluation also contribute to reproduction of such behavior by considering short-term results of case management only, or in other words, by using the “cherry picking” strategy to evaluate and present incomplete picture [
