<p id="Par20">It is important to note here that in accordance to the latest data from RO’s report for 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], of 489 PWID engaged in the intervention in 2017, 253 (51.7%) started ART. These numbers demonstrate an increase in the percentage of people starting ART after engaging in the intervention and at the same time an increase in the number of people engaged in the intervention in 2017 compared to 2016, and also changes in the donor’s performance indicator requirements on the number of people enrolling in the intervention and starting ART. The presented study’s field work started in April 2017 (new program year with new donor’s requirements also started in April) and finished in August 2017. Thus, the researchers became witnesses of how new requirements were “incorporated” into case managers’ everyday working routines and were performed in the context of Kyiv Fast-Track obligations. We found it significant to consider the whole context of interaction as a framework in which interaction between case managers, medical workers, and clients features, and in which the interaction was observed during the study.
