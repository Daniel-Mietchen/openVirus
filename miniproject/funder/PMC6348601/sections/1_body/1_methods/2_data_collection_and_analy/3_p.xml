<p id="Par26">The “shadowing” technique was used as the main data collection method. Shadowing offers access to “invisible” aspects of work and social life organization [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], particularly when the work being done is difficult to observe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Following McDonald’s advice—“never go [shadowing] in cold” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], both field researchers were familiar with RO’s work. One of the researchers (EL) had previous experience of outreach work with female sex workers at RO, another researcher (AD), serving as an ethnographic field researcher, spent several weeks observing RO’s clients and social workers’ activities at RO’s community center. Two researchers, working at the same time but observing different case managers, carried out all the shadowing sessions. Each day the researchers changed places to create the most objective picture of the observation. Three days of observation were conducted with each of the four case managers working at RO for a total of 12 shadowing sessions. There were breaks between the observations due to a number of official holidays within the fieldwork period.
