<p id="Par24">The study conducted institutional ethnography (IE) using a thick description technique. IE is a method for studying the social interactions that shape and organize everyday life experiences [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The focus in IE is on the ongoing structural and social determinants of everyday activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These determinants include institutional work processes—the implicit norms and explicit rules that organize daily work. As McCoy states, “the health care of a person living with HIV involves a complex, daily work process that loops from the home and everyday spaces of the individual into the sites of professional medical service and back again” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We may add to McCoy’s statement that within the framework of our research, in the chain of a person, their environment, and the space of medical institutions, another fully-fledged actor appears. The case manager is involved in the contexts of both social work and the global approach to counteracting the HIV epidemics.
