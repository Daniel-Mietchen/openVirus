   <italic>Kolia (case manager) called the client whom they tested 8 days prior, his girlfriend answered and it turned out that the client had died. Kolia paused for a second, but almost immediately asked whether the girlfriend was going to undergo treatment, the girl agreed to call him on Monday and come to the confidence room on Tuesday, and only after that Kolia offered his condolences (shadowing field notes)</italic>.
