   <italic>One day I got sick and called a doctor to visit me, two elderly women arrived, one of whom was palpating my stomach, the other was asking questions about my health. I reported that I was HIV +. The one that was palpating my stomach abruptly pulled away and ran to wash her hands, the second one started yelling that it was crazy not to warn in advance about my HIV status! (a story told by an HIV positive social worker, shadowing field notes)</italic>
