<p id="Par76">Spending lots of time in the confidence rooms and the City AIDS center, case managers make attempts to develop a more informal relationship with medical workers rather than a formal, professional one, justifying it as a way to increase the number of privileges for their clients. This also increases the number of privileges available for case managers themselves. One of the examples of such privileges is to have an access to “the doctor’s journal of patients who failed to follow up” (patients who failed to follow up at the confidence room or the AIDS Center and have never been clients of the case managers before). For case managers, to get the “lost patients” from doctors directly means to skip the standard process of case management—they do not need to register such cases at the AIDS Center as they all have already been registered there and do not need to visit all the other necessary doctors. To get such an opportunity, this “case manager with privileges” is ready to even do strange and humiliating things. One such example is to do manicures and pedicures for the HIV doctor.</p>
