   <italic>When we go outside, Anna explains to me whispering, that she works closely with an HIV-doctor and the client who has just appeared is not a “typical” client, his appearance is not just merely a result of a standard scheme when a case finder or a social worker tested him positive. He has come directly from a doctor. There are patients who failed to follow up for medical supervision, and to re-engage them in care and treatment the HIV-doctor may refer such patients to a case manager, not vice-versa as it normally happens (shadowing field notes)</italic>.
