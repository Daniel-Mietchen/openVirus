<p id="Par68">The same with case managers, medical workers (HIV doctors, in particular) have a monthly performance indicator plan determined by Kyiv’s participation in the Fast-Track initiative. The activities of case managers are framed by two main work results and performance indicators—the number of PWID who engage in HIV care and the number of PWID who start ART; thus, their responsibility and working obligations are considered to be completed at the level of ART initiation and cover only PWID. The responsibility and working obligations of HIV doctors and medical workers working at confidence rooms and the City AIDS Center cover any HIV-positive people who are registered for medical supervision and engaged in HIV care, and their performance indicators include the number of people with a zero viral load that could be suppressed if only a patient is adhering to ART. As a result, HIV doctors’ work load as well as their performance indicator increase tremendously.</p>
