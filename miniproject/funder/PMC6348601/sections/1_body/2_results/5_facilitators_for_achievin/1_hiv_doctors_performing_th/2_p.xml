   <italic>There are a lot of people at the HIV-doctor’s office - the doctor herself, a nurse, two social workers from the Care and Support program, one client who has come to take part in the survey, our client, Kolia (case manager) and I, and all these people are in the space of only 15 square meters. Because of the quantity of people, it becomes noticeable that the functional sense of medical practice is shifted very much towards paperwork and attempts to optimize the workflow with the help of computers (there are 4 computers at the doctor’s office), and there is still an endless number of papers lying all over the place. The interaction between the client and the doctor looks like a business meeting – short and concrete (shadowing field notes)</italic>.
