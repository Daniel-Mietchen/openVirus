<p>Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common causative agent of acute viral hepatitis. Eight HEV genotypes (HEV-1 to HEV-8) have been described, of which five are well recognized as human pathogens (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). HEV-1 and HEV-2 are waterborne, transmitted through fecal-oral routes, and are responsible for large HEV outbreaks in resource-limited countries. HEV-3 and HEV-4 are linked to zoonotic transmission and cause sporadic infections in industrialized countries. It has been reported that HEV subtype 1e (HEV-1e) was responsible for a large outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa (Chad). The T3 strain (GenBank accession no.

The virus was isolated from a 35-year-old resident of the Mobbar local government area of Borno State, Nigeria. The patientâ€™s serum tested positive for HEV antibodies using Wantai HEV IgM rapid test and Wantai HEV IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Sanbio, The Netherlands).
