<p id="par0040">The final volume of 25 μl reaction mixtures for RT-LAMP was prepared, which contained 1 μl of Bst DNA polymerase (NEB, USA) (8000 U/ml), 2.5 μl of 10 × Isothermal Amplification Buffer, 5 μl of Betaine (5 M), 1 μl of MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> (100 mM), 5 μl of dNTP (2.5 mM), 2 μl of each inner primers FIP and BIP (10 μmol), 0.25 μl of each outer primers F3 and B3 (10 μmol), 0.25 μl of each loop primers LF and LB (10 μmol), 1.25 μl of AMV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, China) (40 U/μl), 2 μl of RNA template, and the sterile distilled water was set as a negative control template. To determine the optimal reaction conditions, the RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at different temperatures of 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65℃ for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 min, respectively. Finally, the reaction was terminated by heat inactivation at 85℃ for 10 min. The amplified DNA products from the RT-LAMP were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with the addition of 0.01% ethidium bromide using a gel electrophoresis system (Liuyi, China). The results were also observed directly by color change from orange to green with staining due to the presence of SYBR Green Ⅰ (Thermo Scientific, USA). After the amplification was completed, 1 μl of coloring agent was added to each reaction tube, and the results were then examined visually. In RT-LAMP assay with PPgV RNA as template, the amplified DNA products showed characteristic ladders of multiple bands on an agarose gel, indicating that the final products were a mixture of stem-loop DNA with different stem lengths (

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> . In contrast, LAMP-specific DNA bands and color changes were not observed in the negative control. Meanwhile, the DNA products of RT-LAMP showed the highest intensity when the reaction was carried out for 60 min (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). In regard to temperature, the optimal reaction temperature of RT-LAMP was 63℃. Therefore, the optimized parameter for the established RT-LAMP was 63℃ for 60 min.
