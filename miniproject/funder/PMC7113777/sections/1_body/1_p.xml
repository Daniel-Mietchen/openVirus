<p id="par0025">In the past decade, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has become an effective technique, which exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing important pathogens in medicine and veterinary medicine (

In this study, a reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay was established and evaluated for surveying the prevalence of PPgV in porcine serum samples. A set of three specific primers pairs was designed to amplify the NS5A gene, which is suitable for RT-LAMP and relatively conserved in PPgV genome. The developed RT-LAMP assay showed high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the PPgV. The results tested by RT-LAMP assay on clinical samples were 100% correlated to that of nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, indicating the assay could be used for the surveillances of PPgV infection.
