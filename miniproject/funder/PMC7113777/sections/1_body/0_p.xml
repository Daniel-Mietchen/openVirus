<p id="par0020">Porcine pegiviruses (PPgV) are small enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that have recently been assigned as the 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Berg et al., 2015</xref>). PPgV genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein, which is cleaved into individual proteins including E1, E2, X, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Pegiviruses are detected in diverse mammalian hosts including pigs, humans, horses, chimpanzees, bats, monkeys, and rodents (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). All known Pegiviruses have been classified into 11 species (Aâ€“K), and PPgV is a member of 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> K. PPgV was first discovered in Germany in 2016 (

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In China, PPgV was first identified in Guangdong province (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>), where vesicular diseases broke out in a swine farm in 2017. The serum samples were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of Jiangxi Agriculture University, China for diagnosis. The tested results indicated that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and Seneca Valley virus (SVV) were negative but positive for PPgV by a RT-PCR assay. Although it remained yet unknown about the association between PPgV infection and the disease, more epidemiological studies are needed to address the clinical effect of PPgV on swine health. Currently, there are some methods available for PPgV diagnosis, including conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, a rapid and accurate method to detect PPgV is urgently needed for monitoring its presence.
