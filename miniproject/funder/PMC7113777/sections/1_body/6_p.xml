<p id="par0050">To assess the specificity of RT-LAMP for PPgV, cDNAs of Seneca Valley virus (SVV), food and mouth disease virus (FMDV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) were used, and the plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV was used as the positive control. The amplified products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with 0.01% ethidium bromide and addition of SYBR Green â…  staining solution. The results indicated that there was no cross amplification of the RT-LAMP assay for these control viruses. Using PPgV RNA as a template, positive DNA bands were amplified as expected (
