<p id="par0045">To determine the detection limit of the RT-LAMP, 10-fold serially diluted plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>-1 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> copies) were used as templates in 25 μl RT-LAMP reaction system under optimized conditions. The sterile distilled water was set as a negative control template. Nested RT-PCR was performed based on the protocol established in our laboratory (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>). For the PCR step of the nested RT-PCR, the primer sets of F4/R4 and F3/B3 respectively served as outer (1
 <sup>st</sup> set) and inner primers (2
 <sup>nd</sup> set) (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The reaction system contained 1 μl of plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>-1 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> copies) or 1 μl of the first PCR product, 2.5 μl of 10 × PCR buffer (TaKaRa, China), 0.3 μl of rTaq (5 U/μl), 2 μl of MgCl (25 mM), 1 μl of dNTP (2.5 mM), and 1 μl of each primer (10 μmol). Two rounds of nested PCRs were performed under the following conditions: 94℃ for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94℃ for 30 s, 55℃ for 1 min, and 72℃ for 1 min; and a final extension of 72℃ for 10 min (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The conventional RT-PCR was carried out under the same reaction condition as above in nested RT-PCR using the primer pair of F4 and R4 based on the procedure described previously (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>). The products of nested RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with 0.01% ethidium bromide. For qRT-PCR, the primer set of F5 and R5, targeting conserved region of the NS5A gene of PPgV, was used (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The qRT-PCR assay was performed by using a commercial qPCR kit (TaKaRa, China) based on the manufacturer’s procedure. Each 20 μl reaction mixture consists of 10 μl of TB Green Fast qPCR mix, 1 μl of plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>-1 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> copies), 0.8 μl of (10 μmol) each forward and reverse primers and 0.4 μl of ROX. The amplification parameters included an initial denaturation at 95℃ for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95℃ for 5 s and 60℃ for 1 min. The melting curve analysis was measured using the software supplied with ABI7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The results demonstrated that the detection limit of the developed RT-LAMP was 10 copies/μl, which was much higher than conventional RT-PCR (10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/μl), while it was comparable to that of the nested RT-PCR (10 copies/μl) and qRT-PCR (10 copies/μl), respectively (
