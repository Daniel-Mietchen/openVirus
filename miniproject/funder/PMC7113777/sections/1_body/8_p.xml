<p id="par0060">Pegiviruses have a broad host range and infect diverse animal species. PPgV is recently proposed as a novel species in the 
 <italic>Pegivirus</italic> genus. PPgV epidemics have been confirmed in Germany in 2017, the United States in 2018, and China in 2018. Although several pigs positive for PPgV exhibited vesicle and lameness (
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), there is limited evidence that infections were associated with a clinical disease. Therefore, the clinical significance and epidemiological investigation of PPgV infection should be further studied. Nevertheless, the establishment of a sensitive, cost-effective, and rapid assay for detecting PPgV is urgently needed. In this study, a RT-LAMP assay was developed to monitor PPgV in pig populations. Compared to other diagnostic methods, such as conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR (
