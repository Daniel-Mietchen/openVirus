<p id="par0055">To further evaluate the developed RT-LAMP assay, serum samples (n = 299) from finishing pigs and sows collected in Guangdong and Jiangxi province in China during October 2017 to January 2018 were tested (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>). Total RNA was extracted and used as a template for conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and RT-LAMP according to aforementioned methods. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> , the positive sample rates of conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and RT-LAMP were 9.03% (27/299), 10.37% (31/299), 10.37% (31/299), 10.37% (31/299), respectively, suggesting these data were consistent with our previous findings (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2019</xref>). The detailed information is listed in Table S1. The results showed the RT-LAMP had a similar sensitivity to nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, which was superior to conventional RT-PCR.
