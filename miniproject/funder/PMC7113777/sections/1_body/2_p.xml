<p id="par0030">In this study, serum samples (N = 90) of 20-week-old pigs with a vesicular disease from Guangdong Province, China in 2017 were collected. Total RNA was extracted by using MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, China), and then stored at -80℃ until use. The extracted RNA was converted to the first strand of cDNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For the construction of plasmid standards, an 889-bp fragment of the NS5A gene of PPgV was initially amplified using a pair of primers (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ) with the 1st strand of cDNA as template. Afterwards, the purified fragment was cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To assess the successful construction of the plasmid, designated as pMD-PPgV, DNA sequencing was performed by Sangon Biotech Company (Shanghai, China). The concentration of pMD-PPgV plasmid was measured by a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The copy number of the cloned gene was quantified as follows: [copy/μL = plasmid concentration (g/μL) / [(plasmid length) ×660) × (6.022 × 10
 <sup>23</sup>)] (

 <sup>6</sup>-1 × 10
 <sup>0</sup> copies) were used as templates for the determination of detection limit of PCR, which would be used as a positive control in the RT-LAMP assay system.
