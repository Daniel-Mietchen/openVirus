<p id="par0065">RT-LAMP is considered to be an alternative diagnostic tool in terms of its ability to rapidly amplify target nucleotide sequence(s) under isothermal conditions. LAMP has been widely used to detect a variety of important swine pathogens, including PDCoV (

The detection limit of RT-LAMP assay established is 100 times higher than that of conventional RT-PCR, and had a similar sensitivity to nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. RT-LAMP developed in the study showed a high specificity as it did not cross react with other related porcine viruses. In the clinical evaluation, the positive rate of RT-LAMP were consistent with that of nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, indicating the PPgV-specific RT-LAMP assay was a valuable tool for the rapid detection in field settings.
