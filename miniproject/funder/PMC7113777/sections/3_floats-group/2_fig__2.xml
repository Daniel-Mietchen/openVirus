  <p>RT-LAMP results: PPgV RNA was used as a template and six primers targeting the PPgV NS5A gene were used in the PPgV NS5A-based RT-LAMP assay performed at 63℃ for 60 min. The agarose electrophoresis results are shown in panel A: lane M 2000 bp DNA marker, lane 1 RT-LAMP products, lane 2 negative control. The direct observations by adding SYBR Green Ⅰ are displayed in panels B (in daylight) and C (in UV light): tube 1 positive reaction, tube 2 negative reaction (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
