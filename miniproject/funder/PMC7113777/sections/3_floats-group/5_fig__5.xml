  <p>Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay. PPgV (plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV of 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> copies) and other related swine pathogenic RNA viruses were used as templates and subjected to RT-LAMP performed at 63℃ for 60 min. Tube and lane 1–6 are RT-LAMP results from templates of PPgV, SVV, FMDV, PEDV, PDCoV, and SADS-CoV, tube and lane 7, negative control, and lane M, 2000 bp DNA marker.
