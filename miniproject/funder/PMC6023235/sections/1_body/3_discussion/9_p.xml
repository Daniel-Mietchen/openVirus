<p>Limitations of this study include the use of a single urine albumin-creatinine ratio as a surrogate marker of renal function. In addition, the use of POC devices for measuring glucose, HbA1c and the albumin-creatinine ratio may be considered a drawback, however such devices are increasingly being used in both clinical and epidemiological studies and show good agreement with laboratory-based methodologies [

A number of variables in this study were based on data taken from patient files and this may limit the conclusions that can be drawn when using such information. All HIV-positive subjects were receiving ART and therefore we were not able to discern whether any differences between subjects with and without infection were due to the virus or its therapy. The sub-group analyses were not powered to the same extent as those performed in the full cohort and therefore the results of these regression models should be interpreted with some caution. Despite this, significant associations were still identified in the sub-group regression analyses. Lastly, this study was conducted in a single out-patient clinic in an urban setting and our findings may therefore not be applicable to all HIV-positive diabetics within South Africa. The strengths of this study include the assessment of a broad range of appropriate variables and that it was sufficiently powered to detect differences in glucose and HbA1c levels between the 2 study groups. Furthermore, this is the first cross-sectional study to specifically assess glycaemic control and kidney function in sub-Saharan African diabetic subjects with HIV infection and receiving HAART.
