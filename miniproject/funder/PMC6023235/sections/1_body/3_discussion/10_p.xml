<p>In conclusion, these data show that HIV-positive diabetic subjects receiving ART have higher fasting glucose levels than HIV-negative diabetics. In addition, statin and anti-HT therapy were associated with poorer glycaemic control, the origins of which are uncertain. Furthermore, fasting glucose levels were negatively associated with CD4 counts, a relationship that requires further investigation. The prevalence of albuminuria did not differ between HIV-negative and HIV-positive diabetic patients, a finding that was hypothesized to be due to full ART coverage in the latter group. Due to the high prevalence of both HIV infection and type 2 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa it is important that future studies further investigate the clinical consequences of the overlap of these 2 epidemics and put in place programs to help ameliorate these effects.</p>
