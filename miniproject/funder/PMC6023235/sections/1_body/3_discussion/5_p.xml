<p>The use of anti-HT agents was associated with higher glucose levels whilst statin use was associated with higher HbA1c levels. Eriksson et al found that higher glucose levels were associated with hydrochlorothiazide therapy compared to placebo in hypertensive subjects [

With regard to statin therapy, Liew et al reported an increase in HbA1c levels in patients receiving simvastatin regardless of the presence of diabetes [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This parallels the current study where simvastatin use was associated with higher HbA1c levels. In addition, a meta-analysis has demonstrated a modest increase of HbA1c in diabetic patients receiving statin therapy [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, it is possible that the relationship observed of anti-hypertensive and statin therapy with glucose and HbA1c levels, respectively, are simply due to the provision of these drugs to subjects who have the worst glycaemic control. In order to clarify the relationship of these therapies with glycaemia future longitudinal studies would be required.
