<p>The principle anti-retroviral drugs used by the HIV-positive participants in this study were efavirenz, tenofovir and lamivudine. These drugs are recommended by the Southern African HIV Clinicians Society as the preferred first line therapy for HIV infection and are the most readily available anti-retroviral agents within the public healthcare system of South Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Stavudine and zidovudine were used by very few of the participants. These drugs are still available within South Africa but are only recommended for use in cases where multiple other drugs are contraindicated, and in the case of stavudine, use is recommended for no longer than 3 months [
