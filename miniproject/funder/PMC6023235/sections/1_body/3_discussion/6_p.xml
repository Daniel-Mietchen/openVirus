<p>The current study demonstrated that albuminuria was not associated with HIV infection. However, it must be noted that only 2 previous studies have investigated this relationship [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], both of which showed a higher prevalence of albuminuria in diabetic subjects that were HIV-positive. One of these studies concluded that albuminuria was related to the use of abacavir [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Within the current study, all HIV-positive subjects were receiving ART but none were using abacavir. These data suggest a complex interaction between HIV infection, its therapy and kidney function, with lack of ART and use of particular anti-retroviral agents both being related to albuminuria. We hypothesize that full ART coverage in the HIV-positive subjects may protect them from HIV-related kidney dysfunction and may explain the similar level of albuminuria within the 2 patient groups. The present study showed that albuminuria was associated with the presence of dyslipidaemia and with raised HbA1c levels. Similarly, a study from Korea demonstrated that dyslipidaemia was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria in pre-diabetic female subjects [
