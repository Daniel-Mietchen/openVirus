<p>The data from this study shows that HIV-positive diabetic subjects had poorer glycaemic control than HIV-negative subjects whilst HbA1c levels were lower in the former group after adjusting for possible confounding factors. Furthermore, within the HIV-positive group higher CD4 counts were associated with lower glucose levels. The use of anti-HT agents was found to be associated with poorer glycaemic control whilst the use of statins was linked to higher HbA1c levels. Kidney function, as assessed via albuminuria, was not different between the HIV-positive and HIV-negative diabetic groups. Albuminuria was found to be more prevalent in subjects with dyslipidaemia and in those with higher HbA1c levels.</p>
