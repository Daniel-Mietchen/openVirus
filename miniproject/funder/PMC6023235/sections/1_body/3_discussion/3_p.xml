<p>The current study demonstrated that glucose levels were higher in diabetic subjects with HIV infection when compared to those who were not infected. A recent South African study also demonstrated poor glycaemic control in diabetic patients living with HIV [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], using data collected from patient files. A study from the USA showed that serum glucose levels were higher in diabetic, HIV infected subjects compared to those without HIV but the difference missed statistical significance (p = 0.09) [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, a further study showed no difference in fasting glucose levels between female diabetic subjects with or without HIV infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], whilst a study from Malawi demonstrated lower fasting glucose levels in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative diabetic subjects [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It can therefore be seen that there are only a few studies that have analysed the effect of HIV infection on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects. The majority of these studies suggest that HIV infection is associated with poorer glycaemic control. It has been suggested that this is due to the effects of ART [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and it is interesting to note that in the study showing lower glucose levels in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative diabetic subjects, only 16.9% (11 of 65) were receiving ART [
