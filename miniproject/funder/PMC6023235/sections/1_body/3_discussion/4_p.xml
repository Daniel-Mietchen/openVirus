<p>We were able to show that within the diabetic subjects with HIV infection, the CD4 count correlated negatively with glucose levels. A similar association has been observed in a previous study, which was conducted in non-diabetic subjects [

These data suggest that improved immune system functionality may enhance glycaemic control, which may be mediated by a reduction of the viral load and/or attenuation of the inflammatory response to viral infection. It is known that inflammation may play an important role in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The effect of IRIS on the development of type 2 diabetes in subjects with HIV infection has not been investigated, but should be the focus of future studies. The present study also demonstrated that in HIV-positive subjects a longer duration of HIV infection was associated with higher HbA1c levels. However, this association was very weak.
