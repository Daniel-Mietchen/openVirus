<p>This study has demonstrated that in diabetic subjects lower HbA1c levels are observed in HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative subjects, but higher glucose levels in the former compared to the latter group. This has also been observed in other studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], only 1 of which was undertaken in diabetic subjects [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These data demonstrate that HbA1c measurement in HIV-positive diabetic subjects underestimates the level of glycaemia. Whilst HbA1c is an excellent tool for monitoring glycaemic control, there are several factors that can affect its level by influencing the lifespan of red blood cells. These factors include iron/vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic renal failure, splenectomy, splenomegaly, increased haemolysis, cirrhosis and drugs such as ribavirin and dapsone [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been suggested that in HIV-positive subjects, the lower HbA1c levels may be as a result of a faster turnover of red blood cells due to increased haemolysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The haemolysis may be due to the use of ART, and a number of studies have shown that the discrepancy between glucose and HbA1c levels is related to such therapy [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa has shown that ART-use is associated with lower HbA1c measurements [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is therefore advised that fasting glucose measurements be used for the diagnosis of diabetes in HIV-positive subjects [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and this is in line with the American Diabetes Association guidelines which discourage the use of HbA1c as a diagnostic or a glycaemia monitoring tool in HIV infected subjects [
