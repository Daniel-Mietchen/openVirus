<p>Ethics approval was obtained for this study from the University of the Witwatersrand Ethics Committee (Human Research). All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedures were conducted. A data sheet was used to collect information from the patient and also from the patientâ€™s file. During clinic visits fasting glucose, HbA1c and urine albumin:creatinine ratio were measured using point-of-care (POC) devices. The capillary blood samples for glucose and HbA1c measurement were obtained from the same puncture wound made using a sterile, disposable lancet, with the fingertip first being cleaned with an alcohol swab. A spot urine sample for the urine albumin:creatinine ratio measurement was collected into a sterile, disposable urine container from each participant during the clinic visit.</p>
