<p>The sample size for this study was calculated based on the use of multivariable linear regression models for identifying the principal determinants of glucose and HbA1c levels in diabetic subjects with and without HIV infection. Assuming a maximum of 12 independent variables in the initial regression models, with a statistical power of 90%, a p-level of 0.05 and an effect size of 0.10, the estimated sample size was 230. We chose to use a sample size greater than this (N = 320) to ensure the study was fully powered to achieve its aims. Similar analyses were performed in sub-groups i.e. in those with and in those without HIV infection. These were secondary analyses and the sub-group sample sizes were not calculated to ensure that there was sufficient power to run these regression models. However, a 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> power analysis demonstrated that in the sub-group with the smallest sample size i.e. HIV-positive subjects (n = 106), with 5 independent variables in the initial regression model that there was 85% power to identify a minimal effect size of 0.15 at p&lt;0.05.
