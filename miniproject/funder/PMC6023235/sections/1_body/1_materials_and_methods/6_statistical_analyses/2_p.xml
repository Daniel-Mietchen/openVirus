<p>Multivariable linear regression models were developed to find the principal determinants of glucose and HbA1c levels and albumin:creatinine ratio (dependent variables). Univariate regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship of each study variable (independent variable) with each of the 3 dependent variables. Independent variables that correlated with the dependent variable at p≤0.20 were included in the multivariable model. Backward, stepwise removal of non-significant variables was then performed until a final model was obtained in which all remaining independent variables correlated with the dependent variable at p&lt;0.10. Collinearity was assessed in all the initial multivariable models using the variance inflation factor (VIFs). Any variable with a VIF≥5 was removed from the model until all variables had VIF&lt;5.</p>
