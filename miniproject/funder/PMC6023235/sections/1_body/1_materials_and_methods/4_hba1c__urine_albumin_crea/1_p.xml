<p>The HbA1c and urine albumin:creatinine measurements were performed using a Siemens DCA Vantage analyzer (Tarrytown, NY, USA), which is a cartridge-based analyzer. The DCA Vantage HbA1c assay method is based on a latex immunoagglutination inhibition methodology and it is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP). The DCA Vantage has been assessed according to NGSP-certified HbA1c POC device guidelines and was found to have a 2.3% coefficient of variation (CV) at HbA1c levels of 5.26–5.34%, a CV of 2.5% over a HbA1c range of 6.10–6.18%, and a CV of 2.7% in the 8.01–8.09% range [
