<p>The DCA Vantage albumin:creatinine assay is a quantitative method measuring albumin, and creatinine and reports a albumin:creatinine ratio. Urine albumin is linear between 5 to 300 mg/l and for creatinine linearity is between 1.3 to 44.2 mmol/l. The albumin:creatinine measurement covers the following range: 0.11 to 226 mg/mmol. Evaluation of the performance of this POC device in terms of measurement of urine albumin, creatinine and albumin:creatinine ratio against a laboratory-based method demonstrated excellent correlations (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.989, 0.987 and 0.991, respectively) with total imprecision of &lt; 8.7%, and an inter-and intra-day imprecision of &lt; 2.9% [
