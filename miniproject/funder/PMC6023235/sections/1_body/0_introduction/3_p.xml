<p>Kidney dysfunction, including both acute and chronic renal failure, is a known complication of HIV infection. The aetiology of HIV-associated acute kidney disease is thought to involve the virus itself, co-morbid diseases or infections and anti-retroviral therapy [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The development of CKD in those infected with HIV is thought to be mediated by viral proteins, host genetic variants, and environmental factors [
