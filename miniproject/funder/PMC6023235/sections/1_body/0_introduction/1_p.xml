 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] observed that the prevalence of diabetes was up to four fold higher in HIV-infected men exposed to HAART compared to HIV-negative men. A recent meta-analysis confirms the strong association between the use of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and increased risk for diabetes [
