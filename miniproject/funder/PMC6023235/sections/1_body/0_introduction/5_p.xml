<p>It is therefore clear that HIV infection and its therapy may lead to both poor glucose control and an increased risk of kidney dysfunction in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This overlap of diseases and the resulting pathology is of significant concern in South Africa where both type 2 diabetes [

 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] are common. Indeed, South Africa has the highest number of subjects living with HIV infection, with a national prevalence level of 12.2% [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, a national survey has shown that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in South Africa is 9.5% [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The aim of the present study was therefore to compare glycaemia and renal function (using albuminuria as a surrogate marker) in African type 2 diabetic patients with and without HIV infection, and to identify the determinants of fasting glucose and HbA1c levels and albuminuria in this population.
