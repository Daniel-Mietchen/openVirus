<p>The HIV-negative subjects were older (p&lt;0.005), had a significantly higher BMI (p&lt;0.005), and a longer duration of diabetes (p&lt;0.05) than the HIV-positive subjects (
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The higher HbA1c levels in the HIV-negative group (p&lt;0.05) were found to be due to higher BMI and age as adjusting for either of these variables in an ANCOVA attenuated the p-value (p = 0.21 and p = 0.13, respectively). All subjects were receiving metformin in combination with insulin and/or sulphonylureas. All the HIV-positive patients were receiving ART with the majority using an anti-retroviral triple therapy of tenofovir, lamivudine, and efavirenz, with a very small number of subjects receiving stavudine (1 person) or zidovudine (also 1 person). Fewer of the HIV-positive subjects were being treated for hypertension (p&lt;0.005) when compared to the HIV-negative subjects, but this relationship became non-significant after adjusting for age (p = 0.24). No difference in the prevalence of albuminuria was noted between the groups.
