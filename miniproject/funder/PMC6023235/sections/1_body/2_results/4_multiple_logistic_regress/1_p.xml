<p>The data in 
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show the results of backward, stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis of albuminuria risk. The results demonstrate that gender, dyslipidaemia and HbA1c levels are all independent risk factors for albuminuria. Thus, the risk for albuminuria is 47.7% lower in females than males, and the risk of albuminuria is 94.2% higher is subjects with dyslipidaemia than in those with normal lipid levels. In addition, a 1 unit increase in HbA1c levels is associated with a 24.3% increase in the risk of albuminuria (
