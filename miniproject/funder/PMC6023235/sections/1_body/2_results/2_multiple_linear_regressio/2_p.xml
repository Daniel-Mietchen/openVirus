<p>These data demonstrate that both glucose and HbA1c levels are determined by HIV status, and therefore we repeated the multivariable linear regression analyses of both these variables in HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. The results of these analyses are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In terms of glucose levels, within the HIV-negative group only anti-hypertensive therapy was associated with glucose, with those using such therapy having a 6.30% higher glucose level than non-hypertensive subjects. In the HIV-positive group, BMI and CD4 counts were both associated with fasting glucose levels. Thus, a 1 unit increase in BMI was associated with a 0.60% increase in the glucose level, however this relationship just missed statistical significance (p = 0.084). A 1 unit increase in CD4 count was associated with a 0.02% fall in glucose concentration. With regard to HbA1c, in the HIV-negative group BMI, glucose and statin use were all correlated to this marker of glycaemia. Thus, a 1 unit increase in BMI was associated with a 0.30% rise in HbA1c, a 1 mmol/L increase in glucose was associated with a 1.40% rise in HbA1c and statin use was associated with a 4.00% higher HbA1c level. Within the HIV-positive group, gender, BMI, glucose and duration of HIV infection were all associated with the HbA1c level. Thus, females had a HbA1c level that was 4.00% lower than in males, a 1 unit increase in BMI was associated with a 0.40% rise in HbA1c, a 1 mmol/L increase in glucose was associated with a 0.90% rise in HbA1c and a 1 year higher duration of HIV infection was associated with a 0.30% increase in HbA1c. This last association just missed statistical significance (p = 0.074).
