<p>Stepwise, backward multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that HIV infection and the use of anti-hypertensive therapy were both independently associated with higher glucose levels (
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, HIV-positive subjects had glucose levels that were 4.40% higher than in HIV-negative subjects and subjects receiving anti-hypertensive therapy had glucose levels that were 6.90% higher than those not receiving such therapy (
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). With regards to HbA1c levels, HIV infection was negatively associated with this variable, whilst BMI, glucose and use of statins were positively associated. Thus, HIV-positive subjects had HbA1c levels that were 2.80% lower than those without HIV, a 1 unit increase in BMI was associated with a 0.30% increase in HbA1c, a 1 mmol/L increase in glucose levels was associated with a 1.20% increase in HbA1c, whilst subjects on statins had a 3.00% higher HbA1c level than those not taking statin therapy (
