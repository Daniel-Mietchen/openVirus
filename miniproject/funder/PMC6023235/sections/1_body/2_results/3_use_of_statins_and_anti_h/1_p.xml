<p>Due to the effects of statins on HbA1c and anti-hypertensive (HT) agents on glucose levels, these drugs were analysed in more detail. Patient files showed that simvastatin was the only statin type used in this population whereas 8 different types of anti-HT agents were used. The main agents used for treating hypertension (and their % use in subjects with hypertension) were: the diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide (38.6%); the ACE inhibitor, enalapril (45.3%); the calcium channel antagonist, adalat (25.6%). All these agents were used in combination with each other and with other anti-HT drugs. Due to the reported elevation of glucose levels by thiazide diuretics [
 <xref rid="pone.0199946.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], these agents were compared against all other anti-HT drugs for their effects on glucose. Thus, in non-hypertensives, the median (interquartile range) fasting capillary glucose level was 7.10 (6.25, 9.30) mmol/L, in those using hydrochlorothiazide it was 8.65 (6.90, 11.0) mmol/L (p = 0.028 versus non-hypertensives) and in those using all other forms of anti-HT therapy it was 8.80 (7.10, 10.5) mmol/L (p = 0.033). Due to the large number of drug combination therapies (12) used in the non-thiazide group, we were not able to determine which individual therapies were the main contributors to the higher glucose level. No significant effects were observed for the anti-HT drugs on HbA1c levels.
