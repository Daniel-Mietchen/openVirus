 <p>We would like to thank the transgender individuals and cis-MSM across sub-Saharan Africa who participated in these studies, given the significant risks and limited personal benefits. In addition, we acknowledge the crucial role of the community groups that make great personal and professional sacrifices to serve the unmet health and advocacy needs of those most marginalized in the HIV response. Finally, we would like to acknowledge Sosthenes Ketende for his important contribution to managing the data included in this study.</p>
