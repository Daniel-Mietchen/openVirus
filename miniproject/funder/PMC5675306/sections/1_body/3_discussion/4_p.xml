<p>Transgender women in this study were more likely than cis-MSM to report condom use with their last regular partner and easier access to condoms and lubricants. However, they also reported a greater number of sexual partners and were more likely to report condomless receptive anal sex than cis-MSM. Receptive condomless anal intercourse with a serodiscordant and viremic partner has a relatively high per-act HIV acquisition probability [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; therefore, one would expect receptive condomless anal sex with a high number of partners to be associated with HIV infection. However, the significant effect modification by gender on the relationship between condomless receptive anal sex and HIV suggests a more complex relationship. Transgender women were more likely than cis-MSM to have been recently tested for HIV; therefore, one possibility is that those individuals who recently received an HIV diagnosis and post-test counseling were more likely to use condoms. Alternatively, these data may suggest the need to look beyond behavioral risks and examine psychosocial and structural drivers of HIV infection.
