<p>In this analysis of data from MSM-tailored studies in 8 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, 1 out of every 5 participants (
 <italic>n =</italic> 937) identified as transgender or as a woman. Transgender women were more likely to report stigma, depressive symptoms, condomless receptive anal sex, and receipt of an HIV test within the prior 12 months compared with cis-MSM. HIV prevalence was 25% among transgender women and 14% among cis-MSM. In adjusted regression modeling, transgender women demonstrated a 2-fold higher odds of HIV infection than cis-MSM, with significant effect modification by the interaction between gender and condomless receptive anal intercourse.
