<p>Overall, 1 in 4 transgender women tested positive for HIV infection across these studies. While HIV prevalence varied greatly by country, wherever there was a statistically significant difference between transgender women and cis-MSM, transgender women had a higher HIV prevalence. Even in Lesotho, which has a broadly generalized epidemic and national HIV prevalence of 25% [
