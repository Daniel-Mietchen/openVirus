<p>The UNAIDS 2016â€“2021 Strategy aims for 90% of people living with HIV to know their status, 90% of people with diagnosed HIV infection to receive antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 90% of people taking ART to be virally suppressed by 2020 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The strategy also sets a target for 90% of key populations, including transgender people, to have access to HIV combination prevention services [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Combination prevention includes traditional interventions such as condoms and lubricants as well as newer strategies such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and suppressive ART [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and long-acting antiretroviral agents [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] are being explored as strategies to increase access to effective HIV prevention and care. However, these strategies are unlikely to be effective for transgender women without an enabling environment that reduces stigma, addresses the associated mental health burden [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and provides culturally and biomedically appropriate HIV services [
