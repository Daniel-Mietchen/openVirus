<p>A mixed effects logistic regression model was built to estimate the odds of HIV infection for transgender women compared with cis-MSM [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A random intercept was added by site to account for clustering. The adjusted model included age as a potential confounder as well as stigma factor score, positive depression screen, and condomless receptive anal sex as potential mediators. We hypothesized that gender would modify the relationship between condomless receptive anal sex and HIV; therefore, an interaction term for gender and condomless receptive anal sex was included in the final model.
