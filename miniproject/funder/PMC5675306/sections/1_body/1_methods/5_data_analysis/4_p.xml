<p>Because we combined data from multiple studies, no adjustments were made for RDS. The proportion of missing data was calculated for each variable in the model. Missing data comprised less than 5% of all variables, except condomless anal intercourse, which was missing for approximately 16% of participants, with no difference in proportion of missing data by gender. No data were imputed.</p>
