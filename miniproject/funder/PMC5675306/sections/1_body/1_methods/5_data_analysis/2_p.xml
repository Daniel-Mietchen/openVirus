<p>A stigma index was created for item reduction using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Varimax rotation was used due to minimal overlap in variance, and tetrachoric correlations were calculated to account for the binary nature of the items. Item reduction took place using an iterative process by which individual items were deleted if they failed to load on any factor or loaded equally on multiple factors; then, the EFA was conducted again on the lower number of items. Scree plots were used to determine the number of factors to extract. This process was repeated until each of the remaining items loaded (&gt;0.5) on at least 1 but no more than 1 factor.
