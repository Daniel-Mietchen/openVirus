<p>Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At sites that used RDS, recruitment was initiated using 3 to 6 seeds who were selected based on the recommendation of local community-based organizations. Seeds represented a range of characteristics in terms of age, education, socioeconomic status, and participation in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) associations. In The Gambia, where there were no formal LGBT organizations, recruitment started with 10 highly motivated initial seeds who represented diversity in age and education levels and who were well-connected with members of the LGBT community.
