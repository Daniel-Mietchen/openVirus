 <xref rid="pmed.1002422.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], transgender women were defined as participants who were assigned male sex at birth and self-identified as transgender or female/woman. Three countries (Burkina Faso, Lesotho, and Togo) also included the option to identify as intersex; however, all intersex participants also identified as either male/men or female/woman/transgender. Therefore, gender was dichotomized as transgender women and cis-MSM. Demographic data included age in years and current employment status. Depression screening was conducted using an item that asked, “Have you ever felt sad or depressed in the last two weeks?” Suicidal ideation screening was conducted by “Have you ever felt like you wanted to end your life in the last two weeks?” Three questions assessed drug use: “Have you used needles to inject drugs in the last 12 months?” “If yes, have you used needles previously used by other people?” “Have you taken any drug that was not injected and not prescribed in the last 12 months?” Alcohol use was measured by “What is the average number of drinks you consume in one sitting?”
