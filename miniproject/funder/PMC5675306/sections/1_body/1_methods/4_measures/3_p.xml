<p>Scales used to measure access to condoms and lubricants varied by country. In 3 countries (Malawi, The Gambia, and Swaziland), participants were asked “What kind of access to condoms do you have when you need them?” with response options on a 4-point Likert scale where higher scores represent easier access. The same question was repeated replacing “condom” with “lubricant” in all countries except The Gambia, where lubricant access was not assessed. In 4 countries (Lesotho, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Togo), participants were asked, “How difficult or easy is it for you to obtain condoms when you need them?” with response options on a 5-point Likert scale where higher scores represent easier access. The same question was repeated replacing “condom” with “lubricant.” Côte d’Ivoire data included the 5-point lubricant scale but no condom scale. Participants were also asked about history of sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and diagnosis, and history of HIV testing and diagnosis.</p>
