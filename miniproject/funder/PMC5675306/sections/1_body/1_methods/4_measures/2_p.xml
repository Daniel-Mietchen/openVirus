In every country except Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, participants were asked the number of male partners with whom they had anal sex in the prior 12 months. In Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, respondents were asked about the number of anal sex acts or number of partners in the prior 30 days, but number of male anal sex partners could not be determined. Participants in all countries were asked whether a condom was used during the last time they had sex with a casual male partner and a regular male partner, and they were asked if they had condomless insertive and/or receptive anal sex with any of their reported male partners.</p>
