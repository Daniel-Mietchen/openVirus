 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002422.t004">Table 4</xref> presents comparative data on sexual behavior, condom and lubricant access, and HIV and STI history. Transgender women had a higher median number of male anal sex partners than cis-MSM (3 versus 2, 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.004) and were less likely to have used a condom the last time they had sex with a regular partner (OR 0.8, CI 0.67–0.96, 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.16). However, there was no statistically significant difference by gender in condom use at last sex with a casual partner. Transgender women had more than twice the odds of reporting condomless receptive anal sex with male partners compared to cis-MSM (OR 2.44, 95% CI 2.05–2.90, 
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001). Both groups found it easier to access condoms than lubricants. Transgender women reported greater access to condoms when they needed them than cis-MSM (3.4 versus 3.1 on a 4-point Likert scale, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and they reported easier access to lubricant when they needed it (3.6 versus 3.0 on a 5-point Likert scale, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Transgender women were less likely to have been tested for STIs in the prior 12 months (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–0.99, 
 <italic>p =</italic> 0.046) but had no significant difference from cis-MSM in STI diagnosis (8% versus 7%). There was no difference by gender in history of ever having had an HIV test (78% versus 75%) or having been tested in the prior 12 months (51% versus 44%).
