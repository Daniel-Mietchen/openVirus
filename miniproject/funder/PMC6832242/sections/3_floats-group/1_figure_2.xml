  <p>Histologic nasal turbinate and lung sections from pigs infected with either IBV or IDV at 8 days post-infection. 
   <italic>Top Row</italic>: Nasal turbinate sections from control and infected pigs. Turbinate from control (
   <bold>A</bold>) have normal ciliated respiratory epithelium (arrow) and minimal inflammatory cells in lamina propria (asterisk). The IBV (
   <bold>B</bold>) or IDV (
   <bold>C</bold>) infected nasal turbinates have prominent segment of squamous epithelium/metaplasia (arrow) with infiltrating neutrophils through lamina propria and epithelium and increased lymphocytes in lamina propria (asterisks). 
   <italic>Bottom Row</italic>: Lung sections from control (
   <bold>D</bold>) and infected pigs (
   <bold>E,F</bold>) taken after collection of lavage. Lungs infected with IBV (
   <bold>E</bold>) have prominent diffuse interstitial pneumonia with increase in cellularity of alveolar septae (double arrows), along interlobular septae (single arrows), and with prominent (though mild) peribronchiolar lymphocytes (arrowheads). Lungs infected with IDV (
   <bold>F</bold>) have milder diffuse interstitial pneumonia (increased thickening and cellularity of alveolar septae including along interlobular septae) and minimal peribronchiolar inflammation. Lungs of control pigs have minimal increased cellularity noted components. Bars for nasal turbinate and lung section are 100 and 200 Âµm, respectively.
