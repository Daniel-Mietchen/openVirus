  <p>Body temperature, macroscopic, and microscopic lungs lesions of contact or infected pigs with influenza B virus (IBV), or influenza D virus (IDV). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The body temperature of infected or contact pigs is presented as the average body temperature of each group of pigs at indicated days. The number, such as 6/10, means that 6 out of 10 IDV-infected pigs showed fever at a defined dpi. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Macroscopic lung lesions of infected or contact pigs are presented as the average percentage ± SEM of gross lesions of three or four pigs in each group at the indicated days. (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) Microscopic lung (
   <bold>C</bold>) and nasal turbinate (
   <bold>D</bold>) lesions of infected pigs are presented as the Mean ± SEM of lesions of three or four pigs in each group at the indicated days. The asterisks (*) represent a statistically significant difference between groups (*:
