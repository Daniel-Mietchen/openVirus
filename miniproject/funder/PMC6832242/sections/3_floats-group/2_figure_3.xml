  <p>Virus titers in BALF and nasal swab samples collected from contact or infected pigs with IBV or IDV. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Mean of virus titers in BALF from contact or infected pigs with either IBV or IDV at indicated days. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Mean of virus titers in nasal swabs from contact or infected pigs infected with either IBV or IDV at indicated days. None of the contact pigs had virus in lung or nasal turbinates. Determination of virus titers was performed by calculating the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>)/mL in Madinâ€“Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The number of pigs with positive virus isolation out of the total number of tested pigs is presented above of each bar. The error bars represent SEM. The asterisks (*) represent a statistically significant difference between groups (**: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and ***: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
