<p>Thirty-five pigs were randomly distributed into 3 groups including two infected groups and one control group. Each infected group contained 10 pigs and each pig was infected intratracheally (1.5 mL) and intranasally (1 mL) with 2.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of B/Brisbane/60/2008 or D/bovine/Kansas/1-35/2010 virus, while the negative control group had 9 pigs that were mock-inoculated with 2.5 mL of DMEM media using the same routes. At 2 days post-infection (dpi), three contact pigs were commingled with the infected pigs in each group to investigate virus transmission. Body temperatures and clinical signs were monitored daily. Nasal swabs were collected from infected pigs at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi and from contact pigs at 0, 2, 4, and 6 days post-contact (dpc) to determine virus shedding. Three pigs from each infected group and control group were necropsied at 4 and 6 dpi, and the remaining 4 infected pigs in each infected group and 3 mock-inoculated pigs were necropsied at 8 dpi. All contact pigs were necropsied at 6 dpc. Blood samples were collected from each pig prior to infection and at the necropsy day. During necropsy, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were collected by flushing each lung with 50 mL of fresh DMEM. Virus titers in nasal swabs and BALF samples were determined on MDCK cells.
