 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The average of gross lung lesions of seven lung lobes of each pig was determined. After collection of BALF samples, lung and nasal turbinate specimens from each pig were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and routinely processed for histopathologic examination at the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Lung and turbinate sections were examined by a board-certified veterinary anatomic pathologist in a blinded fashion. Lung scoring was assessed based on criteria described in a previous publication [
