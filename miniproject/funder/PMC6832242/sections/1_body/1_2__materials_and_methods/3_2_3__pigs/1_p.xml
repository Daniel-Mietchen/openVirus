<p>Thirty-five 5-week-old pigs were used in the study. Prior to the pig study, blood and nasal swab samples collected from each pig were used for serology and real-time RT-PCR tests. The pigs were seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (ELISA assay), influenza B, and D viruses (HI assay), but had antibodies to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (HI titer from 40-160) and swine influenza cluster IV H3N2 (HI titer from 40-640) viruses. All pigs were negative for influenza A, B, C, and D viruses by testing nasal swab samples using genus-specific real-time RT-PCR assays.</p>
