<p>To perform the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, serum samples were collected from infected pigs at 8 dpi and contact pigs at 6 dpc. HI assays were performed using 0.5% turkey red blood cells (RBCs) according to the standard protocol. Sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (Denka-Seiken, Stamford, Texas, USA) overnight at 37 °C and 50% of turkey RBCs for 1 h to destroy nonspecific hemagglutination inhibitors and agglutinins. Serial two-fold dilution was performed for receptor-destroying enzyme-treated sera from 1:10 initial dilution. Diluted sera were incubated with 4 hemagglutinating units of IBV (B/Brisbane/60/2008) or IDV (D/bovine/Kansas/1-35/2010) for 30 min followed by incubation for 40 min with 0.5% turkey RBC solution.</p>
