<p>Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and swine testicle (ST) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). DMEM infecting media containing 0.3% bovine serum albumins (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, and 0.5 or 1 μg/mL of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used for virus infection of cells. Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Influenza D/bovine/Kansas/1-35/2010 was isolated from bovine nasal swab samples [

 <sub>2</sub> for 4 days. IDV was propagated in ST cells using DMEM infecting media containing 0.5 μg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 days. Virus loads in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were determined on MDCK cells by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). A 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated to determine virus titers using Reed and Muench method [
