<p>To detect IBV or IDV RNA in nasal swab and BALF samples, the specific real-time RT-PCR assays were performed. For detecting the IBV RNA, the CDC developed real-time RT-PCR assay targeting flu B 
 <italic>NS</italic> gene was used [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the cutoff threshold cycle (Ct) value lower or equal to 38 was judged as positive; whereas to detect the IDV RNA, a specific real-time RT-PCR assay described previously targeting the flu D 
 <italic>PB1</italic> gene was employed [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and its cutoff Ct value lower or equal to 37 was judged as positive. RNA from nasal swab and BALF samples was extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, Maryland, USA) and the real-time RT-PCR was performed using the qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix (Quantabio, Beverly, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
