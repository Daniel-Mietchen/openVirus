<p>To determine virus titers in nasal swabs and BALF, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed. MDCK cells in 96-well plates that were infected with serially diluted samples were fixed with methanol for 10 min followed by drying. After moistening the fixed plates with PBS, the plates were incubated with 5% FBS in PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific binding of the antibodies. A volume of 50 μL of mouse monoclonal anti-IBV nucleoprotein antibody (diluted 1:1000 with 1% FBS in PBST; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) or pig polyclonal primary antibody against bovine IDV (diluted 1:200 with 1% FBS in PBST) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Following three times washing with PBST, the plates were incubated with a volume of 50 μL FITC conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:200 with 1% FBS in PBST; Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) or FITC conjugated rabbit anti-pig IgG secondary antibody (diluted 1:600 with 1% FBS in PBST; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. After decanting secondary antibodies, plates were washed three times with PBST. Fluorescence signals were observed under a fluorescence microscope.</p>
