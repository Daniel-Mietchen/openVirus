<p>Uninfected control pigs did not have any clinical signs through the length of the study with the exception of one pig that had a fever on day 6 post mock-infection. No obvious respiratory signs were observed in pigs infected with either the IBV or IDV. In contrast to the control pigs, 8 out of 10 pigs infected with IBV developed fever (temperature ≥ 104 °F) starting as early as 1 dpi and lasting from 1 to 6 days, while 9 out of 10 pigs infected with IDV displayed fever starting as early as 1 dpi and lasting from 1 to 5 days (

No macroscopic lung lesions were present in the control pigs, whereas macroscopic lung lesions were observed in pigs infected with either the IBV or IDV. The average lung lesion score was less than 2% in both IBV- and IDV-infected groups at 4, 6, and 8 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Nine out of ten pigs infected with IBV showed macroscopic lung lesions except one pig sacrificed at 8 dpi, while 8 out of 10 pigs infected with IDV exhibited gross lung lesions except one pig sacrificed at 4 dpi and one pig sacrificed at 6 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). There was no significant difference in macroscopic lung lesion severity between IBV- or IDV-infected pigs. In addition, histologic lesions were evaluated from lung lobes and nasal turbinates collected from infected and uninfected control pigs at all necropsy dates. A very low lung lesion score was found in the control pigs in contrast to higher scores in both IBV- and IDV-infected pigs at each necropsy time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Slightly higher lung lesion scores were observed in IBV-infected pigs than those infected with IDV at all 3 (4, 6, and 8 dpi) tested time points, but a significant difference was only found at 8 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The lungs of all pigs infected with either IDV or IBV showed variable degrees of microscopic lung lesions, which ranged from minimal to mild peribronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia/alveolitis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F). Peribronchiolitis was characterized by increased numbers or layers of lymphocytes, macrophages, and rarely neutrophils around bronchioles and terminal airways and occasionally vessels. Patchy to diffuse areas of interstitial pneumonia/alveolitis were characterized by thickening and increased cellularity of alveolar septae around margins of the lobules and rarely degenerate and intact neutrophils, histiocytes, and/or sloughed pneumocytes in the alveolar lumen in both IBV- and IDV-infected pig lungs. No bronchiolar epithelial necrosis was observed in any of the pigs infected with either IBV or IDV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F). Both IBV and IDV infections resulted in higher lesion scores in nasal turbinates of infected pigs than in controls although controls did have areas of mild inflammation. In contrast, a higher lesion score was found in the IDV-infected pigs at 4 and 6 dpi than in IBV-infected pigs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Numerous regions of squamous epithelium/metaplasia associated with epithelial erosions and often neutrophilic infiltrates were present in turbinates from both IDV- and IBV-infected pigs (
