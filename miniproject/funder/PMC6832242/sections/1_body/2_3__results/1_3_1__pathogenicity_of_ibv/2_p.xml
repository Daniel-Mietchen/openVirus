<p>No virus was detected in BALF and nasal swab samples collected from the control pigs. Virus was detected in BALF samples collected from IBV- or IDV-infected pigs at 4 and 6 dpi; however, none of the IBV- or IDV-infected animals had detectable virus in the BALF at 8 dpi (

 <sup>1.7</sup> TCID

 <sup>3.0</sup>, 10
 <sup>2.3</sup>, and 10
 <sup>3.5</sup> TCID

We also performed the specific real-time RT-PCR to detect IBV or IDV RNA in collected BALF and nasal swab samples of control, infected, and contact pigs. Results showed that all BALF samples collected from IBV- or IDV-infected pigs at 4 and 6 dpi were positive for the respective virus RNA except for one sample from an IBV-infected pig at 6 dpi. In addition, BALF samples from all four IDV-infected pigs collected at 8 dpi were positive by real-time RT-PCR, although no virus was isolated from these samples. A greater number of nasal swab samples was positive by the specific real-time RT-PCR as compared to BALF samples. IDV-positive swab samples were found at all time points (2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi) in IDV-infected pigs. In contrast, only three out of ten nasal swab samples collected from IBV-infected pigs were positive at 4 dpi (
