<p>No live virus was detected in BALF or nasal swab samples collected from contact pigs in both IBV- or IDV-infected group at all tested time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). No IBV RNA was detected in BALF or nasal swab samples collected from contact pigs in the IBV-infected group at any tested time point (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00905-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, IDV RNA was detected in nasal swab samples collected from contact pigs at 2, 4, and 6 dpc and in one BALF sample harvested from one contact pig at 6 dpc by specific real-time RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00905-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The other g two IDV-contact pigs harvested on 6 dpc were positive only in nasal swabs collected at 2 dpc, but not in BALF samples (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00905-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Seroconversion occurred in both IDV-infected and IDV-contact pigs as well as in IBV-infected pigs but not in IBV-contact pigs. No HI titer against both viruses was detected in control pigs. A higher HI titer was detected in the IBV infected pigs (Geometric Mean HI = 269) necropsied at 8 dpi when compared to the IDV-infected pigs necropsied on the same day (Geometric Mean HI = 135) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, no contact pig in the IBV-infected group seroconverted, but two out of three contact pigs in the IDV-infected group seroconverted (HI titer of 20) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00905-f004">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that IDV is transmissible among pigs.
