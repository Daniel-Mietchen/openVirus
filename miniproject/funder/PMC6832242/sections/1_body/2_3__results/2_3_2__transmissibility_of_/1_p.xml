<p>To compare the transmissibility of IBV and IDV among pigs by direct contact, three sentinel pigs were commingled with IBV- or IDV-infected pigs at 2 dpi. None of the contact pigs in the IBV and IDV groups showed any respiratory clinical signs during the 6-day contact period. However, all contact pigs in the IBV- and IDV-infected groups showed fever, all lasting 1 or 2 days, with the exception of one contact pig in the IDV infection group that had a fever lasting 5 days (
