<p>Taken together, we showed that both IBV and IDV can infect and replicate in pigs in the presence of IAV-specific antibodies. Despite the fact that both genera of influenza viruses do not cause severe respiratory disease in pigs, it is important to include these viruses in routine veterinary diagnostic swine panels as they could play a role in PRDC. In addition, more studies are needed to understand the molecular evolution of all genera of influenza viruses in pigs in order to protect animal and public health.</p>
