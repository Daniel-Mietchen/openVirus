<p>The similarity between currently circulating influenza virus strains in human and swine populations emphasizes the importance of influenza research in swine. Pigs were shown to harbor IBV antibodies against lineages identical to the predominantly circulating IBV lineages in humans [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis identified IBVs isolated from swine that may have originated in humans [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of reverse zoonotic/ zoonotic transmissions of IBVs from humans to swine, and swine to humans, as has been shown for IAVs [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since swine serve as a mixing vessel for different IAVs, similar reassortment events between different IBVs may also occur in pigs, which would allow to generate novel zoonotic IBVs. Although the likelihood of zoonotic transmission of IDV is not clear yet, several lines of evidence support the possibility of zoonotic IDV transmission. Firstly, a surveillance study of human serum samples found 1.3% of the tested group seropositive for IDV antibodies, with a much higher likelihood of IDV antibodies (95%) in individuals with occupational contact to cattle [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, IDV has a broader cellular tropism than ICV, is known to infect humans, and has the ability to replicate in ferrets which are a well-known animal model for human influenza studies [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As both IBV and IDV can infect and transmit in pigs [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the mixing vessel for IAVs, it is possible that novel IBV and IDV strains could be generated in pigs as well, potentially creating the risk for zoonotic transmission of novel strains to humans. Thus, more extensive studies are required to understand the pathogenicity and evolution of IBVs and IDVs in pigs to mitigate a possible threat to public health.
