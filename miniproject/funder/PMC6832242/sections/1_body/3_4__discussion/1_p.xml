<p>Unlike other animal species susceptible to influenza virus infections, swine can be infected with all four genera of influenza viruses, IAV, IBV, ICV, and IDV. Pigs are known to play a critical role in IAV evolution as the mixing vessel for different IAVs to generate novel reassortant influenza strains with the potential to infect humans and cause pandemics [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus is a good example of the critical role of pigs in the ecology of IAVs [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the biology of these viruses in pigs is not well understood. In this study, we compared the pathogenicity and transmissibility of IBV and IDV after intratracheal and intranasal infection of pigs that previously had antibodies to both H3N2 and H1N1 IAVs. We clearly showed that IBV and IDV can replicate in pigs despite the presence of IAV-specific antibodies. Additionally, we confirmed that IBV- and IDV-infected pigs shed virus via the nasal cavities, consistent with previous findings [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, IBV had a higher replication efficiency in the lower respiratory tract as compared to IDV, evidenced by a significantly higher virus titer in BALF samples in IBV-infected pigs. In contrast, IDV had a higher replication efficiency in the upper respiratory tract as more pigs shed virus for a longer period post-infection as compared to IBV. These results are in agreement with observed histopathological lesions in lung and nasal turbinate sections from pigs infected with either IBV or IDV. This finding most likely correlates with the distribution of virus receptors in pigs utilized by each virus. A previous study reported that IDV infection was limited to the upper respiratory tract, as evidenced by the lack of virus replication in lung samples from intranasally infected pigs [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We detected IDV in BALF of infected animals, indicating at least limited IDV replication in the lower respiratory tract. These different findings may be due to either the dissimilar inoculation routes (intranasal vs intranasal and intratracheal in the present study) or the different age of pigs used (11-weeks-old vs 5-weeks-old in the present study). Our results are in agreement with previous findings that IDV can be transmitted to contact pigs from infected animals [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast, IBV was not transmissible among pigs in this study, as evidenced by a lack of IBV RNA, virus, and seroconversion in contact animals, although virus shedding was found in the infected pigs. This result differed from a previous study [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is most likely a result of the IAV-positive immune status of infected and contact animals in the present study. Nevertheless, we found that presence of IAV serum antibodies does not protect from IBV or IDV infection and replication in pigs.
