<p>Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is one of the most important multifactorial disease worldwide and costs the US cattle industry over one billion dollars annually [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed a higher prevalence of IBV antibodies in PRRSV-positive swine herds [

Although PRRSV is a main contributor to PRDC, it is possible that coinfection with IBV or IDV could exacerbate clinical signs of PRDC. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the pathogenesis of IBV and IDV in swine and their roles in multifactorial diseases such as PRDC.
