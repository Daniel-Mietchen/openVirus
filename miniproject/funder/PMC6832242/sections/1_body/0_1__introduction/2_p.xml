<p>Pigs are highly susceptible to IAV, which together with other pathogens such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), 
 <italic>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Bordetella bronchiseptica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic> cause porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), resulting in significant economic losses annually for swine industry [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Importantly, swine are known as the mixing vessel for multiple IAVs to generate novel reassortant strains that have the potential to infect humans and cause pandemics [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IAV infections in pigs are widespread and still represent an enormous challenge for human and animal health due to their rapid and frequent genetic changes. All influenza genera are capable of infecting pigs, although the role of IBV, ICV, and IDV in PRDC or the reassortment potential of these strains in pigs has not been determined.
