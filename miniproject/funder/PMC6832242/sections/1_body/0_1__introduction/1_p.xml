<p>Influenza viruses are classified into four genera, including influenza A virus (IAV), influenza B virus (IBV), influenza C virus (ICV), and influenza D virus (IDV), which belong to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. IAV and IBV consist of eight negative-sense RNA segments, whereas ICV and IDV have only seven RNA segments. IAV and IBV cause severe seasonal human epidemics worldwide, resulting in 3000 to 48,000 deaths in the US each year, while ICV is merely associated with mild and asymptomatic respiratory disease in humans, particularly in children [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although IDV specific antibodies were detected in humans [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], no virus has been isolated so far. Unlike IAV which has genetically distinct subtypes based on 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins, IBV is classified into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages: the Victoria-like lineage (B/Victoria/2/1987) and the Yamagata-like lineage (B/Yamagata/16/1988) [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast, six genetically discrete lineages of ICV have been identified [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while IDV is phylogenetically classified into three clusters based on the hemagglutinin-esterase (
 <italic>HE</italic>) gene [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
