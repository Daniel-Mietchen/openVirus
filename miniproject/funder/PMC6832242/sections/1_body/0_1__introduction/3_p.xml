<p>In contrast to IAV, IBV lacks antigenic diversity and has limited gene reassortment; therefore it has not been implicated in influenza pandemics [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the lack of pandemic potential, IBV is highly prevalent in patients with flu-like symptoms and may be associated with central nervous system complications, myositis, and even fatality in infected individuals [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. IBVs have also been isolated from other animals, such as dogs, pheasants, and seals [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, IBVs were isolated from nasal swabs of naturally infected pigs in 2014 [
