<p>ICV commonly infects humans. ICV has been isolated from naturally infected pigs and has been shown to experimentally infect and transmit among pigs [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00905" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. IDV is a newly emerging genus of influenza virus, which was isolated from pigs with respiratory illness in Oklahoma in 2011, and has been proposed as a new genus of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family due to its genetic dissimilarity to other influenza viruses [
