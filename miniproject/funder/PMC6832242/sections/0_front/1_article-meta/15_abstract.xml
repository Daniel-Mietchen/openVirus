 <p>Influenza viruses are important pathogens causing respiratory disease in humans and animals. In contrast to influenza A virus (IAV) that can infect a wide range of animal species, other influenza viruses, including influenza B virus (IBV), influenza C virus (ICV), and influenza D virus (IDV) have a limited host range. Swine can be infected with all four different genera of influenza viruses. IAV infection of pigs causes the well-known swine influenza that poses significant threats to human and animal health. However, influenza virus infection of pigs with IBV, ICV, and IDV are not well-characterized. Herein, we compared pathogenicity of IBV and IDV using intratracheal and intranasal infection of pigs, which are IAV seropositive, and commingled na√Øve pigs with the infected animals to determine their transmissibility. Both viruses caused fever and some lung lesions, replicated in the lungs of infected pigs, but only IDV transmitted to the contact animals. Although IBV and IDV displayed differing levels of replication in the respiratory tract of infected pigs, no significant differences in pathogenicity of both viruses were observed. These results indicate that both IBV and IDV can replicate, and are pathogenic in pigs.</p>
