<p>Inclusion of HIV–TB-coinfected populations in TB clinical trials poses a number of challenges. To enhance their enrollment, TB trials should be conducted, at least in part, in geographic locations where HIV and TB epidemics coincide and interact. Partnering with public-funded trials networks specializing in recruitment of HIV-infected persons can facilitate this. For example, the US CDC Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC)/AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) partnership has enhanced enrollment of HIV-infected people in the Phase III randomized trial of rifapentine-containing shortened treatment for pulmonary TB (NCT02410772). Requesting culture-confirmed disease for trial eligibility also limits enrollment of HIV–TB-coinfected persons. Sensitivity of sputum smear and culture are limited by low bacillary load of TB in the context of HIV [

To ensure balanced treatment assignments among various trial subgroups, randomization could be stratified by HIV status (i.e., HIV-infected versus -uninfected) or by specific eligibility criteria (i.e., culture-confirmed versus nonconfirmed). Incorporating clinical TB diagnosis as a secondary outcome measure (ideally reviewed by an expert committee blinded to treatment assignment) may also be important for interpreting results in the overall trial population and in key subgroups. Outcome rates could also be assessed by HIV infection/HIV disease status and/or ART use, as treatment outcomes in HIV–TB-coinfected patients may be highly dependent on the specifics of ART management. Consistent with HIV and TB treatment guidelines, ART should be required or expected to be initiated within 4–8 weeks of initiating TB treatment. It is important to understand whether mortality or other poor outcomes in HIV–TB-coinfected patients is related to HIV or TB. Thus, data analysis should be stratified by HIV infection/HIV disease status (i.e., HIV-uninfected, HIV-infected with high CD4 count, and HIV-infected with low CD4 count) to reduce concerns about any potential imbalances in subgroup numbers between randomized arms.
