<p>Worldwide, an estimated 1,040,000 TB cases and 300,000 TB deaths occurred among HIV-infected persons in 2017–86% of reported HIV-associated TB deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. TB is 20–30 times more likely in the context of HIV and remains the leading cause of death in this population. Adults and children with advanced HIV disease (low CD4 count) are especially vulnerable. This subgroup has a particularly high mortality rate [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and is more likely to have disseminated TB disease and more rapid disease progression. Despite this, a 2011 review revealed that many TB trials exclude HIV-infected persons with CD4 counts &lt; 200–350 cells/mm

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], currently enrolling, and registered (clinicaltrials.gov) randomized TB trials suggests recent expansion of inclusion criteria, but HIV-infected persons with very low CD4 counts (&lt;50–100 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) remain frequently excluded (

As in children, smear-negative TB disease is common in the context of HIV, which poses challenges for TB diagnosis and treatment monitoring. In addition, polypharmacy arising from treatment of HIV, TB, and new/existing comorbidities may increase adverse events and impact adherence and tolerability. Drug metabolism, absorption, and toxicity profiles may be altered in HIV, making longer courses of treatment and side effects, such as neuropathy, liver injury, and rash, more likely [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)/paradoxical worsening, specific cytochrome interactions, poor nutritional status, and chronic inflammation further impact HIV-infected populations. As in children and pregnant women, physiologically based PK modeling can help inform TB drug dosing in the setting of HIV but cannot replace data generated from trials. In recent years, high-quality evidence has dramatically evolved the use and timing of TB treatment in relation to ART [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]—persons with advanced HIV who are diagnosed with TB are currently recommended to start ART within 2 weeks [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. However, potential DDIs remain a major concern for TB treatment in HIV-infected persons, particularly between antiretrovirals, such as protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors, and rifamycins, key TB sterilizing agents [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. DDIs and adverse effects cannot always be readily identified from observations in HIV-uninfected populations. A healthy-volunteer study assessing a TB-preventive regimen (rifapentine and isoniazid) and interaction with dolutegravir (HIV antiretroviral) found significant toxicity and was terminated early, yet these effects were not observed in a larger study of HIV-infected persons [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is important that TB trials assess the full spectrum of HIV/TB and be sufficiently powered to evaluate the impact of HIV [
