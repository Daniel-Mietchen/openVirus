<p>Considering scenarios in which disease progression and/or response to an intervention are expected to differ among adults and children, the classical approach is to conduct PK studies in children to establish appropriate dosing followed by safety and efficacy trials. For example, because children often develop less severe, paucibacillary TB, it is plausible that children would respond equally well (i.e., treatment would have at least equal efficacy) to shorter, less intense, and less complex regimens than adults while potentially improving their tolerability, safety, acceptability, and adherence. Identifying such regimens would require an efficacy study in children, as regimens that could be effective in children may be rejected in adult trials. Based on these assumptions, the currently ongoing Shorter Treatment for Minimal TB in Children (SHINE) trial (ISRCTN63579542) investigates whether a shorter 4-month regimen can be used for children with less severe disease than the standard 6-month adult regimen (
