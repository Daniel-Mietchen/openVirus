<p>Lastly, child-friendly formulations are important to ensure accurate, acceptable, and palatable doses in young children. The development and implementation of bioequivalence studies of pediatric formulations is lengthy and should start much earlier during the drug development process. A potential temporary solution is to better understand how manipulating the adult formulation affects the PK to inform pediatric use. The TASK-002 study successfully assessed the relative bioavailability of 100-mg bedaquiline tablets suspended in water versus when administered in healthy adult volunteers to inform its use in children [
