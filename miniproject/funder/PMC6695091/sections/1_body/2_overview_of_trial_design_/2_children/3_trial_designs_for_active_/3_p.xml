<p>If the exposure response to an intervention is expected to differ among children and adults, then PK/PD should be conducted to establish the exposure response in children followed by safety studies. If a PD marker is unavailable to assess pharmacologic response, as is typically the case in bacteriologically unconfirmed TB (i.e., clinically diagnosed TB), then PK studies should be followed by safety and efficacy studies [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The traditional assumption that exposure response is similar among children and adults for all types of TB is being questioned. For example, most children with pulmonary TB are sputum smear and culture negative and therefore have different bacillary burden compared with adults with cavitating disease. Given that childhood TB may differ in disease type and severity compared with adult TB, target concentrations for treatment of many forms of childhood TB may differ from those in adults. This provides additional justification for efficacy trials in children in some instances. For example, there are no data from trials investigating regimens to prevent MDR TB in either adult or child household contacts. TB-CHAMP (ISRCTN92634082) is a Phase III cluster-randomized placebo-controlled study that is specifically powered to evaluate the efficacy of 6 months of levofloxacin versus placebo for the prevention of TB in young child household contacts (age &lt; 5 years) of MDR TB cases. Although not powered for efficacy in children, the PHOENIx trial (A5300/I2003) plans to study adult, HIV-infected, and child contacts of MDR TB using delamanid versus isoniazid and is a good example of how key populations can be studied within a single Phase III efficacy trial (
