<p>In contrast, when considering scenarios in which children and adults are expected to have similar disease progression, response to an intervention, and exposure response, then it is logical to conduct PK studies to achieve drug exposures similar to adults, followed by safety trials at the proper dose. For individual TB medications, it is reasonable to assume that the response in children would be at least as good as in adults. Therefore, repeating formal efficacy studies for individual TB drugs in children is unnecessary. Instead, the focus should be on trials to establish PK, dose, and safety in children. Many of the trials shown in

 </bold> are such studies, including the pediatric trials of the recently approved drugs bedaquiline and delamanid. Another example is the Opti-Rif Kids trial (South African trial identifier 27-0117-5411), which aims to characterize rifampin doses among children 0 to &lt;12 years old that approximate exposures observed in adults receiving higher rifampin doses (â‰¥35 mg/kg) in adult trials [

It is especially critical to include young, small children given that the effects of age and weight are most pronounced in this subgroup. Traditionally, age-de-escalation studies have been a major feature of pediatric PK-focused Phase I/II trials whereby children have been studied in series, rather than in parallel, starting with older children and progressing to younger children. This approach, however, should be avoided if possible: it is costly and time consuming; older children may have limited ability to inform dosing and safety in the youngest children, for whom there is the most uncertainty; and regulatory agencies do not strictly require age de-escalation [
