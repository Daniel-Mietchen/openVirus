<p>Globally, approximately 10% of TB cases occur among children (0–14 years) annually. Of the estimated 1,000,000 cases in 2017, only 360,000 were notified to WHO, yet children &lt; 5 years old are particularly vulnerable, accounting for &gt;50% of child TB cases and approximately 80% of child TB-related deaths [

In contrast to the situation in adults, children display a wide spectrum of TB disease phenotypes ranging from nonsevere, often paucibacillary pulmonary/intrathoracic TB (usually uncomplicated lymph node disease) to severe disseminated TB and TB meningitis, a major cause of TB-related morbidity and mortality in children [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Paucibacillary intrathoracic TB (minimal or nonsevere TB) is more prevalent overall, and TB treatment outcomes are generally good for drug-sensitive (DS) and drug-resistant (DR) TB (provided treatment is initiated early), even when considerably lower doses of antituberculosis drugs were used for DS TB [

PK also varies because of effects related to child age and size. Young children, particularly &lt;2 years old, are at much higher risk of developing TB and severe disease forms [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and typically require higher mg/kg doses of most TB drugs to reach adult therapeutic targets. Finally, TB diagnosis and treatment response monitoring rely on clinical, more subjective measures in at least 60% of children, as young children cannot spontaneously produce sputum for examination, and paucibacillary disease (sputum smear negative) is diagnosed by culture, the current diagnostic gold standard, in only 30%–40% of cases [
