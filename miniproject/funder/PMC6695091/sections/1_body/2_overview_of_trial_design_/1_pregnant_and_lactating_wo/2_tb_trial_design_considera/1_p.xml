<p>In 2018, the US FDA and the US Federal Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (PREGLAC) issued separate documents to accelerate inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in clinical trials. The FDA draft guidance [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] outlines prerequisites for “reasonable” and “ethically justifiable” inclusion of pregnant women in premarketing studies (i.e., “adequate” preclinical data plus the potential to provide unique clinical benefit to the woman or fetus) and postmarketing studies (i.e., “adequate” nonclinical data plus established safety in nonpregnant women and no alternate means to extrapolate efficacy and/or assess safety). Generally, Phase I and II trials should be conducted in nonpregnant women of reproductive age, and inclusion of pregnant women should be considered in Phase III or IV trials based on clear risks and benefits assessment. Critical trial components include PK data with minimum requirements (i.e., gestational age at enrollment, gestational timing/duration of drug exposure, and pregnancy outcomes [adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal events]), obstetrical care meeting recognized standards for pregnant women on trial, and follow-up safety data among infants of mothers with investigational drug exposure. The FDA also provides guidance regarding evaluation of systemic drug exposure to fetus/newborn, women who become pregnant on study, obtaining adequate nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicology data, identifying trial populations standing to benefit most while minimizing risk, gestational timing of investigational drug exposure relative to fetal development, and appropriate control populations. In its report, PREGLAC highlighted 15 recommendations to encourage research on therapies during pregnancy and lactation, the majority of these being of particular relevance to TB therapeutics [
