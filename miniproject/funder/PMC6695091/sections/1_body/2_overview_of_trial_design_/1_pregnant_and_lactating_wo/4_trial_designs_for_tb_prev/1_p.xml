<p>Despite the large burden of LTBI and risk of progression to active TB, pregnant women have been systematically excluded from the &gt;12 Phase III and postmarketing clinical studies of TB preventive therapy [

The relative risks and benefits of immediate antepartum versus deferred postpartum IPT initiation was assessed and included careful monthly monitoring of maternal, fetal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes. No differences in maternal safety outcomes, maternalâ€“infant TB, or infant safety outcomes were found between arms, but an increase in composite adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed in the immediate IPT arm. Shorter-course, efficacious TB preventive therapy regimens have been studied in nonpregnant adults [
