 </bold>). This protocol is enrolling pregnant and lactating women to assess the safety and PK of first- and second-line TB drugs routinely used in clinical practice as regimens evolve [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Assessments are made by pregnancy trimester, at delivery, and postpartum, with careful monitoring/ascertainment of maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes. PK of multiple TB drugs are captured in maternal plasma by pregnancy stage and from cord blood, breast milk, and infant samples along with relevant maternal–fetal–infant safety and clinical outcomes. This model also allows for study of DDIs between TB drugs and both antiretrovirals and postpartum contraceptives [
