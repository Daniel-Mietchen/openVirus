<p>Inclusion in Phase III trials is likely the only way to access more optimal regimens/newer agents and generally the only way to obtain safety, PK, and outcome data in this population, as postmarketing studies are not prioritized for funding or by regulatory bodies. In this respect, because MDR TB has significant morbidity and mortality and because many MDR TB drugs are associated with substantial intolerance and adverse effects, it is reasonable to consider inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in Phase III MDR TB treatment trials when there is no teratogenicity signal from reproductive toxicity. However, to our knowledge, no Phase III trial of MDR TB treatment has included pregnant women to date. To counter the automatic exclusion of pregnant women that currently pervades the TB trial landscape, early discussion among trialists, pharmaceutical companies, maternalâ€“child experts, ethicists, and regulatory bodies are needed to address risks, benefits, and compelling rationale for inclusion [
