<p>Another important approach is to capture pregnancy outcomes among women who become pregnant while participating in a therapeutic trial. Current practice is to discontinue study drugs at the time pregnancy is identified and define the participant as “unassessable.” Instead, newly pregnant participants should be reconsented, offering the option to continue the study drug unless teratogenicity is known or suspected. All current information concerning the drug/regimen during pregnancy should be reviewed and communicated, including any shifts in risk–benefit balance, and carefully described to the patient. Examples of such secondary consent forms have been developed and are already used in some clinical trials [

Furthermore, support and mandates to standardize systematic data collection and reporting to a global pregnancy TB treatment registry is urgently needed. Similar to the HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) registry, data from pregnancy, delivery, and infancy until age 6 months should be mandated [

Whether from trials or registries, collecting PK and outcome data among pregnant women will be invaluable and can be pooled for analysis once sufficient data have accumulated. Novel physiologically based PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling can also be applied to estimate drug dosing in pregnancy, but prediction of safety and toxicity profiles still requires trial data [
