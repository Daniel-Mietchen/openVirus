<p>In most countries, TB incidence peaks in women of reproductive age, irrespective of HIV [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Pregnancy is not routinely included in national/international TB registries, but worldwide, at least 216,000 TB cases are reported to occur in pregnancy annually [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Immune changes in pregnancy may alter the risk of disease, TB presentation, and diagnosis [

Complications of TB developing during pregnancy and lactation are well known and can include maternal death, preeclampsia, vaginal bleeding, and maternal death as well as prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal or infant death, particularly if TB is inadequately treated [
