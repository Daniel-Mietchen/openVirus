<p>Regardless of age, HIV-infected persons are at highest risk of developing TB and have a high TB-related mortality. In this population, differential responses to TB treatment and preventive regimens and overlapping toxicities between HIV therapies and TB therapies are such that safety, toxicity, and DDIs cannot be predicted by modeling alone. In particular, adults and children with advanced HIV disease have more complex and unknown responses, toxicities, and DDIs than HIV-infected persons with higher CD4 T-cell counts. This subgroup is important to include in TB trials, as they may benefit from new TB therapies, but this needs to be ascertained carefully and is best done in a clinical trial setting.</p>
