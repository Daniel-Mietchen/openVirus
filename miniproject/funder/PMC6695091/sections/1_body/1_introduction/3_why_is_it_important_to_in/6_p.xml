Controlled trials are also essential to assess specific TB treatmentâ€“associated outcomes and adverse effects. However, there are also issues of justice and access to the benefits of research participation. Inclusion in clinical trials is likely the only way for pregnant/lactating women, children, adolescents, and HIV-infected persons to access or accelerate access to new regimens and medications.
