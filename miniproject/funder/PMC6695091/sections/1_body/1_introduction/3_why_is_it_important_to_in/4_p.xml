<p>In pediatrics, off-label drug use is a common practice and is largely based on adult studies without rigorously conducted pharmacokinetics (PK), dose-finding, or formulation studies in children [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Children, however, are not small adults. The age-related risk of progressing to disease after TB infection and excess risk of disseminated forms of TB in children mandate the study of new therapies in this group. Additionally, it is critical to include young, small children in trials given that the effects of age and weight on PK are most pronounced and challenging to predict in this subgroup. Notably, the 2011 revised WHO dosing guidelines for first-line TB drugs in children &lt; 12 years old were based on studies suggesting that young children require higher mg/kg doses [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the evidence supporting these dosing recommendations was limited and especially lacking in studies using high-quality drug formulations. With a wide spectrum of disease, children with paucibacillary intrathoracic TB may in fact require lower total drug exposures (lower dose and/or shorter regimen), whereas children with more severe pulmonary TB or disseminated disease (e.g., TB meningitis) may require higher doses than adults.
