<p>Although concerns of potential harm from TB therapeutics are understandable, a scientific and ethical foundation exists for including pregnant and lactating women and other key populations in trials of TB medicines for prevention and treatment [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]—namely, the need for effective treatment and evidence-based answers to enable patients to make fully informed choices for themselves (and the developing fetus) based on risks and benefits of specific therapies. However, these data are rarely available [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Pregnant and lactating women, children, and HIV-infected persons each have unique features. Thus, assumptions made from therapeutic TB trials excluding these populations are not always applicable, and data cannot be reliably extrapolated from other populations. Without high-quality data from targeted studies, many unanswered questions remain concerning optimal TB regimens, optimal dosing of new/existing TB drugs, and their safety.
