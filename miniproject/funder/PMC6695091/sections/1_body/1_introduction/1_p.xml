<p>Globally, 10 million cases of active tuberculosis (TB) disease and 1.6 million TB-related deaths occurred in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Pregnant and postpartum women, children &lt; 15 years old, and HIV-infected persons account for 20% of the global TB burden, with an estimated 216,000, 1,000,000, and 1,040,000 cases each year, respectively [

Special considerations in these populations include TB disease spectrum and severity, lower diagnostic sensitivity, possible differential treatment responses, drug dosing and interactions, and challenges in acquiring high-quality data through clinical trials [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Without clear consideration of actual risks and benefits of trial participation, pregnant women have been uniformly excluded from TB therapeutic trials, especially for multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002882.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], including enrollment of key populations that may be currently underrepresented in clinical trials. Although many such populations exist, including migrants, prisoners, homeless people, and healthcare workers, the technical consultation discussions were concentrated on three populations and were framed around five questions (

This review is part of a Collection, “Advances in Clinical Trial Design for the Development of New TB Treatments: A Call for Innovation,” and highlights key aspects, barriers, and potential solutions to conducting TB therapeutic clinical trials in pregnant and lactating women, children, and HIV-infected persons [
