<p>TB therapeutic trials that exclude key populations are often not followed by trials in those populations. Pregnant and lactating women, children, and HIV-infected persons contribute a large proportion of the global TB burden and require optimized TB treatment and access to the latest therapeutic advances. Overall, adequate inclusion and appropriate study of these populations remain problematic, particularly for pregnant and lactating women; some advances are being made for children, yet pediatric TB trials lag far behind adult trials despite the potential for better TB treatment outcomes among children, and further evaluation of DDIs is needed in HIVâ€“TB-coinfected populations to ensure that HIV-infected persons, particularly those with more advanced HIV disease, more fully benefit from therapeutic advances. Importantly, despite the differences among these populations, several cross-cutting themes exist and can serve as a way forward toward inclusion of key populations in TB clinical trials (
