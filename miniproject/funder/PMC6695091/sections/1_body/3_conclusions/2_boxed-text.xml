    <p>Pregnant and lactating women, children, and HIV-infected persons have increased susceptibility to TB and variable responses during TB treatment, which cannot be predicted by modeling data alone. Inclusion into clinical trials—especially Phase IIb and beyond—is often the best way to generate population-specific data, as postmarketing studies are not prioritized and cause delay in obtaining needed information.</p>

    <p>Ethics are not a reason to exclude people from clinical trials, but careful consideration of design and involvement of content experts, regulatory agency inputs, and community participation is critical to ensure appropriate trial design and implementation. Inclusion will continue to require careful risks and benefits assessments, weighing direct benefits alongside potential risks of adverse effects from interventions on a case-by-case basis. The uncertainty cost of uniform exclusion results in lack of guidance to inform use of these important TB therapies.</p>

    <p>Design of trials requires careful attention to how safety, risks, and benefits are defined and measured. Novel approaches may be useful, such as desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR)/response adjusted for duration of antibiotic risk (RADAR), a methodology that integrates overall clinical outcome and patient-level risks and benefits and was specifically developed for clinical trials comparing strategies to optimize antibiotic use [

    <p>Rigorous qualitative research is useful to inform trial design and elicit patient, caregiver, and family preferences regarding trial participation and regimens.</p>
