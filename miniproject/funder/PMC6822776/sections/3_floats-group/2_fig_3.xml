  <title>Phylogenetic trees showing the relationship of DENV identified in AFIRE study.</title>
  <p>The AFIRE DENV 
   <italic>envelope</italic> (E) gene sequences are presented as: Subject Identification Number | Country | City | Year (in bold). The reference E gene sequences retrieved from GenBank are presented as: Accession Number | Strain (if available) | Country | City (if available) | Year (not bold). The scale presents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site along the branches. The relationships were constructed by the maximum likelihood (ML) method using nucleotide sequences of the E gene (DENV-1, 2, 4 = 1485 bp; DENV-3 = 1479 bp), with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The trees consist of 43 E gene nucleotide sequences from AFIRE specimens (DENV-1 = 12, DENV-2 = 3, DENV-3 = 19, DENV-4 = 9) and other sequences from the GenBank database. The sequences of the AFIRE DENV E gene were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers MK629460 to MK629502. The clustering of genotypes for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 referred to the classification that were described earlier [
