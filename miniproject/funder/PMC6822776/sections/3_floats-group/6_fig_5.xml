  <title>Nucleotide substitutions in TS-1 annealing site (nucleotide 568â€“586) that affected DENV-1 identification.</title>
  <p>Alignment of sequences covering the TS1 annealing region of AFIRE DENV-1 with other DENV-1 recently circulating in Indonesia as well as DENV-1 Cambodia (2001), with the prM sequence of DENV-1 Nauru/74 (GenBank Accession No M23027) as numbering reference in positive strand. Dots show similarity of nucleotides in their respective positions. Black arrow shows direction of amplification. Numbers below TS1 Mod sequence indicate nucleotide position where mismatches between the TS-1 primer and viral RNA template occur. The three AFIRE specimens that have the TS-1 mutation are 5201009, 5801015, and 5801063, the TS-1 annealing site is highlighted in grey. The sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers MK634700 to MK634702.</p>
