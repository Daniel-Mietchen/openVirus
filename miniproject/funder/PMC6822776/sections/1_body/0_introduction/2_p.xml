<p>DENV infection has a wide range of clinical presentations, from subclinical to debilitating but transient Dengue Fever (DF) to potentially life-threatening Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Atypical presentations are categorized as expanded dengue syndrome [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Diagnosis of DENV infection in Indonesia is typically based on clinical presentation, common laboratory evaluation, and rapid diagnostic tests. Specific DENV laboratory confirmation is not usually pursued. Since care for DENV infection is supportive, diagnostic inaccuracy can result in inappropriate treatment, including administration of unnecessary antibiotics for cases attributed to other infections and forgoing of needed antibiotics when other infections are presumed to be dengue. Inappropriate clinical management and inappropriate use of antimicrobials may contribute to increased morbidity, mortality and treatment cost, as well as promote antibiotic resistance.
