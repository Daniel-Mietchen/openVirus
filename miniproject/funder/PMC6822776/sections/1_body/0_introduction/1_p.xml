<p>Dengue Virus (DENV) infection is a global health threat that can strain local economies and healthcare resources. Previously unaffected countries are increasingly reporting outbreaks. Only a few countries in Europe and Antarctica have thus far evaded vector borne transmission of DENV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It was recently estimated that 390 million (95% CI: 284–528 million) DENV infections occur annually and 96 million (95% CI: 67–136 million) were symptomatic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indonesia is a DENV endemic region and has experienced a 700-fold increase in incidence over the past 45 years [
