<p>Our data also demonstrated that children were exposed to DENV early in life. This finding was consistent across sites. By age 5, more than 40%, and by age of 12, more than 90% showed serologic evidence of prior exposure. Our results are consistent with prior studies of sero-prevalence in Indonesian children, which have shown that 33.8% of children younger than 4 years and 89% of people older than 14 years had been exposed [

The finding that seronegative vaccinees have an increased risk of hospitalized or severe dengue manifestation starting about 30 months after the first DENV vaccine dose has led the WHO to update its recommendations on DENV vaccination [
