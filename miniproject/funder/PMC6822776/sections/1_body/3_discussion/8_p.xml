<p>Severe dengue occurred with secondary DENV-1 and DENV-3 infection. It is known that secondary infections are more likely to be associated with severe disease than primary infections. In a meta-analysis demonstrating that likelihood of severe dengue varies amongst serotypes, primary infection with DENV-3 and secondary infection with DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 were more likely to result in severe dengue in South East Asia [
