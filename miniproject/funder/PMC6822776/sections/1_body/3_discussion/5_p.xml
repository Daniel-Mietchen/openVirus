<p>Dengue diagnostic inaccuracy may reflect overlap of the dengue clinical syndrome with that of several other infections, suggesting the need for increased awareness of the differential for dengue. Consideration should be given to routine use of diagnostic criteria such as the WHO 2012 criteria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which considers clinical parameters, hematology, and dengue diagnostics, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Incorrectly attributing another condition to dengue, which is managed supportively, can result in non-administration of necessary medication and hence worse outcomes. Alternatively, mistaking dengue for bacterial infection can engender unnecessary use of antibiotics and potential development of resistance. Factors contributing to diagnostic inaccuracy merit additional investigation.
