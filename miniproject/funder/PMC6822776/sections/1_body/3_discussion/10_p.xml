<p>We herein report DENV-1 virus with TS1
 <sub>3</sub>(A→G), TS1
 <sub>13</sub>(G→A), TS1
 <sub>16</sub>(C→T), and TS1
 <sub>19</sub>(C→T) substitutions in the annealing site of the TS1 primer (nucleotide 568–586). TS1
 <sub>19</sub>(C→T) prevents successful DENV-1 serotype determination, as also observed from DENV-1 strains in Cambodia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We indeed observed TS1
 <sub>19</sub>(C→T) in DENV-1 from a 1998 DHF case in Indonesia (DENV-1 98901518, GenBank accession number AB189120). However, TS1
 <sub>19</sub>(C→T) that was identified in three DENV-1 from this study (5201009, 5801015, 5801063) are not identical to 98901518 since they have three additional mutations within the TS1 annealing site that were not observed in 98901518. Continuous monitoring for genomic mutations may be warranted because failure in serotype determination might mask the true prevalence of circulating DENV. Clinical implications of TS1
 <sub>19</sub>(C→T) substitutions were not evident based on our data.
