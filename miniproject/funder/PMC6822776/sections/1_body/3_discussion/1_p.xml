<p>Our data confirm that dengue is the most common cause of acute febrile illness requiring hospitalization in Indonesia. Our rate of dengue (31.9%) was high relative to previous reports. One study in India did find that DENV infection was responsible for 27% of acute fever syndromes [

Our highest rate (52%) occurred in Denpasar, consistent with the Indonesian Ministry of Health dengue data which showed that Bali province had the highest incidence of dengue infection in Indonesia from 2011 to 2015 [
