<p>The diagnosis of dengue was missed in 54 (11.5%) cases. In most of these, dengue had been considered and then ruled out based on rapid testing. Clinicians often requested only the NS1 antigen or the IgM/IgG rapid tests. Difficulty in interpreting these results without accurate information about onset of illness may have contributed to the missed diagnoses. In the two fatal cases, comorbidities may have influenced the clinical and laboratory findings, confounding the diagnosis. Most of the missed cases (44/54, 81.5%) were mild (DF), suggesting that in the absence of typical presentations (hemoconcentration, severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding manifestation, or shock), and/or incompletely performed dengue rapid diagnostic test, clinicians may overlook dengue as a cause of fever [
