<p>Our study had several limitations. The study was not designed as a dengue evaluation and included only febrile hospitalized patients. Since dengue can be subclinical or mild, and may not require hospitalization, generalizability of our findings is limited. Furthermore, management of cases was determined by the site clinicians; it was not standardized nor was it assessed in detail. Thus, it is difficult to infer causality with regards to patient outcomes. However, our study may be the first to evaluate in detail the challenges of confirming dengue in a resource limited setting with multiple other endemic pathogens that have overlapping manifestations. Finally, as the mutation rate of DENV is high, the gel-based RT_PCR method that we used might miss several dengue cases. This might also be one of the reasons that we could not determine DENV serotypes in 72 subjects besides the viremic phase that had passed when blood was collected. However, the serotype detection rate (85%) in our study was comparable with other studies that used RT-PCR method [
