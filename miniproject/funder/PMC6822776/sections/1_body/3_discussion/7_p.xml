<p>All four DENV serotypes were identified at all study sites with a predominance of DENV-3 (46.8%) and DENV-1 (26.1%), except in Surabaya where DENV-2 predominated. Previously, Surabaya had shown more DENV-1, which circulated widely in 2012 [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007785.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). This may explain differences in predominant DENV serotype in our study compared to previous reports from certain cities. For example, a prior study from Denpasar conducted from March to May 2015, overlapping with our study period, found that DENV-3 is predominant [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our data agree that the predominant serotype during March to May 2015 was DENV-3, though the overall predominant serotype in Denpasar is DENV-1. It has been shown that the predominant serotype may vary between DENV-1 and DENV-3 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], though we found that predominant serotype fluctuates between DENV-1 and DENV-2 in Surabaya. Shifting of predominant serotype is associated with immune alterations in the population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], although it is unclear if this is occurring in Indonesia. Furthermore, two of our cases showed dual serotype infection, which has been reported in endemic areas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This may impact clinical presentation and is considered a major risk factor for dengue with higher severity and mortality [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Epidemiology and clinical profiles of DENV infection did not vary by serotype in our study, although this has been reported in other studies in Indonesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. High dengue prevalence amongst febrile hospitalized patients, its impact on productive populations and identification of patients with dual dengue infection suggesting that dengue serotypes may circulate simultaneously underscore the need for effective public health approaches to controlling disease.
