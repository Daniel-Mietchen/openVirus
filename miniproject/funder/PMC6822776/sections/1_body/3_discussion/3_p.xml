<p>The sensitivity of dengue diagnosis by sites was good, with 88.5% of reference laboratory confirmed dengue cases correctly diagnosed at study sites.

In most non-dengue cases, clinicians diagnosed dengue despite negative dengue rapid tests and/or non-specific clinical presentations. Over-diagnosis of dengue is consistent with prior reports, which showed even higher rates of over-diagnosis during dengue outbreaks [
