<p>DENV is a common etiology of acute fever amongst patients presenting for hospitalization in Indonesia. DENV infection diagnostic accuracy at clinical sites merits optimization since misdiagnosis of DENV infection can adversely impact management and outcomes. Furthermore, mutations may confound diagnosis. Clinicians should consider following diagnostic algorithms that include DENV confirmatory testing and policymakers should prioritize development of laboratory capacity for diagnosis of DENV and other common pathogens.</p>
