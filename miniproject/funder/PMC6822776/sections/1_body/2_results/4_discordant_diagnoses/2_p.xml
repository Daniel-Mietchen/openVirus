<p>Of these 54 cases, dengue rapid tests were performed in 29 cases at sites. In four cases, NS1 was positive but typhoid fever was the site diagnosis as the Tubex test for IgM 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> was also positive. In total, dengue was considered in the differential diagnosis in 10 of the 54 missed cases. Comorbidities were observed in 12 cases, including pulmonary tuberculosis, COPD, leukemia, thalassemia, chronic otitis, septal defect, and choledochal cyst. Subjects who were incorrectly diagnosed as non-dengue infection had higher odds of being DF than subjects who were correctly diagnosed as dengue infections; 81.5% of missed cases were clinically DF, whereas only 34.5% of those correctly diagnosed as DENV infection were DF (OR 8.3, 95% CI: 4â€“19.1).
