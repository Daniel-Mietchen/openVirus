<p>Based on clinical signs and symptoms from 468 cases of DENV infection, 187 were classified as DF (40%); 270 as DHF grade I and II (57.7%); and 11 cases as DHF grade III and IV or atypical manifestations (2.3%). Seventy-one cases were primary and 397 were secondary infection. The severe cases were more common in secondary than primary infection. While the difference was not statistically significant, our findings add to the body of evidence that secondary infection cases are more prone to becoming severe (2.8% vs. 0%, p&lt;0.15). Severe cases tended to be DENV-1 (3 cases) and DENV-3 (8 cases). Mortality due to DENV infection was low (3/468; 0.6%). The first case was a 2 year-old boy, with no underlying disease, who had a secondary dengue infection with DENV-3. He presented to the hospital with 6 days of fever, vomiting, ecchymosis, hemoconcentration (44%), leukopenia (3,800/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and thrombocytopenia (34,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). He died on day 3 hospitalization with DSS. The second subject was a 23 year-old male with leukemia, presenting with fever, epistaxis, gum bleeding, nausea, leukocytosis (13,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), and thrombocytopenia (23,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). Clinically he was classified as DF with hemorrhagic manifestations. He was hospitalized for 8 days and died with septic shock. DENV-4 was retrospectively detected by the reference laboratory. The third case was a 62 year-old man with COPD who presented with pneumonia. He had normal leukocyte and platelet counts at enrollment. He died on hospital day 3 from complications of intra-cranial hemorrhage and septic shock. DENV-1 was detected in his blood by the reference laboratory.
