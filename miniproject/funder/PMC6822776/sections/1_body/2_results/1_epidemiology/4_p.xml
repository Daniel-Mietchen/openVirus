<p>Serotypes 1â€“4 were found circulating during the entire study period with predominance of DENV-3 nationally and in most cities, except DENV-1 in Denpasar and DENV-2 in Surabaya. Monthly DENV serotype distributions by city show dynamic variation of predominant serotype (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 showed clustering in genotype I, but a specimen collected from Bandung in 2013 was genotype IV. DENV-2 specimens tended to cluster in genotype Cosmopolitan. DENV-3 specimens clustered in genotype I. DENV-4 specimens were mostly in genotype II, with a 2015 specimen from Denpasar falling within genotype I (
