<p>Recent dengue virus infection was confirmed when viral RNA and/or NS1 antigen was detected in an enrollment sample and/or IgM and IgG seroconversion or increased optical density was observed between enrollment and a subsequent time point (14â€“28 days apart). Positive DENV IgG in acute specimens was considered evidence of DENV exposure prior to enrollment. Confirmed DENV infections were considered primary when DENV IgG antibodies were not detected in acute specimens; and infections were considered secondary when IgG was detected in acute specimens.</p>
