<p>Assays were conducted using Focus Dengue IgM capture/IgG indirect and Antigen NS1 ELISA (Focus Diagnostics, CA, USA). This is a qualitative assay targeting IgM and IgG antibodies to DENV and NS1 DENV antigen. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 450 nm on a microplate reader. The index value was calculated by dividing the sample absorbance by OD cut-off. Index &lt;1.0 was considered negative, Index &gt;0.9 to &lt;1.0 was considered borderline, and Index &gt;1.0 was considered positive [
