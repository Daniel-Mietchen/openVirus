<p>Dengue serotypes were determined by Msn RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] targeting a region encompassing the C-prM gene of DENV with the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in an Applied Biosystems ProFlex PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The Msn RT-PCR product was visualized in a 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis alongside a 100-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The amplicon size for determination of serotypes are 482 bp, 119 bp, 290 bp, and 392 bp for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007785.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], respectively.
