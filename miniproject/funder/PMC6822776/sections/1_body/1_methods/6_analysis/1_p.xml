<p>All DENV cases confirmed by the reference laboratory were stratified by serotype, and further stratified by year and location; the absolute number of cases in each stratum was reported. Cases that were confirmed by the reference laboratory but missed at the study sites were stratified by the final study site diagnosis; within each stratum, clinical characteristics were summarized using absolute counts and percentages. The difference in rates of severe cases between secondary and primary infections was summarized with a point estimate, and the p-value was calculated using a chi-squared test. Discordant diagnoses were defined as those who were diagnosed with dengue at a site but did not have reference laboratory confirmed dengue, or those who did have reference laboratory confirmed dengue but were not diagnosed with dengue at a site. The contrast in rates of clinically DF patients between missed cases (those with reference laboratory confirmed dengue who were not initially diagnosed with dengue at a site) and correctly diagnosed cases (those with reference laboratory confirmed dengue who were correctly diagnosed with dengue at a site) was summarized with an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval from Fisherâ€™s exact test. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LLC).</p>
