<p>Of 945 pig serum samples, we selected 56 candidate samples for virus isolation on the basis of their RT-PCR results with the MAMD and cFD2 primers, and from these samples, we obtained the full or partial genome sequences of 5 JEV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 2). Out of a total of 22,277 mosquitoes comprising 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>16 species, we obtained the full or partial genome sequences of only 2 JEV isolates (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 3). Overall, we obtained the full-genome sequence of 4 of the 7 JEV isolates and the partial genome sequence (envelope gene) of the remaining 3 isolates (DDBJ accession nos. LC461956â€“62; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>).
