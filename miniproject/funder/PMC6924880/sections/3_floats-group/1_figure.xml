  <p>Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of JEV isolates, Japan and Southeast Asia, 2016–2018 (circles), and reference isolates constructed on the basis of the envelope gene sequence (1,500 nt). A) Genotype Ia (GIa); B) genotype GIb; C) genotypes GIII and GIV; D) parent tree showing all genotypes. Tree was reconstructed by using MEGA6 (

JEVs isolated in Japan (blue), Thailand (green), the Philippines (yellow), and Indonesia (maroon) are indicated. In panels A–C, origin, year, and country of isolation are provided in parentheses; in panel D, DDBJ and GenBank accession numbers are provided. bo, bovine; eq, equine; hu, human; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; MQ, mosquito; NA, data not available; sw, swine; wb, wild boar.
