  <p>The CCS estimated through simulation analysis for 1000 realizations, for a range of market turnover rates. (
   <italic>a</italic>) Estimated CCS for a single strain across a range of instantaneous market turnover rates for the baseline parameters (red), when transmissibility of the strain was increased by 25% (blue), and by 75% (green). (
   <italic>b</italic>) Estimated CCS for the co-infecting strains across a range of instantaneous market turnover rates for the baseline parameters (red), when transmissibility of a single founding strain was increased by 75% (green), when the transmissibility of the co-infecting strain was reduced by 25% (purple). (
   <italic>c</italic>) Estimated CCS for a single strain across a range of gradual market turnover rates for the baseline parameters (red), when transmissibility of the strain was increased by 25% (blue), and by 75% (green). (
