  <p>The prevalence of H3, H6 and H3/H6 co-infection in ducks in the surveillance data between 2005 and 2006. The red line shows the prevalence of H3, the blue shows the prevalence of H6 and the cyan line shows the prevalence of H3/H6 co-infecteds. Overall, the prevalence of both strains was much higher in 2006 compared with 2005, although despite this the overall prevalence of co-infection with both strains was low.</p>
