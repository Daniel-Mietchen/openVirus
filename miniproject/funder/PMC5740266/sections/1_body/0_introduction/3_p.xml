<p>The critical community size (CCS) for a pathogen is defined as the threshold population size required for the persistence of transmission, such that the probability of stochastic fade-out is very low [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] it has not been applied to the persistence of AI in a multi-strain system. The persistence of AI within LBMs is of public health and evolutionary importance; if multiple different AI strains persist in LBMs, there is greater opportunity for co-infection, where a co-infection is the presence of at least two independent viruses within a single host. Frequent co-infections with genetically distinct viruses increase the opportunity for novel viruses to be generated through reassortment.
