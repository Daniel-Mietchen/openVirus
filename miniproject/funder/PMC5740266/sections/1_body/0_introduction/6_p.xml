<p>Mathematical models that seek to capture the dynamic nature and rapid turnover of LBMs remain rare, with detailed work on the mechanisms that generate the observed dynamics of infection restricted to single strains [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One such analysis by Pepin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] suggested that components of the poultry distribution system (farms and wholesale LBMs (wLBMs)) feeding into retail LBMs (rLBMs) were likely to be important points in the supply chain that were contributing to the seeding and on-going spread of AI within LBMs, but that rLBMs alone were unlikely to be the source of all infection [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, further investigation is required at points in the supply chain prior to birds entering LBMs.
