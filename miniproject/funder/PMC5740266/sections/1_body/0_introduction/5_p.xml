<p>Reassortant viral lineages continue to be identified in routine surveillance data collected from LBMs [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Because co-infection of a host with two different strains is a necessary prerequisite for reassortment to occur, the higher the number of co-infection events that occur, the greater the chance that transmissible and pathogenic novel reassortant progeny will be generated. Here, we use the word strain to describe a distinct lineage that may reassort with another lineage. Currently, we have a poor understanding of the frequency of co-infection in LBMs and the factors driving persistence [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A better understanding of factors that predict the persistence of multiple strains would provide a foundation for advancing our ability to predict the risk of reassortment. Worryingly, an increasing number of studies are showing that reassortment between different AI subtypes and human endemic subtypes can readily occur [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and spillover of AI infections into the human population continue to be reported as a consequence of exposure to LBMs.
