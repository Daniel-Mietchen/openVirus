<p>If effective public health control measures are to be developed it is important to understand the ecological and epidemiological drivers of persistence such that we understand the conditions in which AI persistence is most likely to occur. Here we use a multi-strain stochastic susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model to investigate the drivers of single and co-infecting strains, where co-infecting strains are two genetically distinct, independent viruses within a single host. Subsequent reassortment that may occur following co-infection is not considered. We assess how different parameters impact the persistence probability of a single AI strain, we determine the CCS for single and co-infecting strains, and the relationship between the CCS, market turnover rate and the

We then use time series data collected in Shantou, China, in 2006 to explore the mechanisms that may generate the non-persistent multi-strain dynamics observed in surveillance data from a wLBM.
