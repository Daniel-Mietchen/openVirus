<p>In reality more strains and host species are present within a market than modelled here, and susceptibility to infection is likely to vary between hosts and strains. We assumed there was no long-term cross-protective immunity following recovery from infection with a single strain [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and that short-term cross-immunity was 100%. However, given the short average stay times of birds within the market system modelled, our assumption should not impact our findings on AI persistence. Within the system modelled there is competition for susceptible hosts, therefore if there were marked differences in fitness between the two strains it is possible that one strain may outcompete the other. The environmental transmission parameters were selected based on estimates from experimental data and values previously used in modelling studies, however, there remains large uncertainty in these values [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The impact of variation in four key parameters on the probability of persistence was done for a single strain, it would also be interesting to assess how the probability of co-infection persistence varied according to the relative combinations of these parameters across the two strains.
