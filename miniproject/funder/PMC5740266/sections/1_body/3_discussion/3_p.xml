 <sup>env</sup> were the most significant determinants of viral persistence, highlighting that further research should be conducted to more accurately quantify these parameters. The higher the market turnover rate the higher the average population size required for transmission to become self-sustaining, implying that both the size of the market and its expected turnover rate need to be considered when assessing the opportunities for AI persistence. This finding supports previous calls to reduce the time birds spend in the market [
