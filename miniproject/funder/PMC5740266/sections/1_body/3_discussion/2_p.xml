<p>We have used a stochastic transmission model to investigate which mechanistic properties and parameter sets could capture prevalence data of two co-circulating strains seen in surveillance data collected from a wLBM in Shantou, China. Our findings highlight that re-introduction of infection into wLBMs is required to generate the infection dynamics seen in surveillance data. The need to continuously re-seed infection suggests that more needs to be done at the farming and production level to ensure that birds come to the market infection free.</p>
