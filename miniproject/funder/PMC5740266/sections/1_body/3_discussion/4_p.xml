<p>Depending on the geographical location of the market the estimates of the CSS identified across a range of parameter combinations may not be considered particularly large [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With increasing market turnover rate, the estimated CCS increased. Yet as the transmissibility of circulating strains increased, the CCS for a single strain reduced substantially. Our results show that persistence of co-infection under typical market conditions requires continued seeding of both strains, and that continual introduction of both strains separately (as opposed to introduction as co-infections) can lead to long-term persistence of co-infection. This observation may mean that the co-circulation and persistence of multiple strains increases the frequency of co-infected birds, without the need to ensure frequent transmission of the co-infecting strains concurrently.
