<p>The trade of live birds in and between different LBMs is of cultural importance in mainland China [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], in addition to other regions in South East Asia and some parts of Africa. Periodic closure of LBMs can halt the transmission of AI, particularly with respect to preventing new human cases [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], however, in the absence of routine cleaning, market rest days and ensuring that birds come into the market infection free, wLBMs will continue to amplify AI. The simultaneous persistence of multiple strains within the market increases the probability that a bird will become co-infected. When co-infection risk is high, the risk of reassortment is increased, highlighting the important role that LBMs may play in the emergence of novel influenza A lineages. Our results demonstrate the importance of controlling the size of the market population to prevent self-sustaining transmission, but that uncertainty remains in terms of characterizing the ecology of LBMs in China.
