<p>There are a number of limitations to this study. The model is stochastic and the results have only been compared to data from a single year and geographical region. Therefore, there is a chance that some parameter sets performed better than others as a consequence of stochastic variation. However, the broader finding that regular external seeding of infection into LBMs is required to generate the epidemics of multiple strains observed in surveillance data is likely to hold true for other settings. We may have underestimated the CCS for the co-infecting strains as we assumed that co-infected birds only transmitted both strains concurrently. However, the probability of transmission of each strain from a co-infected host may differ, which may reduce the frequency with which co-infection events occur increasing the CCS.</p>
