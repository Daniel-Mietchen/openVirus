<p>As variation in the population size directly impacted

 <sub>0</sub>, we explored how the CCS varied when other components of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> were altered. For the single-strain CCS, we increased the within-flock and environmental transmissibility, infectious period, viral decay and shedding rates to 25% and 75% above the baseline values. For the co-infecting strains CCS we decreased all aforementioned parameters by 25% for the co-infecting strains and then increased all aforementioned parameters for one of the founding strains by 75%. Sensitivity of CCS estimates for the co-infecting strains to changes in the duration of the latent period and market turnover rates were also assessed.
