<p>We define the CCS as the population size of the market required to ensure the persistence (at least one infected bird in the market) of a single strain 1 year after infection is seeded with a probability of at least 0.99 [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The dynamics of infection and circulating strains can vary markedly between different years, therefore we considered persistence only within a single year. The definition for the persistence of co-infecting strains is more complicated. Even if direct transmission of the co-infecting strain fades out, if both individual strains are still circulating, direct transmission of the co-infecting strains can re-emerge. Thus, we calculate the CCS for the persistence of the co-infecting strains by considering the frequency with which a single introduction of both strains separately results in an epidemic of the co-infecting strains which persists for at least 1 year, ensuring the number of birds infected with strain A and B (individually), or strain AB is greater than 1 at the end of the year. The CCS was estimated through simulation.
