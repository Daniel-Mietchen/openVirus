<p>Four summary statistics were calculated for each model realization and compared to those calculated from the data [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These were: (i) correlation between the two circulating strains; (ii) the number of epidemic peaks for each strain; (iii) the periodicity of the observed epidemics (by Fourier transform of the time series); and (iv) the mean prevalence of each circulating strain. Nonparametric approximations were used to locally estimate the probability density using the 10 000 realizations of each model for each summary statistic [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The model with the largest intersection of realizations across all four summary statistics that fell within Â±50% of the data value was selected as the best performing model. All calculations and simulations were performed with R v. 3.2.1 [
