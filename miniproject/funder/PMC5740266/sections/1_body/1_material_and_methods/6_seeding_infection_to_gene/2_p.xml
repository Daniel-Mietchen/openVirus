<p>We specified a random process for the introduction of each strain, where frequency, duration and prevalence of infection imported were drawn from random uniform waiting time distributions. Birds (5000) were brought into the market on a daily basis. Birds were imported on seeding days in the 
 <italic>I</italic> state infected with strain A or B, all remaining birds were imported in the 
 <italic>S</italic> state. An illustration of the seeding process is presented in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2. Maximum and minimum ranges of infection prevalence, and duration of seeding and non-seeding days were informed by the data. Each of the 10 models corresponding to different seeding regiments (electronic supplementary material, table S2) were run for 365 days, for 10 000 independent stochastic realizations. Co-infection data were not used to match the seeding scenarios owing to the very low reported prevalence.
