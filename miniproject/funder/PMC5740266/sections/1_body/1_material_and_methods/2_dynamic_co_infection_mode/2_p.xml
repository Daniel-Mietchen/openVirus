<p>We modelled the dynamics of infection within a single LBM in rural China, where birds were moved into the LBM on a daily basis from different sized farms and geographical locations, and then moved out of the market on a daily basis through selling to other smaller markets, farmers or directly to individuals for consumption. Interactions and importations between external farms and the market were modelled such that at one time point within a day, birds would be brought into the market and at the same time point approximately the same proportion were sold onwards (i.e. instantaneous turnover). As turnover rates within markets remain poorly quantified, we also examined the effects of different fixed turnover rates (above and below 50%) on our model outcomes. We assumed the market population size remained approximately constant, which is the prevailing opinion of fieldworkers as physical space is a scarce resource within LBMs and is therefore highly utilized [

However, although the market population may be approximately constant across days (except at major holidays), it is unlikely to be constant throughout the course of a dayâ€”i.e. most birds come in in the morning (highest population size) and gradually leave throughout the day (population size decreases gradually throughout the day). Thus, we also evaluated how fluctuations in population throughout the day impacted CCS estimates. Insights from the variable population sizes throughout the day could be extrapolated to interpret the effects of variable population sizes during holiday seasons.
