<p>Birds in the 
 <italic>S</italic> compartment were susceptible to infection with all strains (A, B and AB, which denote strain A, B and the co-infection with independent strains A and B (AB), respectively). Exposed (
 <italic>E</italic>) birds were infected but not infectious to other birds, and susceptible to infection with a second strain. 
 <italic>I</italic> birds were infectious to other birds, and temporarily immune to infection with a second strain [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as a consequence of the innate immune response to infection [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In terms of adaptive immunity, 
 <italic>R</italic> birds were fully recovered, and immune to re-infection with the same strain (i.e. full homologous immunity) but were susceptible to infection with a second strain with the same probability as fully susceptible hosts (
 <italic>S</italic>) (no cross-immunity). States in which birds were 
 <italic>S</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>I</italic> or 
 <italic>R</italic> to both strains were denoted as subscripted state symbols. We do not explicitly model particular AI strains, but generally model possible multi-strain dynamics. Additional model description is provided in the electronic supplementary information. Co-infection here represents simultaneous infection with strain A and B, thus our notation for co-infection reflects the host's state. Supporting quantitative evidence for the relative infectivity of two strains in co-infected birds was limited, therefore, we assumed co-infected birds always transmitted strains A and B concurrently (i.e. equal fitness for both strains) and that this led to direct co-infection in a susceptible bird. As a minimum criteria for co-infection, each individual strain must be capable of establishing sustained transmission for a period of time in a rapid-turnover market. Therefore, we define 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>total</sup>
 <sub>0</sub> for a single strain as the sum of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>wf</sup>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
