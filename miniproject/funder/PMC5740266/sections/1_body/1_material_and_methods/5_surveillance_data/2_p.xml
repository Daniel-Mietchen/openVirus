<p>Samples from named wLBMs in Shantou, China were taken between 2005 and 2006 and were collected reliably with a frequency of two to four weeks. Embryonated chicken eggs were used to isolate virus. Subtypes H1â€“H13 were tested for with monospecific antisera in haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. Further detail on the methods of data collection can be found in Pepin
