<p>As the duration of the latent period increased for a fixed market turnover rate, the CCS of the co-infecting strains increased (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Assuming a latent period of 6 days and a market turnover of 10%, the estimated CCS was approximately 1250 birds (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). However, if market turnover was increased to greater than 40%, the estimated CCS was greater than 100 000 birds. If the latent period was 3 days or less and market turnover was less than 75%, all CCS estimates were less than 100 000 birds (electronic supplementary material, figure S6).</p>
