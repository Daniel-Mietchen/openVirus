<p>With a 25% decrease in the baseline parameters of the co-infecting strains, the estimated CCS was similar to the baseline estimates assuming instantaneous turnover (

 <italic>c</italic>,
 <italic>d</italic>). This suggests that direct transmission of co-infecting strains is less important for the persistence of co-infection, and that the main factor facilitating the persistence of the co-infecting strains is the persistence of both individual strains, where sequential infection with both strains leads to a co-infection.
