<p>As the transmissibility, decay and shedding rates and the duration of infection were increased by 75% for both founding strains, the average population size required to ensure persistence decreased (electronic supplementary material, figure S7). Considering a market turnover rate of 10%, the probability of persistence for 500 or more birds was 1, but if the baseline parameters were reduced by 25%, approximately 5000 birds were needed to ensure a persistence probability of greater than 0.99. If market turnover was 40% and baseline epidemiological parameters were increased by 75%, an average daily population of approximately 1000 birds ensured persistence. However, if market turnover was 70%, greater than 10 000 birds were needed to ensure a persistence probability of 1 (electronic supplementary material, figure S7).</p>
