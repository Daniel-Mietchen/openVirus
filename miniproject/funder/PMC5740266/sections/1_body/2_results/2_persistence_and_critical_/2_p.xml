<p>We explored the impact of four key model parameters on the probability of AI persistence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170715F2">figure 2</xref>). Increases in the values of 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sup>wf</sup>, 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sup>env</sup> and viral shedding rate (
 <italic>ω</italic>) increased the probability of persistence for a single strain, while increases in the rate of viral decay (
 <italic>η</italic>) decreased the probability of persistence. All parameter values are presented in the electronic supplementary material, table S1. Variation in the probability of persistence across the range of values evaluated reduced as the average daily population size of the market (
 <italic>N</italic>) increased. When 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sup>wf</sup> was 0.2 and 
 <italic>N</italic> = 2000 birds the probability of persistence was 0.05; when 
 <italic>N</italic> = 15 000 the probability of persistence was 0.7. Thus, the probability of persistence increased by 1300% with a 650% increase in 
 <italic>N</italic>. Equally, if 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sup>env</sup> was 0.25 and 
 <italic>N</italic> = 5000, the probability of persistence was approximately 0.60, but approximately 0.88 when 
 <italic>N</italic> = 10 000 (a 46% increase in the probability of persistence with a 100% increase in 
 <italic>N</italic>). Across all parameter ranges, the largest proportional increase in the probability of persistence was seen when 
 <italic>N</italic> increased from 5000 to 10 000 birds (electronic supplementary material, figure S4).
