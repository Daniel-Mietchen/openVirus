<p>At smaller population sizes, all parameters had a substantial impact on an invading strain's probability to persist (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170715F2">figure 2</xref>), generally, a steeper gradient and magnitude of change across the range of parameter values in smaller market sizes. When 
 <italic>N</italic> was 5000 and 
 <italic>η</italic> was 0.1, the probability of persistence was approximately 0.98, when 
 <italic>η</italic> was increased to 1.2, the probability of persistence decreased to approximately 0.25 (74%). However, when 
 <italic>N</italic> was 15 000 and 
 <italic>η</italic> was 0.1 and the probability of persistence was 1. When the 
 <italic>η</italic> was 1.2 the probability of persistence was 0.7 (a 30% decrease) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170715F2">figure 2</xref>). Differences in the probability of persistence across the parameters were least substantial when looking at 
 <italic>η</italic>, suggesting assumed values of viral decay rate may be a less important driver of persistence relative to the other parameters examined. By contrast, for any given 
 <italic>N</italic>, the greatest variation in the probability of persistence was seen for 
 <italic>ω</italic> (
