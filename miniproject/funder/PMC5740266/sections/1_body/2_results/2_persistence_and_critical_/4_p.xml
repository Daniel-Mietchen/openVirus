<p>Market turnover rate and hence average daily market population size played a key role in determining the probability of persistence. For our baseline parameters (electronic supplementary material, table S1) and an instantaneous market turnover rate of 50%, a sigmoidal relationship between the probability of persistence and CCS was observed (electronic supplementary material, figure S5
 <italic>a</italic>). Following increases in the population size above 11 800, no further marked increases in the probability of persistence were seen, suggesting the CCS for a single strain in this scenario was approximately 11 800 birds (

If an instantaneous market turnover rate of 90% was assumed the estimated CCS was approximately 120 000 birds, but if 90% were sold gradually the estimated CCS was approximately 400 000 birds (
