<p>Models for which the range of seeding days was a maximum of 12 days (models 6–10), were unable to capture the calculated correlation between the two circulating strains. Models 9 and 10 had the shortest range of seeding and non-seeding days, where infection was seeded between every 1–12 days and not seeded every 2–40 days. This suggests frequent seeding and non-seeding intervals at high levels of prevalence may be able to capture the high prevalence of infection in the data (
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), but not the dynamic interplay between two circulating strains. For models 6–10 the inability to capture some summary statistics resulted in none of these models being able to satisfy all criteria across the four statistics simultaneously (
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). If the stringency of the criteria were reduced to assess the intersection of realizations between two or three summary statistics, very limited overlap between statistics for the same model were seen (electronic supplementary material, table S6).
