<p>Model 2 seeding a prevalence of 0–50% every 5–30 days, with a maximum non-seeding duration of 80 days was most consistent with the data. We judged consistency by the number of model realizations that were able to simultaneously match all the summary statistics (
 <xref rid="RSPB20170715TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Models 1 and 2 scored the same for overall matching (6 out of 1000). We chose model 2 because model 1 had a very low number of matches to the number of strain 1 peaks. We present a random subset of four realizations obtained from model 2 (electronic supplementary material, figure S9). Models 1 and 5 were the next best performing. Both models drew prevalence values between 0 and 70% every 1–30 days, with a maximum non-seeding duration of 80 and 100 days, for models 1 and 5, respectively. Therefore, introduction of a relatively high prevalence of infection and a number of consecutive infection seeding days (greater than 5) are likely to be important features of the system.
