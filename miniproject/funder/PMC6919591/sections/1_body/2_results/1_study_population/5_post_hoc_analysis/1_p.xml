<p>As a post hoc analysis, early syphilis diagnoses that occurred on the same date as an HIV care visit (defined as presence of an HIV-related laboratory test result) were quantified for each person to assess the degree to which syphilis is diagnosed at the same time as one’s HIV care (
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Excluding eight individuals who had no HIV-related laboratory tests reported dates, there were 312 people diagnosed with early syphilis, of which 191 (61.2%) were diagnosed on the same day as the HIV care visit. Due to small cell sizes, ‘Never’ and ‘Sometimes’ virally suppressed were combined resulting in the co-variate being recategorized as ‘Yes’/’No’ to always virally suppressed. Syphilis disease stage at diagnosis was the only factor significantly associated with a same day diagnosis. MSMLWDH diagnosed with early latent syphilis were 1.41 (95% CI: 1.06–1.88) times more likely to have a same day diagnosis than those with primary syphilis. There was no significant difference between those diagnosed with secondary syphilis compared to primary syphilis. As no other variables were significantly associated with having a syphilis diagnosis on the same day as HIV care, a multivariable model was not constructed for the post-hoc analysis.
