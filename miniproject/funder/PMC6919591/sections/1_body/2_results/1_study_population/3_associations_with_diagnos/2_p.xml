<p>The final multivariable model included race/ethnicity, age, viral load suppression status, and duration of HIV infection. HIV care status and viral load suppression status were collinear (the VIF was 3.73 and 3.78 for HIV care status and viral load suppression status, respectively); therefore, only viral load suppression status was retained for the final analysis. After adjusting for all other variables in the model, non-Hispanic black MSMLWDH were 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10–1.89) times more likely to have an early syphilis diagnosis than non-Hispanic white MSMLWDH (

MSMLWDH who were categorized as always virally suppressed during the study period were more likely to have an early syphilis diagnosis [adjusted risk ratio (aRR): 3.36 (95% CI:2.09–5.42)] than those who were never suppressed. Those living with HIV for less than three years were 3.81 (95% CI: 2.50–5.81) times as likely to have a syphilis diagnosis than those living with HIV for more than 13 years.
