<p>Race/ethnicity, age, viral load suppression status, HIV care status, and duration of HIV infection were all significantly associated with a diagnosis of early syphilis (
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Non-Hispanic black MSMLWDH were 1.95 (95% CI: 1.49–2.55) times more likely to have an early syphilis diagnosis than non-Hispanic white MSMLWDH. Age was inversely associated with early syphilis diagnosis; persons 18–24 years of age were 5.74 (95% CI: 3.55–9.30) times more likely to be diagnosed with early syphilis than those aged 45 and older. MSMLWDH who were categorized as always virally suppressed or always in HIV care during the study period were more likely to have an early syphilis diagnosis [RR: 2.44 (95% CI:1.51–3.92) and RR 5.18 (95% CI:2.57–10.40), respectively]. MSMLWDH for less than three years were 7.83 (95% CI: 5.38–11.40) times more likely to be diagnosed with early syphilis than those who had been living with HIV for greater than 13 years. Zip code level percent below poverty, percent unemployment, and percent uninsured were not significantly associated with early syphilis diagnosis among MSMLWDH.
