<p>Of the 320 MSMLWDH with an early syphilis diagnosis, 261 were analyzed for missed opportunities for syphilis diagnosis during an HIV care visit (excludes eight individuals with no HIV-related laboratory tests and 51 individuals diagnosed with primary syphilis). Of individuals included in the analysis, 145 (55.6%) had at least one missed opportunity for syphilis diagnosis during an HIV care visit (
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). MSMLWDH diagnosed with early latent syphilis were 1.96 (95% CI: 1.48–2.58) times more likely to have a missed opportunity than those diagnosed with secondary syphilis. Individuals whose syphilis diagnosis date differed from their HIV care date were 1.28 (95% CI: 1.04–1.59) times more likely to have a missed opportunity than those whose diagnosis occurred on the same date as their HIV care. Race/ethnicity, age, and duration of HIV positive status were not significantly associated with having a missed opportunity.
