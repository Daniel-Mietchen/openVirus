 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] While rates are increasing among both males and females, and across all racial/ethnic groups, males accounted for 90% of all primary and secondary syphilis diagnoses in 2017, and rates among non-Hispanic black individuals were 4.5 times higher than non-Hispanic white individuals, mirroring the disparities observed for HIV.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Roughly 80% of males whose case surveillance record included information on the sex of sex partners reported having intercourse with males.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Estimated primary and secondary syphilis rates among MSM greatly exceed those of men who report having sex with women only (309.0 per 100,000 compared to 2.9 per 100,000 in 2015).[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The number of early latent syphilis diagnoses, defined as a latent stage of syphilis where the infection occurred within the past year, has also reached new highs with a 17.6% increase from 2016â€“2017.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] NYS, excluding NYC, is seeing comparable statistics with a 4.9% increase of primary and secondary syphilis from 2016 to 2017, 90.9% of primary and secondary diagnoses in 2017 among males, and rates among non-Hispanic black individuals six times higher than rates among non-Hispanic white individuals.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Early latent syphilis diagnoses increased 16.8% from 2016 to 2017 in NYS, excluding NYC.[
