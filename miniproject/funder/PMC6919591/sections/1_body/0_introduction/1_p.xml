<p>The rate of diagnosis of HIV infection has been declining in the United States, falling 10% between 2012 and 2016.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Most people newly diagnosed with HIV are men who report a history of male-to-male sexual contact (MSM), who have an estimated 1 in 6 lifetime risk of acquiring HIV.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Similarly, MSM continue to experience the highest estimated prevalence of HIV compared to people with other reported transmission categories.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Black and Hispanic MSM are particularly disproportionately impacted, with 1 in 2 black MSM, and 1 in 5 Hispanic/Latino MSM having an estimated lifetime risk of acquiring HIV compared to 1 in 11 white MSM.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In New York State (NYS), excluding New York City (NYC), there are more people diagnosed with HIV who indicated a history of MSM than all other HIV risk groups combined and rates of new HIV diagnoses among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic individuals were 7.2 and 5.4 times higher, respectively, than the rate for non-Hispanic white individuals.[
