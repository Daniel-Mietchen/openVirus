<p>Early syphilis, defined as a syphilis infection less than one-year in duration, includes primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis diagnoses.

Since a significant percentage of newly diagnosed early syphilis cases are among PLWDH, this group represents a priority population with respect to syphilis testing, treatment, and prevention of onward transmission.
