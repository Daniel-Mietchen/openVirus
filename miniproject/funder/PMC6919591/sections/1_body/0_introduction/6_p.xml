<p>In NYS excluding NYC, the degree to which early syphilis is being diagnosed among MSMLWDH and the timeliness of that diagnosis are not well understood. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: 1) establish the yearly rate of early syphilis diagnosis in the cohort, 2) assess factors associated with early syphilis diagnosis, and 3) describe missed opportunities for earlier detection of syphilis among those diagnosed with syphilis among MSMLWDH in NYS, excluding NYC.</p>
