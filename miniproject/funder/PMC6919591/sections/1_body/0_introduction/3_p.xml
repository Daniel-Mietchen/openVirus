<p>The links between syphilis and HIV are well established from both clinical and epidemiologic perspectives. Multiple studies have shown that syphilis infection, and/or co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (i.e. herpes, chancroid) can facilitate HIV acquisition and transmission.[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] One study found that 1 in 20 MSM diagnosed with primary or secondary syphilis was subsequently diagnosed with HIV within a year of their syphilis diagnosis.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Rates of incident syphilis have also been shown to be high among MSM living with diagnosed HIV (MSMLWDH).[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Specifically among persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH) syphilis infection may increase HIV viral load and decrease CD4 count, though study findings suggest antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence may mitigate these effects.[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] For these reasons, medical guidelines and recommendations call for screening PLWDH for syphilis, with more frequent screening recommended for those at highest risk of syphilis infection.[
