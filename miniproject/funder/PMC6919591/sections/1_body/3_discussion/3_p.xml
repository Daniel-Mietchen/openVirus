<p>Persons at highest risk of subsequent early syphilis diagnosis were young (&lt;35 years of age), those of racial/ethnic minority, and those living with diagnosed HIV for less than seven years. Again, this finding is similar to other studies, and support the current NYS HIV Clinical Guidelines to screen HIV positive MSM at highest risk of syphilis infection for syphilis every three months.[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Unlike other studies, persons most likely to be diagnosed with early syphilis were virally suppressed throughout the follow-up time, and in consistent HIV care.[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] These findings suggest individuals diagnosed with syphilis were receiving HIV care or, at minimum, were adherent to HIV treatment, and represent promising evidence to support the biomedical approach of HIV viral load suppression as an HIV transmission prevention method. It should be noted that HIV care was narrowly defined as receiving HIV-related laboratory tests (i.e. HIV viral load, CD4 or genotype) that were reported to NYSDOH. Individuals may be seeing a medical provider for HIV care and not be receiving HIV-related laboratory tests which are reported to NYSDOH at each of those visits.[
