<p>It should be noted that the missed opportunities should be interpreted with caution given how a missed opportunity was defined. For example, physicians may decide to monitor a patient who started ART more frequently to ensure that they become virally suppressed. The expectation to screen for syphilis at such monitoring events may not be reasonable. Alternatively, one of the HIV-related laboratory tests categorized as a missed opportunity could have been the impetus for syphilis screening. For example, for persons previously virally suppressed and on ARTs, an unexplained increase in HIV viral load may have been an indication for the clinician to screen for STIs. Furthermore, the time-bound cut points chosen to assess missed opportunities could have overestimated the duration of oneâ€™s infection, therefore misclassifying HIV care dates prior to infection as missed opportunities. This misclassification would result in an overestimate of missed opportunities. Therefore, the results of the analysis regarding missed opportunities should be interpreted with caution as they may be indicative of consistent HIV clinical care for this cohort.</p>
