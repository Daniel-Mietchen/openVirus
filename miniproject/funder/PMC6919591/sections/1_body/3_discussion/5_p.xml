<p>Interestingly, while persons diagnosed with early latent syphilis were more likely to be diagnosed with syphilis on the same day as HIV care, they were also more likely to have a missed opportunity for earlier detection. While the latter finding is likely an artifact of individuals infected for a longer duration simply having more time to have a missed opportunity, it speaks to the importance of pairing syphilis screening with HIV-related laboratory tests, especially for persons who are not experiencing any syphilis symptoms (or whose symptoms go unobserved). Though primary and secondary syphilis are marked by symptoms (rectal chancres, for example), these will not be apparent without rectal screening, which is not part of routine HIV care. Pairing syphilis screening with every HIV CD4 count or viral load assay has been recommended to clinicians providing care to MSM.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Lending further support to paired testing is that only half of those individuals diagnosed with primary or secondary syphilis in this cohort were diagnosed on the same day as HIV care. Lastly, there were no other associations found between the covariates assessed and having a missed opportunity. Therefore, while some populations are at a higher risk of a syphilis diagnosis, screening for syphilis among PLWDH should be universal.
