<p>In conclusion, this study supports the notion of high interrelatedness of syphilis and HIV, especially among MSM. Consistent and routine screening for syphilis among MSMLWDH is needed. Continual integration of syphilis testing during routine HIV care could help increase early identification of syphilis infection and help decrease transmission rates. Biomedical approaches, such as HIV viral load suppression, have increasingly become the cornerstone of efforts to end the HIV epidemic and must be leveraged in order to maximize opportunities for STI detection, especially since STIs can increase HIV viral loads. Comprehensive sexual health continues to be paramount to ensuring HIV and STI prevention. Additional studies examining the relationship between HIV viral load suppression status and syphilis diagnosis, as well as the relationship between syphilis testing and/or diagnosis should be conducted.</p>
