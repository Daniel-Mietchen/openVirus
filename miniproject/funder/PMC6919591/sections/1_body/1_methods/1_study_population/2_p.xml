<p>Employing a retrospective cohort study design, this cohort of individuals living with diagnosed HIV was matched to early syphilis diagnoses reported to the NYS Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System (CDESS) between July 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016. The study follow-up time was selected to increase the probability that the syphilis infection, regardless of when it was reported to CDESS, occurred after an individualâ€™s HIV diagnosis; individuals included in the study had to be diagnosed with HIV for at least one year prior to the start of the July 1, 2014 follow-up. Early syphilis diagnoses were defined as diagnoses meeting CDC case definitions for primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, and were staged per CDC case definition at the time of the diagnosis (reflecting the results of laboratory data, physical examination, and partner services investigation information).[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Persons from the cohort who matched to at least one early syphilis diagnosis during the follow-up period were defined as having had a subsequent early syphilis diagnosis. For persons with multiple syphilis diagnoses, only the first diagnosis was included.
