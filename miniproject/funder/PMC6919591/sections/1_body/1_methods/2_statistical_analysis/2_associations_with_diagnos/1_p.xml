<p>Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine associations between available covariates and subsequent early syphilis diagnosis. For the bivariate analysis, unadjusted risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all individual- and zip-code-level covariates. Only covariates significantly associated with the outcome in the bivariate analyses were included in the multivariable analysis. The final multivariable model was restricted to covariates that remained significant at a significance level of &lt;0.05 and were not highly collinear. Collinearity was assessed by calculating the variance inflation factor (VIF) for all variables considered for inclusion in the multivariable model. Available covariates included: race/ethnicity, age, duration of HIV positive status, HIV care status, HIV viral load suppression status, and socioeconomic variables. All demographic and HIV-related outcome variables were extracted from eHARS. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other. Age was defined as one’s age at the start of the study period and was categorized into 10-year increments after the age of 24; age groups were defined as follows: 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, and 45+. Ages higher than 45 were collapsed to one category to ensure adequate cell sizes in the analysis.</p>
