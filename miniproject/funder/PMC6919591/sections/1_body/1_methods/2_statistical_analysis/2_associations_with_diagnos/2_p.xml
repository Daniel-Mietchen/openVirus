<p>Duration of HIV positive status was calculated as the difference in years from the initial HIV diagnosis until the study start year of 2013. Presence of a CD4, HIV viral load, or HIV genotype test result reported to the NYSDOH was used as a proxy for HIV care. HIV care status from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016 was defined as: 1) always in care: presence of at least one HIV-related laboratory test per year of follow-up (i.e. HIV-related laboratory testing collection dates â‰¤ 13 months apart); 2) sometimes in care: at least one HIV-related laboratory test during follow-up [i.e. HIV-related laboratory testing collection date(s) &gt;13 months]; and 3) never in care: no evidence of an HIV-related laboratory test reported to the NYSDOH within the study period. HIV care data prior to the start of follow-up was included to allow individuals time to get into HIV care.</p>
