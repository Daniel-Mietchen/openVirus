<p>People who had both evidence of any HIV-related laboratory testing during the study period and a subsequent syphilis diagnosis were assessed for missed opportunities for earlier syphilis diagnosis. Missed opportunities were defined by the absence of a syphilis diagnosis on the same date as an HIV care visit, defined as an HIV-related laboratory test (i.e. CD4, HIV viral load, or HIV genotype test), within a given window corresponding to syphilis staging as follows: for individuals diagnosed with secondary syphilis, any HIV-related laboratory test from one week to three months prior to the secondary syphilis diagnosis was defined as a missed opportunity for earlier syphilis detection.[

 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] For those diagnosed with early latent syphilis, HIV-related laboratory tests from one week to six months prior to the syphilis diagnosis were defined as a missed opportunity.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] These time-bound cut points were chosen based on the natural course of syphilis infection.[
 <xref rid="pone.0226614.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] The presence or absence of a missed opportunity was determined for each person based on their syphilis stage at diagnosis. Individuals diagnosed with primary syphilis, or those with no reported HIV care dates, were excluded from the potential missed opportunity analysis.
