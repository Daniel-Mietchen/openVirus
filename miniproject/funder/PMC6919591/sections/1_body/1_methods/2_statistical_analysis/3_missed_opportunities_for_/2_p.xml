<p>Bivariate and multivariable associations between the following covariates and having a missed opportunity were assessed: syphilis disease stage, race/ethnicity, age, duration of HIV positive status, and syphilis diagnosis on same day as HIV care. HIV care and viral load suppression status were not included in this analysis as covariates given that persons eligible for this analysis were selected based upon receipt of HIV-related laboratory tests and would therefore introduce bias in measuring these covariates. Multivariable modeling methods for this analysis mirrored those employed for examining the relationship between the listed covariates and a subsequent early syphilis diagnosis.</p>
