<p>Yearly unadjusted rates of early syphilis diagnosis per 100,000 MSMLWDH in NYS excluding NYC were calculated for calendar years in which full years of data were available. Yearly rates were calculated for 2015 and 2016 by dividing the number of early syphilis diagnoses each year by the study population and presented as a rate per 100,000 persons per year; for the 2016 rate, diagnoses in 2015 were removed from the study population. Rates for 2014 were not calculated because early syphilis diagnoses were only matched for the second half of the year.</p>
