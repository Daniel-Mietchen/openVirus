<p>To identify the seasonal variation of the dengue infection, analysis of the data on monthly basis were done. A gradual increase in dengue positivity was noticed from September with a peak in October, in the year 2016 which is quite close to finding by 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al. (2011)</xref>. But in the year 2017 the dengue cases started to increase from the month of May with a peak in July, August. However, the seasonal variation in the year 2018 seems quite different with low level of dengue cases and uneven distribution pattern throughout the year. Such uneven pattern of seasonal variation of dengue infection is quite different from the studies done by

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al. (2011)</xref>. Such pattern is an indication for weak relationship between monthly mean temperature and incidence of dengue as indicated by studies done by 
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al. (2002)</xref>. As revealed by the study of 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Guha-Sapir &amp; Schimmer (2005)</xref> the present study supports the oversimplification of the relationship between temperature, rainfall and increasing vector-borne disease. However the indication of overall dengue infection in the three years of study seen mostly during rainy season of the state (Juneâ€“October) indicates its correlation with monsoon season. Moreover anthropogenic climate change due to human activities such as extensive urbanization, explosive growth of population, deforestation/degradation of forests for industrialization, increasing emissions of fossil fuel, waste disposal etc. may have paved a way for increase of vector borne diseases such as dengue (
