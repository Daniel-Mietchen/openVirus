  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of haplotypes from RCC11/10 (A) and UVEVV51/10 (B) outbreak based on 450 bp of the P2 region.</title>
  <p>The nucleotide dendrogram was inferred using the UPGMA method with distance calculation by number of differences method using the MEGA7 software. A bootstrap of 1000 replicates was performed, and values above 75 are shown. Bold indicates reference strains. Haplotypes names are composed of sample name, number of haplotype.</p>
