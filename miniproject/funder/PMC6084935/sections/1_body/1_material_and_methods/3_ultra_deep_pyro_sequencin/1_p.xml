<p>UDPS was performed using a 454/GS-Junior deep sequencing platform (Roche, Branford, CT, USA). Briefly, after purified RT-PCR products were pooled equimolarly at 10
 <sup>9</sup> molecules/ul, they were subjected to 15 cycles of re-amplification for the addition of the MIDs, multiplex identifier oligomers of 10bp. Amplification products were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), evaluated using the BioAnalyzer DNA 1000 LabChip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and quantified by PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Massive parallel sequencing was performed in a 454/GS-Junior platform (Roche, Branford, CT, USA), using titanium chemistry (GS Junior+ Series, XL+ Kit), which enables sequencing up to 700-nt fragments.
