 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, the fasta file from the GS-Junior was demultiplexed to obtain a fasta file for each sample and strand. Reads not identified by MID and/or primer were discarded. The allowances were two mismatches in the specific sequence, three on the universal M13 sequence and one on the MID sequence with no indels. Sequences not covering the full amplicon or showing more than 2 Ns or 3 gaps were discarded. Sequences not observed on the forward and reverse strands at a minimum abundance of 0.1% were discarded. Different haplotypes, defined as reads covering the full amplicon, were identified and their frequencies computed as the number of observed reads. All sequence data are available from the SRA database (accession number SRP150980).
