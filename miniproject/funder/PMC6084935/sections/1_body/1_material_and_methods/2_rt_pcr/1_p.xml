<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 150 μl of 10% stool suspension in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and was stored at −80°C. A two-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was employed to amplify a 450-bp region of the HuNoV genome encoding for P2. Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) was used for the RT and high-fidelity 
 <italic>Pwo</italic> DNA Polymerase (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland) for the PCR. Primers are described in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and include a template-specific sequence and a universal M13 sequence required in the multiplex Ultra-Deep Pyro Sequencing (UDPS) reaction [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. RT-PCR products were purified from agarose gel bands using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) and quantified using a NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE).
