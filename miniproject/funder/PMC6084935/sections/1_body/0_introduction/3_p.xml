<p>Noroviruses are classified into seven genogroups (GI to GVII) and nearly 40 different genotypes, being genogroup I and II the most relevant for human infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Genogroup II is the most prevalent one, accounting for around 90% of all infections, and GII.4 has been the most commonly isolated genotype in most parts of the world during the last decade [

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. New genetic clusters of GII.4 arise every 2 to 4 years under the pressure of herd immunity [

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], although the reservoir for such variants is still poorly characterized. In individuals chronically infected with HuNoV (mostly immunocompromised patients) new variants may arise due to the accumulation of mutations during the protracted virus replication. In addition, a lower replication fidelity of GII.4 pandemic strains has also been related to an increased intra-host diversity [
