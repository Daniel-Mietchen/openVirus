<p>However, despite it is clear that HuNoV intra-host population diversity is higher in persistently infected immunocompromised individuals, HuNoV quasispecies distribution and evolution patterns in both symptomatic and asymptomatic acute infections has not been extensively studied [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Genetic variability is one of the main factors contributing to the high incidence of HuNoV in the human population, and a better knowledge of HuNoV evolution driving forces is of clinical and public health interest.
