<p>The viral RNA genome is about 7500 nt long with three open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 encodes for a polyprotein that is processed co- and post-translationally by the viral protease to generate six mature active proteins [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. ORF2 and ORF3 are translated from subgenomic RNA and encode VP1 and VP2, respectively. VP1 is the major capsid protein and is organized into two domains [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the shell (S) and the protruding (P) domain. P domain is subdivided into two subdomains P1 and P2. P1 subdomain is more conserved than P2 which is the most exposed region of the capsid and contains the Human Histo-Blood Group Antigen (HBGA) binding function and antigenic determinants [
