<p>It is described that HuNoV GII.4 is able to generate new antigenic variants that have the potential to escape herd immunity by accumulation of mutations at major blockade epitopes [

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, numerous SNPs were found in sequence variants from both outbreaks, and 21 of them produced amino acid changes at sites previously determined to be functionally significant. Some of these changes occurred at or near described epitopes A, B, D, and E, while none of them affected any of the described receptor binding pocket sites.
