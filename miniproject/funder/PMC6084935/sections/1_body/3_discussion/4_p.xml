<p>The NGS analysis of samples belonging to UVEVV51/10 outbreak occurring at a nursing home allowed us to confirm earlier results reported by Sanger sequencing [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While subjects C and D shared some of the haplotypes, sequences detected in subjects E and F were markedly different, suggesting more than one introduction of HuNoV in the nursing home. However, since transmission has been shown to be an important source of diversity and minor variants at frequencies as low as &lt;0.01% have been shown to be efficiently transmitted from a donor to a recipient [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], viral transmission between subjects C or D and E and F cannot be completely ruled out. Quality filters performed during our NGS analysis excluded haplotypes at frequencies lower than 0.1%. Indeed, the type of transmission event (foodborne, fecal-oral, vomit-oral, etc) may also affect viral population diversity. Workers at nursing homes may be frequently exposed to episodes of vomiting and diarrhea and minor variants may disseminate more easily [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Indeed, the total number of different haplotypes found in the nursing home outbreak was higher than in the foodborne outbreak.
