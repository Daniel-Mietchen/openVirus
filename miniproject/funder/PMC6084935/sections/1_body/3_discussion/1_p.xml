<p>In this work we used amplicon-NGS analysis to investigate the viral population of selected individuals linked to the same outbreak, as well as to analyze the intra-host HuNoV evolution dynamics over time. Since all investigated subjects suffered an acute infection, viral populations observed were highly homogeneous as expected. However, studied individuals who were asymptomatically infected had a higher haplotype diversity, suggesting that they may also act as a reservoir of novel genetic variants. Asymptomatically infected individuals are usually underreported and may transmit the virus in the absence of maximized hygiene habits.</p>
