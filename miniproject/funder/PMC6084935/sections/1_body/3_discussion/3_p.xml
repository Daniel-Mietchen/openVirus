<p>The effect of other factors related to the host on the degree of intra-host haplotype diversity could be especially observed in foodborne outbreak RCC11/10, which had been caused by a common source (contaminated shellfish). In this outbreak, a greater level of variability was found in the subject who did not develop symptoms. The relationship between the immune response raised to clear infection and the occurrence of symptoms is still poorly understood, and although a larger number of asymptomatic infected individuals should be tested to confirm this idea, our observations suggest that people infected by HuNoV who do not suffer symptoms may act as a reservoir for viral antigenic variants. While a properly functioning immune response may induce a higher fixation rate of mutations [
