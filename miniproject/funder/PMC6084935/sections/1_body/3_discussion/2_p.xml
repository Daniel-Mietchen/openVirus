<p>Of note, the pattern of evolution of HuNoV variability over time differed in the 2 analyzed symptomatic subjects. While the single initial haplotype was maintained in one of them (subject A) during at least 8 days, diversity in subject D, which also was initially higher, increased from 3 to 18 haplotypes in only 5 days, revealing an average of 0.0062 nucleotide changes per nucleotide per day. Although still remarkable, this variation rate is significantly lower than what was described for immunocompromised patients chronically infected with HuNoV, which ranged between 0.03 to 0.37 nucleotide changes per day considering the full genome consensus sequence variation over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition to unknown individual factors, such as genetic differences or the history of previous infections by different strains of each subject, the degree of diversity in the transmitted/founding population that initiated the infection in both individuals may have also been different. Although our analysis did not indicate a correlation between haplotype diversity and viral load within a given sample, the initial viral load may be important in determining the evolution pattern. Individual D, who had the highest initial viral load at day 1 showed the highest diversity over time.
