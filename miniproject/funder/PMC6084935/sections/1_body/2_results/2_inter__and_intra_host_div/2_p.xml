<p>Five samples from four patients were analyzed from the UVEVV51/10 outbreak. The data revealed marked differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. While symptomatic subjects C and D shared the most abundant haplotype, neither this haplotype nor any of the minor variants detected in these individuals were found in asymptomatic subjects E and F (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201850.g003">3B</xref>). While all 5 haplotypes identified in the first specimen for subjects C and D only differed in synonymous changes, the single haplotype found in subject E, and the most abundant haplotype found in subject F, both asymptomatically-infected, differed in 2â€“3 amino acid positions (

These results suggest either multiple sources of infection or a high degree of virus evolution within the selected infected individuals. Compared to GII.4 New Orleans reference strain, all haplotypes identified in subjects C and D differed in 2 common amino acids (P294S and I413T), and all but one also differed at an additional site (R339K) (
