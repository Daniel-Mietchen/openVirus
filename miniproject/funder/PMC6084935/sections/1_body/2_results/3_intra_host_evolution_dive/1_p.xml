<p>While the intra-host viral diversity initially observed in asymptomatically infected subjects (B, E and F) was higher than in symptomatic patients (A, C and D), diversity evolution over time for the 2 individuals with a serial sample (A and D) showed markedly different trends. While in subject A, who was 43 years old, the single initial haplotype remained stable over the 8 days of infection, in subject D, a 50 year-old woman, HuNoV population diversity increased from 3 to 18 haplotypes in only 5 days (

The phylogenetic analysis showed that of the 3 initial haplotypes in D-1, the most abundant haplotype slightly decreased from 96.9% to 93.1%, the second haplotype remained at a stable frequency of 2.9% and the third haplotype slightly increased from 0.3% to 0.6% (

During the following 5 days, variation occurred in 14/450 nt positions, which represents an average of 2.8 nt changes per day and 0.0062 changes per nucleotide per day. At the amino acid level, all 3 initial haplotypes detected in subject D were synonymous, and 11 out of the 18 evolved haplotypes contained amino acid changes (61.1%) at previously identified informative sites: D289G, I293T, T314A, F358L, N380D, E399G, S407I, V416A, F433L, and F434L (
