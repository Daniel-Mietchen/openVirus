<p>At the amino acid level, the majority of the observed changes emerged at or near epitopes A, D and E, while some others were located at internal regions of the P dimer (Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>, and

 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. No changes were observed in HBGA binding pocket sites. Identified substitutions matched previously identified changes between different GII.4 variants (VP1 residues 289, 293, 294, 313, 314, 330, 339, 356, 358, 380, 394, 399, 404, 407, 413, 416, 426, 427, 433, 434, and 436). In two different individuals, mutations were detected at specific amino acids directly involved in epitope D (T394I) and epitope E (S407I) among the minor variants, suggesting that they may affect antibody recognition and HBGA binding.
