<p>Of note, 96.5% of these substitutions were transitions (58.1% of the transitions were substitutions U-to-C, 19.4% were A-to-G), and only 3.5% were transversions (G-to-U) (
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Since HuNoV mutants with a high proportion of U-to-C and A-to-G transitions have been described in clinical samples and double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminases (ADAR)-mediated editing of the viral RNA was suggested as the molecular mechanism responsible for them [
 <xref rid="pone.0201850.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we analyzed their sequence context. Although the chi-square test did no show significant differences compared to the percentages found for conserved sites, of all U-to-C transitions, the 3â€™ neighbor nucleotide was U in 40% of cases, A in 26.7%, G in 20% and C in 13.3%, which tend to the sequence context compatible with ADAR-mediated editing of the viral RNA.
