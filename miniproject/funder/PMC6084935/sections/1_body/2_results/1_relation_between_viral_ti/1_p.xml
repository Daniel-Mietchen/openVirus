<p>NGS was performed on 450-bp P2 amplicons on 8 selected samples. An average of 2848 reads per sample were obtained (range 1275â€“5038). Whole genome sequence analyses of other RNA viruses have demonstrated that the depth of coverage improves by increasing viral load [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201850.g001">Fig 1</xref>, we observed a moderate correlation (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.552; p = 0.0347) between viral load and number of reads. In general, samples with highest viral load exhibited higher number of reads, while samples with lower titer yielded less reads. No correlation was found between viral load and number of haplotypes (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.070), neither between number of reads and number of haplotypes (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.143).
