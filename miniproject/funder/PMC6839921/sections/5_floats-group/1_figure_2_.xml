  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice that underwent a sham or splenectomy surgery were inoculated i.v. with CHIKV and viral genomes in the inoculum and serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 6, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; p&gt;0.05. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Splenectomized WT C57BL/6 mice were treated i.v. with PLL or CLL. At 42 hr post-treatment, mice were inoculated i.v. with CHIKV and viral genomes in the inoculum (input) and serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 6, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; **p&lt;0.01. (
   <bold>C</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were treated and inoculated as in (
   <bold>B</bold>), and viral genomes present at 45 min post-inoculation in the serum or indicated tissues were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 9, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test or Two-tailed t-test; ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. (
   <bold>D and E</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were treated as in (
   <bold>B</bold>) and inoculated with CHIKV at 42 hr post-treatment. Livers were collected at 45 min post-inoculation, and RNA Scope in situ hybridization (
   <bold>D</bold>) or IHC (
   <bold>E</bold>) were performed to visualize viral RNA localization or F4/80
   <sup>+</sup> macrophages, respectively. Brown staining is indicative of viral RNA (
   <bold>D</bold>) or F4/80
   <sup>+</sup> macrophages (
   <bold>E</bold>). N = 6–7, two experiments.
