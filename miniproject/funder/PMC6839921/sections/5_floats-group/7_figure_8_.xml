  <title>Lysine residues at E2 200 or E2 251 are essential for CHIKV and RRV clearance, respectively.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Properties of the amino acid side chains selected for substitution analysis at E2 K200 or K251. Amino acid structures generated using PepDraw. (
   <bold>B</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.v. with a panel of CHIKV mutants with different amino acid substitutions at position E2 200. Viral genomes in the inoculum and in the serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 4, one experiment. Kruskal-Wallis, comparing each group to WT virus containing K; ***p&lt;0.001. (
   <bold>C</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.v. with a panel of RRV mutants with different amino acid substitutions at position E2 251. Viral genomes in the inoculum and in the serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 4, one experiment. One-way ANOVA, comparing each group to virus containing K; ****p&lt;0.0001. (
   <bold>D</bold>) WT C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.v. with CHIKV or CHIKV E2 K252R, and viral genomes in inoculum and in the serum at 45 min post-inoculation were quantified by RT-qPCR. Mean ± SD. N = 8, two experiments. Mann-Whitney test; p&gt;0.05.
