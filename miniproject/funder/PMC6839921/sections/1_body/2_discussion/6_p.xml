<p>Despite the apparent benefit for the virus to encode an arginine or other amino acid at E2 200 or 251, lysine residues at CHIKV E2 200, ONNV E2 200, and RRV E2 251 are commonly found in virus isolates. Analysis of E2 protein sequences in the ViPR database (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Pickett et al., 2012</xref>) revealed that 1,333/1,335 CHIKV sequences encode a lysine at position E2 200 (2/1,335 encode an arginine), 8/8 ONNV sequences encode a lysine, and 187/204 available RRV sequences encode a lysine at position E2 251, while the remaining 17 encode an arginine. One possible explanation for this conservation could be that a lysine residue at this position provides a fitness advantage in the mosquito vector. However, we found that CHIKV E2 K200R replication and dissemination was indistinguishable from that of WT CHIKV in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, and no selective disadvantage of an arginine residue at this position was observed in direct competition experiments, suggesting that the conservation of lysine at CHIKV E2 200 is not due to constraints in the mosquito vector. Alternatively, the susceptibility or resistance of circulating alphavirus particles to clearance may be influenced by polymorphisms in SRs. Genes encoding SRs, including MARCO, exhibit substantial genetic variation in both humans and mice (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bowdish and Gordon, 2009</xref>) and this variation can have functional consequences. For example, position 252 of MARCO is known to be polymorphic in humans, and the less common variant has a decreased capacity to phagocytize bacteria in vitro (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Novakowski et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, SNPs within human SRs associate with differential susceptibility to various pathogens (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Westhaus et al., 2017</xref>). Following alphavirus infections, human patients exhibit a high degree of variability in peak viremia and disease severity (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Chow et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">de St Maurice et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Musso et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Thiberville et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Waggoner et al., 2016</xref>). Given this, inter- or intra-host variability within SRs may influence the susceptibility of alphaviruses to SR-dependent clearance from the circulation, contributing to variability in viremia and disease outcomes. Similar species-specific effects have been observed with multiple pathogen recognition receptors (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Daugherty and Malik, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, MARCO is evolving under positive selection (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Yap et al., 2015</xref>), a signature often associated with host-viral conflicts. Thus, circulating alphaviruses may have adapted to their cognate hosts and can readily evade this defense mechanism in certain vertebrates, but the MARCO allele in the mouse strains evaluated in this study allows these alphaviruses to be efficiently cleared from the circulation. More work is needed to determine whether polymorphisms within or between vertebrate species influence SR-dependent clearance of circulating alphaviruses.
