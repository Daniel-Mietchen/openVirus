<p>The spleen and liver contain phagocytic cell populations that are strategically positioned to capture circulating pathogens. To determine the relative contribution of the spleen, viral clearance was evaluated in mice that underwent sham or splenectomy surgeries. CHIKV was efficiently cleared from the circulation of splenectomized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating that the spleen is not required for clearance of circulating CHIKV. Moreover, CLL-pretreatment blocked CHIKV clearance in splenectomized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the remaining phagocytic cells in the liver are sufficient to clear CHIKV from the circulation. Consistent with this, CHIKV RNA accumulated in the liver of control PLL-treated mice, and this specific accumulation was lost in CLL-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, viral RNA levels increased in the spleen and lung of CLL-treated mice compared with control PLL-treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), likely due to the high amounts of virus present in contaminating blood. Moreover, CHIKV RNA is readily detectable by in situ hybridization in the livers of PLL-treated mice at 45 min post-inoculation, but not in CLL-treated mice (

 <sup>+</sup> DCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting macrophages are responsible for alphavirus clearance. Collectively, these data suggest that Kupffer cells (KCs), the tissue resident macrophage population in the liver (
