<p>As arboviruses, alphaviruses must maintain efficient replication in both vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. Given this, we evaluated whether the E2 K200R mutation influencedÂ viral replication and/or dissemination in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. Following blood-feeding inoculation of mosquitoes, similar levels of WT CHIKV and E2 K200R were detected in the bodies, legs and saliva of infected mosquitoes at 3 d post-infection, suggesting that in contrast to mice, the E2 K200R mutation had no impact on viral dissemination in mosquitoes (

To more rigorously test if this mutation affects viral fitness in mosquitoes, we performed in vitro and in vivo competition experiments with a WT CHIKV strain genetically marked with an ApaI restriction site (CHIKV-ApaI). Control 1:1 competitions of CHIKV and CHIKV-ApaI in C6/36 cells (

 <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>) demonstrated that the genetic marker does not influence viral fitness. Similar results were observed following direct 1:1 competition of CHIKV and CHIKV E2 K200R, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C and D</xref>), suggesting that the E2 K200R mutation has no selective disadvantage to WT virus in the mosquito vector. Collectively, these findings suggest that while the E2 K200R mutation dramatically influences CHIKV dissemination in the vertebrate host, it is neutral in the mosquito vector.
