<p>Clearance of circulating bacteria and other particles from the circulation often involves opsonins such as antibodies and complement component 3 (C3) (

 <sup>-/-</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and B cell deficient μMT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which lack C3 and circulating IgM and IgG, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kitamura et al., 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Wessels et al., 1995</xref>). These data suggest that clearance of circulating alphavirus particles is independent of receptors for fragments of C3 and of Fc receptors. Scavenger receptors (SRs) are a large family of transmembrane proteins that capture and eliminate a broad range of endogenous and microbial ligands via non-opsonic mechanisms (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Canton et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Mukhopadhyay and Gordon, 2004</xref>). To test the hypothesis that one or more SRs mediate clearance of alphavirus particles from the circulation, 5 min prior to inoculation of virus, mice were pre-treated i.v. with the polyanionic SR competitive inhibitor poly(I), or poly(C), a polyanion that is not a competitive inhibitor of SRs (
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Pearson et al., 1993</xref>). Similar to pretreatment with CLL, poly(I) pretreatment potently inhibited the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar results were observed following pretreatment of mice with dextran sulfate (DS), another SR ligand (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To identify SRs that are expressed by KCs, we mined publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data of the mouse liver (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), and found SR-A1 (MSR1), SR-A6 (MARCO), SR-B1 (SCARB1), SR-B2 (CD36), and SR-I1 (CD163) mRNAs to be robustly expressed in KCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these, only SR-A1 and MARCO are known to bind poly(I) and DS (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Platt and Gordon, 1998</xref>). To investigate the relative contributions of SR-A1 and MARCO, CHIKV clearance was evaluated in SR-A1
 <sup>-/-</sup> and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. CHIKV particles were efficiently cleared from the circulation of SR-A1
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, and this clearance was inhibited by pre-treatment of SR-A1
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with poly(I) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that CHIKV clearance was still occurring through a SR-dependent mechanism. In contrast, CHIKV particles remained readily detectable in the serum of MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice at 45 min post-inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, whereas pretreatment with CLL blocked clearance of circulating CHIKV particles in WT mice, this treatment had no effect on the level of CHIKV in the circulation of MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, CHIKV RNA was detectable by in situ hybridization in the liver of PLL-treated WT mice, but not in the liver of PLL-treated MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice or CLL-treated WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Despite the virological differences in the circulation and liver of PLL-treated WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, these mice had a similar number of KCs in the liver (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Finally, both WT and MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> KCs were efficiently depleted by CLL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>), suggesting that MARCO
 <sup>-/-</sup> KCs retain phagocytic capacity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that MARCO is essential for clearance of CHIKV particles from the circulation.
