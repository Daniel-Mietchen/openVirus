<p>The impact of lysine to arginine mutations was surprising as this is a conservative amino acid substitution. To further map biochemical features of amino acid side chains that associate with efficient viral clearance by phagocytic cells, we introduced a variety of amino acid substitutions at CHIKV E2 200. The amino acid panel was designed to evaluate positively charged (K, R, H), negatively charged (D), hydrophobic (A, L), and polar, uncharged (Q, S) amino acids (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Moreover, a subset of these mutations was introduced at position E2 251 of RRV, and again all substitutions away from lysine allowed for RRV escape from phagocytic cell-mediated clearance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These findings suggest that clearance of these alphavirus particles from the circulation is strictly dependent on the presence of a lysine residue at E2 200 (CHIKV) or E2 251 (RRV). The critical lysine residue that mediates clearance in RRV (E2 K251) is conserved in CHIKV (E2 K252). To investigate if this lysine residue also contributes to CHIKV clearance, we introduced an E2 K252R mutation. However, we found that CHIKV E2 K252R remained susceptible to clearance by phagocytic cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that, in contrast to RRV, a lysine at this position in E2 is not required for CHIKV clearance. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that specific lysine residues in the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV, ONNV, and RRV facilitate phagocytic cell-mediated clearance of viral particles from the circulation of a vertebrate host.
