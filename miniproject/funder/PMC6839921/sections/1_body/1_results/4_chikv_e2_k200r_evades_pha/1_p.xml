<p>We next investigated which viral features promote clearance of alphaviral particles from the circulation. In prior studies, DENV and West Nile virus (WNV) clearance from the circulation of mice was found to be influenced by N-linked glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins (

 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Voss et al., 2010</xref>). N345 is located in the E2 stem near the transmembrane domain, making it unlikely that glycans at this position mediate interactions with MARCO (
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Voss et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate if the more surface exposed glycosylation sites influenced clearance, we introduced asparagine to glutamine mutations at N263 and N273 to disrupt glycosylation. Mutation of positions N263 or N273 alone, or in combination, had no effect on the clearance of CHIKV particles from the circulation (
