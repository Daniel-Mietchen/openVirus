<p>To explore whether phagocytic cells participate in the clearance of circulating arboviruses, we treated mice intravenously (i.v.) with PBS- (control) or clodronate-loaded liposomes (PLL or CLL, respectively) to deplete phagocytic cells in the spleen, liver, and circulation that are in direct contact with blood (

 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Van Rooijen and Sanders, 1994</xref>). The uptake of CLL by phagocytic cells results in intracellular release of the encapsulated clodronate which is cytotoxic (

 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Suhrbier et al., 2012</xref>), and viral RNA or infectious virus in the serum was analyzed at 45 minutes (min) post-inoculation. In PLL-treated mice, viral particles (CHIKV and RRV) or plaque forming units (ONNV) were nearly undetectable in the serum by 45 min post-inoculation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that CHIKV particles had been removed from the circulation. These findings suggest that blood-exposed phagocytic cells, such as those in the spleen or liver, are required for clearance of blood-borne alphaviruses.
