<p>Livers were minced and incubated in digestion buffer (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 15 mM HEPES, 2.5 mg/ml Collagenase Type 1 (Worthington Biochemical), 1.7 mg/ml DNase I (Roche), 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 30 min at 37
 <bold>°</bold>C with shaking (130 rpm). Digested livers were passed through a 100 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon). Liver cells were pelleted and re-suspended in a 35% Percoll solution and centrifuged for 15 min at 450 x g at 4
 <bold>°</bold>C with medium acceleration and no break to isolate lymphocytes, and washed 1X with RPMI. Isolated cells from livers were blocked with anti-mouse FcγRII/III (2.4G2; BD Pharmingen) for 20 min on ice and then stained in FACS buffer (1x PBS, 2% FBS) for 1 hr on ice with the following antibodies from Biolegend (most) or eBioscience (NK1.1): anti-MHC-II (M5/114.14.2), anti-Ly6C (HK1.4), anti-F4/80 (BM8), anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-NK1.1 (PK136), anti-TCRB (H57-597), anti-CD19 (6D5), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-CD45 (30-F11), anti-Ly6G (1A8). Liver cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. Samples were analyzed on an LSRFortessa using FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson). Further analysis was done using FlowJo Software (Tree Star).
