<p>1) There is no evidence of direct interaction of these viruses with MARCO, nor of the role of lysine in such an interaction. The most important evidence would be in vitro experiments showing differential viral binding to matched MARCO+ and MARCO- cells. Both WT and lysine-mutant viruses should be tested for their interaction with these cells. It's also possible that similar studies could be performed in vivo by showing co-localization of viral RNA with KC in WT livers compared to KO. However, the reviewers acknowledge that such in vivo experiments may take much longer than the requested 2 month time frame and are therefore lower in priority.</p>
