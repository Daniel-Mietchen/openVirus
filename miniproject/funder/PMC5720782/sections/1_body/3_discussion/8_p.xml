<p>In recent years, the EV71-C4 sub-genotype has been the major type of EV71 found in epidemics in mainland China. This subtype can be further divided into the C4b and C4a evolutionary branches, which correspond to two time periods [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The C4b evolutionary branch contains strains from Shenzhen and Shanghai, 1998â€“2004, and C4a has been identified in mainland China since 2003 [

 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene showed that the EV71 strains sequenced in this study all belong to C4a, with most of them exhibiting higher identity to strains circulating in southern China (especially in Fujian and Guangdong provinces) than to strains in northern China. Moreover, the predominant circulating EV71 strains in Guangxi collected from 2012 to 2015 were phylogenetically distinct from the strains collected from China before 2008.
