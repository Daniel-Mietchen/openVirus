<p>In this study, we found that the EV71-positive rates for HFMD among 14 cities in Guangxi differed among cities each year. Regardless of large epidemic (2010, 2012, and 2014) or small epidemic (2011, 2013, and 2015) years, cities with the highest EV71-positive rates were not the same from year-to-year. One possible reason for this is that antibodies produced after EV71 infection might protect people from re-infection.</p>
