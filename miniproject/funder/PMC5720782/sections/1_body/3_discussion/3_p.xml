<p>In December 2015, two inactivated EV71 vaccines, which were the first HFMD vaccines, were approved in mainland China for preventing severe HFMD [

 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. EV71 consists of one serotype with multiple sub-genotypes, and consequently expresses a variety of different antigens. Antibodies produced in response to an EV71 vaccine (EV71-H07, C4a strain) have been shown to cross-react with different EV71 genotypes including the B and C1â€“C4 sub-genotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; this should provide effective protection against HFMD caused by EV71. The epidemiological and genetic characterization of EV71 might now be affect by EV71 vaccination; therefore, there is still a need to monitor EV71 sequence variations to evaluate the genetic effects that occur after EV71 vaccination. The EV71 vaccine has been available in Guangxi since 2016. However, its relatively high cost, incurred by the recipients, has contributed to a low vaccine coverage level in Guangxi. EV71 was always the predominant pathogen for severe and fatal cases from 2010 to 2015. Thus, the EV71 vaccine is necessary across the province to abate disease burden. We suggest that EV71 vaccination should be prioritized in four cities with relatively high incidences of EV71 infection (Nanning, Qinzhou, Hechi, and Hezhou).
