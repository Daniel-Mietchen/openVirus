<p>We predict that positive rates of non-EV71 and CA16 enterovirus such as CA6 and CA10 would be increased in mild cases in Guangxi from 2010 to 2015. For this, the results will be analyzed in a further study. It is now important to extend this pathogen detection to several other enteroviruses such as CA6 and CA10. Thus, these data suggest that HFMD pathogens other than EV71 are becoming more prevalent, and this fact should receive more attention.</p>
