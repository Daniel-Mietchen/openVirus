<p>Interestingly, one strain, 207–3, which was isolated in 2012, was similar to Vietnamese strains isolated in 2011–2012. There is also a reference strain, HCM120/VNM/2011, isolated in Vietnam, which forms a closely-related cluster with mainland China strains. There is strong phylogenetic support suggesting that this lineage was likely derived from strains circulating in China in 2010, as has previously been described [

 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, these data suggest that a close interaction occurs between China and neighboring Vietnam.
