<p>Only a small number of EV71-positive HFMD specimens collected from Nanning city were used for cell culture and genetic analysis, but an EV71 stain was found to cluster with Vietnamese strains, suggesting that there is high risk of EV71 introduction from neighboring counties. Thus, surveillance of HFMD pathogens and the genetic analysis of the EV71 stain should be expanded in the three border cities (Chongzuo, Baise and Fangchenggang) of Guangxi, even though these were all associated with low EV71 infection rates.</p>
