<p>From 2010 to 2015, EV71 was one of the most important pathogens that caused HFMD in 14 Guangxi cities, with the exception of Fangchenggang city. Interestingly, we found that Fangchenggang always had the lowest EV71-positive rate from 2010 to 2015. Although it had a high incidence of HFMD, there was a low number of severe and fatal cases during this 6-year period. The EV71-positive rate was highest for fatal cases, which was followed by severe cases, and this was lowest in mild cases, which is consistent with previous results found in Henan and Hunan provinces [

 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The EV71-positive rate for mild cases in Fangchenggang was similar to that for mild cases in 13 cities. Thus, it appears that the few severe and fatal cases might be associated with a low EV71-positive rate in Fangchenggang; however, the reasons for this phenomenon require further exploration.
