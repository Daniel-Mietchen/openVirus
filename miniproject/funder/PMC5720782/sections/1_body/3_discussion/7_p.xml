<p>In China, the nationwide transmission of HFMD was reported to be associated with the relative humidity, birth rate, and population density. With respect to the latter, an interaction between the log of the population density and the Health System Performance has been observed using a multiple linear regression model [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although it has a lower population density, Guangxi has relatively higher humidity and lower Health System Performance, which might facilitate the transmission of HFMD. However, we found four cities (Fangchenggang, Baise, Chongzuoin, and Gulin) that had a relatively low EV71 rate in HFMD from 2010 to 2015. The possible reasons for this might be related to the fact that that they had low levels of rainfall, a lower population density, and a lower temperature, compared to those in other cities in Guangxi.
