<p>We found that the EV71-positive rate tended to decrease from 2010 to 2015. In years with large epidemics, such as 2014, the EV71-positive rate in clinically-diagnosed HFMD was found to decrease, compared to the rates in 2010 and 2012. There was also a similar trend for years with small epidemics; specifically, the EV71-positive rate was also found to be diminished in 2015, compared to that in 2011 and 2013. The fact that the EV71-positive rate tended to diminish was observed not only in Guangxi, but also in other provinces in China, according to the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Overall, the EV71-positive rate was reduced from 2010 to 2015, which mainly resulted from the decrease in mild cases associated with EV71 infection.</p>
