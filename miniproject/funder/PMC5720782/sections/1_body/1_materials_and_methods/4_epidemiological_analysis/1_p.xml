<p>Case information was aggregated at the municipal level. All statistical analyses were performed using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria;

Differences in age and pathogen distribution were analyzed using a chi-square test. The seasonal distribution of HFMD cases and EV71-positive cases was plotted as a line graph to detect peaks across the entire year. The spatial distribution of EV71-positive HFMD cases for each municipality was shown on maps created using maptools and ggplot2 in R. EV71 clusters were created using pheatmap in R. All statistical tests were two sided, and p values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
