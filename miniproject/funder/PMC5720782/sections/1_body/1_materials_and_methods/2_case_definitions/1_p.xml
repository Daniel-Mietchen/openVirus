<p>HFMD case-reporting criteria were based on the national guidelines for the control and prevention of HFMD (issued by the Ministry of Health in China (2009)). The diagnosis criteria for HFMD, severe cases, and laboratory test procedures followed the HFMD Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (2010). Mild cases were defined as the absence or presence of fever accompanied by a rash (maculopapule or vesicular rash) appearing on either the hand, foot, mouth, or buttock. Severe cases were defined the presence of at least one of the following complications: acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary edema, encephalitis, hemorrhage, or cardiopulmonary collapse. Clinically diagnosed cases, along with laboratory evidence of enteroviruses infection (including EV71, CA16, or other enteroviruses), were detected using real-time RT-PCR, and these were considered ‘laboratory-confirmed’ cases.</p>
