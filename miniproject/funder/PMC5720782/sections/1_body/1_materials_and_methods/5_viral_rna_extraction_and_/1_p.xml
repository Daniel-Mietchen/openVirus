<p>Specimen processing was performed as previously described with a slight modification [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Stool suspensions were created by mixing 0.1 g of stool sample, 0.1 mL of chloroform, and 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. The suspensions were shaken vigorously for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. For rectal swab samples, the supernatant was prepared by centrifuging the fluid at 13,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min and transferring the supernatant to a fresh tube. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 μL of supernatant using the viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA from each sample was examined using real-time RT-PCR kits (Diagnostic Kit for human enteroviruses, EV71, and CA16, Jiangshu Shuoshi Biological Technology Co., Ltd, Taizhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
