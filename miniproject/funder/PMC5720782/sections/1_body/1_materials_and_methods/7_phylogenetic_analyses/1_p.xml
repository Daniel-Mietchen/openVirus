<p>Evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 1.07373051 was shown. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) were shown next to the branches. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths given as the same units as those for the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method, and the units were the number of base differences per site. The analysis involved 130 nucleotide sequences. The codon positions included were first, second, third, and non-coding positions. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were 881 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The phylogenetic tree was displayed using the online tool, Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The complete nucleotide sequences of 73 EV71 VP1 genes from GenBank were analyzed with the sequences of the VP1 genes obtained in this study (
