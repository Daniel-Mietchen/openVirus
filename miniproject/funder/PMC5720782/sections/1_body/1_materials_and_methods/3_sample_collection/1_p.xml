<p>There are 14 cities in Guangxi, and every city has set up sentinel sites responsible for the national surveillance program for HFMD. The diagnostic criteria for HFMD were defined by the Ministry of Health. Clinical specimens (including stool or rectal swabs and throat swabs) from patients were collected by sentinel practitioners and were transported to a pathogen laboratory. Meanwhile, a standardized report form was sent to the local CDC. A total of 44,284 clinical specimens were collected in the study from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015.</p>
