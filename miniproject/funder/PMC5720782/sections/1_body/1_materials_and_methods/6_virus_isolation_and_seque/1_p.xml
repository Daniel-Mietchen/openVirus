<p>Viruses were isolated from cultured rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells and human epidermoid cancer cells (Hep-2) cells. After the cells were inoculated with virus-contaminated samples, they were cultured at 37°C and observed for three passages to ensure sufficient time for viral replication. When the cytopathic effect occurred for 75–100% of the cell monolayer, the virus was harvested. Collected viral particles were analyzed by RT-PCR and the complete VP1 gene sequences from EV71 and CA16 isolates were amplified as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The amplified products were sent to Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) for DNA Sanger sequencing. The protocol is provided as DOI:

The VP1 sequences of the 57 EV71 strains have been submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession numbers MF185255–185311).
