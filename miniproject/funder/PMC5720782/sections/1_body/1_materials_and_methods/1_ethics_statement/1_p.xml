<p>This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Disease Control and Prevention of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Specimens were obtained from sentinel hospitals associated with the Center of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous for Disease Control and Prevention (Guangxi CDC) for EV surveillance. It was determined by the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China that data collection for HFMD cases was part of continuous public health surveillance for a notifiable infectious disease and was thus exempt from institutional review board assessment. All patient information was kept anonymous to protect patient confidentiality.</p>
