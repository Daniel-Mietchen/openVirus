<p>The Guangxi autonomous region is located in the south of China, and is divided into fourteen cities; it is one of the Chinese provinces that is most affected by HFMD [
 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Guangxi, the number of reported cases has increased from 2008 to 2015, and since 2008, the incidence and rate of severe and fatal cases has consistently been the highest in China. In addition, from January 1 to May 10 of 2017, the number of reported cases (46,674) and incidence (97/10,000) were highest in Guangxi, among 31 Chinese provinces. Elucidating the epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of E71 is critical for guiding the development of HFMD prevention and control strategies. This study focused on characterizing the epidemiological profiles and molecular evolution of EV71 in HFMD in the Guangxi autonomous region from January 2010 to December 2015. The results therefore provide information describing the baseline HFMD pathogen profile before vaccination was implemented.
