<p>HFMD is caused by members of the enterovirus family, among which 
 <italic>human enterovirus 71</italic> (EV71) and 
 <italic>coxsackievirus A16</italic> are the main pathogens responsible for global outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pone.0188640.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EV71 infection has been reported to be responsible for both severe and fatal HFMD [
