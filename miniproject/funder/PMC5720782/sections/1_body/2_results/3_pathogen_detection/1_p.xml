<p>Of the 44,284 clinically diagnosed HFMD cases, a total of 33,498 (75.67%) were positive for enteroviruses, including 12,007 cases (27.11%) positive for EV71, 6,468 (14.61%) positive for CA16, and 15,023 positive (33.92%) for other enteroviruses. The positive rates of EV71, CA16, and other enteroviruses identified each year were significantly different (Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> = 894.90, p &lt; 0.001). Higher EV71-positive rates occurred in years with large epidemics (2010, 2012, and 2014), compared to those in years with small epidemics (2011, 2013, and 2015; p = 0.03725), and this was true for mild, severe, and fatal cases (
