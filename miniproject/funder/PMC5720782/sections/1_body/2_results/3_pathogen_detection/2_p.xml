<p>Compared to those for CA16 and other enteroviruses, the EV71-positive rates were significantly higher in severe cases (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 4591.13, p &lt; 0.001) and fatal cases (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 706.89, p &lt; 0.001) each year, whereas they were lower in mild cases (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5282.46, p &lt; 0.05). Thus, EV71 appears to be the dominant pathogen causing severe and fatal HFMD from 2010–2015.
