<p>Several strains isolated in 2012 and 2013 (in our study) displayed a close genetic relationship with other strains from Guangdong province, isolated in 2011 and 2012. Meanwhile, strains isolated from 2014 and 2015 were found to cluster with strains from Fujian province isolated in 2013 and 2015. Thus, the molecular characteristics of the EV71 strains tend to change gradually over time. Surprisingly, there was one strain, 207â€“3_GX_2012, that was phylogenetically closer to Vietnamese strains isolated in 2012 than to strains from mainland China.</p>
