<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on complete VP1 sequences (891 nucleotides) composed of the C subtypes (C1–C5) of EV71 strains from the present study and respective representative strains. Overall, VP1 genes of all EV71 strains identified in this study exhibited 95.2–100.0% nucleotide similarity, corresponding to 97.6–100% amino acid similarity. All of these strains clustered exclusively to genotype C, subtype 4a (C4a;
