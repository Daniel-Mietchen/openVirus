<p>Differences in HFMD incidence among the five different age groups were statistically significant (χ

For this, the largest group was the 1–3-year old group, accounting for 52.40% of the cases; the second largest group was the ≤ 1-year old group, accounting for 32.41% of the cases. Most cases (96.62%) occurred in patients less than 5 years of age, which is consistent with the results of previous studies [
