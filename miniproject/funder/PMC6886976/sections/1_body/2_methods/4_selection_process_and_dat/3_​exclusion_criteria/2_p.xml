<p>Two reviewers with a social science background (MJ and LL) will independently examine titles and abstracts in Rayyan Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI), a web application to screen literature.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Each study will be labelled with reasons for inclusion and exclusion. Distinct labels will be used for vulnerability assessment tools used in the field of climate change and in the context of disease outbreaks. Discussion rounds between reviewers (MJ and LL) are planned for the first two weeks of screening to clarify questions concerning the screening process and to specify inclusion criteria. The screening will be blinded, so that reviewers’ decisions will not be visible until all conflicting decisions are resolved.
