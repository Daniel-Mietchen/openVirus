<p>A preliminary search of literature and already existing reviews yielded few studies on vulnerability assessment tools tailored to infectious threats, but a significant amount of literature in the field of climate change. To fill the assumed gap of studies in the context of vulnerability assessment tools and infectious threats, we will also take into account studies exploring practices at the human–animal–environment interface, providing insights on practices that expose certain groups of people to infections or pathogen spillovers.</p>
