<p>EIDs and AMR are not only medical problems; they require careful attention to the relationship between infectious events, political, economic and ecological conditions, and to local communities and the marginalised people who often live within them. Such attention remains particularly important when instability (caused by infectious disease outbreaks, conflicts or other stresses) exaggerates local inequalities, hampering effective preparedness and response efforts. Devastating epidemics have struck frequently in countries and among populations already shattered by government neglect, forced migration, social unrest or civil war.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10â€“12</xref> What these insights reveal is that people living in unstable conditions remain disproportionately vulnerable to infectious threats.
