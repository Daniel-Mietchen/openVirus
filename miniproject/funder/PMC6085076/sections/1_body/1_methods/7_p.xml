<p>We assume that infectious people, especially those with symptoms may avoid exposure to mosquito bites. Around 20–93% individuals infected with DENV are asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and asymptomatic prevalence of Chikungunya was estimated in the range 16.7–27.7% during some recorded outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], while only around 20% of people infectious with ZIKV have significant symptoms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The biting rate accounts for a fraction, 
 <italic>π</italic>, of infectious humans do not change their behaviors due to the illnesses and continue being bitten by mosquitoes at the same rate as the susceptible population. In our model, we assume 
 <italic>π</italic> = 0.75 for DENV, 
 <italic>π</italic> = 0.3 for CHIKV, and 
 <italic>π</italic> = 0.8 for ZIKV. The remaining fraction (1 − 
 <italic>π</italic>) avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. This behavior change has a significant impact on the force of infection from humans to mosquitoes and is an important aspect of any vector-borne transmission model.
