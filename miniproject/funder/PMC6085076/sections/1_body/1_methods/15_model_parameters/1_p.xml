<p>In the simulations, the parameters are set to the baseline values in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, unless specifically stated otherwise. Most of the parameter values used in this study were derived, or extensively referenced, by Manore et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for disease transmission in 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free mosquitoes. Manore et al. provided a comprehensive sensitivity analysis on how the model predictions change with respect to variations in the key parameters [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although these baseline values are our best estimates for the parameters, they are scalar estimates from a distribution of possible values. To help quantify the uncertainty in the parameters, we will investigate the behavior of the model over a wide range of feasible parameters. The model predictions for a specific value of the basic reproduction number or the fraction of the population infected at the endemic equilibrium depend on the specific values used in the simulations. Although these specific values for these predictions are sensitive to the parameter values, we find that the qualitative differences between different diseases and strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> are fairly insensitive over the feasible ranges of parameters.
