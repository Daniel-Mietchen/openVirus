<p>We assume that the probability of transmission per bite from a mosquito to a human is related to the viral load in the mosquito. Recent experimental comparisons of the growth of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in mosquitoes indicate that the viral loads and the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) for an infected mosquito to become infectious are comparable [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Because there are no experimental estimates for the infectivity of ZIKV-infected mosquitoes, we assume that the parameter values for infectivity of ZIKV are the same as those of DENV in our simulations. Note that, although we assume that the probability of transmission per mosquito bite is assumed to be the same for ZIKV- and DENV- infected mosquitoes. The behavior changes of humans infectious with ZIKV and DENV are different, leading to very different epidemics. That is, one must be very careful in extrapolating findings between ZIKV and DENV epidemics [
