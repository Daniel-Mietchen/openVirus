<p>ZIKV infection is a self-limiting illness that is mostly asymptomatic. Lazear et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] noted that approximately 20% of the individuals infected with ZIKV progress to a clinically apparent febrile illness, although rarely hospitalized. Rajah et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] also observed that 20% of the people infected with ZIKV present mild symptoms. In our simulations, we assume that 80% of ZIKV-infectious people continue exposing to mosquitoes (
