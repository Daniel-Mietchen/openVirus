<p>Bloch et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] concluded that about 62.5% CHIKV infections are symptomatic through extensive statistical analysis. They observed that about one-third of CHIKV-infected participants are asymptomatic, which is consistent with estimates of 3–39% asymptomatic cases in past outbreaks. Robinson et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also noted that 16.7–27.7% of the infections in Chikungunya outbreaks are asymptomatic. In our simulations, we assume that 30% of infectious people with CHIKV continue exposing to mosquitoes (
