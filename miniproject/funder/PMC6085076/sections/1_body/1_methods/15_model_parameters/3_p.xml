<p>Duong et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that asymptomatic individuals infected with DENV may be infectious before the onset of symptoms and continue infecting mosquitoes as they visit multiple locations during the day. They also noted that sick people who are hospitalized or stay at home are only exposed to their residential mosquitoes. Grange et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] summarized data from a large number of studies, showing that often 20–93% of DENV infected individuals are asymptomatic. In our simulations, we assume that 75% of DENV-infectious people continue exposing to mosquitoes (
