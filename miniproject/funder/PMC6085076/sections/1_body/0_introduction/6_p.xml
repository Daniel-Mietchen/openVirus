<p>Many mathematical models have been developed to explore conditions under which 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can be used to fight against the spread of viruses effectively. The analysis of a compartmental mathematical model showed that a significant reduction in human dengue cases can be obtained provided that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes persist when competing with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Zhang et al. developed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to assess how best to replace DENV vectors with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquito populations and the results showed that successful population replacement will rely on the selection of suitable strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and careful design of augmentation methods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The analysis for an impulsive model for 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection control of mosquito-borne diseases with general birth and death rates showed that strategies may be different due to different birth and death rate functions, the type of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains, and the initial number of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Xue et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] created a two-sex model that included an egg/aquatic stage for the mosquito lifecycle and observed that an endemic 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection can be established only if a sufficient number of infected mosquitoes are released. Recently, this model was extended by Qu et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to better account for the cytoplasmic incompatibility by considering the fact that most female mosquitoes only mate once. They used the model to investigate the effectiveness of multiple releases of infected mosquitoes in sustaining an endemic 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection.
