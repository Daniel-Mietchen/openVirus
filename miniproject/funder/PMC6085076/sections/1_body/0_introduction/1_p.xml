<p>The current pandemics of Chikungunya caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue fever caused by dengue virus (DENV), and Zika resulted from Zika virus (ZIKV) infect over one hundred million people each year [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and recently over a million cases occurred in the Caribbean and Latin America. Symptoms of infection with CHIKV include high fever and headache, with arthritis affecting joints, and may sustain for weeks or months [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. People infected with DENV have symptoms ranging from mild headaches, severe headaches and joint pains to hemorrhagic or shock syndrome fever. Recently, ZIKV has spread through the Americas, starting with a 2015 explosive outbreak in Brazil. Although most people infected with ZIKV have mild symptoms, there is a correlation between infections in pregnant women and their children born with microcephaly (an abnormally small brain). Currently no vaccines are commercially available for Zika and Chikungunya. The first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), registered in Mexico in December, 2015 is not effective for the younger ones and for the seronegative population due to ethical concern of non-maleficence [
