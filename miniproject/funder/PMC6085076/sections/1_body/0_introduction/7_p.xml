<p>Manore et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] used a mathematical model to compare the spread of DENV and CHIKV in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes that are not infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Our study is based on extending these results to evaluate the effectiveness of infecting these mosquitoes with different strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to show their different roles in controlling different vector-borne diseases. In our model, we assume that lifespans of the infected adult mosquitoes are slightly shorter than those of uninfected mosquitoes (reducing transmission), and the larval survival rates of wAlbB-infected mosquitoes are less than those of wMel-infected mosquitoes (making invasion somewhat potentially harder for wAlbB). We evaluated the effectiveness of infecting these mosquitoes with wMel and wAlbB strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to show their different roles in controlling the transmission of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV. Since transmission of ZIKV is estimated to be similar to transmission of DENV but exact values of parameters are not available [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we assume that the parameter values for ZIKV are the same as those for DENV except the fraction of infectious humans exposed to mosquito bites. Our simulation results show that the differences between the spread of DENV and ZIKV lie in different behaviors of infectious humans, and wMel is more effective than wAlbB strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in simulations with the available baseline parameters.
