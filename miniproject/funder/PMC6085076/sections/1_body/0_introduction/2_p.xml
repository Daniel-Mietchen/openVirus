 <italic>aegypti</italic>) and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) mosquitoes can transmit these viruses, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are more abundant in urban areas and are the primary vectors. Current prophylactic measures include individual protection from mosquito bites, such as applying mosquito repellent and avoiding exposure to mosquitoes. Limited control options focus on reducing the mosquito populations, including spraying insecticides, treatments, and removal of mosquito breeding sites. These control strategies are hard to sustain because of the vigilance needed to eradicate the breeding sites, the expense of repeated spraying, and the mosquitoes developing resistance to the insecticides.
