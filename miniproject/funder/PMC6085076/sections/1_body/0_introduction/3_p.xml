<p>The cost and difficulty of eliminating the mosquitoes motivate the need of developing more efficient strategies to mitigate and control the transmission of these viruses. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a genus of bacteria that can infect 25-75% of all insects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and recent studies have shown that some strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> can increase the resistance of mosquitoes being infected with these viruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent experiments have shown that wMel strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> inhibits the growth of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in mosquitoes reduces egg laying rates, reduces their ability of transmitting viral infections, and shortens their lifespans by a few days. Since many mosquitoes infected with DENV, ZIKV, or CHIKV are infectious for only a few days at the end of their lifespans, the shortened lifespans of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes result in more mosquitoes dying before they can transmit the infection. This implies that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes sustaining in a wild mosquito population will be less likely to transmit these viral diseases.
