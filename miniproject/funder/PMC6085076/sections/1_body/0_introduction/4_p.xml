<p>Infected females can pass the bacteria to their offsprings and spread 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> vertically from one generation to the next. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> disrupts the reproductive cycle of hosts through a cytoplasmic incompatibility between the sperms and eggs. Cytoplasmic incompatibility occurs when 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected male mosquitoes mate with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free female mosquitoes, and causes the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free females to produce fewer progeny [

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> a vertical transmission advantage. However, this is offset by a reduced lifespan and reduced number of eggs hatched by a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquito.
