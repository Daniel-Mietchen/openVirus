 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the fraction of humans still susceptible at the EE for wMel-infected mosquitoes is the largest, while the susceptibility of

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> infected with the same strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, the percentage of humans susceptible to CHIKV is higher than the percentage of humans susceptible to DENV or Zika. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> infected with the same strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, the percentages of humans susceptible to DENV and ZIKV are higher than the percentage of humans susceptible to CHIKV. Although the wMelPop-infected mosquitoes are the most effective in stopping an epidemic, it is unrealistic to consider a fully infected wild population of wMelPop-infected mosquitoes. Hence, we did not include the analysis for wMelPop strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This coefficient for effectiveness computed using
