 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006666.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the cumulative number of infectious humans up to time 
 <italic>t</italic> = 700 when 0.1% of humans are infected at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0. The figure illustrates that the wMel-infected mosquitoes are more effective in slowing disease transmission than wAlbB-infected mosquitoes. For DENV and ZIKV, the number of people infected by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes is greater than the number of humans infected by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes carrying the same strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. The opposite is true for CHIKV where the number of people infected by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes is greater than the number of people infected by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes carrying the same strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Note that in these simulations we assume the same mosquito populations for both genera. Typically the density of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes is much greater than the density for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in urban areas, while the opposite is true in wooded rural areas. In this study, we only considered one mosquito genus at a time. When both mosquitoes are present, then the predictions will depend on the total mosquito population. As a first order approximation, the results are interpolated based on the fraction of each mosquito genus.
