<p>We compare the differences in the spread of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV in wMel- and wAlbB-infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes with the spread in 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-free mosquitoes. In the simulations, the parameters are set to the baseline values in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, unless specifically stated otherwise. The baseline values are the best estimates available for these parameter values. Since parameter uncertainty exists, it is important to investigate the behavior of the model over the wide range of feasible parameters. By investigating the model over the full range of parameters, we have focused on the qualitative differences between different infections and strains of
