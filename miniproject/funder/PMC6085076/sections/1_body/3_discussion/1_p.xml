<p>A mosquito infected with the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria is less capable of transmitting DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV, and one of the leading new mitigation strategies is to fight the spread of these viral infections by releasing 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes. We quantified the impact of wAlbB, wMel, and wMelPop strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in reducing the transmission of CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV. The model accounts for reduced fitness of the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes, reduced ability of transmitting viruses, and the behavior changes of infected individuals caused by the infection. Because people infectious with DENV and CHIKV are more likely to have serious symptoms, we assumed that the people infectious with these viruses were less likely to be bitten by mosquitoes than the people infectious with ZIKV. The behavior changes of humans have significant impacts on the model predictions and, unfortunately, is often let out of most vector-borne disease models.
