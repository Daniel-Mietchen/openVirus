<p>There are ongoing efforts for releasing 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes in the wild to fight against the spread of these viral infections. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes could contribute to the reduction of transmission instead of elimination. Besides, the number of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes released has to exceed the threshold and continual introductions are required. The real-world thresholds for sustaining an epidemic will be greater than the threshold estimates derived for ideal conditions where there is a homogenous population of infected and uninfected mosquitoes.
