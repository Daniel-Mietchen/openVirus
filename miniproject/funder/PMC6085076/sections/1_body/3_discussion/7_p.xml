<p>The analysis of the basic reproduction number assumes that when the infections first enter a population, then everyone is fully susceptible to the infection. We derived the effective reproduction number for when the host population is partially immune to new infections, perhaps due to a previous epidemic. The effective reproduction number increases with the susceptibility of humans. When more people are immune to DENV and CHIKV than ZIKV, as happened in the 2015 Zika epidemic, then the numbers of dengue and Chikungunya cases tend to be stable, while the number of Zika cases exploded. Hence, the susceptibility of the human population must be taken into account in future seasonal outbreaks. Our analysis quantified how
