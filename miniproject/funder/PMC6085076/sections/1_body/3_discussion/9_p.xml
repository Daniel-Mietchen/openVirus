<p>These field tests suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the populations must be considered before this model will be appropriate to help guide policy decisions. Also, our simulations are based on an environment of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes where most of the wild mosquitoes are infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. When introducing the wMel or wAlbB strains of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> into a wild mosquito population, it may take several weeks or months for it to reach the equilibrium level and may require several introductions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the model parameter values are based on average estimates from the literature, and not the parameters for a specific location. Before this model can be applied to a specific location, then model parameters, such as the average number of mosquitoes per person, must be estimated for this location.
