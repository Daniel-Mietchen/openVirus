<p>In future studies, we will couple the model for the spread of

 <xref rid="pntd.0006666.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to evaluate effectiveness of this approach for the situations where the mosquito population is only partially infected with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and consider new human arrivals including people who are immune and infectious.
