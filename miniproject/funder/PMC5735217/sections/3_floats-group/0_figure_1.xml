  <p>Conceptual progression of a viral haemorrhagic fever from animal reservoir to global pandemic</p>
  <p>Keys stages in the progression to a potential widespread epidemic are summarised. Stage 1, index-case potential, refers to spillover viral transmission from animal reservoir to index cases. Stage 2, outbreak potential, represents an index case infecting individuals within the local community or in a care-giving setting quantified via a composite indicator assessing outbreak receptivity. Stage 3, epidemic potential, reï¬‚ects the widespread transmission of the virus both at regional and international scales.</p>
