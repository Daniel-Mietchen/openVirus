  <p>Index-case potential across countries that did not previously report spillover events</p>
  <p>Stage 1 index-case potential masked by previous reporting of index cases for Crimeanâ€“Congo haemorrhagic fever (A), Ebola virus disease (B), Lassa fever (C), and Marburg virus disease (D). Countries in dark grey are those that have previously seen spillover index cases reported. The remaining at-risk administrative units coloured in red are those with median values (based on 1000 draws) that rank in the top quintile of ranked remaining units; those coloured in green have median values that rank in the lowest quintile.</p>
