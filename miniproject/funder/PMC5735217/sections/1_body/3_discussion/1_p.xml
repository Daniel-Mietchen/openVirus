<p id="para250">We report large heterogeneities across Africa in potential for zoonotic spillover resulting in index cases and their subsequent potential to result in local outbreaks or spread to neighbouring districts or countries. Several locations rank highly for localised outbreaks, but are comparatively less likely to spread elsewhere due to their isolation (eg, forests in middle Africa). Other locations, many in western Africa, rank highly both in terms of viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak potential and capacity to spread in the absence of effective interventions. Identification of regions with the greatest increases in rank between stages highlights key transition points in which interventions are crucial for preventing epidemics.</p>
