<p id="para310">The appropriateness of factors in approximating for these processes is open to debate, as a trade-off between the geographic completeness and epidemiological relevance of data that was needed for inclusion. For instance, more appropriate proxies for local expenditure on health care beyond percentage of total gross domestic product could be leveraged as this information becomes increasingly available.

 </xref> Similarly, response time might not be solely dependent on travel infrastructure being present, but also its quality and year-round availability. With continued efforts to improve existing data resources or use geostatistical approaches to increase their spatial resolution,

Increasing the number of subnational covariates will also result in greater variation between districts within a country (supplementary materials), and is therefore particularly important when considering using such approaches to evaluate heterogeneity within a specific country. Additional pathogens will require other covariates to be considered. For instance, existing niche mapping approaches have been restricted to those pathogens strongly affected by environmental factors, whereas additional pathogens will necessitate quantification of an increasing number of socioeconomic factors.
