<p id="para320">Pathogens will continue to emerge and providing a rational and informed mechanism for the identification and prioritisation of regions for improvement and assistance across the world is therefore crucial. As demonstrated with African viral haemorrhagic fevers, this framework presents pandemic potential as distinct, yet interconnected stages, and allows for specific interventions to be tailored to locations where it is likely to have the greatest effect before the next epidemic. In moving to a more proactive consideration of these pathogens and regional variation in vulnerabilities, this analysis complements global health security ambitions and contributes to the larger discussion of where to focus limited resources in preparation for an epidemic of these rare, yet potentially devastating, pathogens.</p>
