<p id="para280">This framework is not dependent on there being an outbreak and can therefore support the proactive development of national and regional contingency plans by ministries of health and non-governmental organisations. Where vulnerabilities are identified, communities can appropriately prepare and rectify issues in advance. Understanding where potential outbreaks might occur and prospective transmission trajectories is an important step in establishing informed protocols for prevention and control. Indeed, even when cases occur, this framework combined with specific modelling strategies by stage and pathogen can inform focal control and response efforts. Aligning future priority pathogens with strategic investment in vaccine countermeasures targets (eg, Nipah virus) or other organisations' aims, will maximise the value of these outputs.</p>
