For stage 1, this assessment highlights the subnational variation that exists in at-risk populations, providing additional evidence concerning spillover potential in places that are considered non-endemic, such as Ebola virus disease in the Central African Republic. Proactive surveillance in animal populations can help these locations better evaluate emerging infectious disease threats. Additionally, highest ranked locations should be provisioned with the necessary diagnostic capacity to ensure timely and accurate diagnosis.
