<p id="para300">Use of rankings versus absolute values meant that although comparative statements can be made, definitive statements of risk are harder. Given the evidence base currently available, we are able to identify potential spillover locations in a data-driven manner; however, such statements are not possible for stage 2 and 3 in the absence of more outbreak-specific information. For future iterations, parameterisation of outbreak receptivity using historical outbreaks could allow for this, and could also be used to weight the relative effect of factors. By leveraging the full history of outbreaks, these data will also provide a mechanism for formally validating the framework. When expanding to new regions, this ability to parameterise differences in factors will allow for regional variations to be considered. Rankings are also sensitive to estimated parameters such as the suitability thresholds defining risk at stage 1, which leads to inconsistent at-risk admin 2 level definitions based on varying thresholds (supplementary materials). Such variation is incorporated and reflected in broader uncertainty intervals. In spite of this fact, however, districts such as Guéckédou (the epicentre of the western African Ebola virus disease outbreak) remain in the 98th percentile of districts with high epidemic potential for Ebola virus disease, indicating that this approach can indeed provide valuable information on epidemic potential.</p>
