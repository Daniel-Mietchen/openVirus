<p id="para110">To assess the ability of these pathogens to cause a widespread epidemic, we developed a framework that focuses on key transition points in a potential outbreak. By addressing different stages of an epidemic, we aim to provide actionable information on where to focus existing countermeasures. Additionally, by using a subnational unit of reference, we aim to provide information at a scale comparable to the localised nature of outbreaks, allowing for identification of communities at greatest risk. Drawing from multiple data sources and methods, this study outlines a three-stage framework (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>): stage 1, index-case potential, describes the transition (spillover) from zoonotic reservoirs or vectors into human populations, resulting in an index case (ie, the first case in any potential epidemic); stage 2, outbreak potential, characterises the subsequent secondary spread of the pathogen in people, typically localised where care is given, whether at home or in the health-care system and nearby settlements; stage 3, epidemic potential, describes the processes by which local outbreaks can subsequently cause infections elsewhere nationally, regionally, and internationally.
