<p id="para10">The Ebola virus disease outbreak, which centred in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, was unprecedented both in terms of mortality and morbidity, as well as the extent to which the disease spread locally and internationally.

 </xref> The unanticipated cases of Ebola virus disease in regions previously considered non-endemic, coupled with inadequate infrastructure and susceptible, yet highly mobile populations, might have contributed to the outbreak infecting over 60 times more individuals than any previous Ebola virus disease outbreak.

 </xref> As pathogens continue to emerge and spread into populations at-risk, a move from purely responsive activities to also include proactive management of emerging infectious diseases is urgently needed.

 </xref> Initiatives such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the US Global Health Security Agenda, with its renewed focus on achieving the International Health Regulations, have reinforced a need for a proactive approach to emerging infectious diseases.
