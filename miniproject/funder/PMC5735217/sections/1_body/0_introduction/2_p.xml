  </p>
  <p id="para40">We searched PubMed with search terms “viral haemorrhagic fever preparedness”, “viral haemorrhagic fever risk assessment”, “pandemic risk assessment”, and “pandemic preparedness”, for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and July 1, 2016, with supplemental searches in Google Scholar. Articles assessing subnational variation in pandemic risk or evaluating this risk across broad geographic scales were included. A variety of analytical approaches have been developed to assess different aspects of outbreak risk, including environmental correlates to define regions of possible pathogen emergence, models of population connectivity to determine potential spread, and analyses of drivers of incidence and prevalence at local and national levels. Most of these assessments are retrospective, or delayed due to time lags in data availability and hence may have limited utility for improving epidemic preparedness. Pre-emptive assessments of epidemics, leveraging common features from such work are less common. Hotspots of disease emergence have been identified and indices developed to gauge national-level susceptibility to infectious pathogens, representing important first steps in assessing risk. To date, however, no analyses have quantified how these vulnerabilities might change during different stages of an outbreak, nor have they consistently evaluated such vulnerabilities for the spatial granularity at which outbreaks occur and are addressed.</p>

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para60">This study builds upon previous preparedness concepts to develop a subnational evaluation of epidemic potential across Africa. For the first time, within a single pandemic potential framework, our analyses show how different stages of an outbreak can be quantified and evaluated before the next outbreak. We use a new combination of methods to provide a complete picture of potential outbreak progression, from initial spillover resulting in an index case to broader regional and international spread; thus allowing countries to directly focus on places where disease emergence and subsequent transmission could have the greatest impact on human health.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para80">Our results allow both governmental and non-governmental organisations to better understand epidemic potential, and offer pre-emptive planning to address vulnerabilities before the next outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever. Using these results in tandem with existing in-country evaluations, such as the Joint External Evaluations, allows stakeholders to establish whether outbreak preparedness activities, broader governmental initiatives, or pathogen-specific control measures, are being targeted appropriately to places with future outbreak potential. Regions where there is a mismatch between pandemic potential and existing preparedness activities should therefore be considered as priorities in future preparedness planning. By moving preparedness discussions from national to subnational assessments, outbreak response protocols can better reflect the demands that epidemics present to local health systems.</p>
