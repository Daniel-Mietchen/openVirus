<p id="para100">Viral haemorrhagic fevers, such as Crimeanâ€“Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever, and Marburg virus disease, are present in Africa and have the potential for secondary human-to-human transmission after zoonotic spillover into human populations, with initial clinical presentation similar to several other pathogens. Subsequently, they pose a risk to populations in both endemic and non-endemic locations, particularly where rapid diagnostic capacity is low.
