<p id="para210">Across Africa, the ranking of subnational regions in stage 1, identification of locations with the greatest potential for index cases, reflected key trends observed in the original zoonotic niche maps (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2, first row</xref>). All admin 2 areas are ordered so that regions with the highest index-case potential are highest ranked. Areas susceptible to spillover of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever were widespread, with the highest ranked admin 2 units found in the Sahel (eg, Kollo, Niger), the Horn of Africa (eg, Sennar, Sudan), and southern Africa (eg, Johannesburg, South Africa). By contrast, Lassa fever was restricted to areas in western Africa such as in Guinea (eg, Guéckédou) and Nigeria (eg, Ife North), whereas Ebola virus disease had highest ranked admin 2 units, and thus those with the highest potential for index cases, found in both western Africa (eg, Macenta, Guinea and Foya, Liberia) and middle Africa (eg, Woleu, Gabon and Haut-Uele, the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Highest ranked locations for Marburg virus disease were present across the continent (eg, Mwenge, Uganda; Voinjama, Liberia; and Beni, the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Although many regions in the highest quintile were located in countries with previous outbreaks, several locations with no previous outbreaks had high index-case potential, such as Boumba-et-Ngoko in Cameroon for Ebola virus disease (
