<p id="para220">Outbreak receptivity, the composite indicator used in stage 2 to identify regions susceptible to ongoing secondary transmission, revealed substantial variation in capabilities to effectively respond to index cases (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). At least 90% of the districts found in the Central African Republic, Chad, Somalia, and South Sudan ranked in the top 90th percentile of African locations, or in other words, those administrative units with the most susceptible populations and poorest response capacity. More than 80% of admin 2 units in Guinea, Madagascar, and Sudan were in the top 70th percentile or higher for outbreak receptivity.
