<p id="para230">Pairing outbreak receptivity (stage 2) with index-case potential (stage 1) highlights key differences in pathogen-specific vulnerabilities between locations (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, second row) which shows that some regions are more susceptible to continued human-to-human transmission. Locations rising up the rankings between stages indicate that, in the event of an index case, these would be key targets for rapid and effective intervention, to avert local outbreaks. For Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, many at-risk districts increased in rankings, particularly in Somalia (54% increase in districts in top quintile admin 2) and across the Sahel, such as within Sudan (+25%) and Niger (+14%). Conversely, rankings decreased between stages in all districts in South Africa (85% reduction in top quintile admin 2) as well as parts of Kenya (−51%) and Tanzania (−29%). Similar patterns were observed with Ebola virus disease, with locations in Angola (+14%), the Central African Republic (+7%), and South Sudan (+7%) ranking higher, whereas districts in Côte d'Ivoire (−5%) and Uganda (−19%) decreased between stages. By contrast with Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever showed variable changes in ranking across western Africa; Guinean districts rose in ranking (+15%), Ivorian districts decreased (−28%), and Nigerian districts reflected the heterogeneities in receptivity found across the country. For Marburg virus disease, rankings rose most in at-risk districts in Angola (+13%) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (+21%), whereas similar national-level trends occurred in line with changes seen in Ebola virus disease rankings (eg, 35% reduction in top quintile admin 2 units in Uganda).
