<p id="para240">Travel time to nearest city in stage 3a revealed large variations in connectivity across Africa, contrasting the densely populated and urbanised regions in northern and western Africa with the Sahara and the rainforests of middle Africa. For instance, the isolation of forested areas in middle Africa contributed to substantial reductions in rankings (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, third row, stage 3a), and suggest lower potential for a widespread outbreak of Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, or Marburg virus disease occurring in Congo (14% and 15% reduction in top quintile admin 2 for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (−43% Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, −21% Ebola virus disease, −18% Marburg virus disease), and Gabon (−40% Ebola virus disease, −29% Marburg virus disease). Conversely, much of western Africa rose in the ranking for epidemic potential, particularly in Nigeria (+20% Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, +29% Ebola virus disease, and +19% Marburg virus disease), Guinea (+28% Ebola virus disease, +27% Marburg virus disease), and Sierra Leone (+25% Ebola virus disease). A similar trend was seen for densely populated regions of eastern Africa, such as Uganda (+19% Ebola virus disease, +23% Marburg virus disease), indicating that these locations have a greater potential to spread to neighbouring areas. To that end, comparison of local outbreak potential with international spread capability also highlights important trends (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>, fourth row, stage 3b). For Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, with only low rankings in receptivity, the potential for international spread was high for South Africa (81% increase in top quintile admin 2) and at-risk districts in Nigeria represented many of those with the highest potential for global spread (+30% Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, +59% Ebola virus disease, +42% Marburg virus disease, +18% Lassa fever).
