 </xref> Following INFORM protocols, we normalised covariate factors and standardised to a 0â€“10 output, with 10 representing the worst outcome. Contingent on the potential for compensatory effects between factors, we used either geometric or arithmetic means when aggregating data, with each stage building on the previous stage. We established uncertainty by calculating 1000 draws, each using independent random draws for covariates with associated variance. We assessed uncertainty at each of the three stages. Aggregation of the results for all stages occurs after this process, ensuring a full record of the uncertainty by stage. Importantly, the output measures of median ranks allow for comparison, but are not direct representations of quantitative differences in potential case numbers and deaths.
