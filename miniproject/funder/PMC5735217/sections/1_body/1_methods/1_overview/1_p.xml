<p id="para120">In this multistage analysis, we characterised three stages of a potential viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak with a variety of methods and datasets (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>). We used environmental suitability maps to define at-risk populations for stage 1. Stage 2 is an adaptation of an existing risk framework, the Index for Risk Management (INFORM),
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and uses a composite indicator to assess variation in outbreak receptivity (ie, locations where continued transmission in people is more likely to occur) combined with stage 1 estimates to identify regions with the highest potential for localised outbreaks. For stage 3, we combine connectivity assessments, both at the local and international scale, with stage 2 to establish regions with the highest potential for widespread epidemics.
