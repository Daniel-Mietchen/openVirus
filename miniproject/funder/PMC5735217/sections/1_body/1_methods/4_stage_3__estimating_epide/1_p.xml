<p id="para180">We evaluated two dimensions of epidemic potential for stage 3. First, we assessed the source capacity of an admin 2 unit (ie, the potential for an outbreak to seed infections in other locations) (stage 3a) by measuring the average travel time from a given 5 × 5 km unit in each admin 2 to the nearest city (defined as over 50 000 inhabitants).

 </xref> With this calculation, we identified the at-risk locations most likely to be exporters of infected individuals, in the absence of barriers to movement such as border restrictions. The travel time covariate uses information on land cover and existing infrastructure to estimate the shortest travel time from any given point to nearby settlements. We normalised this covariate and standardised to a 0–10 scale, and the geometric mean of stage 2 outputs and this covariate were taken to produce the measure for stage 3a. Second, we assessed international source capacity (stage 3b) with anonymised passenger-level flight itineraries from the International Air Transport Association for 2015, which included details on passengers' initial airport of embarkation and final destination.
