 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> We compiled this information to build an environmental profile that best characterises possible pathogen presence. Subsequently, areas of unknown disease status can be evaluated based on their environmental profile similarities. We calculated a data-driven threshold value defining at-risk areas by assessing different groupings of reported disease occurrences and background records, and the ability of each threshold to accurately classify them.
