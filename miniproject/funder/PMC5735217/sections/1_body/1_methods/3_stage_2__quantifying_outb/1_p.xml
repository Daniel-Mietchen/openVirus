<p id="para160">We paired stage 1 estimates of index-case potential with a composite indicator of measures termed outbreak receptivity (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table</xref>) to produce admin 2 level outbreak potential assessments, identifying locations more likely to experience secondary human-to-human viral transmission. We established an initial set of measures, referred to here as factors, through expert consultation based on the INFORM study,

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> based on hypothesised similar effects on outbreaks. This outbreak receptivity indicator and its components are intended to reflect the susceptibility of a given location to continued transmission based on the resident population and existing response infrastructure. Thus, each included factor is a hypothesised correlate of continued secondary transmission.
