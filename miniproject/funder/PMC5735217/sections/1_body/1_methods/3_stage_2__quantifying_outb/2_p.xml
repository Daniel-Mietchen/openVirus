<p id="para170">Other factors such as access to personal protective equipment or number of isolation wards were considered, but were ultimately excluded because data at a continental scale were not available. We collected information on each factor at the highest possible spatial resolution and summarised data at the admin 2 level. We standardised inputs to a 0â€“10 scale, including normalisation where appropriate, using optimised Box-Cox transformations,

In testing this composite indicator, we identified uniqueness among factors via principal components analysis, and removed redundant factors (ie, those with similar scores across the first two principal components).

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Given that a subset of all possible outbreak drivers are used with no a priori rationale for one component being dominant, we enforced equivalence by reweighting the arithmetic mean so that the differences in variance explained of the final composite indicator by each component were reduced. We coupled the resultant outbreak receptivity values with stage 1 outputs for each pathogen by taking their geometric mean, to produce the final stage 2 evaluation.
