H3N2 causes the majority of severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood imprinting to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via homosubtypic immune memory or via broader, heterosubtypic memory. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a consequence, newer and less &#x0201c;senior&#x0201d; antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood. Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Influenza viruses of subtype H1N1 and H3N2 both cause seasonal epidemics in humans, but with different age-specific impacts. H3N2 causes a greater proportion of cases in older adults than H1N1, and more deaths overall. People tend to gain the strongest immune memory of influenza viruses encountered in childhood, and so differences in H1N1 and H3N2&#x02019;s age-specific impacts may reflect that individuals born in different eras of influenza circulation have been imprinted with different immunological risk profiles. Another idea is that H3N2 may be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults because it evolves slightly faster than H1N1 and can more quickly escape immune memory. We analyzed a large epidemiological data set and found that birth year-specific differences in childhood immune imprinting, not differences in evolutionary rate, explain differences in H1N1 and H3N2&#x02019;s age-specific impacts. These results can help epidemiologists understand how epidemic risk from specific influenza subtypes is distributed across the population and predict how population risk may shift as differently imprinted birth years grow older. Further, these results provide immunological clues to which facets of immune memory become biased in childhood, and then later play a strong role in protection during seasonal influenza epidemics.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AI134017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9369-6371</contrib-id><name><surname>Gostic</surname><given-names>Katelyn M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9369-6371</contrib-id><name><surname>Gostic</surname><given-names>Katelyn M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCE-1335657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-502X</contrib-id><name><surname>Lloyd-Smith</surname><given-names>James O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1557022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-502X</contrib-id><name><surname>Lloyd-Smith</surname><given-names>James O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PREEMPT D18AC00031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7941-502X</contrib-id><name><surname>Lloyd-Smith</surname><given-names>James O.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Worobey</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>KMG was supported by the National Institutes of Health (F31AI134017, T32-GM008185).

Foundational work on original antigenic sin [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and antigenic seniority [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] shows that individuals maintain the highest antibody titers against influenza strains encountered in childhood. But how these serological patterns map to functional immune protection, and shape birth year-specific risk during outbreaks, remains an active area of inquiry. One open question is the breadth of cross-protection provided by immune memory imprinted in childhood.</p><p>We define immune imprinting as a lifelong bias in immune memory of, and protection against, the strains encountered in childhood. Such biases most likely become entrenched as subsequent exposures back-boost existing memory responses, rather than stimulating de novo responses [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. By providing particularly robust protection against certain antigenic subtypes, or clades, imprinting can provide immunological benefits, but perhaps at the cost of equally strong protection against variants encountered later in life. For example, every modern influenza pandemic has spared certain birth cohorts, presumably due to cross-protective memory primed in childhood [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently, we showed that imprinting also protects against novel, emerging avian influenza viruses of the same phylogenetic group of hemagglutinin (HA) as the first childhood exposure [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Imprinting may additionally shape birth year-specific risk from seasonal influenza [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the importance of broadly protective immunity in this context is still being evaluated [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, narrow cross-protective immunity specific to variants of a single HA subtype has been considered the primary mode of defense against seasonal influenza. Lymphocyte memory of variable epitopes on the HA head (i.e. sites at which hemagglutinin antigens of different subtypes show limited homology) drives this narrow, within-subtype protection, which is the main mechanism of protection from the inactivated influenza vaccine. But a growing body of evidence shows protection may also be driven by memory of other influenza antigens (e.g. neuraminidase, NA) [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or by immune response to conserved epitopes, many of which are found on the HA stalk [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Antibodies that target conserved HA epitopes can provide broad protection across multiple HA subtypes in the same phylogenetic group [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], where HA group 1 contains hemagglutinin subtypes H1 and H2, while group 2 contains H3. Only three HA subtypes have circulated seasonally in humans since 1918, H1, H2 and H3; H1 and H2 belong to phylogenetic group 1, while H3 is in group 2 [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Current thinking stipulates that within a single host, imprinting probably induces multiple levels of bias in immune memory, to both conserved (broadly protective) and variable (narrowly protective) sites on various influenza antigens. The functional role of any single layer of imprinted immune memory depends on both immunodominance hierarchies and epidemic context. Here, we examine which layers of imprinted memory impact risk from seasonal influenza.</p><p>Different breadths of immunity are expected to act differently on influenza epidemiology. Within-subtype immunity to HA is known to shape seasonal influenza&#x02019;s epidemiology and evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but due to rapid decay in the face of antigenic drift, it would not be expected to shape cohort-specific imprinting protection across an entire human lifetime [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Conversely, broad, HA group-level immune memory arises when lymphocytes target conserved HA epitopes. Responses to these conserved epitopes should be more stable over time, and can play a strong role in defense against unfamiliar influenza strains (e.g. novel, avian or pandemic subtypes [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but are not traditionally though to act strongly against familiar, seasonal influenza subtypes. However, responses to the conserved HA stem have recently been identified as an independent correlate of protection against seasonal influenza [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and might play a particularly strong role against drifted seasonal strains whose variable HA epitopes have become unrecognizable. Thus, childhood immune imprinting may determine which birth cohorts are primed for effective defense against seasonal strains with conserved HA epitopes characteristic of group 1 or group 2, or with variable HA epitopes characteristic of a particular subtype (H1, H2, etc.). A similar line of reasoning may apply to immunity against NA, although much less attention has been paid to this antigen.</p><p>Since 1977, two distinct subtypes of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, have circulated seasonally in humans, with striking but poorly understood differences in their age-specific impact [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These differences could be associated with childhood imprinting: older cohorts were almost certainly exposed to H1N1 in childhood (since it was the only subtype circulating in humans from 1918&#x02013;1957), and now seem to be preferentially protected against modern seasonal H1N1 variants [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, younger adults have the highest probabilities of childhood imprinting to H3N2 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008109.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>), which is consistent with relatively low numbers of clinically attended H3N2 cases in these cohorts. Alternatively, differences in the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1 and H3N2 could explain the observed age profiles. Subtype H3N2 exhibits slightly faster drift in its antigenic phenotype than H1N1, and as a result, H3N2 may be better able to escape pre-existing immunity in immunologically experienced adults, whereas H1N1 may be relatively restricted to causing disease in immunologically inexperienced children [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><fig id="ppat.1008109.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1008109.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Model and expectations under different imprinting hypotheses.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> Reconstructed, birth year-specific probabilities of imprinting (representative example specific to cases observed in 2015).

Cases of all ages were confirmed to subtype by PCR and/or culture, primarily from virologic testing at the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL). The ADHS surveillance system aims to characterize circulating strains from patients across the state with medically attended influenza. Although surveillance does not target specific at-risk groups, relatively severe cases (especially those tested at hospital labs) are overrepresented in our data, as these cases are most likely to be medically attended and confirmed to subtype, thus meeting our study inclusion criteria. This is because confirmation to subtype requires a second-line test (PCR or culture); rapid tests are more common, but do not indicate subtype.</p><p>Although the exact collection setting of individual specimens was not always recorded, ADHS staff internally reviewed reporting source and provider organization of cases in our data to estimate that roughly 76% were reported and/or submitted by hospital labs or may have originated at hospital-associated outpatient clinics. In 2016, an ADHS analysis matched PCR-confirmed cases to hospital discharge data, and found that nearly half of the cases reported from hospital labs were severe enough to warrant hospital admission (if extrapolated to other seasons, roughly 38% of the overall data). The rest (also roughly 38% of the overall data, if extrapolated) were discharged without admission. To obtain a broader representation of clinically attended cases from across the state, ADHS collaborates with county health departments, commercial laboratories, and outpatient clinics to receive specimens. We estimate that roughly 8% of the overall data originated in outpatient settings. The remaining 17% of cases were either tested at commercial labs, or were tested at ASPHL, but with unknown origin.

Specifically, age-specific risk could be influenced by medical factors like age-specific vaccine coverage, age-specific risk of severe disease, age-related changes in endocrinology and immunosenescence, or by behavioral factors like age-assorted social mixing, and age-specific healthcare seeking behavior. These factors should have similar impacts on any influenza subtype. In contrast, imprinting effects are subtype- (or group-) specific. Thus, we fit a step function to characterize the shape of age-specific risk of any confirmed influenza case. Simultaneously, we modeled residual, subtype-specific differences in risk as a function of birth year, to focus on the possible role of childhood imprinting.

We defined children as ages 0&#x02013;10, and verified internally that our analysis of evolutionary rate was insensitive to our exact choice of age range for children. Consistent with this expectation, the data showed a slight negative but not significant association between annual antigenic advance and the fraction of H3N2 cases observed in children (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008109.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>).

However, the data showed that differences in H1N1 and H3N2&#x02019;s age-specific impacts did not converge when lineages showed similar annual advance. When comparing the fraction of cases observed in specific age classes, H1N1 data consistently clustered separately from H3N2, with H1N1 consistently causing fewer cases at the extremes of age (children 0&#x02013;10 and elderly adults 71&#x02013;85), but more cases in middle-aged adults, regardless of antigenic novelty (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008109.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>).

We analyzed several possible drivers of these differences systematically, and found the greatest support for imprinting protection against seasonal influenza viruses of the same NA or HA subtype as the first influenza strain encountered in childhood [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

Our results suggest individuals retain a lifelong bias in immune memory, and that this imprint is not erased even after decades of exposure to or vaccination against dissimilar influenza subtypes.</p><p>External evidence corroborates the idea that birth year, rather than age, drives subtype-specific differences in seasonal influenza risk. When H3N2 first emerged in 1968, it caused little or no excess mortality in the elderly, who had putatively been exposed, as children or young adults, to an H3 virus that had circulated in the late 1800s [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, H1N1-imprinted cohorts (those ~10&#x02013;50 years old at the time) experienced considerable excess mortality in the 1968 pandemic [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Now, fifty years later, the same H1N1-imprinted cohorts continue to experience excess H3N2 morbidity and mortality as older adults [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008109.g002">Fig 2</xref></bold>).</p><p>In model comparison, the data supported childhood imprinting to NA at the subtype level. Although NA is not as intensively studied as HA, these results emphasize the increasingly recognized importance of both antigens as drivers of protection against seasonal influenza [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Realistically, some combination of effects from both HA and NA subtype-level imprinting probably shapes seasonal influenza risk; both models of imprinting produced similar fits to data, and far outperformed other models in terms of AIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008109.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Unfortunately, due to the limited diversity of seasonal influenza subtypes that have circulated in humans over the past century, collinearities between even the relatively simple models tested here prevented us from testing more complicated models of combined effects from imprinting to multiple antigens. Deeper insights into the respective roles of HA and NA will most likely need to come from focused immunological cohort studies, in which individual histories of influenza infection are recorded and can be studied alongside changes in serology, PBMCs, and/or the B cell repertoire [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Alternatively, the development of immunological biomarkers for diagnosis of imprinting status in individual patients could substantially increase the power of epidemiological inference.</p><p>We did not detect a clear relationship between annual antigenic advance and epidemic age distribution, although small sample sizes may have limited our statistical power. We did detect a weak trend, consistent with the idea that influenza cases are more restricted to immunologically inexperienced children in seasons of low antigenic advance, as previously proposed [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. But the data did not reveal a clear relationship between antigenic advance and the fraction of cases occurring in adult age groups, where epidemiological data reveal distinct subtype-specific differences in impact. Perhaps antigenic advance shapes how cases are distributed between children and adults, but has small or inconsistent impacts within the adult population. We speculate that clearer relationships between antigenic advance and epidemic age distribution might emerge if methods to estimate antigenic distance were able to incorporate effects such as immune history [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], glycosylation [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and immunity to antigens other than HA [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The exact immunological drivers of imprinting protection against seasonal influenza remain unclear, but our results provide some new clues. Traditionally, within-subtype cross-protection is thought to decay quickly with antigenic drift. Strains that circulated more than 14 years apart rarely show measurable cross-protective titers by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The short timescale of immune memory to variable HA head epitopes stands in contrast to patterns observed in our study and others [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where within-subtype immune memory imprinted in childhood appears to persist for an entire human lifetime, remaining evident even in the oldest cohorts. We speculate that within-subtype imprinting protection may involve epitopes that are more conserved, and stable over time, than those typically measured in HI assays. These inform most existing estimates of antigenic distance, but disproportionately measure antibodies to variable, immunodominant epitopes on the HA head [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Across a lifetime of exposures to diverse H1N1 and H3N2 variants, repeated back-boosting of antibodies to intermediately conserved sites on HA or NA (i.e. sites conserved within but not across HA and NA subtypes), could explain the longevity of subtype-level imprinting protection. This is consistent with recent evidence that the immune repertoire shifts to focus on more conserved influenza epitopes as we age [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Another possibility is that memory B cell clones developed during the first childhood influenza infection may later adapt via somatic hypermutation to follow antigenic targets as they drift over time. However, this would be inconsistent with new evidence suggesting memory B cells are relatively fixed in phenotype, and have little potential for ongoing affinity maturation [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], or that somatic hypermutation decreases with age [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finally, the role of CD4+ T cells in imprinting is unclear, but T cell memory and T cell help to B cells within germinal centers both play at least some role in the development of the immune repertoire [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Signals of imprinting protection are anomalously strong in the current cohort of elderly adults, as reflected by higher estimates of imprinting protection to H1N1 than H3N2. The oldest subjects in our data, born slightly after 1918, and would not have encountered an influenza virus of any subtype other than H1N1 until roughly age 30. Repeated early-life exposures to diverse H1N1 variants may have reinforced and expanded the breadth of H1N1-specific immune memory [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. But this strong H1N1 protection seems to come at a cost; even after decades of seasonal H3N2 exposure, and vaccination, older cohorts have evidently failed to develop equally strong protection against H3N2. HA group 1 antigens (e.g. H1) appear to induce narrower immune responses, and less cross-group protection than structurally distinct HA group 2 antigens (e.g. H3) [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Perhaps elderly cohorts imprinted to group 1 antigens have been trapped in narrower responses that offer exceptional protection against strains similar to that of first exposure but relatively poor adaptability to other subtypes.</p><p>We speculate that imprinting protection, which currently limits the number of severe, clinically-attended H1N1 cases in the elderly, also limits the mortality impact of H1N1 viruses. Although pre- and post- 2009 H1N1 lineages have caused slightly different profiles of age-specific mortality [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], neither H1N1 lineage causes nearly as many deaths as H3N2 in high-risk elderly cohorts [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the one hand, if strong subtype-specific biases from imprinting remain in future cohorts of elderly adults, our results would corroborate the idea that mortality from H1N1 may increase as protection in the elderly shifts from H1N1 toward other subtypes [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, given that cohorts born after 1968 have had much more varied early life exposures to both H1N1 and H3N2, these cohorts may show a greater ability to act as immunological generalists as they become elderly, capable of effective defense against multiple subtypes.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Relatively severe, clinically attended cases are much more likely to be detected, confirmed to subtype, and included in our data than mild cases. Thus, while our results show a clear relationship between subtype-level imprinting and risk of relatively severe, clinically attended influenza, the relationship between imprinting and mild or asymptomatic cases could not be determined from available data.</p><p>Given the limited number of variables recorded in the data, we could not model explicitly the impact of individual risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities, patient sex, or vaccination status. All these factors are known to shape immunity and influenza risk [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and all may cause individual imprinting outcomes to vary from the average, population trends measured by our study. Understanding how these patient-level covariates modulate imprinting and other aspects of immunity is the next frontier in this line of research. For now, working within the constraints of the available data, we designed the age-specific risk component of the model to capture empirically the combined effects of several risk factors that could not be modeled individually. Additionally, we analyzed the relative count of H1N1 to H3N2 cases within each single year of birth, not absolute incidence, to control for minor age-specific biases in sampling, which are almost inevitably present in any large surveillance data set.</p><p>Another limitation was the low number of confirmed cases available in the pre-2009 era. Large, detailed data sets collected continuously over decades provide the greatest power to separate the effects of age from birth year. We emphatically echo earlier calls [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] for more systematic sharing of single year-of-age influenza surveillance data, standardization of sampling effort, and reporting of age-specific denominators, which could substantially boost the scientific community&#x02019;s ability to link influenza's genetic and antigenic properties with epidemiological outcomes. Additionally, collection and reporting of covariates such as sex, vaccination status and the presence of comorbidities in surveillance data would help us understand how patient-level variables modulate imprinting, and immunity in general [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>Altogether, this analysis confirms that the epidemiological burden of H1N1 and H3N2 is shaped by cohort-specific differences in childhood imprinting [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and that this imprinting acts at the HA or NA subtype level against seasonal influenza [<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The lack of support for broader, HA group-level imprinting effects emphasizes the consequences of immunodominance of influenza&#x02019;s most variable epitopes, and the difficulty of deploying broadly protective memory B cell responses against familiar, seasonal strains. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of how antigenic seniority shapes cohort-specific risk during epidemics. The fact that elderly cohorts show relatively weak immune protection against H3N2, even after living through decades of seasonal exposure to or vaccination against H3N2, suggests that antibody responses acquired in adulthood do not provide the same strength or durability of immune protection as responses primed in childhood. Immunological experiments that consider multiple viral exposures, and cohort studies in which individual histories of influenza infection are tracked from birth, promise to illuminate how B cell and T cell memory develop across a series of early life exposures. In particular, these studies may provide clearer insights than epidemiological data into which influenza antigens, epitopes and immune effectors play the greatest role in immune imprinting, and how quickly subtype-specific biases become entrenched across the first or the first few exposures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study analyzed only existing epidemiological data, which was completely anonymized.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Estimation of age from birth year in ADHS data</title><p>The data contained three variables, influenza season, birth year and confirmed subtype.

<named-content content-type="letter-date">5 Aug 2019</named-content>
</p><p>Dear Ms. Gostic,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics" (PPATHOGENS-D-19-01238) for review by PLOS Pathogens. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important problem, but raised some substantial concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. These issues must be addressed before we would be willing to consider a revised version of your study. We cannot, of course, promise publication at that time.</p><p>We therefore ask you to modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations before we can consider your manuscript for acceptance. Your revisions should address the specific points made by each reviewer.</p><p>In addition, when you are ready to resubmit, please be prepared to provide the following:</p><p>(1) A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>(2) Two versions of the manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p><p>While revising your submission, please upload your figure files to the Preflight Analysis and Conversion Engine (PACE) digital diagnostic tool, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com">https://pacev2.apexcovantage.com</ext-link>.&#x000a0;PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>figures@plos.org</email>.</p><p>Additionally, to enhance the reproducibility of your results, PLOS recommends that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. For instructions see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods">http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/submission-guidelines#loc-materials-and-methods</ext-link></p><p>We hope to receive your revised manuscript within 60 days.

While the reviewers found the question important a few major concerns were raised that must be addressed. First, concerns were raised about biases in surveillance data collection, which can differ by age (Reviewer 3). Also, how host-related factors, including sex, in addition to age, could impact early life imprinting (Reviewer 1) is not considered in the the analyses to ensure that the conclusions drawn are valid across individuals.</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Part I - Summary</bold></p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1: The goal of this paper was to assess how childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology. The authors use large epidemiological surveillance data to test whether this immune imprinting acts primarily by immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immunity that protects again various subtypes. The authors show that within subtype imprinting has the strongest impact on seasonal influenza risk and that antibody responses acquired later in life do not have the same impact on long-term immunity as early-life influenza responses. This is a well-written manuscript with important implications. My specific comments are below:</p><p>Reviewer #2: Overall this is a very insightful manuscript that describes the role of early life influenza exposures in protection against currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. This is a topic of great importance and the manuscript itself is well written with clearly presented data. The authors have published a previous paper examining how early life influenza exposures provide some degree of protection against potentially pandemic influenza strains. However, as humans are repeatedly exposed to seasonal influenza via both vaccination and infection, the protection afforded against circulating strains via imprinting could be vastly different. Indeed, the authors do find early life influenza exposures are able to imprint immunity and provide significant but only subtype-specific protection against future infections into adulthood and beyond. Further, a novel role for the NA protein in imprinting is described. Overall this paper represents an important contribution to the field and the data appear to support the conclusions being drawn.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This is a well-written manuscript by Gostic and colleagues examining imprinting, a critical question in the influenza field. The modeling is a real strength, but I have significant concerns about the data that is modeled.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1: Assessment of host factors</p><p>Although the authors investigate how age can impact imprinting responses, they do not provide the sex of the individuals in their study, nor do they account for sex in their analyses. Previous work has shown that sex can impact influenza responses in human and animal models, and it is important that in this type of epidemiological study, host factors, including sex, are included. Further, although I recognize it is difficult to access human data over the life course, it would be important to know more about the patients included in the analysis and if any patients had co-morbidities that may have influenced their responses both early on and later in life. With increasing age, susceptibility to infection increases; antibody responses and vaccine efficacy decrease; and sex hormones decrease. These immunological and endocrinological changes are important to account for when assessing how age and year of birth may impact responses to influenza.</p><p>Reviewer #2: None</p><p>Reviewer #3: 1. This manuscript relies completely on influenza surveillance data, however, no detail is provided on the surveillance system. In particular, typically state surveillance systems are designed in such a way that they target specific at-risk populations. Thus, the data is collected in an intentionally biased way and does not represent what is happening at a population level, but rather maximizes the cases identified. For instance, sentinel surveillance systems tend to have over-representation of pediatric offices to catch non-severe cases, outbreaks tend to be investigated (and reported on) in old age homes, and hospital surveillance may be more heavily done in specific adult hospitals. In addition, the design of the surveillance system may change over time. If severity patterns differ by virus, which is likely, and surveillance setting differs by age (which is also likely, but I am unfamiliar with surveillance in Arizona), then bias could be introduced into the models. The authors should report on the design of the surveillance system in the methods section including any changes over the study period and, most importantly, on how the design of the surveillance system may have impacted their results.</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold></p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Childhood age range</p><p>The authors include &#x0201c;children&#x0201d; from 0 to 10 years of age. Have the authors thought about the fact that individuals within that large range may have varying degrees of imprinting and also exhibit vastly different immune responses (e.g., a 6-month old child will elicit different responses from a 10 year old). It would be helpful if the authors address this idea and suggest how they controlled for this in the current study.</p><p>Reviewer #2: While the discussion raises many important points, it is very long and would benefit from being compressed while still retaining the major points being made. Although outside of the scope of the current paper (and analyzed dataset), a future study performing similar analysis on a cohort on which serum/PBMCs could also be analyzed would provide significant insight on the immunologic mechanisms underlying the described findings.</p><p>Reviewer #3: 1. The authors should define imprinting more thoroughly in the introduction as non-influenza audiences may not be familiar with the term and in the influenza field imprinting has been used to describe several phenomena that may have different mechanistic bases (and indeed the authors themselves do this when using imprinting vs. within-subtype imprinting).</p><p>2. The authors state that HA group-level responses, which I assume includes the stem, are not thought to play a strong role in defense against familiar strains, however, a recent article by Ng et. al demonstrated that anti-HA stem antibodies are an independent correlate of protection.</p><p>3. Throughout the manuscript the authors refer to &#x0201c;infections&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;infecting&#x0201d; but they are looking at reported cases, not infections.</p><p>4. The authors suggest that imprinting may be a result of CD4 T-cells (as one possibility). Is there any evidence for this?</p><p>5. The authors use a case series. Did the population structure of Arizona change substantially over the time period? If so, they should adjust for the changes in the demographics.</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
