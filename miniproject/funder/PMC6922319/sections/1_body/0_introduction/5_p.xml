<p>Different breadths of immunity are expected to act differently on influenza epidemiology. Within-subtype immunity to HA is known to shape seasonal influenzaâ€™s epidemiology and evolution [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but due to rapid decay in the face of antigenic drift, it would not be expected to shape cohort-specific imprinting protection across an entire human lifetime [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Conversely, broad, HA group-level immune memory arises when lymphocytes target conserved HA epitopes. Responses to these conserved epitopes should be more stable over time, and can play a strong role in defense against unfamiliar influenza strains (e.g. novel, avian or pandemic subtypes [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but are not traditionally though to act strongly against familiar, seasonal influenza subtypes. However, responses to the conserved HA stem have recently been identified as an independent correlate of protection against seasonal influenza [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and might play a particularly strong role against drifted seasonal strains whose variable HA epitopes have become unrecognizable. Thus, childhood immune imprinting may determine which birth cohorts are primed for effective defense against seasonal strains with conserved HA epitopes characteristic of group 1 or group 2, or with variable HA epitopes characteristic of a particular subtype (H1, H2, etc.). A similar line of reasoning may apply to immunity against NA, although much less attention has been paid to this antigen.
