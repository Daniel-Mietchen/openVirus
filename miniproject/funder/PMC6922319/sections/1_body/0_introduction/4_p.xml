<p>Current thinking stipulates that within a single host, imprinting probably induces multiple levels of bias in immune memory, to both conserved (broadly protective) and variable (narrowly protective) sites on various influenza antigens. The functional role of any single layer of imprinted immune memory depends on both immunodominance hierarchies and epidemic context. Here, we examine which layers of imprinted memory impact risk from seasonal influenza.</p>
