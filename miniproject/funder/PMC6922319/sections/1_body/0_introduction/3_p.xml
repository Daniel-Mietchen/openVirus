<p>Until recently, narrow cross-protective immunity specific to variants of a single HA subtype has been considered the primary mode of defense against seasonal influenza. Lymphocyte memory of variable epitopes on the HA head (i.e. sites at which hemagglutinin antigens of different subtypes show limited homology) drives this narrow, within-subtype protection, which is the main mechanism of protection from the inactivated influenza vaccine. But a growing body of evidence shows protection may also be driven by memory of other influenza antigens (e.g. neuraminidase, NA) [

Only three HA subtypes have circulated seasonally in humans since 1918, H1, H2 and H3; H1 and H2 belong to phylogenetic group 1, while H3 is in group 2 [
