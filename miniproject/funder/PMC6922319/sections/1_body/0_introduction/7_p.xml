<p>We analyzed a large surveillance data set of relatively severe, clinically attended influenza cases to test whether cohort effects from childhood imprinting primarily act against variable epitopes, only providing narrow cross-protection against closely related HA or NA variants of the same subtype, or against more conserved epitopes, providing broad cross-protection across HA subtypes in the same phylogenetic group (

 </bold>). We fitted a suite of models to data using maximum likelihood and compared models using AIC. In a separate analysis, we considered the hypothesis that differences in evolutionary rate of H1N1 and H3N2, rather than imprinting effects, shape differences in age distribution. Our results have implications for long-term projections of seasonal influenza risk in elderly cohorts [
