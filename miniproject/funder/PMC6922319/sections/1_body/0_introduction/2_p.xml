<p>We define immune imprinting as a lifelong bias in immune memory of, and protection against, the strains encountered in childhood. Such biases most likely become entrenched as subsequent exposures back-boost existing memory responses, rather than stimulating de novo responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. By providing particularly robust protection against certain antigenic subtypes, or clades, imprinting can provide immunological benefits, but perhaps at the cost of equally strong protection against variants encountered later in life. For example, every modern influenza pandemic has spared certain birth cohorts, presumably due to cross-protective memory primed in childhood [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Imprinting may additionally shape birth year-specific risk from seasonal influenza [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the importance of broadly protective immunity in this context is still being evaluated [
