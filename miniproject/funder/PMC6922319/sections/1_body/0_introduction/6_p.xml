<p>Since 1977, two distinct subtypes of influenza A, H1N1 and H3N2, have circulated seasonally in humans, with striking but poorly understood differences in their age-specific impact [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These differences could be associated with childhood imprinting: older cohorts were almost certainly exposed to H1N1 in childhood (since it was the only subtype circulating in humans from 1918–1957), and now seem to be preferentially protected against modern seasonal H1N1 variants [

 </bold>), which is consistent with relatively low numbers of clinically attended H3N2 cases in these cohorts. Alternatively, differences in the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1 and H3N2 could explain the observed age profiles. Subtype H3N2 exhibits slightly faster drift in its antigenic phenotype than H1N1, and as a result, H3N2 may be better able to escape pre-existing immunity in immunologically experienced adults, whereas H1N1 may be relatively restricted to causing disease in immunologically inexperienced children [
