<p>Altogether, this analysis confirms that the epidemiological burden of H1N1 and H3N2 is shaped by cohort-specific differences in childhood imprinting [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The lack of support for broader, HA group-level imprinting effects emphasizes the consequences of immunodominance of influenzaâ€™s most variable epitopes, and the difficulty of deploying broadly protective memory B cell responses against familiar, seasonal strains. Overall, these findings advance our understanding of how antigenic seniority shapes cohort-specific risk during epidemics. The fact that elderly cohorts show relatively weak immune protection against H3N2, even after living through decades of seasonal exposure to or vaccination against H3N2, suggests that antibody responses acquired in adulthood do not provide the same strength or durability of immune protection as responses primed in childhood. Immunological experiments that consider multiple viral exposures, and cohort studies in which individual histories of influenza infection are tracked from birth, promise to illuminate how B cell and T cell memory develop across a series of early life exposures. In particular, these studies may provide clearer insights than epidemiological data into which influenza antigens, epitopes and immune effectors play the greatest role in immune imprinting, and how quickly subtype-specific biases become entrenched across the first or the first few exposures.
