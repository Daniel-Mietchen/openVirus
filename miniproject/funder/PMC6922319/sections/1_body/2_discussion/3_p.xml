<p>In model comparison, the data supported childhood imprinting to NA at the subtype level. Although NA is not as intensively studied as HA, these results emphasize the increasingly recognized importance of both antigens as drivers of protection against seasonal influenza [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Realistically, some combination of effects from both HA and NA subtype-level imprinting probably shapes seasonal influenza risk; both models of imprinting produced similar fits to data, and far outperformed other models in terms of AIC (

Unfortunately, due to the limited diversity of seasonal influenza subtypes that have circulated in humans over the past century, collinearities between even the relatively simple models tested here prevented us from testing more complicated models of combined effects from imprinting to multiple antigens. Deeper insights into the respective roles of HA and NA will most likely need to come from focused immunological cohort studies, in which individual histories of influenza infection are recorded and can be studied alongside changes in serology, PBMCs, and/or the B cell repertoire [
