<p>We analyzed a large epidemiological surveillance dataset and found that seasonal influenza subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 cause different age distributions of relatively severe, clinically attended cases, confirming previously reported patterns [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We analyzed several possible drivers of these differences systematically, and found the greatest support for imprinting protection against seasonal influenza viruses of the same NA or HA subtype as the first influenza strain encountered in childhood [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The data did not support strong effects from broader HA group-level imprinting, as recently detected for novel zoonotic or pandemic viruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], or from differences in rates of antigenic evolution [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results suggest individuals retain a lifelong bias in immune memory, and that this imprint is not erased even after decades of exposure to or vaccination against dissimilar influenza subtypes.
