<p>Signals of imprinting protection are anomalously strong in the current cohort of elderly adults, as reflected by higher estimates of imprinting protection to H1N1 than H3N2. The oldest subjects in our data, born slightly after 1918, and would not have encountered an influenza virus of any subtype other than H1N1 until roughly age 30. Repeated early-life exposures to diverse H1N1 variants may have reinforced and expanded the breadth of H1N1-specific immune memory [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. But this strong H1N1 protection seems to come at a cost; even after decades of seasonal H3N2 exposure, and vaccination, older cohorts have evidently failed to develop equally strong protection against H3N2. HA group 1 antigens (e.g. H1) appear to induce narrower immune responses, and less cross-group protection than structurally distinct HA group 2 antigens (e.g. H3) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Perhaps elderly cohorts imprinted to group 1 antigens have been trapped in narrower responses that offer exceptional protection against strains similar to that of first exposure but relatively poor adaptability to other subtypes.
