<p>The exact immunological drivers of imprinting protection against seasonal influenza remain unclear, but our results provide some new clues. Traditionally, within-subtype cross-protection is thought to decay quickly with antigenic drift. Strains that circulated more than 14 years apart rarely show measurable cross-protective titers by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where within-subtype immune memory imprinted in childhood appears to persist for an entire human lifetime, remaining evident even in the oldest cohorts. We speculate that within-subtype imprinting protection may involve epitopes that are more conserved, and stable over time, than those typically measured in HI assays. These inform most existing estimates of antigenic distance, but disproportionately measure antibodies to variable, immunodominant epitopes on the HA head [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Across a lifetime of exposures to diverse H1N1 and H3N2 variants, repeated back-boosting of antibodies to intermediately conserved sites on HA or NA (i.e. sites conserved within but not across HA and NA subtypes), could explain the longevity of subtype-level imprinting protection. This is consistent with recent evidence that the immune repertoire shifts to focus on more conserved influenza epitopes as we age [
