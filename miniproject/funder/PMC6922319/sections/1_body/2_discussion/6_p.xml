<p>Another possibility is that memory B cell clones developed during the first childhood influenza infection may later adapt via somatic hypermutation to follow antigenic targets as they drift over time. However, this would be inconsistent with new evidence suggesting memory B cells are relatively fixed in phenotype, and have little potential for ongoing affinity maturation [
