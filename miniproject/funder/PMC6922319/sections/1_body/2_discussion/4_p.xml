<p>We did not detect a clear relationship between annual antigenic advance and epidemic age distribution, although small sample sizes may have limited our statistical power. We did detect a weak trend, consistent with the idea that influenza cases are more restricted to immunologically inexperienced children in seasons of low antigenic advance, as previously proposed [

But the data did not reveal a clear relationship between antigenic advance and the fraction of cases occurring in adult age groups, where epidemiological data reveal distinct subtype-specific differences in impact. Perhaps antigenic advance shapes how cases are distributed between children and adults, but has small or inconsistent impacts within the adult population. We speculate that clearer relationships between antigenic advance and epidemic age distribution might emerge if methods to estimate antigenic distance were able to incorporate effects such as immune history [
