<p>Given the limited number of variables recorded in the data, we could not model explicitly the impact of individual risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities, patient sex, or vaccination status. All these factors are known to shape immunity and influenza risk [

Understanding how these patient-level covariates modulate imprinting and other aspects of immunity is the next frontier in this line of research. For now, working within the constraints of the available data, we designed the age-specific risk component of the model to capture empirically the combined effects of several risk factors that could not be modeled individually. Additionally, we analyzed the relative count of H1N1 to H3N2 cases within each single year of birth, not absolute incidence, to control for minor age-specific biases in sampling, which are almost inevitably present in any large surveillance data set.
