<p>Our study has several limitations. Relatively severe, clinically attended cases are much more likely to be detected, confirmed to subtype, and included in our data than mild cases. Thus, while our results show a clear relationship between subtype-level imprinting and risk of relatively severe, clinically attended influenza, the relationship between imprinting and mild or asymptomatic cases could not be determined from available data.</p>
