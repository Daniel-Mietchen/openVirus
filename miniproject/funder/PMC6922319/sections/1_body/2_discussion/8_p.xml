<p>We speculate that imprinting protection, which currently limits the number of severe, clinically-attended H1N1 cases in the elderly, also limits the mortality impact of H1N1 viruses. Although pre- and post- 2009 H1N1 lineages have caused slightly different profiles of age-specific mortality [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], neither H1N1 lineage causes nearly as many deaths as H3N2 in high-risk elderly cohorts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the one hand, if strong subtype-specific biases from imprinting remain in future cohorts of elderly adults, our results would corroborate the idea that mortality from H1N1 may increase as protection in the elderly shifts from H1N1 toward other subtypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, given that cohorts born after 1968 have had much more varied early life exposures to both H1N1 and H3N2, these cohorts may show a greater ability to act as immunological generalists as they become elderly, capable of effective defense against multiple subtypes.
