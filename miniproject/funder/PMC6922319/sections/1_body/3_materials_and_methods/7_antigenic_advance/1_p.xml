<p>We obtained antigenic distance estimates from Nextstrain (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nextstrain calculates antigenic distance using genetic data from GISAID [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and using methods described by Neher et al. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We analyzed “CTiter” estimates from Nextstrain, which correspond to Neher et al.’s tree model method, and are most directly comparable to pre-2009 H1N1 estimates from [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We repeated analyses using estimates from Neher et al.’s substitution model method and verified that our choice of antigenic distance metric did not meaningfully impact our results. The negative Spearman correlation between antigenic advance and proportion of cases in children was lower, but still not statistically significant when using the substitution model (p = 0.06); all other differences were unremarkable. Datasets from Nextstrain and Bedford et al. both contained redundant antigenic distance estimates for the H3N2 subtype, but for subtype H1N1, only Bedford et al. analyzed the pre-2009 lineage, and only Nextstrain data analyzed the post-2009 lineage. The antigenic distance estimates reported by Bedford et al. were roughly proportional to those reported on Nextstrain, but greater in absolute magnitude [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. To enable visualization of all lineages of H1N1 and H3N2 on the same plot axes, we rescaled pre-2009 H1N1 estimates from Bedford et al. using the formula d

 <sub>Bedford</sub>. The scaling factor was chosen so that directly-comparable H3N2 distance estimates obtained using each method spanned the same range (
