 </bold>, smoothing splines were fit to aid visual interpretation of noisy data. We fit splines using the command smooth.spline(x = AGE, y = FRACTIONS, spar = 0.8) in R version 3.5.0. Variables AGE and FRACTIONS were vectors whose entries represented single years of age, and the fraction of cases observed in the corresponding age group. The smoothing parameter 0.8 was chosen to provide a visually smooth fit. Alternative smoothing parameter choices (0.6 &amp; 1.0) are shown in
