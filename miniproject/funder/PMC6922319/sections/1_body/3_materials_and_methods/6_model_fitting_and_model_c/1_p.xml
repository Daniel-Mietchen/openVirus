<p>We fit models containing all possible combinations of the above factors to the surveillance data. We simultaneously estimated all free parameter values using the optim() function in R, with method L-BFGS-B. Imprinting parameters could take values in [0,1], representing the possibility of a reduction in risk. Age-specific risk parameters could take any value greater than 0. We calculated likelihood profiles and 95% profile confidence intervals for each free parameter. Confidence intervals were defined using the method of likelihood ratios [
