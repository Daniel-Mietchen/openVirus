<p>The population of Arizona aged slightly across the study period, so we controlled for shifting demography in all tested models. Demographic age distribution was obtained from intercensal estimates of total population (both sexes) for the state of Arizona, based on the 2000 and 2010 census [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The US Census Bureau reports population estimates for ages 0–84, but only provides an aggregate estimate for ages 85+. We impute the number of individuals in each single year of age over 85 using a linear model fit to data on age 75–84, with a minimum threshold of 1000 individuals per single year of age. State-specific population estimates were not available prior to the 2000 census, so we substituted estimates from the year 2000 for cases observed in the 1993–94, and the 1994–95 seasons. Vector D represented the fraction of the total population at the time of case observation that fell in a given birth year.
