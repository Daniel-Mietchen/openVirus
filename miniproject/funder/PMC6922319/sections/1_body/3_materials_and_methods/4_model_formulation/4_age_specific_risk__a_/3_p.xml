<p>To obtain the predicted fraction of cases observed in each single year of birth, we normalized so that the product of vectors representing demographic age distribution, and age-specific risk, (DA in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1008109.e001">Eq 1</xref>) summed to 1. Thus, vector DA can be interpreted as the expected distribution of cases of any influenza case (either subtype), in the absence of birth year-specific biases from imprinting.
