<p>Age-specific risk was defined as a step function, in which relative risk was fixed to value 1 in an arbitrarily chosen age bin, and then z-1 free parameters, denoted r
 <sub>2</sub> to r
 <sub>z</sub>, were fit to describe relative risk in all other age bins. Below, 
 <bold>1</bold>
 <sub>
  <bold>i</bold>
 </sub> are indicator functions specifying whether each vector entry is a member of age bin i.
