<p>Furthermore, if evolutionary rate is the dominant driver of subtype-specific differences in epidemic age distribution, then when subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 show similar degrees of annual antigenic advance, their age distributions of cases should appear more similar. However, the data showed that differences in H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts did not converge when lineages showed similar annual advance. When comparing the fraction of cases observed in specific age classes, H1N1 data consistently clustered separately from H3N2, with H1N1 consistently causing fewer cases at the extremes of age (children 0–10 and elderly adults 71–85), but more cases in middle-aged adults, regardless of antigenic novelty (

Overall, the data showed a weak, but not significant signal that relatively severe, clinically attended cases may be more restricted to young children when antigenic novelty is low, but the data did not show strong evidence that the magnitude of annual antigenic drift is a systematic driver of epidemic age distribution across the entire population.
