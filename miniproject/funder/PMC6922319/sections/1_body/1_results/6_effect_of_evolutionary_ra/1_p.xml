<p>To test for effects of evolutionary rate on epidemic age distribution, we searched for decreases in the proportion of cases among children in seasons associated with antigenic novelty, when highly drifted strains might be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults. We defined children as ages 0–10, and verified internally that our analysis of evolutionary rate was insensitive to our exact choice of age range for children. Consistent with this expectation, the data showed a slight negative but not significant association between annual antigenic advance and the fraction of H3N2 cases observed in children (

 </bold>). However, note that no clear relationship emerged between antigenic novelty and the fraction of cases observed in older children (&gt;10) and adults (

 </bold>). These are the cohorts in which epidemiological data show the clearest differences between H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts (

 </bold>); if rate of antigenic evolution is a dominant driver of age-specific differences in incidence, we would have expected to see clearer evidence of evolutionary rate effects among adults cohorts, not just between adults and the youngest children. The data contained too few influenza seasons with sufficient numbers of confirmed H1N1 cases to support meaningful Spearman correlation coefficients for either pre-2009 or post-2009 seasonal H1N1 lineages.
