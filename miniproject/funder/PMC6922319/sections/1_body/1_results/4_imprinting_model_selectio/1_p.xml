<p>The data showed a strong preference for NA subtype-level imprinting over HA subtype-level imprinting (ΔAIC = 34.54), and effectively no statistical support for broad, HA group-level imprinting (ΔAIC = 249.06), or for an absence of imprinting effects (ΔAIC = 385.42)

 </bold>) confirmed that models containing imprinting effects at the narrow, NA or HA subtype levels provided the best fits to data. The lack of support for the no-imprinting model suggests that imprinting is important, and shapes lifelong seasonal influenza risk, just as it does avian-origin influenza (10, 12). However, imprinting appears to act more narrowly against seasonal influenza than against avian influenza, providing cross protection only to a specific NA or HA subtype, instead of broader, HA group-level protection. This result is consistent with the idea that immunodominance of variable HA epitopes limits the breadth of immune cross protection deployed against familiar, seasonal influenza subtypes [
