<p>Although the exact collection setting of individual specimens was not always recorded, ADHS staff internally reviewed reporting source and provider organization of cases in our data to estimate that roughly 76% were reported and/or submitted by hospital labs or may have originated at hospital-associated outpatient clinics. In 2016, an ADHS analysis matched PCR-confirmed cases to hospital discharge data, and found that nearly half of the cases reported from hospital labs were severe enough to warrant hospital admission (if extrapolated to other seasons, roughly 38% of the overall data). The rest (also roughly 38% of the overall data, if extrapolated) were discharged without admission. To obtain a broader representation of clinically attended cases from across the state, ADHS collaborates with county health departments, commercial laboratories, and outpatient clinics to receive specimens. We estimate that roughly 8% of the overall data originated in outpatient settings. The remaining 17% of cases were either tested at commercial labs, or were tested at ASPHL, but with unknown origin. Ultimately, these data allow us to analyze drivers of relatively severe, clinically attended cases, but our results cannot be assumed to generalize to mild or asymptomatic cases.</p>
