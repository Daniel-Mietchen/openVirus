<p>The Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) provided a dataset containing 9,510 seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 cases from their statewide surveillance system (

 </bold>). Cases of all ages were confirmed to subtype by PCR and/or culture, primarily from virologic testing at the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory (ASPHL). The ADHS surveillance system aims to characterize circulating strains from patients across the state with medically attended influenza. Although surveillance does not target specific at-risk groups, relatively severe cases (especially those tested at hospital labs) are overrepresented in our data, as these cases are most likely to be medically attended and confirmed to subtype, thus meeting our study inclusion criteria. This is because confirmation to subtype requires a second-line test (PCR or culture); rapid tests are more common, but do not indicate subtype.
