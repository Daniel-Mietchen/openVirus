<p>Following CDC standards, ADHS defines the influenza season as epidemiological week 40 (around early October) through week 39 of the following year [

We did not analyze cases observed during this time period, because age distributions of cases and immune memory differed during the 2009 pandemic from the normal drivers of seasonal influenza’s immuno-epidemiology of interest to this study [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From the dataset of 9,510 seasonal cases (defined as any case observed outside the 2008–2009 or 2009–2010 season), we excluded 58 cases with birth years before 1918 (whose imprinting status could not be inferred unambiguously), and one case whose year of birth was recorded in error. Ultimately, we analyzed 9,541 cases.
