<p>We fit a set of four models to the ADHS data set. The simplest model contained only age-specific risk, and more complex models added effects from imprinting at the HA subtype level, at the HA group level, or at the NA subtype level. The age-specific risk curve took the form of a step function, in which relative risk was fixed to 1 in age bin 0–4, and one free parameter was fit to represent relative risk in each of the following 12 age bins: {5–10, 11–17, 18–24, 25–31, 32–38, 39–45, 46–52, 53–59, 60–66, 67–73, 74–80, 81+}. Within models that contained imprinting effects, the fraction of individuals in each single year of birth with protective childhood imprinting was assumed proportional to reductions in risk. Two additional free parameters quantified the relative risk of a confirmed H1N1 or H3N2 case, given imprinting protection against that seasonal subtype.</p>
