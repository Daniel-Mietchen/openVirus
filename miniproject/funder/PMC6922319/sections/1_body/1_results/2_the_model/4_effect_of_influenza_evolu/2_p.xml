<p>To assess the impact of antigenic evolution on the epidemic age distribution, we tested whether the proportion of cases in children increased in seasons associated with large antigenic changes. If the rate of antigenic drift is a strong driver of age-specific influenza risk, then the fraction of influenza cases observed in children should be negatively related to annual antigenic advance [

In other words, strains that have not changed much antigenically since the previous season should be unable to escape pre-existing immunity in immunologically experienced adults, and more restricted to causing cases in immunologically inexperienced children; strains that have changed substantially will be less restricted to children.
