<p>We reconstructed birth year-specific probabilities of childhood imprinting to H1N1, H2N2 or H3N2 using methods described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008109.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These probabilities are based on patterns of first childhood exposure to influenza A and reflect historical circulation (

Most individuals born between pandemics in 1918 and 1957 experienced a first influenza A virus (IAV) infection by H1N1, and middle-aged cohorts born between pandemics in 1957 and 1968 almost all were first infected by H2N2 (note that because the first influenza exposure may occur after the first year of life, individuals born in the years leading up to a pandemic have some probability of first infection by the new pandemic subtype,
