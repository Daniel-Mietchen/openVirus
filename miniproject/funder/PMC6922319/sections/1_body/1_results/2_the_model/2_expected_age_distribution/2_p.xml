<p>Our approach distinguishes between age-specific risk factors related to health and social behavior, and birth year-specific effects related to imprinting. Specifically, age-specific risk could be influenced by medical factors like age-specific vaccine coverage, age-specific risk of severe disease, age-related changes in endocrinology and immunosenescence, or by behavioral factors like age-assorted social mixing, and age-specific healthcare seeking behavior. These factors should have similar impacts on any influenza subtype. In contrast, imprinting effects are subtype- (or group-) specific. Thus, we fit a step function to characterize the shape of age-specific risk of any confirmed influenza case. Simultaneously, we modeled residual, subtype-specific differences in risk as a function of birth year, to focus on the possible role of childhood imprinting. Each tested model used a linear combination of age-specific risk (
