<p>To test quantitatively whether observed subtype-specific differences in incidence were most consistent with imprinting at the HA subtype, NA subtype or HA group level, or with no contribution of imprinting, we fitted a suite of models to each data set using a multinomial likelihood and then performed model selection using AIC. AIC is used to compare the relative strength of statistical support for a set of candidate models, each fitted to the same data, and favors parsimonious models that fit the data well [
