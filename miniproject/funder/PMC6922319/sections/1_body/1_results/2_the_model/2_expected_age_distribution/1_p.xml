<p>If HA subtype-level imprinting protection shapes seasonal influenza risk, primary exposure to HA subtype H1 or H3 in childhood should provide lifelong protection against modern variants of the same HA subtype. If imprinting protection acts primarily against specific NA subtypes, lifelong protection will be specific to N1 or to N2 (

 </bold>). Alternatively, if broad HA group-level imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk, then cohorts imprinted to HA subtype H1 or H2 (both group 1) should be protected against modern, seasonal H1N1 (also group 1), while only cohorts imprinted to H3 (group 2) would be protected against modern, seasonal H3N2 (also group 2) (
