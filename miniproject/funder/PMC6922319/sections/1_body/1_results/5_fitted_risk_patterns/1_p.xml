<p>Fitted age-specific risk curves took similar forms in all tested models. After controlling for demographic age distribution, estimated age-specific risk was highest in children and the elderly, consistent with the buildup of immune memory across childhood, and waning immune function in the aged (

 </bold>). Within the best model, estimated reductions in relative risk from childhood imprinting were stronger for H1N1 (0.34, 95% CI 0.29–0.42) than for H3N2 (0.71, 95% CI 0.62–0.82). In the second-best model, HA subtype-specific imprinting, estimated reductions in H3N2 risk were particularly weak, and the confidence interval overlapped the null value of 1.
