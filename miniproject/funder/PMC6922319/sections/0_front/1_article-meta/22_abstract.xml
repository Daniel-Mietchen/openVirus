 <p>Influenza viruses of subtype H1N1 and H3N2 both cause seasonal epidemics in humans, but with different age-specific impacts. H3N2 causes a greater proportion of cases in older adults than H1N1, and more deaths overall. People tend to gain the strongest immune memory of influenza viruses encountered in childhood, and so differences in H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts may reflect that individuals born in different eras of influenza circulation have been imprinted with different immunological risk profiles. Another idea is that H3N2 may be more able to infect immunologically experienced adults because it evolves slightly faster than H1N1 and can more quickly escape immune memory. We analyzed a large epidemiological data set and found that birth year-specific differences in childhood immune imprinting, not differences in evolutionary rate, explain differences in H1N1 and H3N2’s age-specific impacts. These results can help epidemiologists understand how epidemic risk from specific influenza subtypes is distributed across the population and predict how population risk may shift as differently imprinted birth years grow older. Further, these results provide immunological clues to which facets of immune memory become biased in childhood, and then later play a strong role in protection during seasonal influenza epidemics.</p>
