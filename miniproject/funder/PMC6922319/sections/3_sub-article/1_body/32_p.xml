<p>Reviewer #1: The goal of this paper was to assess how childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology. The authors use large epidemiological surveillance data to test whether this immune imprinting acts primarily by immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immunity that protects again various subtypes. The authors show that within subtype imprinting has the strongest impact on seasonal influenza risk and that antibody responses acquired later in life do not have the same impact on long-term immunity as early-life influenza responses. This is a well-written manuscript with important implications. My specific comments are below:</p>
