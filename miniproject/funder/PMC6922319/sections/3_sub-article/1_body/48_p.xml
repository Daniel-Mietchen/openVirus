<p>Reviewer #2: While the discussion raises many important points, it is very long and would benefit from being compressed while still retaining the major points being made. Although outside of the scope of the current paper (and analyzed dataset), a future study performing similar analysis on a cohort on which serum/PBMCs could also be analyzed would provide significant insight on the immunologic mechanisms underlying the described findings.</p>
