<p>Although the authors investigate how age can impact imprinting responses, they do not provide the sex of the individuals in their study, nor do they account for sex in their analyses. Previous work has shown that sex can impact influenza responses in human and animal models, and it is important that in this type of epidemiological study, host factors, including sex, are included. Further, although I recognize it is difficult to access human data over the life course, it would be important to know more about the patients included in the analysis and if any patients had co-morbidities that may have influenced their responses both early on and later in life. With increasing age, susceptibility to infection increases; antibody responses and vaccine efficacy decrease; and sex hormones decrease. These immunological and endocrinological changes are important to account for when assessing how age and year of birth may impact responses to influenza.</p>
