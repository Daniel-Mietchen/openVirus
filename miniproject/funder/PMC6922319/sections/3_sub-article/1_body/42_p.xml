<p>Reviewer #3: 1. This manuscript relies completely on influenza surveillance data, however, no detail is provided on the surveillance system. In particular, typically state surveillance systems are designed in such a way that they target specific at-risk populations. Thus, the data is collected in an intentionally biased way and does not represent what is happening at a population level, but rather maximizes the cases identified. For instance, sentinel surveillance systems tend to have over-representation of pediatric offices to catch non-severe cases, outbreaks tend to be investigated (and reported on) in old age homes, and hospital surveillance may be more heavily done in specific adult hospitals. In addition, the design of the surveillance system may change over time. If severity patterns differ by virus, which is likely, and surveillance setting differs by age (which is also likely, but I am unfamiliar with surveillance in Arizona), then bias could be introduced into the models. The authors should report on the design of the surveillance system in the methods section including any changes over the study period and, most importantly, on how the design of the surveillance system may have impacted their results.</p>
