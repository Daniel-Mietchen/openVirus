<p>The authors include “children” from 0 to 10 years of age. Have the authors thought about the fact that individuals within that large range may have varying degrees of imprinting and also exhibit vastly different immune responses (e.g., a 6-month old child will elicit different responses from a 10 year old). It would be helpful if the authors address this idea and suggest how they controlled for this in the current study.</p>
