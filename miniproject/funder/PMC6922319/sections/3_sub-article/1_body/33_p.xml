<p>Reviewer #2: Overall this is a very insightful manuscript that describes the role of early life influenza exposures in protection against currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. This is a topic of great importance and the manuscript itself is well written with clearly presented data. The authors have published a previous paper examining how early life influenza exposures provide some degree of protection against potentially pandemic influenza strains. However, as humans are repeatedly exposed to seasonal influenza via both vaccination and infection, the protection afforded against circulating strains via imprinting could be vastly different. Indeed, the authors do find early life influenza exposures are able to imprint immunity and provide significant but only subtype-specific protection against future infections into adulthood and beyond. Further, a novel role for the NA protein in imprinting is described. Overall this paper represents an important contribution to the field and the data appear to support the conclusions being drawn.</p>
