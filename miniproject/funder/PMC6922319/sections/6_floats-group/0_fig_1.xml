  <title>Model and expectations under different imprinting hypotheses.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Reconstructed, birth year-specific probabilities of imprinting (representative example specific to cases observed in 2015). Throughout the manuscript, group 1 HA subtypes are represented in blue and group 2 subtypes in red. 
   <bold>(B</bold>) Expected imprinting protection against H1N1 or H3N2 under the three tested models. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cartoon of expected age distribution of any influenza case, before controlling for subtype-specific imprinting. The shape of this curve is purely hypothetical, but each of our tested models combined demographic age distribution with a fitted, age-specific risk step function to generate similar, data-driven curves. (
   <bold>D</bold>-
   <bold>F)</bold> Fraction of each birth year unprotected by their childhood imprinting (from A) determines the shape of birth year-specific risk. (
   <bold>G-I)</bold> A linear combination of demography plus age-specific risk (as in C), and birth year-specific risk (as in D-F) give the expected age distribution of H1N1 or H3N2 cases under each model.
