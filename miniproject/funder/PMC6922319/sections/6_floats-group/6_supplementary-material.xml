   </bold> showing observed age distributions from all influenza seasons. Observed case fractions (points) were only plotted if 10 or more cases of a given subtype were confirmed, to avoid extreme stretching of the y axis. Smoothing splines were only plotted if 50 or more cases of a given subtype were observed, as fits to fewer data points would not have been meaningful.
