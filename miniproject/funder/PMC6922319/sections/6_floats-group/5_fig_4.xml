  <title>Effect of antigenic advance on age distribution.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Relationship between annual antigenic advance and the fraction of cases observed in children (0â€“10), or in adult age groups. Each data point represents a single influenza season in which at least 100 confirmed cases of a given subtype were observed. Blue label shows Spearman correlation between the fraction of H3N2 cases observed in each age group and annual antigenic advance. Blue dashes show linear trend fitted using lm() in R. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Season-specific age distributions of cases, colored by antigenic advance since the previous season.
