<p>Consenting educators were tested for HIV using DBS. A blood specimen was obtained using a finger-prick method, by spotting a maximum of five circles onto a Whatman grade 903 Guthrie card and sent to the laboratory for HIV testing. The VironostiKa HIV Uniform II Ag/Ab assay (EIA 1) and Roche Elecys HIV 1 Ag/Ab assay (EIA 2), was used to test for HIV antibodies. All specimens were tested using EIA 1 and those that tested positive using EIA 1 were re-tested using EIA 2. For quality assurance purposes 10 percent of the samples that tested HIV-negative using EIA 1 were re-tested using EIA 2. Any samples producing discordant results with the first two EIAs were submitted to a nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) (EIA 3) for final interpretation of discordant samples [
