<p>Frequency distribution and percentages were used to summarize the distribution of each NCD and the presence of one or all NCDs was reported by background characteristics of study participants. Pearson chi-square test was used to compare proportional differences in the presence of NCDs by background characteristics. A multivariate logistic regression model using backward stepwise selection method was fitted to determine factors associated with the presence of selected NCDs among HIV positive educators. Probability for removal of variables in the model was set at a p-value of 0.20. Adjusted Odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported, and p-values â‰¤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Coefficient plots were used to display the results of the final model. All data were analysed using STATA 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>
