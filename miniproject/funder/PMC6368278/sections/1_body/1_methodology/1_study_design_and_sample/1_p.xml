 <xref rid="pone.0209756.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The survey followed a cross-sectional approach employing second-generation surveillance methods that combined collection of socio-demographic, behavioural data and a blood specimen using a Dried Blood Spot (DBS) collection. The Education Management Information System (EMIS) Master List of educators from the Department of Basic Education (DBE) for 2012 was used as the sampling frame to identify the schools and number of educators at each school. This comprised 25,179 schools with 389,044 educators. HIV prevalence among educators in South Africa was estimated at 12.7% [

Assuming an HIV testing response rate of 73%, a minimum sample size of 27,869 educators was estimated to be sufficient to enable the detection of a minimum of 5% change in HIV prevalence in each reporting domain with 80% power at 5% level of significance and assuming a design effect of two due to potential clustering at school level [
