 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209756.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the results of the multivariate stepwise backward logistic regression model between the presence of selected NCDs and explanatory variables. The increased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with being female than male [aOR = 1.5: 95% CI (1.1–1.9), p&lt;0.002], age 45 to 54 years [aOR = 1.8: 95% CI (1.4–2.2), p&lt;0.001], and 55 years and older than those 18 to 24 years old [aOR = 2.7: 95% CI (1.8–3.9), p&lt;0.001). While the decreased odds of reporting the presence of NCDs was significantly associated with not being absent from school for health reasons [aOR = 0.7: 95% CI (0.6–0.9), p = 0.003].
