<p>The prevalence NCDs may be underestimated by self-reporting and not considering other NCDs. Furthermore, it have would have been better to consider each NCD as a single outcome and not combined them. However, we were also limited by the small numbers hence the pooled analysis. There may also be other potential unmeasured risk factors and / or confounders that were not taken into account in this analysis. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the survey does not allow for proper inference of the causality between NCDs and explanatory variables in the context of HIV among educators. Nevertheless, this study provides the evidence base on the prevalence of NCDs and their associated risk factors among HIV positive educators using a nationally representative sample. This is useful in planning and rolling out the NCDs active screening as an integral part of the HIV programmes including interventions such as prevention, treatment and care amongst public school educators in SA.</p>
