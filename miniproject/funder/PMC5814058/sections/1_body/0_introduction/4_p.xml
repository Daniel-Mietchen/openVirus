<p>Seasonal influenza generates a large burden each year during the wintertime in temperate regions and with more complex seasonal patterns in tropical regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Influenza pandemics frequently occur outside of the usual season and generate an unpredictable and often large burden in morbidity, mortality, and cost [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This burden has historically been the result of secondary bacterial infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Lung specimens from 1918 to 1919 influenza fatalities were found to be, in more than 90% of cases, positive for at least one bacterium [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series also suggest that deaths from the 1918 influenza pandemic mostly resulted from pneumonia with

 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, multiple infections being common [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Deaths during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics were less closely related to bacterial pneumonia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because emergence and circulation of pandemic influenza take place out of season, and therefore in different climatic and ecological milieus than seasonal strains, pandemic strains may encounter different coinfecting pathogens. It is therefore critically important to pandemic preparedness to understand competitive and synergistic relationships with other species, both at the individual level from a clinical perspective or at a population level from an epidemiological perspective. It is vital to improve our understanding and control of transmission and the risk of developing disease on infection.
