<p>The authors of relatively recent literature reviews gathered biological and epidemiological evidence for interactions between influenza virus and respiratory bacteria or viruses [

Mathematical models make it possible to investigate mechanisms of interaction and visualize the pathological and epidemiological patterns that result from them. Comparison of model outputs to data enables estimation of both the probability of such interactions and the strength of the interaction. Estimation can be made across geographic regions (e.g., winter seasonal vs year-round transmission), for different virus subtypes (e.g., seasonal vs pandemic), and in different age groups (e.g., infants vs elderly). Computational and mathematical models to study influenza with other respiratory pathogens are currently underutilized.
