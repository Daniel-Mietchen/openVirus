<p>In terms of public health, our current understanding of influenza transmission or severity may therefore be incomplete or misguided due to ignorance of the effect of interacting pathogens. On one hand, large-scale influenza vaccination programs may unexpectedly impact other infections due to an indirect rise or fall in the risk of contracting them [

For example, if influenza outcompetes another virus and holds it at bay, an influenza vaccination program could result in an upsurge in the competitor. On the other hand, the introduction of measures to control bacterial infections (e.g., pneumococcal vaccines) may decrease the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia often associated with severe outcomes of influenza.
