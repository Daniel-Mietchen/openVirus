<p>In this article, we report evidence of interaction of influenza with other pathogens and systematically review modelling studies on influenza coinfection. Our aim is to build a case for a more expansive use of mathematical models including influenza with other pathogens. For this, we address how different interference mechanisms might lead to unexpected epidemiological patterns and misinterpretations, identify public health needs, identify modelling and biological challenges, and propose avenues of research for the future.</p>
