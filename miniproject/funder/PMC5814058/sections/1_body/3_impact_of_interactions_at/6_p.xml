<p>For these reasons, public health interventions based on modelling of infectious diseases have become informative and effective. For example, in the UK, a transmission model fitted to a vast range of ILI and influenza surveillance data demonstrated that vaccinating children against influenza will have the same protective effect on people over 65 years old as vaccinating those individuals [
