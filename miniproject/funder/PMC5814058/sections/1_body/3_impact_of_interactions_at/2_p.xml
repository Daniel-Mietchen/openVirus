<p>Development and implementation of public health policies rely on analyses of population surveillance data on influenza epidemics and burden. Policies then generate changes in medical interventions at the population level, e.g., change in vaccination targets, or at the individual level, e.g., recommendations for antibiotics or antivirals in certain groups. These public health interventions then have their own impacts on the dynamics of pathogens and coinfections. Therefore, because coinfections may alter surveillance data, and policies based on evidence from surveillance data may alter coinfection or interference risk, there is a complex cycle of dependence, which highlights the difficulty—as well as the potential importance—of assessing the impact of coinfections (
