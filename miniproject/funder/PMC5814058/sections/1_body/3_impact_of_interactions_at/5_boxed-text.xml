  <p>
   <bold>Mathematical</bold> versus 
   <bold>statistical models</bold>: A 
   <bold>mathematical model</bold> (or 
   <bold>transmission</bold> or 
   <bold>mechanistic model</bold>) is a mechanistic description by mathematical equations of how the number of infected entities changes over time. For example, a mathematical model of transmission between people might explicitly track the number of infected people and describe how many contacts they make, how often these contacts lead to transmission, and how this is affected by temperature. Depending on the scale of the model, entities can be cells, individuals, or groups of individuals (e.g., a household, a city). 
   <bold>Statistical models</bold> do not include a mechanistic link between quantities but only rely on an observed association, often in the form of a probability distribution. So, in the case of the statistical model, you might say that you see more cases when the temperature is low, without explicitly explaining why.

  <p>
   <bold>Individual-based model</bold> versus 
   <bold>compartmental models</bold>: 
   <bold>Individual-based models</bold> (or 
   <bold>agent-based models</bold>) include a description of the properties (e.g., age, immune status, risk factors) of each of the individuals in the studied population. In contrast, 
   <bold>compartmental models</bold> group individuals with similar characteristics together into compartments and look at relationships between these compartments. The most famous compartmental in epidemiology is the SIR model, based on three compartments, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered, which is the basis of most of the existing models of pathogen transmission. Compartmental models are easier to fit to data (see next section) and interpret. Individual-based models are more flexible when it is important to integrate a wide range of characteristics of the population but are comparatively slow to implement and run, more difficult to interpret, and require good data on each characteristic that is modelled.

  <p>
   <bold>Model fitting</bold>: Models are built around a structure (the mechanisms), which is modulated by parameters governing the rates of change between compartments, disease states, behaviours, etc. Historically, parameters have been estimated using results from studies published in the literature. In recent years, with the increased availability of epidemiological data, modelers try whenever possible to fit the model to data (also called 
   <bold>parameter inference</bold> or 
   <bold>calibration</bold>). For this, they use algorithms that explore ‘parameter space’, which is the set of all possible values for parameters, and retain sets of parameters that explain the observed data best. Fitting can be computationally intensive if the model includes many parameters. More efficient fitting algorithms allow fitting of more complex models and thus the study of potentially more interaction mechanisms.
