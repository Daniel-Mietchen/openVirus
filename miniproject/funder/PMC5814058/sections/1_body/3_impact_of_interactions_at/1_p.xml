<p>Although coinfections occur at the host level, their consequences are far-reaching (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006770.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Coinfection may alter the natural history, severity, or timing of illness in an individual and thereby modify the morbidity, healthcare-seeking behaviour, and treatment of that individual. Heterogeneity in these can affect the probability of, and timing of, reporting disease, thereby transferring the effect from individual hosts to the population level.
