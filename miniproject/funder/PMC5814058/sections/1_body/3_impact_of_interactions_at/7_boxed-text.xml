       <p>For example, using models to analyse the cellular dynamics observed in vivo in mouse coinfection experiments, it is possible to design models of hypothesised immunological pathways and determine which most closely fits observed patterns [

       <p>For example, year-to-year influenza epidemics have a different estimated reporting fraction. A model could be used to determine whether coinfection or concurrent epidemics of other viruses are the reason for an increased (or decreased) probability of reporting infection.</p>

       <p>For example, fitting multipathogen models to respiratory virus surveillance data would allow quantitative assessment of the hypothesis that during the 2009 pandemic, influenza affected the timing of rhinovirus, RSV, and influenza by competition [

       <p>For example, a model of influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia could determine optimal target groups for pneumococcal vaccination, based on both the bacterial carriage rates in each age group and the expected influenza vaccination rates in those age groups.</p>

       <p>For example, a model-based analysis of in vitro experimental data could allow assessment of the impact of early antiviral or antibiotic treatment on probability of pneumococcal invasion [
