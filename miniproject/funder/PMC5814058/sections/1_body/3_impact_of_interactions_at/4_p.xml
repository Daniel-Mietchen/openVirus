The role of modelling is two-fold: first, mathematical modelling provides a common language to integrate heterogeneous mechanisms and test competitive hypotheses. By doing so, models contribute to building basic knowledge about infection processes. Second, modelling enables assessment of potential intervention scenarios by predicting their impact.
