<p>Here, ‘interaction’ refers to any process by which infection caused by one pathogen affects the probability, timing, or natural history of infection by another. This process includes a wide range of mechanisms that can involve direct connections between the two pathogens, e.g., at the cellular level, or indirect interactions through an intermediate factor that influences the other. The indirect consequences of these interactions are described later. For influenza virus, interactions with bacterial or viral species can occur at several scales (

Interacting pathogens may have two distinct profiles: natural human commensals—usually bacteria—which cause mainly asymptomatic carriage or mild symptoms often for long durations of weeks to months, or epidemic pathogens causing infection for shorter durations, from a few days to a few weeks. These two distinct epidemic profiles potentially involve different modes of interaction and lead to different levels of consequences. Here, we detail proven and potential interaction mechanisms (
