<p>Human behavioural responses to influenza infection can also indirectly impact transmission of bacteria or other viruses. For example, people with severe influenza symptoms are likely to stay home, modifying their contact patterns and making acquisition of second infections unlikely [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. On the other hand, individuals with milder symptoms may maintain their regular activities, which could increase bacterial transmission to other individuals (as observed for tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]) or increase the chance of acquiring a second infection. Person-to-person variation in care seeking and medication use, such as antivirals, antibiotics, antipyretics, or vaccine(s) uptake, also influences the risk of coinfection. For example, use of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has decreased carriage of the pneumococcal vaccine strains in some contexts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These vaccination campaigns may therefore decrease the chance of observing influenzaâ€“bacteria coinfections.
