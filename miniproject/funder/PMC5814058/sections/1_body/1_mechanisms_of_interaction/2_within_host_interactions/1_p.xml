<p>At the cellular level, interactions involve both direct and indirect mechanisms. First, influenza genes or gene products can enhance or inhibit the replication of other viruses or potential infection by bacteria by direct interaction with pathogen proteins or nucleic acids [

Furthermore, indirect competition for host resources can occur, when pathogens compete for target cells, receptors, or cellular products required for replication. Influenza-infected cells may also release cell signalling molecules that could increase or decrease the probability of coinfection.
