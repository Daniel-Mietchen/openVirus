<p>During infection, influenza virus impairs innate and adaptive host defences [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Mechanisms include altered neutrophil recruitment and function, leading to defective bacterial clearance, diminished production of alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and inhibition of T cell–mediated immunity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Infection with a second virus could be modulated similarly, e.g., by the production of cross-reactive antibodies or cell-mediated immunity that prevents or facilitates this infection. Physiological changes induced by the host response to infection have consequences on other pathogens. For instance, lung tissue damage [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and the induction of type-1 interferon signalling were shown to promote bacterial colonization [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and broadly inhibit viral replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Damage to lung cells caused by influenza infection, such as influenza neuraminidase stripping sialic acids from the cell surface, amplifies bacterial adherence and invasion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and could potentially change the likelihood of infection by another virus. Symptomatic responses to infection, like fever, have also been shown to act as ‘danger signals’ for bacteria, e.g., meningococci, which react by enhancing bacterial defences against human immune cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In contrast, fever may diminish viral replication rate, thereby lowering the probability of coinfection. From the other side, the ‘influenza preinfection’ respiratory flora of individuals may also partially account for the variability of severity and outcome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> colonization was shown to trigger viral load rebounds and reduce influenza virus clearance in animal studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
