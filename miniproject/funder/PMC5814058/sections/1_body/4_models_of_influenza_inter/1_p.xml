<p>Despite mounting evidence of influenzaâ€“bacteria interactions and the concurrent increasing use of dynamic modelling to study infectious diseases in recent decades, influenza interactions have rarely been modelled. Interestingly, previous literature reviews describing evidence of interactions between influenza virus and other respiratory bacterial or viral pathogens neglected mathematical models that, despite their limited number, provide insight into mechanisms of interaction and their consequences [
