<p>To demonstrate how both synergistic and competitive interactions can be modelled, we used a simple transmission model and simulated the effect of interactions (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006770.s003">S1 Appendix</xref>, section B). We show how these interactions occurring at the individual level can impact the epidemics at the population level. The ‘bacterial type’ interaction firstly shows an increase in bacterial prevalence when influenza infection increases bacterial transmission, in a facilitative interaction. In a synergistic interaction, where coinfection increases transmission of both influenza and bacteria, prevalence of bacteria increases, and the epidemic of influenza has a quicker and higher peak. In the ‘viral type’ competitive interaction, progressively decreasing the probability that a second pathogen can infect an already infected host causes the epidemic peaks to separate in time. It also decreases the peak size of the outcompeted pathogen without altering the number of people infected in total (
