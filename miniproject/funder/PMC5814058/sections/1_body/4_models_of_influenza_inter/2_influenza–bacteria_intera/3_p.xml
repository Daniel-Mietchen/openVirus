<p>At the population level, there have been several models to assess influenza interactions with bacteria and test hypotheses regarding the main mechanisms [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The comparison of pneumococcal transmission models to analyse time series of pneumococcal meningitis and viral respiratory infections in France highlighted two important processes in colonized individuals: (1) a virus-related increase in pneumococcal pathogenicity and (2) an enhanced between-individual transmissibility of bacteria [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Models of transmission of bacterial pneumonia fitted to US data also highlighted significant interactions, mainly due to influenza-associated increase of individual risk of pneumonia [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Recently, in a simulation study, Arduin et al. used a flexible individual-based model of influenza–bacteria interaction to assess the population consequences and associated burden of a range of pneumococcus–influenza interaction mechanisms [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Different strategies of antibiotic use (as treatment or prophylaxis) and of vaccination were assessed by modelling the dual transmission of pneumococcus and influenza [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. For a 1918-like pandemic, this model suggested that widespread antibiotic treatment of individuals with pneumonia would significantly lower mortality, whereas antibiotics in prophylaxis would effectively prevent pneumonia cases. A different model evaluated the benefit of vaccinating the UK population against pneumococcus in the context of pandemic influenza using different scenarios: 1918-like, 1957/1968-like, or 2009-like virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This indicated that pneumococcal vaccination would have a major impact only for a pandemic with high case fatality and secondary pneumococcal infection rates (e.g., the 1918-like), with less influence in other scenarios.
