<p>Several dynamic models of coinfection at the cellular level were proposed relatively recently [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In a study combining modelling and empirical data from mice coinfected with two different influenza viruses and two pneumococcus strains, Smith et al. assessed the likelihood of different immunological interaction mechanisms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. They found a role of macrophage dysfunction leading to an increase of bacterial titres and increased virus release during coinfections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], although their results suggest that coinfection-induced increase of bacterial adherence and of infected cell death were not very likely. Shrestha et al. used an immune-mediated model of the virus–bacterium interaction in the lungs to specifically quantify interaction timing and intensity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. They assumed that the efficiency of alveolar macrophages, which are a critical component of host immunity against bacterial infections, was reduced by viral infection and tested the impact of inoculum size, time of bacterial invasion after influenza infection, and the potential impact of antiviral administration. The model predicted that enhanced susceptibility to invasion would be observed four to six days after influenza infection, suggesting that early antiviral administration after influenza infection (&lt;4 days) could prevent invasive pneumococcal disease. Smith and Smith modelled a nonlinear initial dose threshold, below which bacteria (pneumococcus) declined and above which bacteria increased. Using data from mice experiments, they showed that this threshold was dependent on the degree of virus-induced depletion of alveolar macrophages. Because macrophage depletion varies through the course of influenza infection, this important finding may explain why risk of bacterial invasion also changes over the course of infection, with particularly low dose requirement in the first few days of infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In a follow-up study, the same authors analysed published data from influenza–pneumococcus coinfected mice treated with antiviral, antibiotic, or immune modulatory agents. They found that antivirals are more efficient at preventing secondary infection when used in the first two days of influenza infection and also found an important benefit of immunotherapy, especially for low bacterial loads [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Lastly, in a within-host model, Boianelli and colleagues investigated the efficacy of different oseltamivir treatment regimens in influenza–pneumococcus coinfected individuals using parameters drawn from human and mouse studies. They found that increasing the dose of oseltamivir, but not duration of treatment, might increase both its antiviral and antibacterial efficacy [
