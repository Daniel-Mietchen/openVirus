<p>Population models have been used extensively to examine the dynamics of influenza and multistrain influenza systems (for a review see [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]) although many fewer studies examined multispecies systems. Because the influenza virus comprises two types, multiple subtypes, and potentially numerous strains of each, many viruses may be circulating at any given time, providing varying degrees of cross-protection after recovery and sometimes with complex dynamics of within-species strain replacement due to genetic drift or reassortment. There is evidence of competition between strains, with some models requiring short periods of heterologous immunity after infection to create the ladder-like phylodynamic structure of influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], although recent studies could capture this feature without this mechanism [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. One comprehensive early model tested four mechanisms of interaction between influenza types using data from Tecumseh, Michigan, but the data were insufficient to distinguish the mechanisms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Influenza–influenza models must also account for the complex immune history of hosts, related to which there is mounting evidence that the timing of an individual’s influenza encounters, and especially the first infection, shapes their future response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The methods for modelling influenza–influenza interactions should be extended into interactions with other viruses.
