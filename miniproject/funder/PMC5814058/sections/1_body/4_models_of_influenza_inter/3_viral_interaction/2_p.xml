<p>Within host, several models of multistrain influenza infections were proposed [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>], especially examining the interval before the secondary infection. One model of RSV–influenza interaction at the cellular level explored the hypothesis of the viruses interacting through competition for resources within the cell [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. This indirect competition was sufficient to explain the observed rate of virus replication. The model also explored how the speed of virus replication confers an advantage to the first infecting pathogen and determined the ‘head start’ on infection that the slower-replicating virus would require to maintain dominance.
