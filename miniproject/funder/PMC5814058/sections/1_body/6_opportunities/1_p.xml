<p>Considering influenza virus in its ecological context and its interactions as a cause of the associated morbidity and mortality should offer opportunities for prevention and treatment. In addition to influenza vaccines that (partially) protect against infection, antibacterial vaccines are also critical. For example, pneumococcal vaccines have been shown to have good efficacy against influenza-associated nonbacteremic pneumonias [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine significantly lowered the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease and attributed mortality in the elderly [
