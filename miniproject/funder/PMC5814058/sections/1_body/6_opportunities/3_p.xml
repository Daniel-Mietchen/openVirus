<p>Lastly, accurate burden quantification is crucial to designing and implementing public health interventions against influenza. Focusing efforts to better understand these interactions is therefore critical, especially in the context of pandemic influenza but also to plan for seasonal epidemics, by forecasting the onset and peak times and estimating the expected burden. To improve our knowledge, models can be used to analyse available surveillance and experimental data, generate hypotheses regarding interaction mechanisms at play in transmission or infection, and test their likelihoods. Competing assumptions on the biological interaction processes can be assessed, and the strength of interactions can also be estimated. From a public health viewpoint, such models would help better estimate the burden of influenza virus interactions in terms of morbidity and mortality, the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and, critically, more accurately predict the real impact of control measures.</p>
