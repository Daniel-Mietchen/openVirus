<p>In addition, there may be opportunities for optimization of antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions. First, antibiotics have historically been used to prevent secondary infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance worldwide led to policies to decrease antibiotic consumption, focusing particular attention on reducing prescriptions for viral infections. Second, neuraminidase inhibitors were found to prevent some secondary bacterial pneumonias in animal experiments, human epidemiological studies, and mathematical modelling studies, beyond the window in which they directly impact the influenza viral load [
