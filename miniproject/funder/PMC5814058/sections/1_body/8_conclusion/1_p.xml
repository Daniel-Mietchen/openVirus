<p>In this study, we examined the epidemiological and biological evidence supporting influenza virus interference and interaction with other pathogens. We highlighted opportunities to improve knowledge and control of the virus, if we can move forward from the tunnel vision of single-pathogen models. It is time to develop a more holistic approach to pathogen dynamics in mathematical modelling, with novel methodological innovations, and further efforts in data collection and surveillance. The motivation to do so lies in the real opportunity to improve public health practices and create better, more cost-effective interventions against influenza.</p>
