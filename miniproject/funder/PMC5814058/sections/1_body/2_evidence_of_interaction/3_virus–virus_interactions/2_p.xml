<p>Many noninfluenza viruses are also suspected of interfering with influenza virus acquisition, based on different types of studies (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006770.t002">Table 2</xref>). During the 2009 influenza pandemic, Casalegno et al. reported that in France, the second pandemic wave was delayed due to the September rhinovirus epidemic [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], although this shift was not observed in other countries [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and may have been affected by variable reporting rates. Coinfection by the two viruses might also enhance disease severity for individuals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], although evidence is discordant [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similarly, competitive interaction with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been posited for many years [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and some evidence was found for delayed RSV epidemics due to the second wave of the 2009 pandemic in France [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] and tropical regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. There is discrepancy in the findings of interaction between influenza and RSV; while most studies found increased severity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], others found no effect [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and some found less severity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Competitive interaction with parainfluenza viruses was also inferred, based on less frequent coinfection pairs than expected [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], but that observation is not consistent across studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In terms of severity, parainfluenza and influenza coinfection is usually more severe than influenza alone [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] but not always [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].
