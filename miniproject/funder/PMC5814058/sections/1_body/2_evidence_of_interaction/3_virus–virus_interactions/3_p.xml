<p>The general pattern is that bacteria tend to synergize with influenza, often boosting transmission of either pathogen or increasing invasion of the bacteria following influenza infection. It is not always clear whether this is a true synergy—in which both pathogens benefit—or rather that influenza facilitates bacterial invasion. In contrast, viral pathogens tend to form competitive interactions with influenza, although whether these are direct, specific interactions with particular other viruses or the result of an ‘early advantage’ to the first infector remains unclear. This pattern may occur because of the differing natural histories of bacteria and viruses; while the former tends to infect hosts for long time periods, the latter has shorter infections more similar to the natural history of influenza itself. This is a complex system in which each host–pathogen or pathogen–pathogen interaction phenomenon may impact the others. Surprisingly, however, such interactions remain poorly studied and, in particular, very few modelling studies have addressed these questions.</p>
