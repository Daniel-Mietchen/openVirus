<p>Within its family, influenza interacts between types (A and B), subtypes (e.g., H3N2, H1N1), and strains. Competitive exclusion due to homologous immunity is widely accepted [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and has been applied extensively in models of influenza strain coexistence [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Antigenic change (measured through antigenic distance) occurs constantly in influenza, strongly indicating that the virus escapes from immunity resulting from prior infection by genetic change [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Interestingly, there is mounting evidence that the first influenza infection is important and may affect severity of future infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Some evidence also supports the finding that influenza can interact with other influenza viruses and noninfluenza respiratory viruses via nonspecific immunity following infection [
