<p>Mathematical models are crucial to guide public health decision makers, who, for ethical or cost reasons, cannot conduct large-scale trials. Two examples of interventions based on modelling results and mobilizing important public resources are pandemic preparedness (stockpiling of antivirals, use of vaccine doses) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Neglecting the cocirculating pathogens—i.e., adopting influenza tunnel vision—and the indirect impact of coinfections may potentially affect the estimation of the risk associated with influenza infection and, consequently, the accuracy of model predictions. Interaction strength may also change from year to year and depend on the circulating influenza strains. For evaluation of interventions, this neglect can lead to overestimation of the impact—if burden was measured without considering the changing landscape of coinfection in the population—or underestimation—if the effect of an intervention does not account for the potentially decreased burden of an interacting pathogen as a result of diminished influenza transmission. For all these reasons, we think that adopting a more holistic approach to modelling of respiratory pathogens will improve their surveillance and the strategy to control them.
