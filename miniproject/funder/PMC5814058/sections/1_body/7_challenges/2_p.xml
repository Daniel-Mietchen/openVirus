<p>Epidemiological data represent the second major challenge. To date, modelling studies have been limited by the poor knowledge of respiratory viruses and bacteria circulating in the community, especially because little is known about prevalence, incidence, at-risk populations, and even epidemic profiles in different populations. Deeper understanding of the ecology of the vast number of microorganisms that can contribute is needed. On an individual level, new studies are required to assess the effect of coinfections rather than ecological associations from incidence data. Important features include (i) coinfection-induced alteration of diseases’ natural histories, e.g., increased acquisition and severity risk, changes of infection durations and generation times; (ii) specific at-risk periods for secondary infection or invasion of the coinfecting pathogen, or at-risk periods for severe outcomes; and (iii) at-risk populations, as characterized by individuals’ age, comorbidities, or behavioural risk factors.</p>
