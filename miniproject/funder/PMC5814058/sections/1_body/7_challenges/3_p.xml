<p>For population-level data, in most countries, surveillance of influenza acquisition is based on networks of general practitioners who notify patients consulting for clinical symptoms of ILI [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] should be combined, and linked at the patient level, to better identify noninfluenza infections or anomalous epidemics that could signal interaction. Improvement of data quality in patient records and detection of the biases inherent in different types of surveillance data are critical to achieve this goal. The latter could be reached by developing new microbiological tools, including new sampling kits able to rapidly detect multiple pathogens for use during medical consultations.
