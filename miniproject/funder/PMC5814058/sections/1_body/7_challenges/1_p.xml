<p>Integrating transmission and infection by multiple pathogens into mathematical models poses several challenges. From a methodological perspective, modelling several pathogens with interrelated natural histories makes classical compartmental approaches more difficult. Individual-based frameworks (

Individual-based models are often more computationally intensive and can introduce new difficulties in terms of parameter estimation, requiring the design of new methods. Recent developments in statistical inference methods, like particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC) or maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006770.ref131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], now enable modelers to jointly fit complex population-based models to multiple types of data, thereby allowing more data and more diverse types of data to inform the model parameters.
