<p>Public health decision-making for interacting pathogens is a difficult but important challenge. When multiple competing treatment options are available, a coherent framework is needed to determine the best strategy. While the question goes beyond influenza to interactions and coinfections for respiratory viruses in general (e.g., RSV), influenza is one of the most studied viral infections and is therefore the ideal first candidate to develop a more holistic mathematical modelling approach.</p>
