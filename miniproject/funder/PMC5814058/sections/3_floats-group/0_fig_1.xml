  <title>Influenza interactions with other pathogens occur within host or at the population level.</title>
  <p>Each interaction could either inhibit or enhance coinfection, depending on the combination of pathogens. (A) Cellular-level interactions: (1) direct interactions between viral products; (2) altered receptor presentation; (3) cell damage, e.g., its surface receptors; (4) modification of release of immune system mediators; (5) competition for host resources among influenza and other pathogens. (B) Host-level interactions: (1) change of transmissibility due to symptoms; (2) individual variation in commensal microbiota; (3) effect of symptomatic responses to infection; (4) tissue damage, e.g., in the nasopharynx or lung; (5) competition for host resources, e.g., target cells for infection; (6) immune cell–mediated interaction; (7) immune signalling–mediated interaction; (8) antibody-mediated interaction. (C) Population-level interaction: (1) behavioural responses to disease; (2) medication use; (3) vaccination behaviour. Bacterial interaction mechanisms include A1–5, B1–4 and 7, C1–3. Viral interaction mechanisms include A1–2 and 4–5, B1–3 and 4–8, C1–3.</p>
