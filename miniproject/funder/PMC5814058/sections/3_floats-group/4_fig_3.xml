  <title>Illustration of a simple model of two circulating pathogens in interactions.</title>
  <p>Schematic of the compartments and rates of transition between compartments, with equations of the forces of infection by pathogen 1 (λ
   <sub>1</sub>), pathogen 2 (λ
   <sub>2</sub>) for susceptible hosts, and pathogen 1 (λ
   <sub>21</sub>) and pathogen 2 (λ
   <sub>12</sub>) for hosts already infected by the other pathogen. The full system of ordinary differential equations describing the changes of the compartment’s populations over time is described in
