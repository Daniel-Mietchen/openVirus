  <title>Cycle of factors affected by nonneutral interactions at the individual level and their impact on influenza surveillance, treatment, prevention, and control.</title>
  <p>Factors that affect coinfection on an individual scale can feed forward to an effect on population surveillance through their effects on the reporting of infection. Decisions on public health interventions are made in response to population-level data. These interventions then take effect at the individual level, to give a feedback loop both generated and impacted by effects of coinfection.</p>
