 <p>Influenza is responsible for major morbidity and mortality burdens worldwide. Mathematical models of influenza virus transmission have been critical to understanding the virus epidemiology and planning public health strategies for infection control. It is increasingly clear that microbes do not act in isolation but potentially interact within the host. Therefore, studying influenza alone may lead to misinterpretation of transmission or severity patterns. Here, we review the literature on bacteria and viruses that interact with influenza, proposed interaction mechanisms, and mathematical modelling studies that include interactions. We report evidence that, beyond the classic secondary bacterial infections, many pathogenic bacteria and viruses probably interact with influenza. Public health relevance of these pathogen interactions is detailed, showing how possible misreading or a narrow outlook could lead to mistaken public health decision-making. We describe the role of mechanistic transmission models in investigating this complex system and obtaining insight into interactions between influenza and other pathogens. Finally, we highlight the benefits and challenges in modelling and speculate on new opportunities made possible by taking a broader view, including basic science, clinically, and for public health.</p>
