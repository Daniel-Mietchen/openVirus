 <sup>th</sup> January 2018; all articles that could be accessed on these databases were considered for inclusion in the review. Search terms used to identify articles were: ((“Rift Valley Fever” OR “RVF”) AND (“prevalence” OR “incidence” OR “sero*”)). Broad search terms were purposefully used to maximise the chances of capturing all relevant research articles. Data extraction, screening and analysis was carried out by a single user (MC), with co-authors providing advice when required. An Excel spreadsheet was used to record data from eligible studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006627.s003">S1 Dataset</xref>). Data extracted included: (i) seroprevalence percentage (by species, year of study and country); (ii) sample size; (iii) type of study; (iv) diagnostic and statistical tests used and (v) information on study design.
