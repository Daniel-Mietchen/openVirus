<p>Where articles included multiple seroprevalence studies in different species or used different types of study design, each study was considered separately for the seroprevalence-specific analysis. However, articles reporting multiple seroprevalence studies did not account for bias or diagnostic tests for each study individually and, therefore, the analysis of these aspects was conducted by article. The epidemic period (outbreak/IEP) for each article were recorded; if a period wasnâ€™t stated it was classed as an IEP. Outbreak and inter-epidemic periods were classified according to description in each individual article. If the period was not stated it was classed as inter-epidemic period.</p>
