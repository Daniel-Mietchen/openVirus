<p>Over the last four decades there has been an increasing number of RVFV seroprevalence studies carried out in wildlife, livestock and humans in Africa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g003">Fig 3</xref>). There have been a number of RVFV outbreaks during the 2000s, which may have resulted in an increase in RVF awareness and resources for surveillance leading to an increase in seroprevalence studies during IEPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g003">Fig 3</xref>). There is, however, limited geographical coverage of RVFV studies: some countries in North and East Africa have not reported outbreaks or assessed seroprevalence (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g004">4</xref>). This is relevant from an epidemiological perspective since RVFV has been detected in other countries within these regions, thus increasing the likely risk of viral incursions through animal trade which has been implicated as the main route of virus dissemination in several outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The risk posed by animal trade also suggests that cross-border surveillance in both livestock and humans is required to add to the understanding and significance of this route for RVFV transmission.
