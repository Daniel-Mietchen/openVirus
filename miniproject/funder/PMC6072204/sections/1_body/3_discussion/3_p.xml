<p>The higher RVFV seroprevalences seen in animals compared to humans (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g005">Fig 5</xref>) may be a consequence of differing forces of infection (i.e. transmission only occuring as a spillover event in humans and thus risk of transmission is much lower). The significantly higher seroprevalence during outbreak years compared to interepidemic years seen in sheep and goats, but not in other species, is likely due to the faster population turnover in sheep and goats, which means there is a bigger pool of susceptibles to become infected between IEPs and outbreak periods. It has been suggested previously that wildlife species may act as reservoirs of the virus. The high RVFV seroprevalence recorded in wildlife during IEPs supports this statement and provides a basis that low level circulation may be taking place in these species [
