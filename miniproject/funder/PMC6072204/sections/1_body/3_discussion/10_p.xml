<p>The contradictory relationship with sex and the risk of seropositivity may reflect differences in local culture surrounding gender and animal handling/management practices. Understanding the social aspect of disease transmission could provide valuable information to disease spillover dynamics. The risk of seropositivity increased with age in both humans and livestock. This most likely reflects the increase probability of exposure with age rather than implying age-dependent susceptibility. Where the risk of seropositivity was found to differ significantly amongst livestock species, sheep were at increased risk in a number of studies, again presumably due to the high population turnover, and also differences in susceptibility or host immune response, vector host preference or animal management practices [
