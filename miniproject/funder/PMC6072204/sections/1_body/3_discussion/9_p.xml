<p>One third of articles included in this systematic review did not conduct any statistical analysis of the data they generated. This limits their usefulness in terms of both supporting evidence-based decision making and furthering the understanding of the disease. Other studies have identified risk factors associated with seropositivity to RVFV (Tables 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, the level of significance (e.g. cut off p-values) required for something to be deemed a risk factor varied across articles. Moreover, there were conflicting reports of statistical significance for risk factors amongst studies. This could be explained by: the heterogeneity of study design; the complex nature of different environments and the impact this has on the ability of the virus to transmit; the methodology of the operator conducting the diagnostic tests; or those that may have occurred by chance.
