<p>This review has highlighted the potential for bias in the designs of many RVFV seroprevalence studies, further complicating their interpretation. In many studies there was a lack of randomisation, recruitment criteria or insufficient sample sizes. Recruitment is important in understanding disease transmission in livestock, particularly with regard to animal trade histories and where animals have been exposed to the virus prior to the study (e.g. somewhere other than the study locations). Many studies omitted information on livestock characteristics such as age, sex and breed, all of which are factors that could influence interpretation of RVFV seroprevalence results. There is a need to improve study design reporting to provide validity, transparency and reproducibility. By implementing standardised methods, data can be objectively examined and compared [
