<p>The RVFV seroprevalence distributions visualised in the maps were pooled by country and decade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g001">Fig 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006627.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These maps provide an overview of seroprevalence on the African continent, showing the variation both between countries over the same time period and within countries over different time periods. However, it should be borne in mind that this could mask heterogeneity in seroprevalence within a country, which reflects processes at smaller geographical, spatio-temporal and epidemiological scales [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (for example within year variation of seroprevalence in Kenya due to sampling in different regions of the country). Pooling the wildlife species introduced a bias in itself, but this was done to provide a representation of what seroprevalence is seen in wildlife, particularly as little research has been done on this. This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] to provide a comprehensive unbiased overview and collection, although some articles may have been missed due to only including studies published in the English language (
