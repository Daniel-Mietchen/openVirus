<p>A number of risk factors for human RVFV seropositivity were associated with contact practices with livestock (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and further research on risk factors in livestock may indicate measures that could reduce spillover of infection into humans. A pragmatic approach would seek to understand virus maintenance, especially within the environment, vectors and wildlife populations to aid in targeting potential risk factors of RVFV seropositivity in livestock. RVFV-induced abortions are a recognised clinical sign of the disease in livestock and, recently, a study has found associations between miscarriages in women and infection with RVFV [
