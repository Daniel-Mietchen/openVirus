<p>This systematic review sought to highlight important trends and gaps in RVFV seroprevalence in Africa and address where the risk factors lie in cross-species transmission events. In particular, few studies to date have sampled humans, wildlife or livestock species concurrently. This demonstrates that future medical and veterinary research should adopt a “One Health” approach by performing concurrent livestock and human studies as well as assessing spillover events between wildlife and livestock. Understanding the epidemiology and immunology of RVFV in different species will aid targeting control measures such as vaccination to priority species [
