<p>The lack of seroprevalence studies in wildlife over the last decade suggests this is a neglected area of research. Such studies are essential for further understanding the role of wildlife in viral maintenance and potential spillover into livestock animals, particularly during outbreak periods. Indeed, to understand the impact of cross-species transmission, seroprevalence studies should ideally be conducted concurrently in livestock, wildlife and humans. This would allow the force of infection between species to be estimated and, hence, the relative importance of different species in the transmission dynamics of RVFV. Yet the results of this systematic review indicate that such studies are seldom carried out and, even when they are, the relevant linkage between the species are not recorded (
