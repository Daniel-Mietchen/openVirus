<p>A number of countries have conducted very few seroprevalence studies (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006627.s002">S2 Table</xref>) which makes it difficult to assess temporal trends. In those countries where more studies were conducted, temporal trends are indicitative of recurrent outbreaks (for example Comoros, Mayotte, Kenya, Senegal or Mauritania) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006627.s002">S2 Table</xref>). However, caution is warranted when identifying trends from a series of cross-sectional studies. For example, those studies in Mayotte were cross-sectional and undertaken in different districts of the country, and thus different environments, which may have an impact on viral maintenance, transmission, and, hence, seropositivity [
