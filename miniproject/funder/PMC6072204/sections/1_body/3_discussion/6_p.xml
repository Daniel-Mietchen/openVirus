<p>The true seroprevalence of RVFV is often uncertain due to three factors affecting interpretation of published seroprevalence studies. First, most studies do not provide enough information on the diagnostic tests used including their sensitivity and specificity. If this information is provided it is possible to estimate the true prevalence (i.e. allowing for false positive and false negative results) from the apparent prevalence [

 <italic>ID Screen</italic> RVFV competition multispecies ELISA (ID-Vet, Montpellier, France) used in many of the studies was validated by carrying out a ring trial, which demonstrated that the test has a high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (ranged from 91–100%) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. An inhibition ELISA was also commonly used which has been shown to provide 100% sensitivity, and 99.29% and 100% specificity in sheep and camels, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This suggests that for these tests there is a low probability of false positives or false negatives and, hence, the apparent prevalence will be a reasonable approximation of the true seroprevalence. However, reporting the diagnostic test used and its sensitivity and specificity would be a recommendation for future RVFV prevalence studies. Second, there are currently no commercial vaccines that are compliant with tests that are able to differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals (DIVA), meaning vaccinated animals will be classified as seropositive and, hence, the true seroprevalence could be overestimated. Thus vaccination history of recruited animals needs to be recorded in the study design. Third, antibody responses to RVFV infection are long lived with RVFV-specific antibodies having been reported in humans over 12 years after the only known exposure [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Consequently, serological assays are unable to confirm when exposure took place [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Two possible ways of assessing the level of recent infection would be through IgM ELISAs (IgM antibodies are short-lived for RVFV, which would be ideal for showing endemic virus circulation) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] or through use of RT-PCR to detect RVFV RNA [
