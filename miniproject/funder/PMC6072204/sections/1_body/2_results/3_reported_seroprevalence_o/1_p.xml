<p>The seroprevalence of RVFV varied geographically and temporally in livestock, wildlife and humans. These trends are summarised in Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006627.s002">S2 Table</xref>. Median RVFV seroprevalence was 12.9% in sheep (range 0–100%), 12.6% in cattle (range 0–100%); 11.3% in wildlife (range 0–87.5%), 10.1% in goats (range 0–69.6%); 8.8% in camels (range 0–57.1%) and 5.9% in humans (range 0–81.0%). The highest RVFV seroprevalence in livestock was identified in sheep and cattle in Egypt during an epizootic in 1997, where 100% of samples were seropositive (93 cattle and 57 sheep) (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. RVFV seroprevalence was significantly higher during outbreak periods compared to IEPs in goats (Wilcox rank sum test, outbreak median = 50%, IEP median = 9.40%, p = 0.001) and sheep (Wilcox rank sum test, outbreak median = 34.8%, IEP median = 12.9%, p = 0.01) but not in cattle, camels or humans (
