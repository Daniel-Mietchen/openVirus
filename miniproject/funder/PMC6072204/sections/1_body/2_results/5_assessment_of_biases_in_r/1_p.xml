<p>For seroprevalence records (n = 174), the majority of studies in the systematic review were cross-sectional (149/174 [85.6%]); 20/174 (11.5%) were longitudinal studies; 3/174 (1.7%) were case-control studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]; and 2/174 (1.1%) were cohort studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] accounted for all five potential sources of bias outlined by the STROBE statement (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] although the majority of articles did not specify the randomisation protocol (94/126 [74.6%]). History of vaccination status of livestock was not reported in 37/51 (72.5%) livestock seroprevalence eligible articles.
