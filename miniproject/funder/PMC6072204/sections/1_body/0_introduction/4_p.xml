<p>This review seeks to assess RVFV seroprevalence in wildlife, livestock and humans on the African continent, particularly considering the relationship between these species and the risk of RVFV spillover transmission. In order to do this comprehensively, a systematic review was performed and the study designs of eligible articles were evaluated to examine how seroprevalence was measured and calculated, including potential sources of bias. Reviews of Rift Valley fever epidemiology have evaluated the spatio-temporal, ecological, predictive risk factors and modelling methods used in studies across Africa [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Previous seroprevalence studies in wildlife, livestock or humans have typically focused on a single time point, species and country. This review will bridge these studies, identify associated trends in RVFV seroprevalence and evaluate study designs.
