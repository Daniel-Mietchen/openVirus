<p>Routine surveillance for RVFV in African countries is limited and outbreaks are underreported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Proxy measures such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), monitoring of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies between Indian and Atlantic oceans have been used to predict when and where RVF outbreaks may occur [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] although these predictions can be unreliable [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Assessing historic and present RVFV seroprevalence in livestock and humans within African countries provides evidence of where the virus may circulate and helps identify at-risk populations, potentially informing intervention strategies and resources allocation. This is important because: (i) there is a global concern that RVFV is a pathogen that has the potential to cause large scale epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; (ii) in 2000 the geographical range of RVFV epidemics extended to the Arabian peninsula [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and (iii) the theoretical ease with which infection could be sustained in other parts of the world due to favourable ecological conditions, including the presence of competent vectors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By implementing control measures in at-risk populations during inter-epidemic years, further dissemination of the disease can be prevented.
