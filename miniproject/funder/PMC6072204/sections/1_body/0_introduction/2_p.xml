<p>Epizootics of RVF are sporadic and are often linked to persistent heavy rainfall and flooding, which causes the emergence of infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (hypothesised to have been infected via transovarial transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), after which transmission is amplified by other mosquito species (such as of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> genera) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This amplification can result in subsequent spillover transmission from livestock to humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There has been very little research assessing transmission from mosquitoes to humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and the main route of transmission is thought to be through contact with blood/tissue from infected livestock [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Intervals when outbreaks are not occurring are known as interepidemic or interepizootic periods (IEPs). During IEPs RVFV is believed to be maintained by transovarial transmission in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], enabling low-level circulation in wildlife and livestock [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is unknown whether wildlife species act as RVFV reservoirs, but seroconversion has been identified in multiple species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006627.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
