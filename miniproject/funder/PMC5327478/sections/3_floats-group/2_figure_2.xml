   <bold>X</bold>-NA-
   <bold>X</bold> viruses were passaged in MDCK cells at a controlled low m.o.i. (10
   <sup>−5</sup> pfu/cell). For each passage, supernatants were collected at day three post-infection, and virus titres were determined. Ten serial passages were performed for each virus. For 
   <bold>M</bold>-NA-
   <bold>M</bold> and 
   <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NP</bold>, one or two additional independent serial passages were performed, respectively. (

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Results were expressed as relative amounts calculated using the 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> as virus reference and segment M as segment reference. (

   <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>HA</bold> and 
   <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
   <bold>PB1</bold> viruses, ten additional passages were performed and virus titres determined as in a (left panel). The level of segment 6 incorporation was evaluated at passage 20 as described in b (right panel).
