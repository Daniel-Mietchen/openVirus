  <title>Effects of the replacement of the NA segment NC regions on transcription/replication, growth kinetics and segment incorporation.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Length, in nucleotides, of the WSN influenza virus 3′ and 5′ NC sequences of each segment (start and stop codons not included). Recombinant 
   <bold>X</bold>-NA-
   <bold>X</bold> reverse genetics plasmids were constructed and each construct was assigned a colour code. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Transcription/replication of the 
   <bold>X</bold>-NA-
   <bold>X</bold> genomic segments evaluated by transient reconstitution of functional vRNPs. 293 T cells were transfected and total RNA was extracted at 24 h post-transfection. The amounts of viral vRNA and mRNA were measured by specific two-step RT-qPCRs
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Fold differences relative to 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> were calculated. Three independent experiments were performed and the mean (with Standard Error to the Mean, SEM) is given. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Growth kinetics of rescued 
   <bold>X</bold>-NA-
   <bold>X</bold> viruses. Infections were performed in MDCK cells at a low m.o.i. (10
   <sup>−5</sup> pfu/cell). Titres were determined by standard plaque assays at the indicated time points. Results correspond to the mean (±SEM) of three independent experiments. Area Under Curve values were compared by t-test with 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> as reference (*0.05 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.01; **0.01 &lt; p-value &lt; 0.001; ***p-value &lt; 0.001). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Quantification of vRNA levels of the 
   <bold>X</bold>-NA-
   <bold>X</bold> viruses. Viral RNAs were extracted from the supernatants collected at day three post infection of the growth kinetics in c and the level of each segment was evaluated by specific two-step RT-qPCR
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Results were expressed as relative amounts calculated using the 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> as virus reference and segment M as segment reference, except for segment M quantification where segment NP was used as segment reference. Each bar represents the range (minimum - maximum) of the values obtained from three independent growth kinetics.
