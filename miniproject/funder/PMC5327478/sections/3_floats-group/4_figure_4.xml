  <title>Effects on virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation of mutations acquired by X-NA-X viruses with a shorter 5′NC region.</title>

   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> as virus reference and segment M as segment reference. Each bar represents the range (minimum - maximum) of the values obtained from the growth kinetics. Symbols used in growth kinetics graphs are presented next to the name of each virus in panels c, f and i.
