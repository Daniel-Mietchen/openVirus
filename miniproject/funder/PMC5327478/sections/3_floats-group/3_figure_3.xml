  <title>Effects on virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation of mutations acquired by X-NA-X viruses with a longer 5′NC region.</title>
  <p>Panels (a–d) and (e–h) correspond to 
   <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
   <bold>PB2</bold> and 
   <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>PA</bold> viruses and mutants, respectively. (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold> and 
   <bold>e</bold>–
   <bold>g</bold>) Growth kinetics. Infections were performed in MDCK cells at a low m.o.i. (10
   <sup>−5</sup> pfu/cell). Titres were determined by standard plaque assays at indicated time points. Results correspond to the mean of at least two independent experiments. (
   <bold>d</bold> and 
   <bold>h</bold>) Incorporation of segment 6. Viral RNAs were extracted from the supernatants collected at three days post infection of the growth kinetics and the NA segment vRNA level was evaluated by specific two-step RT-qPCR
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Results were expressed as relative amounts calculated using the 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with 
   <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
   <bold>NA</bold> as virus reference and segment M as segment reference. Each bar represents the range (minimum - maximum) of the values obtained from the growth kinetics. Symbols used in the growth kinetics graphs are presented next to the name of each virus in panels d and h.
