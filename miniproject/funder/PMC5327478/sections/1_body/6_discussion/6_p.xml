<p>In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of the signals present in the NA coding region for incorporation of segment 6 into virions. The position of these signals within the NA segment seems to be crucial to assemble the set of eight genomic vRNPs to be packaged by maintaining a correct network of interactions. These results were based only on segment 6 experiments and it would now be necessary to apply a similar approach to other genomic segments. This would help determine, for the other viral segments, whether altering the 5â€²NC region length could also lead to mutations restoring the positioning of functional bundling signals in the coding regions. Complementary approaches will also be needed to further identify the specific residues involved in the complex network of interactions required for efficient packaging of the influenza virus vRNPs.</p>
