<p>The respective role of the packaging signals found in the NC and coding regions is not yet fully understood. It was proposed that the NC signals drive the incorporation of the vRNAs into newly formed viral particles, while sequences in the coding regions serve as a bundling signal to ensure that a complete set of the different genomic vRNPs is packaged

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The requirement for compatibility between the packaging signals in the NC and coding regions has not been studied extensively. Attempts to replace the H1 non conserved NC regions of the HA segment of WSN by those of other HA subtypes resulted in infectious virus production with H2, H3, H5 and H9 NC regions, but not with the shorter H4, H6 or H7 NC regions, when both the 3′ and 5′ ends were replaced. In addition, all chimeric viruses harbouring only one replaced end could be rescued, and the differences observed in viral fitness led the authors to conclude that 1) the 3′ NC region was more important than the 5′NC region, 2) its length impacted viral fitness, and 3) there was no restriction of compatibility between the 3′ and 5′ ends of the HA segment for the different HA subtypes studied
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, the compatibility between the NC and coding regions was not discussed. Our study aimed at evaluating more specifically this compatibility. To this end, the NC regions of the NA segment were replaced by those of the other segments, while maintaining the signals in the coding region. All our 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses could be rescued and were infectious, even if their fitness was more or less altered. This showed that 1) there is no strict necessity for compatibility between the packaging signals in the NC and coding regions, and 2) influenza A viruses harbouring two genomic segments with identical ends restricted to the NC regions can be infectious, at least when segment 6 is used to carry the duplicate NC regions. However, the compatibility might be more stringent for other segments. Strikingly, for 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold>, no restoration of fitness could be observed even after 20 serial passages. When we swapped the NC regions of segment 4 (HA) and 6 (NA), we were unable to recover a 
 <bold>NA</bold>-HA-
 <bold>NA</bold> + 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> infectious virus (data not shown), suggesting that the packaging signals in the NA NC regions were incompatible with those in the HA coding region or that replacement of specific nucleotides in the HA NC region that were shown to be important by Zhao
