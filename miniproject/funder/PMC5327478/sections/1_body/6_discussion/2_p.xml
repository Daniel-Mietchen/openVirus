<p>Various studies have shown that mutations introduced in the packaging signals in the coding region of certain segments could affect both the incorporation of that specific segment and that of the other segments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In our study, only the incorporation of the modified segment 6 was affected when the NC regions were replaced with those of another segment. Thus, by only modifying the NC regions, we did not disturb the incorporation of the other segments and the signals in the coding regions required for the selection of a set of unique genomic segments were preserved. Segment 6 incorporation was nonetheless clearly impaired for all initial 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs, and this also seemed to have consequences on virus fitness. However, segment 6 is not considered as a major actor in influenza A virus genome assembling and packaging
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and viruses lacking segment 6 have previously been obtained
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and even observed in nature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Parallel to their defect in segment 6 incorporation, all the initial 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses produced far more non-infectious particles than the wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> virus, but ratios of infectivity were also improved with segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Transient functional vRNP reconstitution assays showed that transcription into mRNA was not affected for the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> segments, and neither was NA protein expression except for 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> and 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>). However, in infected cells, the levels of NA protein expression by the different 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses tested essentially reflect the level of segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). For the 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> and 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> segments, NA protein expression (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8a</xref>), but not NA mRNA production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>), was clearly reduced in functional vRNP transient reconstitution assays, suggesting a defect at the level of translation. Since all the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses could be rescued by reverse genetics, what causes the specific reduction in NA protein expression remains to be investigated for these two constructs.
