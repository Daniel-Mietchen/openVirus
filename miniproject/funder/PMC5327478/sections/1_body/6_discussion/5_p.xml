<p>Most of the observed modifications that restored viral fitness occurred in the 5′ region of the vRNA, when others have concluded that the 3′ region might have more impact on viral fitness and segment incorporation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Even if our results might seem in contradiction, one might argue either that our approach revealed that the 5′ region contains some particularly important signals that have to be restored, or, on the contrary, that our results support the importance of the 3′ region, within which mutations cannot be tolerated.
