<p>When the 5′NC region of segment 6 was replaced by a shorter 5′NC region, restoration of virus fitness always involved insertions in the 5′NC region, either as a point insertion (
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold>) or as a partial duplication (
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>). Insertion of random sequences revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the insertion was not important as such (data not shown). Similarly, it was previously shown that the length of the packaging signals in the coding region near the 5′NC region was more important for segment 7 incorporation than the nucleotide sequence itself
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. We can conclude from our results in the 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> contexts that a minimum length of the 5′NC region is required for efficient packaging of segment 6 and thus for optimal virus fitness. This was further demonstrated by shortening the length of the 5′NC region of the wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> segment. Segment 6 incorporation was slightly reduced when the 5′NC region was less than 26 nucleotides long (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S9</xref>) with expected consequences on the level of NA expression in infected MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). Results obtained in A549 cells were relatively similar. These observations suggest that the insertions in the 5′NC region that restore the virus fitness of our 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs allowed the repositioning of essential residues of the coding region involved in vRNP bundling and hence restored efficient packaging of segment 6.
