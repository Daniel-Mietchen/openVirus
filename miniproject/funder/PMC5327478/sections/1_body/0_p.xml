<p>In humans, influenza A viruses are responsible for yearly epidemics of respiratory tract infections that represent a constant burden for national health services worldwide
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The introduction of a new influenza virus into the human population is still a major public health threat, as it can lead to devastating pandemics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Influenza A viruses are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family characterized by a segmented, negative-sense RNA genome that replicate in the cell nucleus. The eight genomic viral RNA (vRNA) molecules are associated with the nucleoprotein (NP) and with the three subunits of the polymerase complex (PB1, PB2 and PA) to form eight viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP) that represent the minimal units for transcription and replication
