<p>Genome segmentation confers evolutionary advantages to influenza A viruses by allowing exchange of segments through a process known as genetic reassortment. Viruses responsible for recent pandemics in the 20
 <sup>th</sup> and early 21
 <sup>st</sup> centuries have been shown to be reassortants between human and animal influenza A viruses, leading to the introduction in humans of new viruses to which the population had essentially no pre-existing immunity

However, genome segmentation also complicates genome packaging and requires particular mechanisms to ensure that a complete set of the eight genomic vRNPs is incorporated into newly formed viral particles. Two models of incorporation have long been debated: a random incorporation model requiring that either less or more than eight vRNPs can be packaged, and a selective incorporation model with packaging of only eight vRNPs, one of each kind

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. With growing evidence to support the latter model, a selective mechanism for packaging involving defined segment- and strain-specific packaging signals is now well established. However, it was shown that the majority of viral particles fail to express one or more gene products, suggesting that particles with incomplete genomes might arise
