<p>We and others have recently shown that the sequence of the non-conserved NC regions is not critical for efficient rescue of infectious viruses, suggesting the existence of some degree of flexibility in the compatibility between the packaging signals in the NC and coding regions

In the present study, our strategy was to produce influenza A viruses that harbour two segments with identical sets of NC regions, while maintaining the presumed bundling signals in the coding regions. We focused on the NA segment of influenza virus A/WSN/33 (WSN) and replaced the NC regions of the NA segment with those of each of the seven other segments. All recombinant viruses were successfully rescued and were characterized by a reduced virus fitness related to a defect in NA segment incorporation. Upon serial passages in cell culture, we found that the length of the heterologous 5â€²NC region was key to the type of changes required for virus fitness recovery and restoration of incorporation of the NA segment.
