<p>Gao and Palese evaluated the possibility to exchange packaging signals of the HA segment, with the aim to engineer live attenuated vaccines with a limited risk of potential reassortment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This was successfully achieved by exchanging the complete packaging sequences, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> signals in the NC and coding sequences. We wondered whether decrease of virus fitness and prevention of reassortment could also be achieved by exchange or replacement of the NC sequences only.
