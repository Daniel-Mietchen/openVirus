<p>Each genomic vRNA is composed of a central coding region, flanked on both sides by non-coding (NC) sequences. The NC sequences are themselves divided into conserved (12 and 13 nucleotides at the extreme 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively) and non-conserved sequences, whose lengths vary between segments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In vRNPs, the 3′ and 5′ NC regions associate and form secondary structures. The conserved NC sequences were shown to act as a promoter for transcription and replication of the vRNAs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, while the non-conserved NC regions play a role in modulating the efficiency of transcription and replication
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Numerous studies have demonstrated that packaging signals of all eight segments encompass sequences from both the 3′ and 5′ NC regions and from the adjacent coding regions in the vRNA

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. These studies also revealed that mutations in the packaging signals of a given segment could impact the incorporation of other segments. It was therefore proposed that the packaging signals could have two distinct functions: the 3′ and 5′ NC regions of each vRNA would act as incorporation signals to package the vRNP, while the sequences in the coding regions would serve as bundling signals required to pre-assemble the eight different vRNPs prior to their packaging at the budding site
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. It was suggested that this assembling process is hierarchical
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> and that the PB2, PA, NP and M segments play a pivotal role, while the PB1, HA, NA and NS segments are less important
