<p>The initial defect in 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> virus growth was rapidly compensated upon serial passages and the virus reached a titre similar to that of wild-type at passages 2 and 4 for our first and second series of passages, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). In both cases, a similar insertion of eight nucleotides in the 5′NC region was found when viral titres were restored (passages 2 and 4) that was not present at earlier passages. This insertion corresponded to a duplication of a sequence encompassing the polyU (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). No mutation in the NA coding region was found, but additional substitutions were detected in other segments: the synonymous A33G substitution in the PB1 segment was found from passage 2 of both series, and the non-synonymous A682C (Asn228His) substitution in the PA segment was only found from passage 3 of the second series. However, introduction of these substitutions in the PB1 and PA segments, alone or in combination, in both 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> contexts, had no effect on virus fitness nor segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6a and b</xref>). In contrast, introduction of the eight nt insertion in the 5′NC region (
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>
 <sup>28nt</sup>) was sufficient to increase both virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation to wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, e and f), which also restored the level of NA expression in infected MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). Interestingly, this eight-nucleotide insertion extended the 5′NC region from 20 to 28 nt as found in the NA 5′NC region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), suggesting that the length of the 5′NC region of segment 6 might be important. A chimeric virus with a 24nt-long 5′NC region (
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>
 <sup>24nt</sup>) exhibited altered growth properties similar to 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>, whereas increasing the length of the 5′NC region to 26 nt (
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>
 <sup>26nt</sup>) clearly improved both virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation, but to an intermediate level between 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and wild-type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4d</xref>, e and f) that was not sufficient to improve NA expression levels in infected MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). Overall, infections of A549 cells with 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>, 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>
 <sup>
  <bold>26nt</bold>
 </sup>, 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>
 <sup>
  <bold>28nt</bold>
 </sup>, and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold>, gave similar results for both virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation, even if the effect appeared to be less pronounced for 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S6c</xref>).
