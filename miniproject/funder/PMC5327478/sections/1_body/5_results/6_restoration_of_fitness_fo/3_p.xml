<p>For the 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> virus, the initial fitness defect was compensated upon serial passages either rapidly at passage 5 (series 1), or slowly from passage 7 (series 3) or not (series 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Focusing on series 1 and 3, sequencing performed at passage 10 revealed several mutations that were then tracked at earlier passages. Thus, a C22U substitution in the 5′NC region was found at passages 5 and 10 but not at passages 4 and 9 for series 1 and 3, respectively. This substitution was accompanied by an insertion of 10 and 4 nucleotides, respectively, that also corresponded to a duplication of adjacent sequences and extended the 5′NC region from 23 to 33 or 27 nucleotides, respectively. Finally, several additional mutations were also detected in the NA coding region and in other segments (in PB2, PA), but they differed between series 1 and 3 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Introduction of these substitutions, alone or in combination, in both the 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> contexts, had essentially no effect on virus fitness nor on segment 6 incorporation or in some cases even resulted in a further decrease of virus fitness in the 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> context (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7a and c</xref>). Likewise, introduction of the C22U substitution in the 5′NC region of 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> did not improve but rather decreased virus fitness (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S7b and c</xref>). Only the insertions in the 5′NC region partially (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>27nt</sup>) or totally (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>33nt</sup>) restored virus fitness and segment 6 packaging to wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>, h and i). Accordingly, the NA expression level remained low (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>27nt</sup>) or was restored (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>33nt</sup>) in infected MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). Like for 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>, the length of the 5′NC region seemed important and additional constructs were tested (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). As observed with 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> constructs, a chimeric virus with a 24nt-long 5′NC region (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>24nt</sup>) also showed reduced fitness and defective incorporation of segment 6, whereas a virus with a 28nt-long 5′NC region (
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>28nt</sup>) as in wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> exhibited completely restored virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4g</xref>, h and i). Overall, similar results were obtained with 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>, 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>
  <bold>27nt</bold>
 </sup>, 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>
 <sup>
  <bold>33nt</bold>
 </sup>, and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> when infections of A549 cells were performed (
