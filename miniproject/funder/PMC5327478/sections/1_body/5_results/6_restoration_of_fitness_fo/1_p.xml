<p>Fitness of the 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold> virus increased progressively with passages, and somewhat more steadily from passage 8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Sequencing at passage 10, when the 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold> virus titre reached that of wild-type virus, revealed only two mutations: a one-nucleotide insertion before the stop codon in the 5′NC region and a synonymous G993A substitution in the NA open reading frame. The 5′NC insertion was not present before passage 10, but the G993A substitution appeared as early as passage 3. Introduction of the G993A substitution in both the 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold> and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> contexts did not affect virus fitness nor segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S5a and b</xref>). In contrast, introduction of the one nt insertion in the 5′NC region of 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold> was sufficient to increase virus fitness to near wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a and b</xref>) and to substantially improve incorporation of segment 6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4c</xref>). Similar results were obtained when A549 cells were infected with 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold>, 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold>
 <sup>
  <bold>+1U</bold>
 </sup>, and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> (
