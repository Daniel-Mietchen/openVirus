<p>We first assessed the transcription/replication levels of the different 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs by transient reconstitution of functional vRNPs. All 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> segments, with one exception, were transcribed to produce mRNAs and replicated to produce vRNAs by the viral polymerase complex at levels similar to those of the wild-type segment 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). In the case of the replacement with the original M NC regions, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> following our initial strategy of using the M 5′NC region and the NA stop codon (
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>Mi</bold>), transcription was nearly 100-fold lower than for 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold>, and replication was also affected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, hatched blue). The 5′NC region of segment 7 (M) is the shortest one in the WSN genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>) and the stop codon is merged with the polyU sequence (5′NC: aguagaaacaagguagUUU
 <bold>UUA</bold>). The use of the cognate NA stop codon in the 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>Mi</bold> construct thus shortened the polyU sequence (5′NC: aguagaaacaagguagUUU
 <bold>CUA</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Restoration of the M stop codon and thus of a functional polyU (construct 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) led to efficient transcription and replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>, solid blue). Consequently, construct 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> was used as basis for all further experiments and related constructs. In agreement with the fact that transcription and replication of the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> segments was similar to wild-type, no major differences in expression levels of the NA as analysed by western-blot were observed between the different constructs tested and wild-type, except for 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> and 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> for which expression of the NA was reduced (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8a</xref>).
