<p>All chimeric viruses harbouring two identical sets of NC regions could be rescued by reverse genetics and working stocks were constituted at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i. = 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) from amplifications of plaque-purified viruses. Sequencing of the whole genome (NC and coding regions of the eight segments) of the working stocks did not reveal any differences with the sequence of the plasmids used for reverse genetics. Viral fitness was assessed by analysis of growth kinetics at low m.o.i. in MDCK cells. Viral growth was significantly impaired for all constructs compared to wild-type. At three days post-infection (p.i.), titres for

 <sub>10</sub>, and those for

 <bold>PB2</bold> and 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Sequencing of the whole genome of the viruses from the clarified supernatants at day 3 post-infection did not reveal any mutation. A significant deficit in the incorporation of the NA segment into virions was observed for the seven chimeric 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs compared to 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold>, when all the other vRNA segments were incorporated with the same efficiency for all viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>). Impairment of virus growth was significantly correlated to the deficit of NA segment incorporation (non-parametric correlation test to compare Area Under Curve deduced from the growth curves versus NA segment incorporation fold difference; Spearman r: 0.8682, 95% CI: 0.7660 to 0.9276, two-tailed p-value: &lt; 0.0001). Absolute quantification of the M segment using a synthetic RNA transcript standard curve allowed to estimate the ratio of infectivity, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> the number of RNA copies per infectious unit (pfu), for the different 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses. All 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses produced more (18- to 3000-fold) non-infectious particles than the wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> virus in accordance with the observed reduction in virus fitness (
