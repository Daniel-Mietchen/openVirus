<p>For the 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> virus, substitutions G17A in the 3â€²NC region and U1116C and G1359A in the NA coding region were identified at passage 20, but not at earlier passages. In addition, substitution U1572C in the PB1 segment was found from passage 10. Introduction of this latter mutation in the PB1 segment did not alter virus fitness, neither in the 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> nor in the 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> context (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>). Introduction of each of the other three mutations in 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> did not improve virus fitness nor segment 6 packaging, but the combination of the three mutations together slightly increased both virus fitness and incorporation of segment 6 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2b and c</xref>). A defect in virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation was also observed when we infected human lung A549 cells with 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2d</xref>).
