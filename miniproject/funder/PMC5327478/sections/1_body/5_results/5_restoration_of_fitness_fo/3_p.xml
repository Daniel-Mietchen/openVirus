<p>Viral titres of 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold> increased slowly between passages 6 and 9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>), but mutations were only detected between passages 7 and 8. Substitutions G21U in the 3′NC region, U1308C in the NA coding region, and G1809A in the PA coding region were found at passage 8, when the titre almost reached wild-type levels, but not at passage 7, when the titre was still one log
 <sub>10</sub> lower. Introduction of the PA segment synonymous substitution G1809A in both 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold> and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> contexts did not alter virus fitness nor segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4a and c</xref>). Both the single introduction of the G21U substitution in the 3′NC region or of the synonymous U1308C substitution in the NA coding region of 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold> allowed the restoration of virus fitness and segment 6 packaging to 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref>, f and h). Either mutation in the 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold> context also restored NA expression to wild-type levels in infected MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). No additional effect was observed when these two mutations were combined (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S4b and c</xref>). When introduced into 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA,</bold> the U1308C substitution did not affect virus fitness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>) nor incorporation of segment 6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3h</xref>), nor the level of NA expression in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8b</xref>). Similar results were obtained for
