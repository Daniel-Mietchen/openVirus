<p>For 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2,</bold> restoration of virus fitness occurred between passages 2 and 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Only two substitutions, both non-synonymous, one in the NA coding region (A1355G leading to Asp452Gly) and one in the HA coding region (A1145G leading to Lys382Arg) were identified. The latter substitution in the HA segment, when introduced in both the 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold> and 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> contexts, did not alter virus fitness nor segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3a and c</xref>). On the contrary, the sole introduction of A1355G in 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold> was sufficient to increase both virus fitness and segment 6 packaging to wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>, b and d). Introduction of A1355G in 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold> also restored wild-type levels of NA expression in MDCK cells infected at a high m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S8b</xref>). Interestingly, when introduced in the 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> context, mutation A1355G decreased virus fitness to the level of the original 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>), but segment 6 incorporation was only marginally reduced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>). As assessed by western blot, expression of the NA from the 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA
 <sup>A1355G</sup>-
 <bold>NA</bold> segment was not affected in a transient vRNA reconstitution assay, but NA expression was reduced in MDCK cells infected at a high m.o.i. of 5 pfu/cell in accordance with the decreased virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S8a and S8b</xref>). When A549 cells were infected, similar results were obtained for 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold>, but virus fitness of 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA
 <sup>A1355G</sup>-
 <bold>PB2</bold> seemed to remain affected although segment 6 incorporation was essentially restored as observed in MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3d</xref>). Also, the effects of mutation A1355G in the 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> context (
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA
 <sup>A1355G</sup>-
 <bold>NA</bold>) appeared to be exacerbated in A549 as compared to MDCK cells.
