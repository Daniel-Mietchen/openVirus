<p>For the 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> and 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> viruses, a series of ten additional passages was performed. The titre for 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> consistently remained more than 3 log
 <sub>10</sub> below that of wild-type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), with segment 6 packaging still impaired (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, right panel). On the contrary, for 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1,</bold> titres increased very slowly during these additional ten passages, almost reaching wild-type levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>), and the incorporation efficiency of the NA segment also improved, although it was not totally restored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>, right panel). The ratio of infectivity expressed in genomic RNA copies per infectious unit was in agreement with the observed fitness (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).
