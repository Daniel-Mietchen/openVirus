<p>A series of ten passages at controlled, low m.o.i. (10
 <sup>−5</sup>) was performed in MDCK cells for all chimeric 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses. For all viruses except 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> and 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold>, virus titre at passage 10 was similar to that of wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold>, the chimeric virus with the smallest initial growth defect, titres reached wild-type level at passage 3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold> and 
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold> viruses that displayed an initial defect of 2–3 log
 <sub>10</sub>, restoration of virus fitness was slower, and a titre similar to that of 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> was observed at passages 9 and 10 respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> viruses, that exhibited the strongest initial growth defect, restoration of virus fitness occurred rapidly after two and five passages, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, solid line). To confirm this rapid restoration of virus fitness, a second, independent series of ten passages was performed for these two viruses. Titres of 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> virus again rapidly reached wild-type levels (passage 4) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, dotted line), but 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold> titres remained stable and around three log
 <sub>10</sub> below that of 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> up to passage 10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, dotted line). A third series of ten passages was performed for 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>, leading to a slow increase of virus titres that reached wild-type levels at passage 10 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, hashed/dotted line).
