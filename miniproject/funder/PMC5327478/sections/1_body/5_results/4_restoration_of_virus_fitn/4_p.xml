<p>Using viral RNA extracted from clarified supernatants collected at three days p.i. at the different, indicated passages, sequencing of the whole genome (NC and coding sequences of the eight segments) was performed to identify potential mutations responsible for restoration of virus fitness and segment 6 packaging. Mutations were identified when the viral titre was restored and were traced back at earlier passages. Sanger sequencing sometime revealed double populations at these earlier passages (details are available upon request), but all the identified mutations that were further tested were fixed when virus fitness and segment 6 incorporation were fully restored. These fixed mutations were then reintroduced in the viral genome by site-directed mutagenesis, either alone or in the detected combinations, and corresponding viruses rescued by reverse genetics were tested for viral fitness and segment 6 packaging. We chose to only focus on the viruses for which viral fitness and segment 6 packaging were restored after serial passages. Based on the mutations identified, the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs were grouped and are presented according to the length of the -
 <bold>X</bold> 5′NC region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>): longer than the -NA 5′NC region (
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold>, 
 <bold>PB2</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB2</bold> and 
 <bold>PA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PA</bold>) and shorter than the -NA 5′NC region (
 <bold>NS</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NS</bold>, 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> and 
 <bold>NP</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NP</bold>). The sequences of the different constructs tested are given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. All the substitutions in coding regions are numbered from the start codon in the open reading frame, while substitutions in the NC regions are numbered from their respective extremities.
