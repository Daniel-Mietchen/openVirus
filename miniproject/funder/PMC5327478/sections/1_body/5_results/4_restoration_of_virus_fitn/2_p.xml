<p>The level of incorporation of the different segments was evaluated at passage 10 for all 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> viruses. Restoration of virus fitness was found to be linked to efficient incorporation of the NA segment into virus particles, with similar levels of segment NA detected for all passage 10 viruses except for 
 <bold>HA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>HA</bold> and 
 <bold>PB1</bold>-NA-
 <bold>PB1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>), and to an improved ratio of infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, the level of incorporation of the other segments remained similar to that of wild-type for all viruses (
