<p>In the unidirectional reverse genetics plasmid driving the synthesis of segment 6 (NA) vRNA of WSN, sequences of the NC regions were exchanged by those of each of the other segments to generate seven chimeric segment 6 vRNA constructs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Each construct was named 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold>, where 
 <bold>X</bold>- represents the segment origin of the 3′NC region, NA, the neuraminidase coding region including its natural stop codon, and -
 <bold>X</bold>, the segment origin of the 5′NC region.
