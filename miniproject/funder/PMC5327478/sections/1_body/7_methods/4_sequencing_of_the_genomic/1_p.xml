<p>The sequence of all genomic RNA segments was checked for all rescued viruses. Viral RNA was extracted from clarified supernatant using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of the full-length segment was performed in two steps by sequencing the coding region on the one hand and the NC regions on the other hand. Sequences of the 3′ and 5′ NC regions were amplified by RT-PCR as previously described
