<p>Viruses rescued by reverse genetics were titrated and plaque-purified by plaque assay using Avicel
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and agarose
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> overlays, respectively. Plaque-purified viruses were then amplified once in MDCK cells in DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml of TPCK-trypsin to constitute working stocks. Virus growth kinetics were performed at an m.o.i. of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> in MDCK cells and 10
 <sup>−4</sup> in A549 cells. Viral titres in clarified supernatants were determined at the different indicated time points post infection by plaque assay.
