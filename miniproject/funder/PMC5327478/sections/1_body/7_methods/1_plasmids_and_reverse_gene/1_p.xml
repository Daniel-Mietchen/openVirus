<p>The A/WSN/33 influenza virus 12-plasmid-based reverse genetics system was adapted from previously described procedures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>. To construct the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> plasmids, the whole NA coding sequence was amplified by PCR using primers containing the entire 3′ or 5′ NC sequences of each segment, including the TAG stop codon of the NA segment (except for the 
 <bold>M</bold>-NA-
 <bold>M</bold> plasmid which used the TAA stop codon), and the resulting amplicon was cloned into the pPR plasmid as described previously
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Point mutations in the coding or NC regions were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using Quikchange II Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In the coding region, numbering of the mutation positions started from the ATG codon. The sequences of the primers used are available upon request. All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics).
