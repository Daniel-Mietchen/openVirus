<p>The four expression plasmids for the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) polymerase and NP proteins (a gift from G. Brownlee) were co-transfected in 293 T cells with each of the 
 <bold>X</bold>-NA-
 <bold>X</bold> constructs using FUGENE HD (Promega). Twenty four hours post-transfection, total RNAs were extracted using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) as described by the manufacturer’s recommendations and reverse transcribed using the 3′ universal primer for the vRNAs (5′AGGGCTCTTCGGCCAGCRAAAGCAGG)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> or an oligo dT for the mRNAs. The cDNAs were then used as templates for quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a LightCycler 480 (Roche). Reaction conditions and primers for the detection of the NA segment were essentially as described by Marsh 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Fold differences were calculated in comparison to the wild-type NA construct using the qPCR theoretical relationship between Crossing threshold (Ct) value differences and PCR product amount variations (a 1 Ct difference means a 2-fold difference in PCR product amount; a 10-fold difference in PCR product amount corresponds to a 3.3 Ct difference). Absolute quantification of the M-segment was performed using an in-house RT-qPCR and a quantified synthetic RNA transcript.
