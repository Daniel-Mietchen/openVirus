<p>Three days post-infection, viral RNA was extracted from infected cell supernatants. Reverse transcription specific for vRNAs and qPCRs were performed as described above. The qPCRs were performed with segment-specific primers using a LightCycler 480 (Roche) as described
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The relative amounts of each vRNA were calculated using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method with wild-type 
 <bold>NA</bold>-NA-
 <bold>NA</bold> as virus reference and segment M as segment reference, except for segment M quantification where segment NP was used as segment reference.
