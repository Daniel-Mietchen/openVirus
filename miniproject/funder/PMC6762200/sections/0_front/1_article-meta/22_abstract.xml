 <p>The West Nile Virus (WNV) NS2B-NS3 protease is an attractive target for the development of therapeutics against this arboviral pathogen. In the present investigation, the screening of a small library of fifty-eight synthetic compounds against the NS2-NB3 protease of WNV is described. The following groups of compounds were evaluated: 3-(2-aryl-2-oxoethyl)isobenzofuran-1(3
  <italic>H</italic>)-ones; eugenol derivatives bearing 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities; and indan-1,3-diones with 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities. The most promising of these was a eugenol derivative, namely 4-(3-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)-propyl)-1-(2-bromobenzyl)-1
  <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole (
  <bold>35</bold>), which inhibited the protease with IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 6.86 
  <italic>Î¼</italic>mol L
  <sup>-1</sup>. Enzyme kinetic assays showed that this derivative of eugenol presents competitive inhibition behaviour. Molecular docking calculations predicted a recognition pattern involving the residues His
  <sup>51</sup> and Ser
  <sup>135</sup>, which are members of the catalytic triad of the WNV NS2B-NS3 protease.
