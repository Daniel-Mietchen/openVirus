<p>In this work, a small library of fifty-eight synthetic compounds (isobenzofuran-1(3
 <italic>H</italic>)-ones and triazolic derivatives of eugenol and indandione) were screened against the WNV NS2B-NS3 protease. By modifying the structure of the natural product eugenol to produce 1,2,3-triazolic derivatives, a compound presenting low cytotoxicity and considerable inhibitory protease activity was identified. Compound 
 <bold>35</bold> corresponds to 4-(3-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)propyl)-1-(2-bromobenzyl)-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazole. In addition, molecular docking calculations suggested that the inhibition mechanism relies on interactions between His
 <sup>51</sup>, Thr
 <sup>134</sup>, Ser
 <sup>135</sup> and Tyr
 <sup>161</sup>. The virucidal assay with DENV-1-4 strains indicates that compound 
 <bold>35</bold> is a promising lead compound for antiviral activity against 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. Taken together, our results provide insightful information for further development of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> protease inhibitors via rational drug design. Efforts towards this end are under way in our laboratories.
