<p>To determine whether compound 
 <bold>35</bold> would have antiviral activity for 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic>, a virucidal assay was performed with four serotypes of DENV, due to its close evolutionary proximity to WNV and due to the highly conserved NS2B-NS3 fold and sequence. This assay was performed by prior incubation of the compound with each viral strain, followed by its addition to the cell layer for virus adsorption and internalization. Subsequently, the compound-virus solution was removed and antiviral action was observed through the formation of lysis plates. The concentration of test compounds that inhibited 50% of the viral infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained by nonlinear regression, leading to the calculation of the Selectivity Index (SI).The observed results are presented in
