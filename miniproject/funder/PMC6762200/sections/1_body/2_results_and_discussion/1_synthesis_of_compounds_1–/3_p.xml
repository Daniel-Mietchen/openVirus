<p>For the preparation of compounds 
 <bold>23â€“49</bold>, we initially isolated eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) from dried flower buds of 
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic> via hydrodistillation. Subsequently, eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) was submitted to alkylation procedures, affording terminal alkynes 
 <bold>21</bold> and 
 <bold>22</bold> in yields of, respectively, 87% and 78% (
