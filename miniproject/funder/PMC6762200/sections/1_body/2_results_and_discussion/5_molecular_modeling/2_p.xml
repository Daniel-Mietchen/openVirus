<p>In order to perform our own molecular docking calculations, the crystallographic structure of the NS2B-NS3 protease was obtained from PDB 2IJO, in which NS2B-NS3 is co-crystallized with the WNV protease inhibitor aprotinin. All molecules derived from eugenol were analyzed for their probable three-dimensional binding conformation, binding energy, chemical groups involved, profile of binding and identity of the involved amino acids, as observed in table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0223017.s001">S1 File</xref>. The predicted recognition mechanism for compound 
 <bold>35</bold> relies on interactions with His
 <sup>51</sup>, Thr
 <sup>134</sup>, Ser
 <sup>135</sup> and Tyr
 <sup>161</sup>, as represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223017.g010">Fig 10A</xref>, and the ligand occupies pocket S1 of the catalytic site. The NH
 <sup>+</sup> of the His
 <sup>51</sup> ring interacts with the triazole ring of 
 <bold>35</bold> in cation-π and π-π type interactions, and the Tyr
 <sup>161</sup> ring interacts with the phenyl ring of 
 <bold>35</bold> via π-π type interaction, while a halogen bond can be formed between the Br atom and the OH from Ser
 <sup>135</sup> or the NH from Thr
 <sup>134</sup>. It is important to highlight that both His
 <sup>51</sup> and Ser
 <sup>135</sup> are members of the catalytic triad of the NS2B-NS3 protease, which might explain the observed competitive inhibitory activity of 
 <bold>35</bold>.
