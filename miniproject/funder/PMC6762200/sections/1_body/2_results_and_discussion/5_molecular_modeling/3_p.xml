<p>In addition, compound 
 <bold>36</bold> showed no inhibitory activity, despite the fact that the only difference from compound 
 <bold>35</bold> is the position of a bromo substituent (
 <italic>orto</italic> in 
 <bold>35</bold> and 
 <italic>meta</italic> in 
 <bold>36</bold>
 <italic>)</italic>. Our calculations suggest that the formation of a halogen bond for 
 <bold>36</bold> with bromo in 
 <italic>meta</italic> might induce a more stable conformation for the ligand in which the triazole ring interacts with Gly
 <sup>153</sup> instead of His
 <sup>51</sup> and, consequently, leaves the S1 pocket free (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223017.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). These results suggest that the bromo substituent in 
 <italic>orto</italic> is pivotal for a proper recognition of compound 
 <bold>35</bold>, along with the cation-Ï€ interaction between His
 <sup>51</sup> and the triazole ring, while the methoxyphenyl ring region might be a suitable target for further improvements.
