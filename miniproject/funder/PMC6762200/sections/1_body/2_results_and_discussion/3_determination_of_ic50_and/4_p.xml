<p>For the development of new drugs, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommends the use of compounds with pharmacological effects already described and substances already approved for clinical use, so that several steps can be abbreviated in the long validation process [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, and it has been recognized as a safe, effective and inexpensive anesthetic for fish, amphibians and rats [

 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Also, the analgesic effect of eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) in different models of pain has been well documented [

 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A recent work with BALB/c mice used a derivative of eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) to treat visceral Leishmaniasis. This derivative presented low cytotoxicity for macrophages as well as for naive mice with immune-stimulatory activity. Moreover, no biochemical alterations in hepatic and renal enzymes were noticed [

 <bold>19</bold>) is generally non-allergenic for humans, although in sensitized individuals it may cause a range of tissue reactions from low-grade local to systemic. Low concentrations of eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) are well known to exert local anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anesthetic effects on dental pulp. Also, eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) may have antibacterial effects that are beneficial for dental hygiene, being included in materials such as toothpastes and mouthwashes [

 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. All these features make eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>), as well as its derivatives, very interesting compounds to be explored in drug development.
