<p>The enzyme kinetic assay was conducted under five different substrate concentrations and three varying concentrations of compound 
 <bold>35</bold>. We used the Michaelis-Menten equation to find the values of V
 <sub>MAX</sub> and K
 <sub>M</sub>; and with these, the Lineweaver-Burk graph was built. Compound 
 <bold>35</bold> showed a decrease of enzymatic V
 <sub>MAX</sub> and an increase in K
 <sub>M</sub>, presenting the behaviour of a competitive inhibitor (

 <sub>i</sub> value was 3.06 (± 0.38)
