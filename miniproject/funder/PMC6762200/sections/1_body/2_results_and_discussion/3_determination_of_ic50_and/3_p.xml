<p>For compound 35, the enzyme kinetic data showed an increase in the K
 <sub>M</sub> value, a typical behaviour of competitive inhibitors. In addition, this compound displayed a low K
 <sub>i</sub> value. In a recent investigation, Balasubramanian and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] found eight promising flavivirus protease inhibitors presenting K
 <sub>i</sub> values within the 0.22 to 6.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup> range. However, the K
 <sub>i</sub> value may not be analyzed individually. In the study by Balasubramanian and collaborators, a compound presenting low K
 <sub>i</sub> value (0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) but displaying a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 29.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup> was identified [
