<p>The 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> protease is essential for the processing of the polyprotein which generates the viral proteins required for viral replication and maturation of infectious virions. Therefore, the protease is an ideal target for the discovery of antivirals against 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the present investigation, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of fifty-eight compounds against the WNV NS2B-NS3 protease (eighteen 3-(2-oxo-2-aryl)-isobenzofuran-1(3
 <italic>H</italic>)-ones, compounds 
 <bold>1–18</bold>; twenty-seven derivatives of eugenol with triazole rings, compounds 
 <bold>23–49</bold>; thirteen derivatives of indan-1,3-diones presenting triazole rings, compounds 
 <bold>51–63</bold>,
