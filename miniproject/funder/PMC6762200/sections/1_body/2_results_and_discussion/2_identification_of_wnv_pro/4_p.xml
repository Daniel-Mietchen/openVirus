<p>A derivative of the natural product eugenol capable of significantly inhibiting the activity of the WNV NS2B-NS3 protease was identified. Taking the eugenol derivatives into consideration, we made variations in the size of the carbon chain that links eugenol moiety and the triazole ring. Also, the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring attached to the triazolic portion was varied. These modifications afforded a group of eugenol triazolic derivatives from which was identified the very active compound 
 <bold>35</bold>. It is important to mention that further chemical modifications can be planned regarding the eugenol and triazole fragments so that new derivatives with improved activity may be obtained. Considering that there is no 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> protease inhibitor approved for pre-clinical trial [
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the exploitation of the new scaffold herein identified, namely triazolic derivatives of eugenol, would be of considerable importance.
