 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported the best parameters for the most promising compounds against the protease of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. They highlighted a compound with low cytotoxicity presenting CC
 <sub>50</sub> superior to 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>. Eugenol derivative 
 <bold>35</bold> presented a similar CC
 <sub>50</sub>, and it can be considered a compound with low cytotoxicity. Therefore, although a very potent inhibitor, this compound presented considerable cytotoxicity.
