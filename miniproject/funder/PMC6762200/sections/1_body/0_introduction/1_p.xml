<p>The West Nile Virus (WNV) is a member of the same family as the Dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and Yellow Fever virus (YFV), the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus. They are arboviruses that present RNA as a genome [
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Diseases caused by 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> are the major causes of fatality in poverty-stricken regions across Africa, Asia and some parts of the Americas. The combined potential health risk associated with arthropod-borne viruses like DENV, WNV, and ZIKV is enormous. These arboviruses are either emerging or re-emerging in many regions [
