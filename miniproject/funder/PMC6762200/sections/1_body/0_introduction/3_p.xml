<p>WNV is a genetically and geographically diverse virus. Four or five distinct WNV genetic lines have been proposed, based on phylogenetic analyses of published isolates. Their genomes differ from each other by about 20–25%, and are well correlated with the geographic point of isolation [

 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They are enveloped viruses whose genome consists of single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA approximately 11 kb. This RNA contains a single open reading frame encoding a precursor polyprotein, which is processed by viral and host proteases, giving rise to three structural proteins: capsidial protein (C), envelope glycoprotein (E) and pre-membrane/membrane protein (prM/M); and seven non-structural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5, which are involved in the replicative cycle of the virus[
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Viral protease performs the cleavage of some sites: NS2A-NS2B, NS2B-NS3, NS3-NS4A and NS4B-NS5. It also cleaves the signal sequences at the C-prM position and the NS4A-NS4B, within NS2A, and within the NS3 itself [
