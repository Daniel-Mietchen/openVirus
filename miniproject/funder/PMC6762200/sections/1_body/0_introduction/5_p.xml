<p>Considering the premises, the screening of a small library of fifty-eight synthetic compounds against the NS2-NB3 protease of WNV is described in the present investigation. The following groups of compounds were evaluated: (
 <bold>I</bold>) 3-(2-aryl-2-oxoethyl)isobenzofuran-1(3
 <italic>H</italic>)-ones; (
 <bold>II</bold>) eugenol derivatives bearing 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities; and (
 <bold>III</bold>) indan-1,3-diones with 1,2,3-triazolic functionalities. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0223017.g001">Fig 1</xref> displays the general structures of the evaluated compounds.
