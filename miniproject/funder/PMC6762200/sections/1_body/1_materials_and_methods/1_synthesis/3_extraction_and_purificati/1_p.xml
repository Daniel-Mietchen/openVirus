<p>Eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) was extracted via hydrodistillation from dried flower buds of 
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>, commonly known as cloves, purchased in the local market in Vi√ßosa, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Thus, 60.0 g of cloves were mixed with 500 mL of distilled water in a round-bottom flask which was connected to the hydrodistillation apparatus. The mixture was heated for three hours. The obtained hydrolate was transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 30 mL). The organic extracts were combined and the resulting organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting oil was submitted to column chromatography eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate (6:1 v/v). The described procedure afforded 7.12 g of eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>), which corresponded to approximately a 12% yield in relation to the initial mass of cloves used in the extraction process.
