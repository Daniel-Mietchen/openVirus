<p>A 50 mL round-bottom flask was charged with eugenol (
 <bold>19</bold>) (1.20 g, 7.32 mmol), sodium hydroxide (0.313 g, 7.83 mmol) and 25 mL of methanol. The resulting mixture was heated to 40 
 <sup>o</sup>C and magnetically stirred for 30 minutes. After this time, methanol was removed under reduced pressure and 10.0 mL of anhydrous ethanol was added for the removal of the residual water. The ethanol was removed under reduced pressure. Then, the round-bottom flask, under a nitrogen atmosphere, was charged with anhydrous acetonitrile (25.0 mL) and propargyl bromide (800 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>L, 8.79 mmol) was added slowly. The mixture was magnetically stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. TLC analysis revealed the completion of the reaction after this time. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was partitioned between 25.0 mL of sodium hydroxide solution (0.1 mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) and 25 mL of diethyl ether. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 25.0 mL). The organic extracts were combined and the resulting organic layer was washed with brine (25.0 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate (6:1 v/v). The described procedure afforded 1.29 g (6.37 mmol, 87% yield) of compound
