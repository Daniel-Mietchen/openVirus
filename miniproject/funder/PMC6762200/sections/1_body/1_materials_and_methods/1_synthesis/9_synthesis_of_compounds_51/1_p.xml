<p>To a 10 mL round bottom-flask, containing 1.5 mL of dichloromethane and 1.5 mL of distilled water, it was added 4-bromobenzylazide (168.8 mg, 0.800 mmol), alkyne 
 <bold>50</bold> (88.8 mg, 0.400 mmol), and sodium ascorbate (60.0 mg, 0.300 mmol). Then, it was added CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>Â·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (38.0 mg, 0.150 mmol) and the resulting mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After that, it was added to the reaction mixture sodium carbonate saturated aqueous solution (20 mL) and the resulting aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 15 mL) followed by ethyl acetate (3 x 15 mL). The organic extracts were combined and the resulting organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography eluted with hexane-ethyl-acetate-dichloromethane 3:1:3 v/v. Compound 
 <bold>51</bold> was obtained in 51% yield (143.1 mg, 0.220 mmol). Selected IR and NMR spectra is show at CD-CF Figs in
