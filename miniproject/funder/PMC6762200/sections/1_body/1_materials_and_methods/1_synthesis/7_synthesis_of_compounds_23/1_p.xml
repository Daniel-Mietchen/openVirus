<p>A 10 mL round bottom flask was charged with 4-allyl-2-methoxy-1-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)benzene (
 <bold>20</bold>) (0.150 g, 0.740 mmol), benzyl azide (0.0990g; 0.740 mmol), sodium ascorbate (0.0590 g, 0.300 mmol), 1.00 mL of etanol and 1.00 mL of distilled water. Then, CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>Â·5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.0370 g, 0.150 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature. After completion of the reaction, as noticed was by TLC analysis, the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 10.0 mL). The organic extracts were combined and the resulting organic layer was washed with aqueous sodium carbonate saturated solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate-dichloromethane (3:1:3 v/v). Compound 
 <bold>23</bold> was obtained in 91% yield (0.228g, 0.680 mmol). Selected IR and NMR spectra is show at A-C Figs in
