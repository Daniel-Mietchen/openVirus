<p>To a mixture of indan-1,3-dione (0.146 g, 1.00 mmol) and distilled water (40 mL), it was added potassium hydroxide (0.140 g, 0.250 mmol) and propargyl bromide (0.364 mL, 4.00 mmol). The resulting mixture was magnetically stirred at 40 
 <sup>o</sup>C for 24h. After this time, the reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature and it was neutralized with aqueous solution of HCl 0.100 mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The organic extracts were combined and the resulting organic phase was washed with brine (15 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Compound 
 <bold>50</bold> was not submitted to any purification process and it was obtained in 93% yield (0.207 g, 0.930 mmol).
