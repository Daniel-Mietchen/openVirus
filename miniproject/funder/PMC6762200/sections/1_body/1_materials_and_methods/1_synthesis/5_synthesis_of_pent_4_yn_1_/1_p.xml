<p>Pent-4-yn-1-ol (1.68 g, 20.0 mmol) and dichloromethane (20 mL) were added to a 100 mL round-bottom flask under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was cooled to -50Â°C and triethylamine (5.60 mL, 40.0 mmol) was added. After that, methanesulfonyl chloride was added slowly (2.32 mL, 30.0 mmol) to the reaction mixture under continuous stirring. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of it, 10 mL of distilled water were added. The organic phase was washed with 1% HCl solution (3 x 15 mL) followed by saturated aqueous NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (3 x 5 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate-dicloromethane (3:1:3 v/v) to give compound 
 <bold>21</bold> in 92% yield (3.00 g, 18.0 mmol).
