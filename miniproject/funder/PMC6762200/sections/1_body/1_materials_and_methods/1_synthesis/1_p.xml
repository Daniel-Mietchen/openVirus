<p>Solvents were purchased from Vetec (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Benzyl alcohols, pent-4-yn-1-ol, methanesulfonyl chloride, sodium azide, triethylamine, propargyl bromide, acetophenones, and indan-1,3-dione were procured from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States) and used as received. Eugenol was extracted via hydrodistillation from cloves purchased in the local market in Viçosa, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, and subsequently purified by column chromatography (

 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 MNR Spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, United States) at 300 MHz and 75 MHz, respectively, using CDCl

 </sub> as solvents. NMR data are presented as follows: chemical shift (
 <italic>δ</italic>) in ppm, multiplicity, the number of protons, and 
 <italic>J</italic> values in Hertz (Hz). Multiplicities are shown as the following abbreviations: s (singlet), brs (broad singlet), d (doublet), d
 <sub>ap</sub> (apparent doublet), dd (doublet of a doublets), t (triplet), brd (broad doublet), ddt
 <sub>ap</sub> (apparent doublet of doublets of triplets), q (quartet), quint (quintet), and m (multiplet). Some signals in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were described as multiplets due to the 
 <sup>19</sup>F-
 <sup>13</sup>C coupling. IR spectra were obtained using a Varian 660-IR equipped with GladiATR (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) scanning from 4000 to 500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Analytical thin-layer chromatography analysis was conducted on aluminum-backed, pre-coated silica gel plates using different solvent systems. TLC plates were visualized using potassium permanganate solution, phosphomolybdic acid solution and/or UV light. Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (60–230 mesh). Melting points were determined using a MQAPF-302 melting point apparatus (Microquimica, Santa Catarina, Brazil) and are uncorrected. Solvents were dried using standard procedures described in the literature [
