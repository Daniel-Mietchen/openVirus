<p>The inhibitory enzymatic activity of compound 
 <bold>35</bold>, the one most active against the WNV NS2-NB3 protease, was evaluated at eight different concentrations (66 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>–0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) using the protease assay as described above. Fluorescence was measured in triplicate wells at intervals of 30 s for 5 min in three independent experiments. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, United States), using four-parameter nonlinear regression analysis (Hill slope method).
