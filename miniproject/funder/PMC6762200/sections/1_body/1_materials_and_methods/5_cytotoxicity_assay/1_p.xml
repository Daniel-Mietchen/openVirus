<p>The cytotoxicity of compound 
 <bold>35</bold> was assessed using an MTT assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0223017.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. VERO cells (5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells) were seeded in 96-well plates. Each well contained 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each compound solution at different concentrations (1000, 250, 125, 63, 32, 17, 8 and 4 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>). The compound was diluted in MEM medium with 2% FBS and 1% DMSO. After 24 h of incubation at 37 
 <sup>o</sup>C, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the MTT solution (5%) was added to the wells. After 4 h at 37°C, the MTT solution was removed and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/well of DMSO was added to solubilize the formazan. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm in a microplate reader (Multiskan
 <sup>™</sup> GO Microplate Spectrophotometer–ThermoFisher
 <sup>®</sup>, Waltham, MA, United States). The data were analyzed and CC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined using GraphPad Prism 6.
