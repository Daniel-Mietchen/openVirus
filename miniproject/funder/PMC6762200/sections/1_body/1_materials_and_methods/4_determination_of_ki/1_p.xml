<p>Three different concentrations (2, 4 and 8 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) of inhibitor 
 <bold>35</bold> and five different concentrations of substrate pERTKR-AMC (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mmol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) were tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against the WNV protease (37.04 nmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> protein, 1 ng 
 <italic>μ</italic>L
 <sup>-1</sup>). Fluorescence was measured in triplicate wells at an interval of 30 s. The velocity values (RFU/minute) were then calculated for each substrate/inhibitor pair. K
 <sub>i</sub> values were calculated with GraphPad Prism software 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, United States) with non-linear regression in the competitive inhibition mode of enzyme-kinetics.
