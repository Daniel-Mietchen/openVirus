<p>In order to assess the activity of the synthesized compounds on WNV NS2B-NS3pro, recombinant WNV NS2B-NS3 protease (catalog number SE-2907, already purified and activated) and fluorescent substrate pERTKR-AMC (catalog number ES013) were purchased from R &amp; D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, United States). Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold>, 
 <bold>23</bold>–
 <bold>49</bold>, and 
 <bold>51</bold>–
 <bold>63</bold> were dissolved in pure dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); solutions were then diluted in a buffer to obtain working solutions with a final concentration of 1% v/v DMSO. A volume of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of purified NS2B-NS3pro (final concentration of 1 ng 
 <italic>μ</italic>L
 <sup>-1</sup>) diluted in a buffer (50 mmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> Tris, 30% (v/v) glycerol, pH 9.5) was incubated with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each compound (final concentration of 16 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol L
 <sup>-1</sup>) in a 96-well black plate for 30 min at 21–22°C. After this time, the assay was initiated by addition of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the substrate (40 mmol L
 <sup>-1</sup> –initial concentration). A solution containing a buffer and DMSO was used as negative control on the same plate. The blank contained 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the buffer and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the substrate. The fluorescence intensity was continuously recorded at a 360 nm excitation wavelength and at an emission wavelength of 460 nm using a SpectraMax
 <sup>®</sup> M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San José, CA, United States). Compounds which effectively inhibited the enzyme were selected for further biological assays. Analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office Software) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The assays were conducted in triplicate during three isolated experiments, and the statistical analyses were conducted by utilizing the multiple comparisons of one-way ANOVA.
