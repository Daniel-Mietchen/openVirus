<p id="Par20">Studies in many counties have evaluated the seasonality of newly notified TB cases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These reports have indicated various factors that can explain the mechanisms underlying TB seasonality, including patient lifestyle, temperature, climate region, sunlight, vitamin D deficiency, and air pollution [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In Japan, although TB incidence has gradually declined since 2007 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the seasonal variation of TB incidence was similar over the observed 9 year period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. 2). The overall age distribution of newly notified TB cases has become concentrated in older adults. Among newly notified TB cases in 2007–2015, 60.6 and 43.8% of all cases were in patients aged ≥65 and ≥ 75 years, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A plausible reason for the large number of TB cases seen in older populations is that Japan presently has the oldest population in the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This high number of older people relates to an increase in the population who experienced latent TB infection in previous life years. Historically, Japan had been considered a high-burden TB country, and TB was the number one cause of death approximately 50 years ago [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is thought that most TB cases in older populations may be caused by reactivation of latent TB infection contracted at a young age. Thus, the seasonality of all TB cases may be related to the seasonality for reactivation of latent TB infection. Previously, a study in Japan indicated that the seasonality of TB notification differed among various forms of TB, including pleural TB, smear-positive pulmonary TB, and lymph node TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although reactivation of latent TB may present some of these forms, the seasonality of reactivated latent TB differs from the types of TB in the previous report. In addition, previous studies have only investigated the number of TB cases according to the different forms of TB and have not statistically examined seasonal variation using Roger’s test.
