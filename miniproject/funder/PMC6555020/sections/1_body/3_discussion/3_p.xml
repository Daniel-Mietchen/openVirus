<p id="Par21">Therefore, in this study, we assessed the seasonal variation of newly notified TB cases in Japan according to stratified age groups, using the Roger’s test. We found no significant seasonality in TB cases among age groups &lt; 5 and 5–14 years; however, significant seasonality was seen in the remaining age groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Younger people generally acquire TB as a new, recent infection that progresses over a short period of time to onset. Therefore, the delay between disease onset and diagnosis can be short in young patients [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); however, one study indicated that the frequency of mild pediatric TB cases has been increasing [
