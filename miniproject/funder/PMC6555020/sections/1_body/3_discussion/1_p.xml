<p id="Par19">The present study revealed seasonality of newly notified TB cases in Japan, particularly during the late spring and summer seasons. However, TB cases in patients aged ≤15 years, who may have been infected recently, demonstrated no significant seasonality. Moreover, monthly trends differed according to age group and sex. The highest peaks of monthly incidence in patients aged ≥15 years were concentrated in June and July. The epidemic period tended to be longer with increasing age, indicating that patients may have experienced reactivation of latent TB infection.</p>
