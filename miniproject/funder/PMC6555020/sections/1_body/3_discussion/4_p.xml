<p id="Par22">We found that the epidemic monthly peaks for age groups 15–24 and 25–44 years occurred from April to June and June to August, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These results are compatible with those of studies conducted in the United Kingdom [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and Hong Kong indicating that seasonality for TB incidence is highest in late spring or early summer, owing to indoor crowding in the wintertime. This season-specific risk factor of TB incidence in these age groups might be similar to the conditions of TB cases in Japan. In addition, one of the main routes of TB detection in Japan is via regular health check-ups among schoolchildren and workers, which is regulated by the Industrial Safety and Health Act [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The fixed timing of annual health checkups in Japan may contribute to the seasonality of TB cases in these age groups. School-age children in Japan are required to receive a health checkup at the beginning of the school year, in April or May. In contrast, the timing of health checkups for adult workers is at the beginning of the fiscal year, which is usually in June for many Japanese companies. A regulated health checkup is provided, which includes a chest radiograph examination. New TB cases are commonly reported at the time of these regular checkups. Thus, the seasonal peaks of TB cases tend to match the timing of health checkups among school-age children and working populations. This result emphasizes the need to adopt measures for early diagnosis of TB among these active populations.
