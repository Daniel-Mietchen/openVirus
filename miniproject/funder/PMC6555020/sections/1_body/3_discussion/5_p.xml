<p id="Par23">The incidence of TB among older adults in Japan is extremely high compared with other age groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A Japanese study indicated that the number of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases among patients aged ≥70 years increased by 2.5 times from 1980 to 2000, and most patients had been infected with TB bacilli in the past [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In the present study, epidemic peaks for TB cases among people aged 65–74 years tended to be longer than those for younger people and appeared from late spring to early winter. However, the monthly peak in male groups started in March and declined in September and November; monthly peaks in female groups started in June and did not decline until December. This finding may be explained by reactivation of latent TB infection in older adults, irrespective of sex, owing to aging, biological senescence, and immunologic change. In addition, a variety of viral and bacterial respiratory infectious diseases exhibit winter seasonality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], which may increase susceptibility of individuals to infection by suppressing host defense capacity and concealing disease manifestation in patients with latent TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The reported findings of experimental studies imply that the number of natural killer cells and CD4 T-cells increase in winter and are associated with increased blood levels of interleukin-6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This could be a reason that the lowest epidemic peaks were observed in January and February in all age groups ≥15 years in our study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, seasonality causes a delay in health care-seeking behaviors, especially for male patients aged 65–74 years, who tend to prefer staying at home in the winter season. As a result, the timing of epidemic monthly peaks in male patients within this age group starts in March (e.g., the start of warmer weather in early spring), whereas those in females begins in June. Furthermore, a study suggested that spring surges in TB cases may be owing to delays in the diagnosis of wintertime disease that presents as common seasonal symptoms, including cough and fever with viral upper respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, it can be speculated that the proper diagnosis of TB during its course would be delayed more frequently in winter [
