<p id="Par7">The seasonality of TB incidence has been widely reported in different parts of the world, and understanding season-specific risk factors for active TB can help in developing national TB control policies; however, previous studies have reported conflicting incidence peaks of TB in spring, summer, and winter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the fluctuation of TB during particular times of the year remain unclear, several studies have suggested that environmental factors (including cold weather, sunlight, air pollution) and social factors (such as crowding, person-to-person contact, and health care-seeking behavior) contribute to the seasonality of TB incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, TB occurs not only via a recent infection that progresses rapidly but also via reactivation of TB infection later in life, after prolonged latency [

In Japan, a super-aging society, the frequency of TB cases among patients aged ≥80 years was 37.7% of all newly registered TB cases to the Japanese TB patient registration system in 2016, and the number of latent TB cases has been increasing in older populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although a possible link between vitamin D deficiency and latent TB has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], active TB can arise as a consequence of reactivation of latent TB infection following compromise of the anti-mycobacterial immune response. Reactivation of latent TB infection in older adults may be influenced by decreased immunity caused by aging. However, season-specific risk factors for newly notified TB cases in Japan, including reactivation of latent TB infection, have not yet been fully investigated. In addition, a previous report on TB seasonality in Japan indicated that the trend of seasonality varies according to the form of TB, including childhood TB (age 0–14 years), pleural TB in younger populations, smear-positive TB, and lymph node TB [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, previous studies have not included statistical analyses to test the cyclic trend of TB seasonality.
