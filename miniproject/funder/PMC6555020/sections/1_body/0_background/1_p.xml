 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which is categorized as an intermediate TB-burden country. In contrast, the most of industrialized countries are categorized as low-burden TB countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A better understanding of whether Japan has specific reasons for remaining the intermediate burden of TB is urgently required, to reduce the number of TB cases in the country.
