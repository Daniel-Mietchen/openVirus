<p id="Par25">Pulmonary TB in Japan exhibits seasonality among people older than 15â€‰years of age, with a peak in summer. Monthly trends differ according to age groups. The epidemic period tends to be longer with increasing age in patients who may have reactivated latent TB infection. Health checkups in young adults, reactivation of latent TB infection with aging, and lifestyle habits among older adults may be season-specific risk factors for TB incidence. The early detection of TB, and enhancing clinical practice in TB specialized and non-TB specialized hospitals would be crucial for improving the clinical management on TB patients in Japan. Our results will assist in further investigations to clarify the specific factors leading to seasonality in TB incidence.</p>
