 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the evaluation of newly notified TB cases in stratified age groups, according to sex. TB cases among age groups ≥15 years exhibited significant seasonal variation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3n</xref>) whereas the age groups 0–4 and 5–14 years showed no significant seasonal variation in either male (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>) or female groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, d). The highest peak incidence of TB cases in age groups ≥15 years differed according to age and sex. TB cases among females aged 25–44 years started to increase in May and the epidemic period continued through December, with the exception of November (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). This tendency was similar in higher age groups among females (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>j, l, n). On the contrary, among males aged 25–44 years, the lowest peak month started in September, and incidence remained low until February (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). This trend was seen in male age groups 45–64 years and 65–74 years, except in October for males aged 65–74 years. The monthly trend in males aged ≥75 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>m) was similar to that in females in the same age group; however, the lowest peak months among males were observed in January–March whereas those among females were only in January and February (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>n).
