<p id="Par16">From 2007 and 2015, a total of 199,856 newly notified pulmonary TB cases (male patients, 62.2%) were reported in Japan that were eligible for the present study. The distributions of the number of newly notified pulmonary TB cases in Japan between 2007 and 2015 during each season, according to sex, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The number of TB cases tended to decrease annually and the shapes of epidemic waves were similar in both sexes, presenting a high in summer and a low in winter seasons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the frequency of TB cases in each season according to sex and age group. The highest frequency of TB cases in each season was observed in the age group ≥75 years (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although the epidemic peak among all cases appears high in summer and low in winter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), the peaks vary when presented according to stratified age groups: spring in the age group 15–24 years, summer in the group aged 25–44 years, winter for ages 45–64 years, fall and winter in the age group 65–74 years, and fall in the group aged ≥75 years. The frequency of TB cases in the age groups ≤4 years and 5–14 years were low and nearly the same in each season.
