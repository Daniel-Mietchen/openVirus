<p id="Par9">We used data obtained from TB surveillance by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare in Japan and the Tuberculosis Surveillance Center, between 2007 and 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Japan, TB has been classified as a Category 2 Infectious Disease according to the “Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases” (the Infectious Diseases Control Law), enforced 2007 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Under this regulation, if physicians diagnose a patient with tuberculosis, they are required to immediately notify the public health center. This obligation applies for all TB patients who visit any hospital in Japan, regardless of nationality or ethnicity. Along with this law, a new computerized tuberculosis surveillance system was launched in 2007, which contains a more detailed and more accurate TB registration system than the previous system, including rapid registration and unduplicated registration. Therefore, 100% of patients with TB who visited hospitals in Japan between 2007 and 2015 could be included in this study. Under this condition, in this study, the newly notified TB cases was defined as a newly registered TB case in Japanese TB patient registration system.
