<p id="Par14">To calculate seasonal variations in the incidence data between 2007 and 2015, we summed the number of newly notified TB cases in each month for each year. We used the significance test for seasonal variation proposed by Roger, which evaluates the significance of cyclic trends according to the efficient score vector calculated for one seasonal peak [
