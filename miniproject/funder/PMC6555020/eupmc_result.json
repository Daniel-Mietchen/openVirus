    "BACKGROUND:The seasonality of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) incidence may indicate season-specific risk factors that could be controlled if they were better understood. The aims of this study were to elucidate how the incidence of TB changes seasonally and to determine the factors influencing TB incidence, to reduce the TB burden in Japan. METHODS:We assessed the seasonality of newly notified TB cases in Japan using national surveillance data collected between 2007 and 2015. To investigate age and sex differences, seasonal variation was analyzed according to sex for all cases and then by stratified age groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years). We used Roger's test to analyze the cyclic monthly trends in seasonal variation of TB incidence. RESULTS:A total of 199,856 newly notified TB cases (male, 62.2%) were reported over the past 9-year period. Among them, 60.6% involved patients aged ≥65 years. Overall, the peak months of TB incidence occurred from April to October, excluding September. In the analysis stratified by age group, a significant seasonal variation in TB cases was observed for age groups ≥15 years, whereas no seasonal variation was observed for age groups ≤14 years. For female patients aged ≥25 years, the peak TB epidemic period was seen from June to December, excluding November. Male patients in the same age groups exhibited declining TB incidence from September to March. CONCLUSIONS:TB incidence exhibits seasonality in Japan for people aged > 15 years and peaks in summer to fall. Monthly trends differ according to age and sex. For age groups ≥25 years, cases in women showed longer peaks from June to December whereas cases in men declined from September to December. These results suggest that the seasonality of TB incidence in Japan might be influenced by health checkups in young adults, reactivation of latent TB infection with aging, and lifestyle habits in older adults. These findings can contribute to establishing the potential determinants of TB seasonality in Japan."
