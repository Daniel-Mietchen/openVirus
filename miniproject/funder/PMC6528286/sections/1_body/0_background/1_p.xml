<p id="Par13">Rural communities throughout the USA need evidence-based interventions to reduce the consequences of the opioid epidemic (e.g., HIV and viral hepatitis outbreaks, overdose fatalities) among people who inject drugs (PWID) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Syringe services programs (SSPs) are effective structural interventions that have demonstrated public health benefits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Through the provision of sterile injection equipment, SSPs prevent the spread of HIV/HCV infections among PWID, resulting in significant cost savings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, SSPs may offer wraparound services, including HIV/HCV testing, naloxone distribution, and linkages to other services [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although there is consensus in the literature regarding the benefits of SSPs, most studies examined their implementation in urban areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This creates an important gap in the literature given the ongoing vulnerability for HIV/HCV outbreaks among PWID in rural communities [
