<p id="Par67">This study fills an important gap in the literature by enhancing our understanding of the public health implications of suspending a SSP that primarily served a rural PWID population. Additionally, our research gives a voice to PWID in a city where they were excluded from evaluations of the KCHD SSP [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Our participantsâ€™ voice is a step forward for public health in West Virginia as an evaluation of the KCHD SSP put forth by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources did not include the perspective of a single participant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While the KCHD SSP was not perfect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], objective and balanced assessments of its operations should have, at a minimum, included the voices of those PWID who used the program.
