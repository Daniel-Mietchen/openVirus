Described by a 24-year-old woman: “Since the exchange closed? I thought it [naloxone] disappeared into thin air or something because I have not seen not a one…Oh it’s been months. Months.” A 29-year-old man similarly said, “You can’t get them [naloxone] no more…Don’t nobody got it no more. You won’t see nobody with any of them now.” Many of the participants assumed that the KCHD naloxone program ceased operations along with the SSP, and very few were aware of other ways to access it. Several participants identified that not regularly going to the health department for syringe access was associated with decreased naloxone access as it was an ancillary service they received while interacting with the SSP. As a result, participants overwhelmingly believed that naloxone is not as prevalent in the community and that PWID are more likely to overdose.</p>
