 <italic>aeypti</italic> mosquitoes from Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nairobi were able to transmit DENV-2, a total of 505 mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious blood meal with average titers of 10
 <sup>6.9–7.1</sup> PFU/ml and evaluated at the minimum/maximum temperatures of the three study cities. Although there was no significant difference in dissemination or transmission rates between mosquitoes from each of the three cities, both dissemination and transmission rates increased with an increase in holding temperature (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For mosquitoes held at 22, 28, or 31°C, dissemination rates were 2/140 (1%), 25/182 (14%), and 27/183 (15%), respectively. The dissemination rates for mosquitoes held at either 28 or 31°C were significantly higher than the dissemination rate for mosquitoes held at 22°C (Fisher’s exact test, p &lt; 0.0001). For mosquitoes held at 22, 28, or 31°C, transmission rates were 1/140 (1%), 2/179 (1%), and 9/179 (5%), respectively. Similarly, mosquitoes held at 31°C had a significantly higher transmission rate (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.048) than those held at 22°C, and a higher transmission rate that approached significance (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.061) when compared to those held at 28°C. Of relevance is that with the exception of two mosquitoes from Mombasa, none of the mosquitoes held at 22°C developed a disseminated infection, and only one of the two (1/140 for all those tested at 22°C) transmitted the virus.
