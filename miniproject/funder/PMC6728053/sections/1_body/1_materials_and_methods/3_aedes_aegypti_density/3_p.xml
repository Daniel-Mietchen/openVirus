<p>Mosquitoes were morphologically identified using taxonomic keys [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected was recorded and used to estimate the vector density. This was done by dividing the total number of female 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes collected by the number of traps for each city. Similarly, the blood-fed 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes trapped were used to perform a blood meal analysis.
