<p>Due to the lack of entomological surveillance, vector abundance was estimated retrospectively using entomological records. Regarding the 2007 outbreak, 9.2 biting females per human per day were estimated (with a population density of 25.2 persons per hectare in the study area) using 2008 human landing capture (HLC) experiments [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A lower mosquito/human ratio was estimated in Lazio at the time of the first symptom onset in 2017, with the ratio ranging between 1.9 and 7.3 in coastal sites and between 0.4 and 2.6 in urban areas [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The latter estimates were obtained by using a mathematical model similar to the one adopted in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but calibrated on captured female adult mosquitoes during 2012. To the best of our knowledge, no other measures of vector abundance have been reported so far.
