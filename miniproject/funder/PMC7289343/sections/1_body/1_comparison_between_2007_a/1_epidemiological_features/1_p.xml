 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the epidemiological parameters measured (or estimated) in the 2 Italian outbreaks. In general, both outbreaks started in small towns, yet small clusters of cases (&lt;10 cases; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) were detected also in large cities close to the main focal areas (2007: Bologna, 5 cases out of 373,026 inhabitants, 75 km from initial cluster [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suspected local transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; 2017: Rome, 80 out of 2,873,486 inhabitants, 62 km from initial cluster [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], confirmed local transmission without epidemiological link with Anzio). The 2017 outbreak had a wider geographical spread compared to the 2007 outbreak (
