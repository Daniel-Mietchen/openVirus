<p>Estimates of vector competence have been computed for both viruses involved in the 2007 and 2017 outbreaks. The results, available in Fortuna and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], showed a comparable infection and transmission rate for both lineages. Infection and transmission rates were defined as number of positive bodies/total fed females and as number of positive saliva/positive bodies, respectively. Batches of 10 mosquitoes were processed for each viral strain at 0, 3, 14, and 20 days postexposure. In 2007, infection rates ranged from 100% (day 0) to 40% (day 20) while transmission rates ranged from 86% (day 3) to 50% (day 14). In 2017, infection rates ranged from 100% (day 0) to about 50% (day 3), while transmission rates ranged from 75% (day 3) to 80% (day 14). Interestingly, the transmission efficiency computed as number of positive saliva/total fed females was almost identical for both viruses, 41% (2007) and 42% (2017) [
