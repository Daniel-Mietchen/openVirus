<p>During 2017, Italy experienced also a large spread of measles, with almost 5,000 cases reported, of which 1 out of 3 cases were in the Lazio region (incidence rate: 28.8 cases/100,000 inhabitants). It should be noticed that CHIKV-related skin rash is usually morbilliform (measles-like) [

Differently from measles, after an initial facial flushing, the face is often spared by the CHIKV-related exanthema [
