<p>A common postacute complication is a chronic and disabling joint pain, usually lasting for few months to up to 3 years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that, after 1–3 years from acute CHIKV infection, one-third of patients complain of arthralgia, frequently associated with reduced functional ability, with episodic relapse and recovery periods. Chronic arthralgia is a frequent complication of acute CHIKV disease with a significant long-lasting reduction of functional ability, adding costs to the public health system beyond the strict outbreak time period. A recent cost-effectiveness analysis has shown that in Italy, the average cost of illness per CHIKV case was €424.9 (95% CI: 280.4, 795.5), and its relative burden in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) was 0.45 years (95% CI: 0.01, 2.57) [

Additionally, the public health impact of arboviral infection, including CHIKV infection, is particularly relevant for the safety of the blood-transfusion system, especially during the outbreak. Precautionary measures applied in Italy to regions where CHIKV infection occurred include a 3–4 weeks deferral of donors who stayed (even for a short-time) in the geographical areas affected, as well as a 4-week deferral after the resolution of symptoms for donors who were diagnosed with CHIKV infection [

The application of quarantine based on active recall of all donors and additional inactivation procedure for platelet concentrates caused significant economic and logistic impacts on the management of the blood-transfusion system at both the local and national level [
