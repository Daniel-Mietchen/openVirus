<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV; genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, family Togaviridae) is a positive-stranded RNA mosquito-borne alphavirus that has been causing sustained epidemics in India and Southeast Asia countries in the last decades [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Although CHIKV fever is a self-limiting disease, with a clinical syndrome often resolving within few days [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], ongoing symptoms (sequelae) can include chronic polyarthralgia that could last up to 5 years affecting patient daily and social life, creating an additional economic burden on the public health system [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, several CHIKV outbreaks have been documented in temperate regions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and many urban areas of Southern Europe have a non-negligible risk of CHIKV outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008159.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, general practitioners and public health authorities need to be prepared to face this emerging arboviral risk [
