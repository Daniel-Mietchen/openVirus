<p id="para0016">For subjects younger than 10 years, proxy written informed consent was provided by a parent or legal guardian. For adolescents (10–14 years), verbal assent was obtained and proxy written informed consent was provided by a parent or a legal guardian. For adults (≥15 years), written informed consent was obtained. If an elderly patient lacked the ability to provide informed consent, their legally authorized representative was asked to provide proxy written informed consent.
