<p id="para0021">The manufacturers and models of CT scanners and instructions used for chest imaging varied across different Chinese hospitals. All scans were performed with the patients in supine position without administration of contrast material. The equipment operating parameters included 0·5 mm or 0·75 mm collimation at 5 mm intervals. Each scan was obtained during breath holds at end inspiration and end expiration. Images were obtained with both mediastinal (width 350–450 HU; level 40–60 HU) and parenchymal (width 1500–2000 HU; level 450–600 HU) window settings. Two chest radiologists reviewed the images independently, reaching a final agreement when there was a discrepancy. The radiologists were blinded to clinical information or prognosis for these patients, except for the knowledge that the images were from A(H7N9) survivors.</p>
