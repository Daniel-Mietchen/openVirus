<p id="para0038">There were several limitations in this study. First, since we only included 61 of 1,568 A(H7N9) cases reported in China to date, our findings may not be representative of all A(H7N9) patients who survived hospitalization in China. Second, data were not available for all clinical and laboratory variables during hospitalization or for all follow-up time points. Baseline pulmonary function testing data and CT scans prior to A(H7N9) illness were not available for comparison. Finally, we lacked a comparison group of patients who survived severe respiratory illness without A(H7N9) virus infection.</p>
