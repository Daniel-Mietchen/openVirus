<p id="para0037">It has been reported that cross-group reactive stalk antibody responses can be boosted after A(H7N9) virus infection, with induction of a broad antibody response to seasonal influenza A viruses 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. We previously assessed the level of antibodies against seasonal influenza A and A(H7N9) viruses and observed that 17·8% (8/45) of A(H7N9) patients who survived severe disease had 4-fold elevations in HAI titers to seasonal influenza A viruses during 15 months after illness onset of A(H7N9) virus infection. In comparation, levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) virus-specific antibodies for the other 37 patients were relatively stable until 15 months after A(H7N9) illness onset, and were not significantly different between A(H7N9) patients and healthy controls 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, these data cannot determine whether survivors of severe illness from A(H7N9) virus infection have a higher or lower risk of infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) viruses. We also explored the longevity of A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody titers over time. The main finding is that A(H7N9) patients who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with patients who experienced moderate disease. HAI antibody titers of A(H7N9) patients reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months, and on average HAI antibody titers of ≥80 and ≥40 were present until 11 months and 22 months, respectively
