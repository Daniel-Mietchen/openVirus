<p>As has been noted elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], males were at greater risk of dengue infection. This could be due to increased mobility, workplace exposure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and/or increased health-seeking behaviour [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Interestingly, sex-specific Zika attack rates were positively skewed towards females. Indeed 74% of total cases were among females with a trend towards a greater burden among those of sexual reproductive age. The evidence is therefore suggestive of increased female susceptibility to Zika infection, as has been noted in recent literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However this could be confounded by both increased health-seeking behaviour among this risk group as well as the presence of pregnant women among our data. And yet similar results are prominent in other articles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). To better understand this trend, we used GBS as a possible proxy to represent true Zika infection distribution between the sexes. The data conversely showed that adjusted, stratified GBS attack rates were skewed towards males, which is counter to the trend one might expect were females more susceptible to Zika infection. Yet upon examination of global GBS rates in a systematic review and meta-analysis, Sejvar et al., (2011) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] demonstrated that attack rates are on average higher (almost double) in males than females, which persists and steadily rises with age [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In relation to the data seen here, the gap between male and female rates is narrower than expected, which might indicate absolute increased infection of Zika among women in Dominican Republic, but one should caution that the data from Sejvar et al., 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] were modelled, which prevents overarching parallels being drawn. Considering the data and variety of plausible confounders, true associations to explain the higher incident rate among females remain evasive. While there might still be a biological cause, it is more likely that successful, targeted media campaigns are influencing the health seeking behaviour of women of reproductive age, in turn leading to over-reporting of Zika infections among women.
