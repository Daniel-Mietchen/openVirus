<p>Surveillance data were analysed using STATA 13.0 (STATA Corp, 2016), RStudio, version 0.99.903 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Microsoft Excel [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006876.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Descriptive results comprised means, medians, interquartile ranges and proportions. Age categories were defined by decade unless otherwise specified. Where necessary, measures of frequency were age-standardised to produce adjusted metrics. Estimated national census data for dengue (2015), Zika (2016) and Guillain-Barre (2016) were used for all calculations. Pearsonâ€™s Chi-squared test for independence was used to compare odds of infection between categorical variables, namely sex and event.
