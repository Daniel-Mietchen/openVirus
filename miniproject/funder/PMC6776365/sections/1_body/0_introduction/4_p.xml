<p>Here, we explore the roles of related intrinsic and extrinsic factors in transmission dynamics of HFRS caused by SEOV in the pre-vaccination era. Intrinsic factors refer mainly to herd immunity or host population dynamics, and extrinsic factors include external forces such as climatic or environmental factors. We collected detailed epidemiological and rodent trapping data from a typical SEOV-endemic area of China, Huludao City, where the Norway rat is the dominant rodent species in residential areas [

Additionally, we investigated potential causal relationships among the environmental variables, the population dynamics of the rodent reservoir, and the incidence of HFRS. We subsequently constructed a mathematical model to quantify intrinsic transmission dynamics and extrinsic effects.
