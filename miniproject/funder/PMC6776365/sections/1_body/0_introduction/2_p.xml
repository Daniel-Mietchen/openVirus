<p>HFRS epidemics vary significantly across seasons and are influenced by extrinsic factors across regions, like climate [

Following the Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome outbreaks that occurred in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States in 1993, the correlation between hantavirus infections and climatic conditions was described using a cascade hypothesis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The hypothesis posited that favorable climate conditions would lead to more available food, and to greater rodent population sizes, thereby enhancing the risk of hantavirus infections. Similarly, the 2007 HFRS outbreak in temperate southern Europe may have been caused by increased population density of the bank vole, the vector of Puumala virus (PUUV), which, in turn, may have resulted from abundant food due to preceding warmer than usual autumn and winter weather [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In central China, higher temperature and precipitation in the previous summer led to favorable food conditions for the striped field mouse, the rodent host of HTNV, which led to an autumn peak in incidence of HFRS [
