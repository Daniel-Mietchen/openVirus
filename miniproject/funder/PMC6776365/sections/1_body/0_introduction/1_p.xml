<p>There are 60,000â€“100,000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne zoonosis, reported annually, globally [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HFRS is caused by subtypes of hantavirus, each of which is associated with a distinct rodent species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Humans are usually infected by inhaling air contaminated with saliva, feces, or urine from infected rodents [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. China is the main epidemic region for HFRS, and accounts for 90% of cases, globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The two predominant hantavirus strains circulating in endemic areas of China are Hantaan virus (HTNV), which is carried by striped field mice (
