<p>Our results highlight the crucial role of mass immunization campaigns and rat extermination program in HFRS transmission control. It should be noted that SEOV infections began to rise again after 2013 in the post-vaccination era. In HFRS endemic areas where hosts are mainly wild rodents, fluctuations in the population density of wild rodents, such as striped field mouse or bank vole, are influenced by climatic factors and can mediate the effect of climate on the risk of HFRS transmission, mainly because of the close association between climate and host food supply [

However, in the SEOV-endemic area, the CCM results showed that the change in population density of the Norway rat was insensitive to climate variability. Our results differed from those of a previous study which found a relationship among the virus-carrying index, climate variables, and HFRS incidence by using structural equation modeling (SEM). This study reported that the Norway rat served as an important mediator of disease transmission when climate variability was found to influence the risk of HFRS [

(2009) sampled quarterly. Additionally, the SEM analysis used a latent variable to account for measurement error but did not evaluate the contribution of specific variables to the transmission dynamics.
