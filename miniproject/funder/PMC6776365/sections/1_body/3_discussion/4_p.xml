<p>Our findings indicated that an abiotic factor, relative humidity, was a critical indicator of HFRS risk in the SEOV-endemic area of Huludao City, which is consistent with previous studies in which SEOV was the main virus type [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We assumed that relative humidity may be associated with the survival or infectivity of SEOV in the environment, the activity of the rodent, and human hosts or the transmission process, although the underlying mechanism is not clear. We do not know of any relevant experiments on how environmental conditions affect survival of SEOV outside the host, while PUUV and HTNV have been confirmed to have longer infective periods at low temperatures and high humidities in experimental environments [
