<p>The SEOV-related HFRS is posing a health threat to an increasing number of people. Although the Norway rat is found everywhere, SEOV cases are not. We suspect this may mainly be due to increased surveillance and attention focused on this pathogen, as SEOV previously caused many asymptomatic human infections previously. In conclusion, based on the longitudinal and complete dataset, our study yielded a proper framework for understanding the intrinsic transmission dynamics and extrinsic effects on HFRS risk caused by SEOV, especially at the human-animal-environment interface. The framework can be flexibly adjusted when more information is available. Furthermore, we provided clues to potential environmental drivers on SEOV transmission dynamics, which would be useful for further research related to public health issues.</p>
