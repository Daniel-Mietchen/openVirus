<p>Based on the causal relationship tested by CCM, we constructed a HFRS dynamic model containing the infected rodent population and seasonal contact rate to quantify the specific effect of relative humidity on risk of HFRS (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Materials and methods</xref> for details). We constructed two models: one containing relative humidity and the other without. The model with relative humidity had a slightly better fit when the simulated HFRS cases correlated well with the observations and 75% of the variance was explained (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.75, DIC = 5.57) (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.72, DIC = 7.89). The optimal models also captured the main seasonal patterns of both the rodent population density and reported cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007757.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Additionally, during winter–spring, the estimated seasonal contact rates peaked from February to April (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007757.g004">Fig 4</xref>), which may result from the behaviors of human and rodent. Most of the patients are farmers (77%) and it’s the slack time of winter-spring when people stay at home. Besides, due to the severe weather outside during that time, Norway rats would live and feed in closer proximity to human residence for favorable living conditions and available food, which could be a reason for the high contact rate. The trace plot of Markov chains and the posterior distribution for the parameters used in the optimal HFRS transmission model are shown in
