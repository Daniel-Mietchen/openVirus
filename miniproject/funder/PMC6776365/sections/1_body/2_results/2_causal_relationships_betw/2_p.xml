<p>Convergent cross mapping (CCM) was used to detect causality between these time series. However, rodent data had weak cross mapping skills for the climate variables. Only a marginally significant, weak causal effect was found between minimum temperature (with a 4-month lag, tp = -4) and absolute humidity (with a 3-month lag, tp = -3) on rodent population density, with cross map skills of 0.18 and 0.12, respectively (

To test the non-stationary (transient) correlation between Norway rat and climate variation, we conducted a further test of wavelet coherence analysis. The results showed scattered and small-sized distribution of significant areas with inconsistent phase differences (

In all, the combined results indicate that there might be a weak causal relationship between Norway rat and climate variables. Only relative humidity with a 1-month lag was identified as a significant causal factor for HFRS transmission (cross map skill, 0.86) by the CCM method (
