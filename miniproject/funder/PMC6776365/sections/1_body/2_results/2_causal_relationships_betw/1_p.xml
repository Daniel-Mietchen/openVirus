<p>We first examined the impact of land use and land cover changes on HFRS transmission. Land use changed very slightly in period I (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007757.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), so the effect of habitat and land use change on rodent hosts and disease transmission were minimal during this time period. We then conducted a cross-correlation analysis of the climate variables, rodent population density, and HFRS incidence. The Norway rat population was found to be positively correlated with mean temperature (Pearsonâ€™s

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), with the maximum correlation coefficients occurring at 3, 3, 4, 4, and 4-month time lags, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007757.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). HFRS incidence was strongly correlated with the climate variables. All the tested climate variables showed significant negative correlations with HFRS incidence, and maximum cross-correlations between temperature and HFRS incidence occurred at a lag of 3 months and other climate variables at a lag of 2 months (
