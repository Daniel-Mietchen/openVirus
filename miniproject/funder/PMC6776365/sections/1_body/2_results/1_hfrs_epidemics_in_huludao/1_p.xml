<p>During 1998 to 2015, 6796 HFRS cases were reported in Huludao City, with an annual incidence from 2.50 (1/100,000, minimum in 2008) to 26.99 (1/100,000, maximum in 2005). The pattern of HFRS incidence showed a significant seasonality with an annual peak in spring from March to May (

The epidemic variability could be divided into three periods: period I (1998–2004), characterized by a high-level of HFRS incidence of over 17.6 (1/100,000) and a stable periodicity without limited intervention; period II (2005–2012), vaccination campaign and rat extermination program were implemented simultaneously and the local HFRS incidence decreased dramatically to a relatively low level at 10.0 (1/100,000); period III (2013–2015), the incidence of HFRS gradually rebounded. By using wavelet analysis, we found changes in endemic periodicity after 2006 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007757.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), possibly due to the rat extermination program and mass vaccination campaign that were conducted beginning in 2005. Here, to reduce the effect of human interventions on disease dynamics, we focused our analysis on the study period between 1998 and 2004 (period I). In period I, a total of 3914 HFRS cases were reported. The local rodent community mainly comprised Norway rat and the house mouse, with the former accounting for 94.52% of the total. The population density of the rodents ranged from 4.89% to 7.28%, with two relatively low values in January of 1998 and 1999.
