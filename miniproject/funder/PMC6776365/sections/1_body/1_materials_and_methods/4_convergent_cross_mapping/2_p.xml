<p>Given the seasonality of HFRS incidence, climate variables, and rodent population density, the seasonal component and the response of HFRS risk and rodent population density to the anomalies of other variables were examined to avoid spurious correlations. For each variable, 1500 surrogate time series having the same degree of shared seasonality, but with randomized anomalies, were generated for seasonal surrogate test. For a specific variable, the month of year average (seasonal cycle) was calculated first, and the seasonal anomaly was represented by the difference between the observed value and the seasonal cycle. Then the random shuffling of the time series data of seasonal anomalies was added back to the season average [
