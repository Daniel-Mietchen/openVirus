<p>First, we modelled the Norway rat population dynamic model based on Verhulst-Pearl logistic growth model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], without consideration of SEOV infection, and identified the effect of climate on population fluctuation. Population fluctuations are regulated by an identical seasonal birth rate
