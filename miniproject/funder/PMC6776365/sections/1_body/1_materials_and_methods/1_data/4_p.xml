<p>Rodent population density was investigated indoors and outdoors by the powder-trace method on a monthly basis, obtained from the historical literature [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007757.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. According to the criteria, 400 powdered panels are placed in the special sites for spot checks across the city every month, of which 240 panels are set in restaurant, hotel, station and other public places where rodents are commonly found, and 160 panels are set in general household. Two powdered panels were placed in each room (about 15 m
 <sup>2</sup>) in selected spots. Outdoors, each panel was placed along a wall at 5â€“10 m intervals. All panels were set at night and recovered before sunrise. Rodent population density was calculated as the number of positive powdered panels (with footprints or tail tracks from rodents) divided by the number of effective powdered panels used.
