  <title>Detecting cross-map causality beyond shared seasonality of environmental drivers on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.</title>
  <p>(A) Time series of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) incidence (orange) and relative humidity (green). (B) The convergent cross mapping results at different time series length for HFRS incidence and relative humidity (RH) and surrogate RH (surr_RH) with 1-month lag (tp = -1). The causal relationship was regarded as significant (P &lt; 0.05) when the solid line (cross map skill of the observed data) exceeded the dashed line (surrogate data).</p>
