<p id="Par43">As a notifiable infectious disease, any case of dengue detected in the Brazilian public health system must be reported to the corresponding health authorities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Case notification relies on a passive surveillance framework in which disease reporting builds on patients seeking medical attention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, cases are often missed by the official reporting system because of non-severe presentations, lack of accessibility to health care infrastructure, misdiagnosis, or even misreporting. Thus, reported case counts are assumed to be an underestimation of the true disease burden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, availability of health data based on traditional public health surveillance is usually constrained by time, bureaucracy, and staffing, with a lag of 2 weeks for the best systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], partial notifications in high burden settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], or even complete lack of reporting due to political instability as recently evidenced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Timely disease reporting is critical for preparedness and executable real-time interventions to curb outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].
