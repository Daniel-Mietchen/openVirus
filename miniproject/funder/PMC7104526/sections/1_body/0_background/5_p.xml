<p id="Par45">For Brazil, digital tools to quantify dengue reporting have been previously explored, in fact Chan et al. (2011) inspired the creation of GDT in the first place, showing a strong correlation with dengue cases in Brazil, among other countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Moreover, Yang et al. (2017) recently used an autoregressive model with Google search queries as exogenous variables (ARGO) to predict dengue cases in Brazil and showed good model performance at the country level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Neither of these studies examined the ability of Google-derived data to characterize dengue incidence at the state level, and in fact, only few studies have examined Google-based algorithms at smaller political administrative levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To address this gap, we explore the ability of GHT to characterize weekly dengue cases from 2011 to 2016 in Brazil. For this goal, we used 19 dengue-related search terms for all 27 Brazilian states and quantified how Internet penetration data, demographic variables, and a standardized volatility index could determine a-priori where GHT might be a reliable tool.
