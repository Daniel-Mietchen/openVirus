<p id="Par41">Dengue fever is transmitted by the homonymous arthropod-borne virus (i.e., arbovirus) from the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes with a potential fifth serotype described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], all of them distributed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pathogen is mainly transmitted by

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Dengue disease symptoms range from asymptomatic, mild fever, rash, and joint pain (i.e., dengue with and without warning signs), to life threatening syndromes involving hemorrhagic fever and shock (i.e., severe dengue) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; severe clinical presentations are related with immunological cross-reactivity between dengue serotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As a viral infection, treatment is based mainly on support measures during the acute and critical phase of the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although there has been progress on the development of vaccines, more research is needed before they are used as an effective public health mechanism for control [
