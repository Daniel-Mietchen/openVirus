<p id="Par42">The burden of dengue fever is high; around half of the world population is estimated to be at risk of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and every year, ~â€‰100 million symptomatic cases are detected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This poses a significant burden to the health systems in at least 128 countries worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as well as economic impacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] that likely will expand to new regions in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Brazil, dengue was re-introduced in 1986 in the state of Roraima [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and quickly spread to the rest of the country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In 2018, the total number of cases reported in Brazil was 265,934 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and so far 1,439,471 cases have been reported in 2019 through August [
