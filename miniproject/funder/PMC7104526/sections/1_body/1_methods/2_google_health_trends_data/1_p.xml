<p>The private API of GHT provides Internet search query data starting in 2004. Queries are sampled from the overall Google dataset in the form of a relative proportion, dividing the number of searches for a specified term over a particular time interval (i.e., days, weeks, months, or years) by the total number of term searches in that time, and multiplied by a predefined constant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Thus, it differs from GT which provides a ranked score from 0 to 100 based on the highest frequency of searches in a particular period of time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. We obtained weekly GHT data for the same timeframe of dengue cases using 19 disease and mosquito vector related terms in Portuguese and English, including: “aedes”, “
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>”, “aedes egípcio”, “aegypti”, dengue”, “dengue é vírus”, “dengue fever”, “dengue hemorrhagic fever”, “dengue sintomas”, “dengue vírus”, “DENV”, “DHF” (i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever), “egípcio”, “mosquito”, “mosquito dengue”, “mosquitoes”, “novo vírus da dengue”, “sintomas da dengue”, and “vírus da dengue”. We downloaded the data on June 26th, 2017 and gathered information for the 27 Brazilian states and for the whole country.
