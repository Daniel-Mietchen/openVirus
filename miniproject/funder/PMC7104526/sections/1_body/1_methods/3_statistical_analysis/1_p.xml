<p id="Par48">We fitted a linear regression model using GHT search terms as predictors of dengue incidence at the state level and recorded the adjusted R squared statistic as the primary outcome measure (0/1). Then, we fitted a multiple linear regression model using all the terms retrieving information by state (i.e., all terms model). Due to the potential overlap from conceptually related terms (e.g., “aedes” and “
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>”), we also calculated Pearson’s correlation among terms and developed multiple linear regression models with those with a correlation less than 0.7 (i.e., uncorrelated terms model). Finally, we fitted models using four terms: “dengue”, “dengue sintomas”, “aedes”, and “mosquito”, which although correlated, have the potential to capture the full spectrum of searches considering the information they provide related to the disease and the mosquito vector (i.e., four terms model). We addressed the statistical differences between models with full vs. reduced number of terms, and between full and individual terms per state using pair-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA).
