<p id="Par51">Finally, to determine if variability in the signal of dengue incidence influences GHT accuracy, we computed a standardized volatility index for the dengue incidence data in each state. First, we normalized the dengue incidence time series, subtracting the mean and dividing it by its standard deviation. For this normalized time series, we averaged the absolute difference between each point in the data for each state—incidence per week in this case—to obtain a value representing the stability of dengue incidence (i.e., stable vs. unstable). All analyses were performed in R programming language [
