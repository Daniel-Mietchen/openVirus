<p id="Par49">Given the heterogeneous Internet access throughout Brazil, we analyzed the role that accessibility could play in explaining our ability to track dengue incidence via GHT. Since 2005, Brazil has monitored the accessibility of their population to information and communication technologies [

From all the available variables provided in this survey (~ 150), we used: (1) the total number of people above 10 years using Internet in the last 3 months, (2) the number of households that have used Internet in the last 3 months, (3) the number of people with mobile phones, and (4) the number of households with computers, as working predictors. In addition to these four variables, we used their logarithmic transformation considering their positive (i.e., right) skewed distribution, for a total of eight variables.
