<p id="Par50">We explored all the available demographic variables from the 2010 official census provided by the IBGE [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The census includes information at the municipality level for multiple socio-economic factors including education, sanitation, income, etc., with a total of 237 potential predictors. We aggregated the information to the state level and examined them together with their logarithmic transformations as explained above for a total of 474 variables. Because they represent information with different magnitudes in the form of total counts, percentages, and rates, we normalized all the variables before the analysis. We examined each variable individually with a pair-wise univariate linear regression using the R squared for GHT against dengue cases as a dependent variable; we selected those variables with an adjusted R squared higher than 0.6, and performed a Pearson’s correlation among those selected to keep those with a score below 0.8. We then performed a multiple linear regression using the same dependent variable. We compared the ability of the selected variables to quantify GHT usefulness in Brazil using a principal component analysis (PCA) with the 474 predictors and selecting those components recovering more than 90% of the variance. The Pearson’s correlation statistic was also implemented in order to assess the relatedness between Internet and demographic variables.
