<p id="Par46">We obtained weekly dengue case counts for Brazil and all its 27 states from January 1st, 2011 to July 31st 2016. Data was given by the Brazilian Ministry of Health as a weekly aggregated data sheet with cases identified as counts without any identity information (e.g., names, gender, age, etc) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. This data encompasses the number of confirmed and suspected dengue cases reported by the official surveillance system, which follows specific guidelines of mandatory disease notification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Incidence rates were calculated as the number of cases per week divided by the total population per state according to the official Brazilian population census of 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]; for our analysis we used incidence instead of case counts to allow comparisons of dengue burden between Brazilian states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].
