<p id="Par71">Digital epidemiology approaches based on GHT or other tools should be explored beyond country level to consider its actual ability to inform local public health departments. In the case of dengue in Brazil, 12 out of 27 states showed an adjusted R squared higher than 0.8, which suggests the potential ability of GHT to complement classical epidemiological surveillance, even though some states had low incidence during the 6-year study period (i.e., 2011â€“2016). Models developed with multiple terms were most informative than models using reduced sets or individual terms. Variables such as number of Internet users and total population per state are useful in determining where GHT could complement current surveillance strategies in several Brazilian states. Moreover, both variables benefit from the use of a standardized volatility index for selection of areas of GHT usefulness. The methods proposed here might be applied in other countries to test the ability of GHT to support dengue surveillance. Future studies might also explore the ability of GHT to track dengue using detailed measures of dengue transmission such as the force of infection, only confirmed cases, finer political boundaries (e.g., GHT data is available to particular cities in the world), or different temporal schemes.</p>
