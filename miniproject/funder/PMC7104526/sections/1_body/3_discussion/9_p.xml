<p id="Par67">There are some limitations and caveats to our study. For the Distrito Federal state, GHT data was available for half of the study period, thus, we tested the GHT against weekly dengue incidence only for the corresponding timeframe, which involved ~ 3 years. The state of Distrito Federal corresponds to a small geographical region established as the capital of the country in 1960 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); we hypothesize that the lack of data was an artifact of Google’ algorithm missing the corresponding state before November 2013. Although we do not have any specific evidence of this, it is possibly related to what has been called “blue team dynamics” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], that is, changes on the search engine can affect how and when GHT gathers data. In the same way, GHT retrieves information as a relative proportion of search volumes, as a consequence GHT data for the Brazilian states will not sum up to the same data at the country level and therefore GHT data for the whole country should be evaluated as an independent unit from its states [

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> where, for example, the term “DENV” was only available for the whole country and not for any particular state. Regardless, GHT’s relative proportion volume represents search patterns in an improved way than the ranked scores from GT. In the majority of studies using the latter, a transformation is needed in order to continue with the analysis [
