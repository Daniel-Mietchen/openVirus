<p id="Par65">Variables related to the total population per state were informative in determining GHT performance (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: demographic variables) and these predictors were highly correlated with the total number of Internet users (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], the total population per studied political unit, might be a reliable predictor to inform whether or not dengue surveillance based on digital epidemiology tools can complement traditional surveillance. However, other demographic predictors could also serve as indicators of GHT performance. We explored this possibility using various variable selection methods including Pearson’s correlation on the full 474 variables, a stepwise (i.e., forward and backward) multiple linear regression, and an elastic net regression with L1 normalization (i.e., Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator or Lasso) using leave-one-out cross validation fashion (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: variable selection). Although a combination of five demographic variables allowed us to develop an improved prediction than total population alone (adjusted R squared = 0.670), how those variables may translate to other countries is not immediately clear (e.g., percentage of population that lives in urban households with garbage collecting services; Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>: other demographic variables). In addition, models developed using multivariate linear regressions with different variable combinations never outperformed the model developed using PCA (Additional files

 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>), or those involving population and the standardized volatility index (Fig.
