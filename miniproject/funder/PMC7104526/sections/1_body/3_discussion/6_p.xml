<p id="Par64">Intuitively, the ability to determine if Internet data is going to be useful should depend on access to information and communication technologies. In this study, we found that the number of Internet users acts as a moderate predictor for GHT performance (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), this variable can be regarded as a good predictor. However, for states such as Amazonas, Distrito Federal, Paraiba, and Rio Grande do Norte, only relying on the number of Internet users would have been an equivocal signal of GHT usefulness; thus, our data support a case-by-case investigation of Internet data.
