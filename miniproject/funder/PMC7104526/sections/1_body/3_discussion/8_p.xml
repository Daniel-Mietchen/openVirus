<p id="Par66">The volatility index discussed here might also aid on addressing when to use GHT predictions for dengue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In the context of detailed Internet access data, a model considering volatility and Internet users might be a straightforward exploration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). From a practical perspective, due to the potential lack of fine-resolution data on Internet accessibility in other countries, the total number of people plus the described standardized volatility index might be useful indicators of GHT performance. Finally, as has been discussed previously, we also explored if the total number of dengue cases would be a useful predictor to assess GHT performance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], but this predictor was less useful than any of the others explored (i.e., GHT for all terms vs. logarithm of total number of dengue cases, adjusted R squared = 0.274).
