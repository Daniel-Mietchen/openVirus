<p id="Par62">Among the North and Northeast Brazilian macro-regions, Maranhão, Pará, and Sergipe have the lower dengue incidence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For these states, only Maranhão showed a good GHT fit (adjusted R squared = 0.859). The state of Alagoas showed a moderate dengue incidence aggregated across all years (=8.236x10e-5; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) but poor GHT behavior (adjusted R squared = 0.481) despite being surrounded by states with good GHT performance (e.g., adjusted R squared Pernambuco = 0.819 and Bahia = 0.647; Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). We expected Alagoas to have similar dynamics as the rest of its surrounding states due to similar environmental and epidemiological trends, all limited by the Atlantic Ocean with a comparable area extent (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, variability in local surveillance and mosquito control strategies might account for the differences [
