<p id="Par63">We suggest that multiple search terms should be explored when using GHT. In our case, only 7 from the initial 19 terms, retrieved information consistently in all the Brazilian states within our study period (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>), from the other terms, information was recovered only in specific instances (e.g., “dengue virus”, “dengue fever” for Bahia but not for Acré; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Models developed with all terms were statistically different from models developed with any of the subset term schemes (i.e., uncorrelated terms, four terms, individual terms) with the exception of ten comparisons. From them, Distrito Federal, Maranhão, Rio Grande do Norte, and Santa Catarina were states in which GHT adjusted R squared was higher than 0.8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and the four term model was not statistically different from the full term model (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 in an ANOVA pair-wise comparison). Still, this was not the case for any of the other comparisons (i.e., 318), and more importantly, not for any of the terms individually. We recommend gathering GHT data using multiple terms in order to track dengue incidence dynamics at the state level in Brazil, potentially, this approach would be useful in other countries. While the approach for determining search terms vary, we posit that they should include both keywords (e.g., “dengue”) and conceptual words (e.g., “dengue sintomas”) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and should be selected according to the official and common languages of the country studied, Portuguese and English in our case; for instance, in Singapore searches using English terms were superior than searches using the Malay or Tami local languages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].
