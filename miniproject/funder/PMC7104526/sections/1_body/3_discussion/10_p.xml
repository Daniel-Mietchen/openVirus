<p id="Par68">In the present work, we did not split our data on training-testing datasets, which is a limitation of our approach. However, instead of dealing with prediction ability (i.e., forecasting [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]), we based our evaluation on how GHT reflects dengue incidence in the Brazilian states and where it could inform and complement traditional epidemiological surveillance. Further, we did not include environmental variables known to alter dengue dynamics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. To implement GHT as complementary surveillance tool, other sources of uncertainties should be considered, among them, dengue information-seeking behavior might be confounded by the surge of other arbovirus-diseases such as chikungunya or Zika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], or less well-known pathogens such as Mayaro, Oropouche, or West Nile viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], all transmitted by different vectors from the order Diptera, which could trigger local web search behavior. This is especially true because of unspecific initial clinical presentations for those pathogens, media-induced panic or interest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and because health campaigns are often aimed towards vector control due to the lack of specific treatments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the GHT platform is unstable and could potentially be altered by any update or improvement on Google’s search algorithm itself [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] hindering replicability of these kind of studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].
