<p id="Par59">Digital surveillance systems have been shown to be useful for predicting country-wide dengue incidence in several countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Here, we evaluate the usefulness of GHT in tracking dengue incidence both at the country and the state level in Brazil, by evaluating GHT correlation with weekly dengue incidence data over 6 years. We have shown that the performance of GHT varies across states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>); however, it is highly correlated with dengue incidence (adjusted R squared &gt;â€‰0.8) in 12 Brazilian states that are geographically dispersed. Moreover, we showed that proxies of Internet penetration such as the number of Internet users in the last 3 months only partially explain the usefulness of GHT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In fact, the logarithm of the total population, from among 474 potential demographic predictors, allowed us to build a model that quantified GHT usefulness with similar accuracy to that of Internet penetration data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The standardized volatility index in combination with the number of Internet users or the total population provided the highest accuracy when predicting GHT usefulness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
