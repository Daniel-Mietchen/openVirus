<p id="Par60">Harvesting epidemiological information from Internet-data streams remains an active area of research for health purposes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Despite its caveats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], it has the potential to improve and complement traditional disease surveillance methods. In particular, they may be useful in timely outbreak detection and in settings where health surveillance is underdeveloped [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, before implementation, tools such as GHT should be explored at spatial resolutions smaller than countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Ours is one of the few studies addressing this gap showing that GHT usefulness will be heavily impacted by the political boundaries at which we wish to predict [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In our case, GHT had an adjusted R squared score higher than 0.8 in 12 states, distributed among the five macro-regions of Brazil. The majority of states where GHT successfully track dengue incidence were located in the Southeast—Minas Gerais and São Paulo—, South—Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul—, and Northeast of the country—Ceará, Maranhão, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte—, with the latter concentrating states with higher incidences (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In general, these three macro-regions are considered the most economically developed of Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The Southeast and the South macro-regions have, in general, lower dengue incidence despite having the majority of cases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), highlighting the importance of normalizing measures to allow disease burden comparisons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We calculated incidence rates based on the total population of each state to compare dengue burden, showing that high number of dengue cases in the Southeast are explained by the presence of high-density populations. Among the Southeast, Rio de Janeiro state might benefit from integrating GHT surveillance into dengue modeling and prediction efforts, considering an adjusted R squared of 0.765 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). At the Northeast, Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte showed higher dengue incidence (= 6.223x10e-5 and 8.996x10e-5, respectively) with a high GHT fit to incidence data (adjusted R squared = 0.839 and 0.890, respectively) followed by Paraiba and Pernambuco (adjusted R squared = 0.837 and 0.819, respectively; Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
