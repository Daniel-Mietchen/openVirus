<p id="Par61">The remaining states where GHT was able to track dengue incidence were found in the Central-West—Distrito Federal—, and the North—Amazonas—macro-regions, with one state each (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Both macro-regions represent the fourth and fifth economies of Brazil, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. GHT for the Amazonas state could complement traditional clinical surveillance approaches (adjusted R squared = 0.847) considering its large area extent, moderate dengue incidence aggregated across all years (= 3.014x10e-5), and geographical location (Western portion of the North macro-region and far from the developed Brazilian Southeast; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The North macro-region also included the states of Acré, Amapá, Roraima, and Tocantins where GHT showed a poor behavior due to the low number of Internet users (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Both the North and Central-West areas include states with high dengue incidence consisting of Acré, Goiás, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>); among them, only Goiás showed a high GHT fit (adjusted R squared = 0.785); meanwhile the other states showed adjusted R squared values lower than 0.5 (Table
