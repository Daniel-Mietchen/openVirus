<p id="Par58">States with the highest standardized volatility index, or high variability in reported dengue incidence, had less informative adjusted R squared when fitting GHT to incidence. States with smoother signals of dengue incidence, and therefore low volatility, had a better fit of GHT to incidence, resulting in adjusted R squared values above 0.8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, even with a stable dengue incidence signal, GHT was not able to track dengue in Acré (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> top-right panel). A model using the logarithm of the number of Internet users, the volatility index, and their interaction as predictors of GHT had the highest adjusted R squared among all the variables explored (= 0.694, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> bottom-right panel). The same model with the logarithm of population instead of Internet users showed a similar adjusted R squared (= 0.688, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> bottom-left panel). These models were comparable to those using the individual terms of the logarithm of total population, the number of Internet users, or the selected PCs (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Eliminating Acré, the state with low volatility but low GHT accuracy (i.e., outlier), we saw an improvement in the models using the standardized volatility index plus its interactions with Internet users or total population (All terms vs. volatility index model, adjusted R squared = 0.717; all terms vs. Internet users (log) + standardized volatility index, adjusted R squared = 0.793; and all terms vs. population + standardized volatility index adjusted R squared = 0.809).
