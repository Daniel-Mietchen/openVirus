<p id="Par54">As expected, models developed with all the available terms per state fitted better to the weekly incidence dengue data than models developed with only four terms, uncorrelated terms, or with any of the individual terms when measuring the adjusted R squared statistic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: adjusted R squared for individual terms). Individually, the most informative terms among those conceptually related with the disease included “dengue sintomas”, “dengue”, and “sintomas da dengue” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Among the terms related with the vectors, “mosquito dengue” and “mosquito” were the most informative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Correlated and uncorrelated terms for each state are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>. We used a pair-wise ANOVA between models developed with all terms vs. models developed with reduced combination of terms (i.e., four terms and uncorrelated terms), and the individual terms for each state. From 328 comparisons—different number of terms were available for different states (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>)—only in ten comparisons a reduced model was statistically comparable (i.e., not different, 
 <italic>F</italic> statistic with a 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) to the model with all the terms, namely: the models based on four and uncorrelated terms and the model with the word “dengue” for Amapá, models developed with four terms for Distrito Federal, Maranhão, Pará, Rio Grande do Norte, Santa Catarina, and Sergipe, and models developed with uncorrelated terms for Roraima. Thus, for the subsequent analysis we used the adjusted R squared statistic from the models built using all the available terms in each state.
