<p id="Par55">As demonstrated previously, GHT fit the aggregated country-level dengue incidence well (All terms adjusted R squared = 0.888, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: all plots for Brazil). For Distrito Federal, GHT data was only available starting November 24th, 2013; thus, for this case we performed all the analysis starting that date (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>: all plots for the 27 states). When analyzing each state separately, GHT was useful in some states but uninformative in others (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The highest adjusted R squared was for Minas Gerais (0.923) and São Paulo (0.930), while the worst fit was for Amapá (0.096) and Roraima (0.093; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Overall, by using all the terms combined, GHT was able to track weekly dengue incidences for 12 states with an adjusted R squared higher than 0.8, namely: Amazonas, Ceará, Distrito Federal, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Paraná, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Considering an adjusted R squared value of 0.7, we can include four more states in this list: Espírito Santo, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Rio de Janeiro, for a total of 16 states were GHT might be implemented for tracking dengue dynamics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
