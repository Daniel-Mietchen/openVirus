<p id="Par53">From the 19 GHT terms, seven were useful in recovering information for all the Brazilian states, namely: “aedes”, “dengue”, “mosquito”, “aegypti”, “
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>”, “sintomas da dengue”, and “dengue sintomas”. From the remaining 12 terms, five never provided information and therefore were discarded in further analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Six terms tracked dengue for some but not all the states; for example, the word “mosquitoes” were valuable for Distrito Federal, Minas Gerais, and Paraná, but unimportant for Acré, Mato Grosso, or Santa Catarina. Two terms were informative in only one case: “dengue hemorrhagic fever” for São Paulo, and “DENV” for Brazil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
