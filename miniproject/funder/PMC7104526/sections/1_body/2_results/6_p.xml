<p id="Par57">From the 474 census demographic predictors, only 49 had an adjusted R squared higher than 0.6, all of which corresponded to variables related to the logarithmic transformation of the state population (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: 49 demographic variables). The 49 variables were highly correlated with each other (minimum 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.946); thus, a model including only the logarithm of the total population per state (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> top-left panel) was similar to the one using the logarithm of the total number of Internet users (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>—adjusted R squared = 0.6218—vs. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> top-left panel—adjusted R squared = 0.6143), a consequence of the high correlation between the predictors involved: population and number of Internet users (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.98). Within the PCA framework, the first six PCs recovered 91% of the variance and a model developed with these components yielded similar results as the ones obtained using either the logarithm of the number of Internet users or the logarithm of total population per state (Adjusted R squared = 0.654; Additional file
