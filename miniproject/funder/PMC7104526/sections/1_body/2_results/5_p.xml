<p id="Par56">All the Internet data variables were highly correlated with each other (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref>: correlation plot). The logarithm of the number of Internet users per state partially explains when GHT will be able to track dengue incidence (all terms adjusted R squared = 0.621, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). For instance, in the case of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, with the highest number of Internet users [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], the adjusted R squared for GHT and dengue incidence was high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, log scale); on the other hand, states such as Acré, Amapá, or Roraima with low numbers of Internet users [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] had a lower R squared value (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, log scale). States such as Rio Grande do Norte, Amazonas, Paraiba, and Distrito Federal, had high GHT fit and a low number of Internet users, and viceversa for Rio de Janeiro and Bahia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
