  <p>Google Health Trends and weekly dengue incidence in four Brazilian states, 2011–2016. Models built with all the terms available per state were useful for tracking dengue incidence during the study period for some (top panel) but not all (bottom panel) Brazilian states. The states that are not well predicted have noisier signals and lack strong seasonal dengue case counts, which may account for poor correlation with Google Health Trends in these regions. Lower access to Internet may also be a factor (Fig.
