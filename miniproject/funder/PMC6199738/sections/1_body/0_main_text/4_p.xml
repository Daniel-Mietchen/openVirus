<p id="Par18">Real-time PCR assay targeting the HEV ORF2 and ORF3 overlapping region (ORF2/3) demonstrated viremic HEV infection with a viral load of 1.2 × 10E + 7 IU/mL. Sequence analysis of partial ORF1 and ORF2 genes indicated that NG/17–0500 preliminary belongs to HEV-2. After de novo assembly of the amplicons, the NG/17–0500 full-length sequence showed 7198 nucleotides, excluding the 3′-poly (A) tail, with a G + C content of 57.5% harboring the typical 3 HEV ORFs. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence revealed that NG/17–0500 grouped with HEV-2 Mex-14 strain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), and this was all true for phylogenetic analysis of individual ORFs (data not shown). These relationships were also observed for sequence identities between NG/17–500 and other HEV complete genome or nucleotide or amino acid sequence identities of individual ORFs (Table
