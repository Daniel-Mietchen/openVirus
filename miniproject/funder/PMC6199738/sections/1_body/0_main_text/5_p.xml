<p id="Par19">Due to inadequate sanitation and lack of clean drinking water, hepatitis E is a severe public health issue in several regions of Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Partial HEV-2 sequences have been reported from Sub-Sahara African countries mainly during HEV outbreaks including Namibia in 1995 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Sudan in 2004 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and the Central African Republic in 2002 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, a single study reported of the analysis of HEV isolates from ten sporadic cases in Port-Harcourt city, southern Nigeria in 1997. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF2 fragments indicated that the Nigerian isolates from 1997 are most closely related to the HEV-2a reference Mex-14 strain and have been proposed as HEV-2b [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this regard, comparison of NG/17–0500 sequence to the previously characterized Nigerian HEV-2b isolates displayed a 91.2% to 92.2% nt identity. Phylogenetic analysis of the availability of data of partial HEV-2 sequences from Sub-Saharan Africa showed that NG/17–0500 clustered with proposed HEV-2b sequences, indicating NG/17–0500 belongs to HEV-2b (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Comparison of partial ORF2 sequences of NG/17–0500 to Chad (AY903950) and Central African Republic (DQ151640) HEV-2b isolates shared 90.3% and 88.4% identity, respectively. No evidence of recombination in NG/17–500 was detected by either Identity Plot or Bootscan analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The complete genome sequence of NG/17–0500 has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number MH809516.
