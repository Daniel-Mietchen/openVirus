<p id="Par17">Viral RNA from an anonymized serum sample (NG/17–0500) was extracted using High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following cDNA synthesis using SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Molecular approaches with sensitive real-time PCR and consensus nested PCR assays were conducted as described recently [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To amplify the entire genome sequence of NG/17–0500 and to verify the geno/subtyping results, universal primers were designed based on 38 complete HEV-1 and HEV-2 sequences from the GenBank database. Using genome walking method, gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the gaps. Primers and probe used are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The complete viral genome of NG/17–0500 was amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix PCR kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). 5′ and 3′ sequences were determined using 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Sense and antisense strands of PCR amplicons were sequenced with BigDye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Whole genome sequence was assembled and analyzed using Geneious software version 10.0.5. (Biomatters Limited, Auckland, New Zealand) [
