<p id="Par16">In June 2017, the Nigerian Ministry of Health reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) an HEV outbreak in north-east Nigeria, with 146 laboratory confirmed cases and two outbreak-associated cases of death in pregnant [

The genotyping results showed mainly HEV-1 and HEV-2 strains being predominant within the outbreak, the genotype distribution of isolates from this outbreak as determined by the Nigerian center of disease control (NCDC) and Robert Koch Institute (RKI) was 40% HEV-1 and 60% HEV-2. However, a number of HEV-positive outbreak samples could not genotyped. Since full-length genome sequences of HEV-2 strains are rare, we here report the full-length genome sequence of the HEV-2 strain (NG/17â€“0500) from an isolate of the Nigerian outbreak. The virus was detected from an individual from Borno state, Nigeria, and initially tested serologically positive for HEV using Wantai HEV-IgM Rapid Test and Wantai HEV-IgM ELISA (Sanbio, Uden, Netherland).
