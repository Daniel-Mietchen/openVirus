<p id="Par15">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the prototype of the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> and a common causative agent of acute viral hepatitis. HEV is a small, (non)enveloped spherical particle of about 34 nm in diameter harboring a single stranded, positive sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Eight HEV genotypes are recognized within the species 
 <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> A based on the pairwise distances of entire viral genomes (HEV-1 to HEV-8). The different HEV genotypes have various reservoirs, distinct distribution, and transmission patterns. Four major HEV genotypes (HEV-1 to HEV-4) are well recognized as human pathogens while HEV-5 and HEV-6 have been detected only in wild boars so far. HEV-7 from dromedary camels has been reported to infect humans and cause chronic hepatitis E. HEV-8 is identified in Bactrian camels with an unknown zoonotic potential [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. HEV-1 and HEV-2 are transmitted through the waterborne/fecal-oral route and responsible for large HEV outbreaks and epidemics in endemic areas like the Indian subcontinent and Africa, whereas HEV-3 and HEV-4 are linked to zoonotic transmission causing sporadic infections mainly in industrialized countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. HEV-2 was firstly identified during a hepatitis E outbreak in Mexico in 1986 while the complete genome sequence (HPENSSP, GenBank accession No. M74506) was subsequently characterized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently, additional HEV-2 full-length genome sequences were obtained from an individual patient of same Hepatitis E outbreak in Mexico (Mex-14, KX578717) showing 99.5% nucleotide identity to M74506 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the sequences for M74506 and KX578717 are from the same isolate. Since M74506 has been referred to as Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], Mexico-14 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and Telixtac-14 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the stool sample was re-analysed at the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), Germany, with the isolate designation Mex-14, and the sequences were submitted to GenBank receiving the accession number KX578717. Additionally, several studies have reported that HEV-2 is distributed in Africa. However, only partial ORF2 gene sequences were amplified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. According to the report of Lu et al. and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> Study Group, Mex-14 is the proposed HEV subtype 2a (HEV-2a) reference sequence, and HEV subtype 2b (HEV-2b) was assigned to the partial sequences AF173231 and AF173232 from Nigeria and AY903950 from Chad [
