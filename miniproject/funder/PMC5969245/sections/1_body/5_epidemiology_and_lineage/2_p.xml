<p>Historical accounts suggest that chikungunya may have caused outbreaks as early as the 18th century,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> although the virus and its disease were first isolated and documented respectively in 1952 to 1953, in Tanzania.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> Since then, 2 lineages, namely West African and East/Central/South African (ECSA), have been shown to circulate in sub‐Saharan Africa in a sylvatic cycle between mosquitoes and non‐human primates.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The first documented human outbreaks were in southern Asia during the 1960s to 1970s

 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> and were caused by the Asian strain, a descendent of the ECSA strain.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> After decades of low transmission, an ECSA divergent strain re‐emerged in 2004, having undergone 2 successive mutations of its envelope E1 glycoprotein.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> This new lineage, renamed the Indian Ocean Lineage spread from Kenya to cause explosive outbreaks throughout the islands of the Indian Ocean, India, and Southeast Asia, affecting millions.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> In late 2013, the emergence of the Asian strain was reported in the Caribbean,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> marking its first documented appearance in the Americas. It has since rapidly spread throughout 48 American countries and territories, causing over 2 million suspected cases to date.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Of note, local circulation of the ECSA strain has also recently been reported in Bahia state, Brazil.
