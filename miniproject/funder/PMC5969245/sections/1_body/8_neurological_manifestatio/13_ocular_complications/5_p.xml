<p>Disease relapse has been reported in one report, which described bilateral uveitis and retinal detachment, with loss of visual acuity starting 4 days after symptoms of chikungunya infection.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> Having received a week's course of oral and topical steroids and recovered within 6 weeks, the patient re‐presented 3 months later with floaters and keratic precipitates; clinicians should be vigilant for relapse in such cases.
