<p>Symptoms of encephalitis begin between 0 and 13 days following the onset of systemic features of infection (see Table 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). As is the case in other arboviral encephalitides, a CSF pleocytosis is not always seen.

Described abnormalities include oedema or non‐specific haemorrhage on computed tomography, and increased T2+/− fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery signal (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) or restricted diffusion signal in several areas of the cerebrum on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
