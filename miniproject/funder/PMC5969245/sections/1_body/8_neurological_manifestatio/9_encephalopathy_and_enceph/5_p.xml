<p>In the Réunion Island study, 7 of the 57 patients (aged 4 d‐88 y) with either encephalopathy or encephalitis died in hospital or shortly after discharge; of the 10 adults followed up after 3 years, 3 had persistent neurological sequelae in the form of epilepsy, postinfectious dementia, and cognitive disorder.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Taking into account the attrition in the follow‐up cohort, a range from 18% to 43% of patients were estimated to have neurological sequelae. Similarly, a paediatric series from the same outbreak reported 5 (31%) of 16 children with chikungunya‐associated encephalopathy or encephalitis had residual neurological deficit, whilst 2 (13%) died.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> From our literature review, of the 127 patients cases for whom follow‐up data were reported, 62 (48.8%) had complete or near‐complete recovery, 25 (19.7%) had residual neurological deficit, and 40 (31.5%) died.
