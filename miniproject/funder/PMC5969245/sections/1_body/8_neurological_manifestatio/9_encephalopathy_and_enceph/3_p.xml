<p>In one study from Réunion Island, where the authors were careful to accurately define encephalitis using the international criteria, the estimated cumulative incidence rate for chikungunya‐associated encephalitis was 8.6 per 100 000 people during the 2005 to 2006 outbreak, which led to a 2‐fold increased incidence of all encephalitis in the region.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Twenty‐four patients with encephalitis were reported (5 of whom were neonates infected perinatally), presenting with altered mental status, as well as seizures and focal neurological signs in some. When compared with encephalopathic patients who did not meet criteria for encephalitis, the encephalitic patients had more severe CNS disease and required more intensive care support; this was despite there being no significant difference between chikungunya viral loads and IgM titres in the serum or CSF, which may indicate a role for predisposing host factors in chikungunya virus neurovirulence. Overall, our literature review revealed that 251 of the 322 (78.0%) patients who presented with an isolated encephalopathy syndrome had a diagnosis of encephalitis, whereas 66 (20.5%) and 2 (0.6%) had a diagnosis of encephalopathy and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, respectively. Additionally, involvement of the meninges was also reported in 55 (17.1%) cases.
