<p>Encephalopathy, defined by the International Encephalitis Consortium as “a clinical state of altered mental status, manifesting as confusion, disorientation, behavioural changes or other cognitive impairment,”
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> is one of the most common neurological presentations for arboviral infections. Whilst in some patients this may be due to encephalitis—ie, brain inflammation associated with direct viral infection—in others, it may be a non‐specific manifestation of a severe systemic disease, for example, due to hypoperfusion of the brain.
