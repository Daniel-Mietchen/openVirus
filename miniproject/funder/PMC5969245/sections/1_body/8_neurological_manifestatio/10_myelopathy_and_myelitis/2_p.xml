<p>Chikungunya virus can cause myelopathy, symptoms of spinal cord disease, which may present with limb weakness, sensory changes, hyperreflexia, and bowel and bladder disturbances, depending on the level of the lesion and extent to which the cord is involved. If cord inflammation is confirmed by MRI, a CSF pleocytosis, or elevated CSF IgG index, showing local immunoglobulin production, then it is classified as myelitis.
