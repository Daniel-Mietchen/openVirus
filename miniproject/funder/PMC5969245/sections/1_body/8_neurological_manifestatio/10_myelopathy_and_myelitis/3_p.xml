<p>The incidence of spinal cord disease after chikungunya infection is not known, but it is likely to be less than that of encephalopathy, given that the 90 cases described in the literature comprise less than a third of the 322 cases of encephalopathy. Myelopathy and myelitis usually occur as part of more widespread neurological disease. Of the 90 patients identified, 47 had myelopathy as part of more widespread CNS disease, with encephalopathy or encephalitis; for 48, there was also peripheral nervous system disease in the form or radiculopathy or neuropathy; just 19 patients had a pure myelopathy syndrome. Spinal cord disease typically presents 0 day (Mehta et al, unpublished findings) to 3 weeks after the first clinical feature of infection (fever, arthralgia, or rash).
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> Patients present with weakness in 2, 3, or 4 limbs, sometimes accompanied by one or more of paraesthesia in the limbs, a sensory level, or urinary retention. In our literature review, of the 12 patients with a pure myelopathy where CSF data were provided, 6 (50%) had a CSF pleocytosis. Similarly, MRI abnormalities are variable. They may range from changes “suggestive of demyelinating pathology” to extensive T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity from the cervicomedullary junction to the C6 level.
