<p>It has been suggested that severe complications of chikungunya infection typically arise in those with co‐morbidities.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">96</xref> The above epidemiological study describing 610 atypical cases of chikungunya infection showed that underlying respiratory disease, cardiac disease, and hypertension were all independently associated with severe complications, including neurological disease.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> However, a study from India of 124 atypical chikungunya cases did not identify co‐morbidity as a significant risk factor for systemic complications or fatality
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>; similarly, in a case series of chikungunya‐associated GBS, 6 (67%) of 9 cases did not have any co‐morbidities.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref> Thus, although underlying co‐morbidities may play a role in neurological and other complications of chikungunya, they are not an indispensable requisite. Interestingly, age has been consistently reported as a significant risk factor for severe manifestations of chikungunya infection, both in the elderly (&gt;60‐65)
