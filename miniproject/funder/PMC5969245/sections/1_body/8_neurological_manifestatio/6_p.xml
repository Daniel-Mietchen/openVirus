<p>Future studies will need to determine whether initially asymptomatic chikungunya infections, ie, without a primary fever, arthralgia, or rash syndrome, can cause neurological disease. Although none have been reported to date, the possibility has not yet been investigated in adults. In vertical transmission, a retrospective study from the RÃ©union Island outbreak found that of 38 symptomatic neonates (with combinations of fever, rash, and oedema), 2 mothers had been asymptomatic (with a positive chikungunya PCR or IgM).
