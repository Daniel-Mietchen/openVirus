<p>The literature on neurological manifestations of chikungunya reflects that of the disease activity itself, with 5 publications between 1964 and 1971 and 89 since 2005, comprising 27 case reports, 48 case series, 1 case‐control study, 3 cohort studies, 1 cross‐sectional study, and 14 pathogenesis studies (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); autopsy data were included in one report found.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> Table 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref> provides a summary of all cases of reported chikungunya‐associated neurological disease. In total, we found 856 cases of chikungunya‐associated neurological disease in the literature; 796 (93.0%) were in adults and children infected directly via mosquito, 60 (7.0%) were in neonates infected vertically from mother to child (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Because patients were investigated to variable extents, we have categorised them according to the presenting clinical syndromes of encephalopathy, myelopathy, neuropathy, combinations of these, and neuro‐ocular disease; we then provided diagnoses, treatment, and outcome where available. A limitation of our study was that we could not incorporate diagnostic criteria, given the range of information available amongst all the cases published. The most common clinical presentation of neurological disease associated with adult and child chikungunya infection was encephalopathy; it accounts for 322 (40.5%) of the 781 patients described. Excluding ocular disease, 474 (77.3%) of all adult and child cases had a pure CNS disorder, 82 (13.4%) had a pure peripheral nervous system disorder, and 57 (9.3%) had a disorder of both the CNS and peripheral nervous system. Cases in which coinfection of chikungunya with another neurovirulent arbovirus was detected are not included in Table
