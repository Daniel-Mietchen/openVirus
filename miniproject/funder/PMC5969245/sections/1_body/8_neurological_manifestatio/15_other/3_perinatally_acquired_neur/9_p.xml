<p>Zika virus is also now known to cause devastating neurological disease in neonates, which is of global concern.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">122</xref> Whereas chikungunya appears to be most damaging around the time of birth, Zika has been associated with neurological sequelae in infections at all stages of pregnancy.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0101" ref-type="ref">101</xref> Another important difference is in the initial presentation of neonatal disease—in perinatal chikungunya infections, fever‐rash and neurological symptoms are only seen at approximately 4 days postpartum. In the Zika congenital syndrome, the damage is done in utero; thus, neonates can be born with clear evidence of infection, such as microcephaly. Despite the magnitude of outbreaks throughout the tropics, there is a paucity of data on the effects of dengue virus in pregnancy. A recent large retrospective study from Brazil reported an increased risk of preterm birth associated with dengue infection, with no difference in the rate of congenital malformations.
