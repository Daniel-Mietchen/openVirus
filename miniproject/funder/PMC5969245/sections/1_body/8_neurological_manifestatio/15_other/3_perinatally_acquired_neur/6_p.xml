<p>In addition to overt diseases in some perinatally infected neonates soon after delivery, there is also evidence for impacts on longer‐term development. In one study comparing the neurocognitive function at approximately 2 years of age for 33 children with and 135 without perinatal chikungunya infection, significant differences in development quotients were found, including movement, coordination, language, and sociability.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">120</xref> Importantly, even those infected at birth without obvious clinical features of neurological disease, such as encephalopathy, had significantly worsened neurocognitive function than uninfected children. Thus, the neurological effects of vertically transmitted chikungunya may not be obvious at birth, emphasising the importance of follow‐up of this cohort. The 12 cases with encephalopathy at birth showed still more severe developmental deficit, including cerebral palsy and microcephaly.
