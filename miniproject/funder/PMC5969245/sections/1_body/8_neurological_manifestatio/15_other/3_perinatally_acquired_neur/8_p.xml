<p>Of note, in 3 of 7 miscarriages occurring before 22 weeks, chikungunya RNA was detected in amniotic fluid for all 3 and placenta and fetal brain for 2. However, no significant increase in antepartum fetal deaths was seen during the chikungunya outbreak as compared with previous years. Another study of 1400 mothers from Réunion Island
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0121" ref-type="ref">121</xref> found no effect of antepartum chikungunya infection on pregnancy outcomes. Together, these data would suggest that although antepartum congenital infection has been detected in miscarried fetuses, given the lack of epidemiological evidence for a causal association between infection and miscarriage, this may have been an incidental finding.
