<p>One study from Réunion Island described 739 mothers who experienced symptoms of chikungunya infection during pregnancy, 39 of whom were symptomatic in the intrapartum period (between 2 d before and 2 d after delivery).
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">105</xref> Of these 39 mothers, all infants were asymptomatic at birth, but 19 developed acute disease a median 4 (range 3‐7) days after delivery, giving a vertical transmission rate of approximately 50% for mothers symptomatic in the intrapartum period. The initial clinical features in the affected neonates included fever, distress, poor feeding, petechiae, and a maculopapular rash. Nine cases (47%) were reported to have developed encephalopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid for all 9 showed normal biochemistry and white cell counts, and chikungunya PCR was detected in 5. Magnetic resonance imaging data from this study, combined with a later follow‐up study,
