<p>Neurological disease following chikungunya virus infection was first reported during an outbreak in 1964 in Madras, India.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">65</xref> Four cases with chikungunya confirmed serologically or by viral isolation were described. Two presented with a meningoencephalitic picture (“delirium or coma, and signs of meningeal irritation with nuchal rigidity and Kernig's sign, sluggish pupillary reaction etc”), one with acute flaccid paralysis and elevated CSF protein, suggestive of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS), and one with transient dysarthria. Since then, neurological manifestations have been reported throughout the Indian Ocean, South Asia, the Pacific islands, Southern Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, ranging from mild behavioural disorders to severe acute syndromes of both CNS and peripheral nervous system (Figure
