<p>Given the large spectrum of neurological disease and scarce epidemiological data, estimating the incidence of neurological disease amongst all systemically symptomatic chikungunya infections is difficult. In one study from the 2006 Indian outbreak,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> 18 (4.4%) of 405 suspected chikungunya cases attending the recruiting hospital over 3 months developed neurological complications; this study did not, of course, include the many people with uncomplicated chikungunya infection who did not seek hospital attention. An epidemiological study of the 2005 to 2006 Réunion Island outbreak found approximately 0.3% of all chikungunya infections resulted in “atypical” cases,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> of which 24.1% of the adults presented with abnormal neurology. Thus, approximately 0.1% (1 case per 1000) of all chikungunya infections developed neurological disease.
