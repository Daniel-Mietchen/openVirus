<p>On neonatal neurological disease, given that caesarean section is not protective, vertical transmission is unlikely to occur via the birth canal, as is the case in other neonatal infections such as herpes simplex.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0135" ref-type="ref">135</xref> Furthermore, the placenta seems to act as a barrier to transmission, as one study reported (as unpublished data) that placental cells from infected neonates were negative when labelled with antichikungunya antibody.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0105" ref-type="ref">105</xref> One hypothesis raised by the authors is that uterine contractions result in breaches of this placental barrier, allowing passive passage of the virus.
