<p>Patients diagnosed with myeloneuropathy or encephalomyeloneuropathy exhibit disease of both the CNS and peripheral nervous system. Given the association between chikungunya and GBS, it is not clear whether in these cases, there is one underlying pathological process involving both the CNS and peripheral nerves, or dual pathology, with a myelopathy ± encephalopathy centrally and GBS peripherally. For example, a case report from India described a 73‐year‐old man who, a week after chikungunya infection, was admitted with drowsiness, weakness, and absent reflexes and eventually died.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> His CSF and MRI showed evidence of CNS involvement, and an electromyogram showed a sensorimotor neuropathy. A brain autopsy showed subarachnoid haemorrhage, ischaemic changes, and small foci of demyelination without identification of viral inclusion bodies. Clearly, this patient had involvement of both CNS and peripheral nervous system at the same time, but it is not clear whether the same pathological process was responsible for both. Elucidation of these mechanisms may help to better guide management strategies.
