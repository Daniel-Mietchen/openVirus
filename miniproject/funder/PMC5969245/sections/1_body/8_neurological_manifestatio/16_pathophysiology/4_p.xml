<p>Whether the virus affects the nervous system directly or indirectly via a triggered immune‐mediated effect is also unknown; scarce evidence argues for both. For the former, both RNA and virus have been isolated from CSF in severe CNS disease,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> consistent with direct neuroinvasion. Neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (but not microglia) are susceptible to chikungunya infection in vitro; the former 2 cell types were shown to undergo apoptosis postinfection.

 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0131" ref-type="ref">131</xref> In relation to the latter, immune‐mediated hypothesis, this study also showed upregulation of 
 <italic>TLR2</italic> in grey matter astrocytes, a gene associated with the innate immune response. The clinical neurological state of the macaques was not reported, which adds to the uncertainty of whether the immune response was protective or pathogenic in these cases. Another study that subcutaneously inoculated mice with chikungunya virus detected upregulation of 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> in the brain, a gene that is also associated with the innate immune response.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">132</xref> Amongst other clinical signs, these mice developed hind‐limb paralysis, dehydration, and weight loss, and 25% of them died after 1 week. Interestingly, pretreatment with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (a 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> agonist and interferon inducer), which caused upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, antiviral genes, and IFN‐β, was protective clinically and promoted viral clearance from the brain, arguing for a protective innate and adaptive immune response, at least in CNS disease. In concordance, faster viral clearance after chikungunya infection was seen in wild‐type mice compared with a 
 <italic>TLR3</italic>‐knockout model; this was thought to be secondary to increased antibody‐neutralising activity in the wild‐type mice.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0133" ref-type="ref">133</xref> Chikungunya‐infected 
 <italic>TLR3</italic>‐knockout mice had increased viral dissemination throughout the viscera, including the brain. Along with a U‐shaped pattern of age‐specific incidence, this critical role of 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> is reminiscent of susceptibility to HSV encephalitis.
