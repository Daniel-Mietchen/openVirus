<p>A study from India compared the cytokine profile for patients with and without neurological complications following chikungunya infection.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0128" ref-type="ref">128</xref> Of those with neurological disease, 4 had encephalitis and 1 had “neuropathy.” Concentrations of 4 cytokines (TNF‐α, IFN‐α, IL‐6, and monokine induced by IFN‐γ) were found to be significantly higher in patients with neurological disease secondary to chikungunya, as opposed to uncomplicated chikungunya infection. However, the role of these cytokines in disease pathogenesis is still unclear.
