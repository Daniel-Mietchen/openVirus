<p>Neurological disease secondary to chikungunya has been reported in areas with both ECSA (or ECSA‐diverged Indian Ocean lineage) and Asian strains, but whether these strains have differing neurovirulence is unknown. One study compared the effect of intracerebral inoculation of Asian and ECSA‐diverged strains in mice.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0134" ref-type="ref">134</xref> Both spread within the brain to a similar extent, but the Asian strain was associated with higher mortality than the ECSA‐diverged strain. Upregulation of a gene associated with apoptosis was seen in the former, whilst antiapoptosis, antiviral, and CNS protective gene upregulation were seen in the latter. This potentially suggests a higher neurovirulence of the Asian strain, and comparative clinical data from countries such as Brazil, where both strains are circulating, will be useful.
