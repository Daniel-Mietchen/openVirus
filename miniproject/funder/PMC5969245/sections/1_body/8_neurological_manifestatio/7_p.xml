<p>Cocirculation of chikungunya, Zika, and dengue viruses has been reported in much of South America
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> and is a potential problem in all areas of the world where 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes are endemic. 
 <styled-content style="fixed-case">
  <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context">Aedes albopictus</styled-content>
 </styled-content> mosquitoes have the ability to deliver more than 1 arbovirus in their saliva, raising the possibility of simultaneous transmission of the viruses.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">98</xref> Furthermore, coinfection of arboviruses has been detected in patients presenting with neurological disease.

 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0100" ref-type="ref">100</xref> Given that all 3 arboviruses are known to be neurovirulent, it is unclear whether in these patients, their neurological disease is associated with one or more of their infections. Coinfection has also been reported in pregnant women,

 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0102" ref-type="ref">102</xref> the significance of which for the neonate is unclear. The most common coinfection to be reported in all patients is with chikungunya and dengue viruses, although this may be due to the greater number of epidemics of these viruses so far compared with Zika. Albeit rarely, coinfection with all 3 viruses has been reported, including in patients with neurological disease.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">99</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0103" ref-type="ref">103</xref> The differences in disease pathogenesis, presentation, and severity between monoinfections and coinfections are currently unknown. It is clear, however, that in endemic areas, pregnant patients with a fever‐arthralgia‐rash syndrome and all patients presenting with acute neurological disease (regardless of previous viral symptoms) should be investigated for all 3 of chikungunya, Zika, and dengue viruses.
