<p>Neurological disease associated with chikungunya virus is being reported increasingly, in part because of the recent introduction of the virus to the South American population and associated large outbreaks. Clinicians and public health officials globally face challenges from the wide range of associated neurological disease and the complicating factor that dengue and Zika viruses are transmitted by the same mosquito vectors and have broadly similar epidemiology. In endemic areas, chikungunya virus should be tested for in all patients presenting with acute neurological disease and all mothers presenting with fever, arthralgia, or rash; neonates with suspected infection should be followed up for at least 2 years for evidence of neurodevelopmental delay, regardless of the initial presentation (Table

Future challenges include understanding the full scope of chikungunya neurological disease, in both neonatal and adult infection, and their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is hoped that new direct therapeutic and vaccine candidates, some of which have shown promise in early studies, will augment the current supportive management strategies.
