<p>There are clear limitations to these in modern microbiology. For example, we know now that certain pathogens can cause multiple diseases, and indeed certain diseases can be caused by more than 1 pathogen (postulates 1 and 2). Furthermore, modern technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have increased our detection rate of certain pathogens over isolation in culture (postulate 3). We therefore adapt these postulates today in studies regarding causality. Neurological disorders associated with arbovirus infection have an added layer of complexity, owing to the different samples used for testing for the presence of the viruses. The strongest evidence of causality comes from demonstrating that the virus is in the central nervous system (CNS), which is most often shown by detecting viral RNA in the CSF by PCR; alternatively, the virus may be cultured. In fatal cases, autopsy material may be positive by PCR. For many patients, the virus has cleared from the CSF by the time they present; in which case, the detection of CSF IgM antibody by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay is considered diagnostic. Interpretation is complicated for flavivirus infections because a positive Zika‐IgM test can result from cross‐reactivity of serum containing antibodies against dengue virus.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Because chikungunya is an alphavirus, there is no serological cross‐reactivity with the flaviviruses, making diagnosis more straightforward (in areas where other alphaviruses are not circulating). It is not known for how long virus, RNA, or IgM remains detectable in chikungunya‐associated neurological disease, and whether this differs for the different neurological disorders. By analogy with similar arboviruses, we might expect the virus to be detectable for the first few days of illness, at which point it is replaced by antibody, which remains for weeks to months. Chikungunya virus is more readily detected by PCR or culture in the blood, because of its long and high viraemia; IgM antibody can also be detected in the blood. However, a positive blood test in a patient with neurological disease does not necessarily mean the virus caused the disease; infection may be coincidental, and care must be taken to exclude other possible causes. The virus can also be detected in urine, saliva, semen, and milk,
