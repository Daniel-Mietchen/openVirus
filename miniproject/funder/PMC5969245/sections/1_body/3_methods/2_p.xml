<p>We searched PubMed and Scopus for articles published up to 29 October 2017 using the following criteria: “chikungunya” AND (“neurolog*” OR “encephal*” OR “meningoencephalitis” OR “guillain‐barré syndrome” OR “myelitis” OR “myelopathy” OR “stroke” OR “ocular” OR “optic neuritis” OR “severe” OR “unusual manifestations” OR “neonatal” OR “congenital” OR “perinatal” OR “fatal”) (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv1978-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There were no language restrictions. All published studies describing patients with neurological complications of chikungunya were considered eligible for inclusion, comprising case reports and series, and case‐control, cohort, cross‐sectional, and pathogenesis studies. Articles that did not mention neurological complications of chikungunya were excluded. Data extracted included the numbers of patients with neurological complications, and where available, the time between systemic symptoms of infection and neurological disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, a summary of the clinical presentation, the author's diagnosis, treatment given, and outcome. The number of patients described per distinct neurological syndrome and aggregate data on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome were summarised.
