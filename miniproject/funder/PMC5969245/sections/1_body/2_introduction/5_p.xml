<p>We performed a systematic review for evidence of neurological disease associated with chikungunya virus. A well‚Äêdesigned review was recently published on this topical subject
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>; our review approaches the disease spectrum in a different manner, accounting for the differences. Here, we use a broader search strategy, leading us to consider general features of the virus and disease before individually discussing the different neurological manifestations, the challenges in their diagnosis, sequelae of perinatal infection, and knowledge of the underlying disease mechanisms; we include comparison with Zika and dengue viruses throughout. Where provided, we present all data detailing the clinical information, investigations, management, and outcome for all cases described in the literature.
