<p>Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, family Togaviridae) that is primarily transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, and occasionally from mother to child. The word “chikungunya” originates from the Makonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “that which bends up”
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>; this refers to the debilitating arthralgia often occurring in the acute phase of infection, along with fever, myalgia, headache, and rash. Although the first outbreaks were described in the 1960s, the virus was not considered a major public health problem until 2004, when it caused explosive outbreaks in the tropics. Severe complications of chikungunya infection, including neurological disease, are being recognised increasingly.
