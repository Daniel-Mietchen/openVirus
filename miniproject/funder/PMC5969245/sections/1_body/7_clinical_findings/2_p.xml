<p>Seroprevalence studies have reported a range of asymptomatic rates of chikungunya infection, from 3% to 47%.
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> In acute symptomatic infection, following an incubation period of approximately 3 days,
 <xref rid="rmv1978-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> there is an abrupt onset of fever, headache, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia, which typically last for 1 to 2 weeks.
