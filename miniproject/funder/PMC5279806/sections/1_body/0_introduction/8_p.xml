<p>The objective of this study was to include within-host evolution, disease stage, and individual specific transmission rates to improve the realism of social network reconstruction. We simulated epidemic spread on three prototypic network types and investigated the behavior of several tree statistics, including both topological imbalance measures and tree-based distance measures. In addition, we investigated the effect of varying epidemic size, varying sampling proportion, as well as heterochronous sampling on the tree statistics. Finally, we analyzed data from two different epidemiological scenarios of spread among injecting drug users (IDU) in the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for network model choice and parameter inference following the algorithm defined in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that virus geneaologies can differ from the underlying transmission tree in both topology and branch length and, therefore, that meaningful inference of social networks needs to take within-host evolution into account.
