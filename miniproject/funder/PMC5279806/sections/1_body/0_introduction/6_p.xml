<p>Phylodynamic analyses of HIV-1 have shown that asymmetry in viral phylogenies may be indicative of heterogeneity in transmissions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; networks with more heterogeneous degree distributions yield transmission trees with smaller mean cluster sizes, shorter mean branch lengths, and somewhat higher tree imbalance than networks with relatively homogeneous degree distributions. However, it has been argued that these direct effects are relatively modest for dynamic networks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or if only a small fraction of infected individuals are sampled [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Also, factors other than contact rate, such as high infectiousness during acute infection, may have a more dramatic impact on asymmetry [
