<p>During the course of an epidemic, the pathogen spreads over a subset of edges in the social network forming a subgraph that is the realized transmission history. Keeping track of who transmits to whom and assuming that every individual may be infected only once and by only one other individual, such a transmission history can be represented as a rooted tree (
 <italic>transmission tree</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, full transmission histories are rarely observed and commonly available epidemiological data such as diagnosis-recovery times of infected people may provide information on who was infected, when, and for how long, but it provides limited information on who acquired infection from whom [
