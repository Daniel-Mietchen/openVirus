<p>However, previous studies as well as more recent papers [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], assume that the unobserved transmission tree is identical to the reconstructed time-scaled phylogeny (
 <italic>virus genealogy</italic>), i.e. the internal nodes of the genealogy correspond to transmission events between hosts over time and within-host diversity is fundamentally ignorable. This is unrealistic since all coalescent events in a pathogen phylogeny occur within hosts, pushing the genealogy node heights further back in time than the nodes of the transmission tree, known as the pre-transmission interval [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, the order of coalescent events may not correspond to the order of transmission events but rather reflect within-host dynamics [
