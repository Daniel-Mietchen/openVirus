<p>The main issue with contact network-based epidemiology has been the difficulty of collecting individual- and population-level data needed to develop an accurate representation of the underlying host population’s contact structure. This has led to an interest in methods to infer information about host contact networks from epidemiological data. Previously, Britton and O’Neill [
