<p>Infectious diseases that are directly transmitted spread over contact networks, where each individual host can be represented by a node with a finite set of contacts (edges) via which they can transmit the pathogen. The structure of these networks is a major determinant of the pathogen transmission dynamics and possible control strategies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which, in a specific range of the scaling exponent, results in an infinite variance of the network’s degree distribution. This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold, making prophylactic strategies for sexually transmitted diseases very challenging.
