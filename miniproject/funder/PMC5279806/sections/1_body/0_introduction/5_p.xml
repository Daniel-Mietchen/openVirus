<p>Since pathogens evolve over a transmission history, the analysis of pathogen genetic sequences taken from different hosts provides a way to infer the most likely donor and recipient [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] introducing constraints on the space of possible transmission trees, which are a trace of the underlying contact network. Phylodynamics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] focuses on linking methods of phylogenetic analysis with epidemiological models under the assumption that if the evolution of a pathogen occurs sufficiently fast, transmission histories become “recorded” in the between-host pathogen phylogeny (
