<p>An epidemic spreading on an ER network is similar to a population random mixing model. Therefore, it is expected to generate a balanced transmission tree [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The average number of people infected by an individual in the ER network show little variance and therefore the within host evolution model will add some heterogeneity producing small changes in the tree topology leading to an increase in the unbalancedness in the resulting virus genealogy. In BA models, instead, the presence of superspreaders generate transmission histories that are very unbalanced [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. When a donor infects two or more recipients within a short interval, the order of transmissions along with infection times become impossible to accurately reconstruct; all splits are within the donor, describing within-host evolution in the donor (also shown in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Overall, the pretransmission interval associated with each and every transmission is a random draw from the possible coalescence times in the donorâ€™s viral population. Therefore, in BA networks the virus genealogy will show larger changes in the tree topology with respect to the underlying transmission trees and result in more balanced trees. The ratio of the mean internal to external branch lengths is informative about the type of network (smallest for BA, higher for ER, highest for WS). While the trends were similar in transmission trees and virus genealogies, the expected ranges overlapped for ER and WS in transmission trees, and virus genealogies showed generally smaller ratios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Branch lengths increase linearly as a function of tree height during epidemic spread on both ER and BA networks. Deviations from linearity are observed for epidemic spread on WS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). At the end of an epidemic, the mean branch length is constant among networks but longer in virus genealogies rather than in transmission trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Overall, trees from ER and WS networks are more imbalanced based on virus genealogies. However, as an epidemic spreads much faster in a BA network, the resulting virus genealogy will instead become more balanced because the virus does not have time to evolve time-structure between transmission events.
