<p>The within-host model generates virus genealogies that are consistent with a given transmission history, but not necessarily identical to it. An example of the impact of the within-host evolutionary process in a small size network/epidemic is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g002">Fig 2</xref>. This figure shows a transmission history (A), its transmission tree representation (B), and four compatible virus genealogies (C-F). The genealogies display branch elongation/compression as compared to the transmission tree but also changes in topology. For instance, lineage 5, sampled in individual 5 infected by 2 soon after 2’s own infection, appears consistently on the top part of the simulated virus genealogies and its branch can only be elongated by a small amount (because the pretransmission interval is small). On the other hand, lineage 10, infected later by 2, is located in different parts of the possible genealogies, thus indicating changes in the virus genealogy topology versus the underlying transmission tree. This happens because longer time implies an increase in the virus diversity in 2, i.e. more lineages are available in the donor. Therefore, as many virus trees are possible under any transmission history, it is important to evaluate the additional variation within-host diversity inflicts on the epidemiological inference. An epidemic can spread faster on ER and BA networks, thus the resulting transmission tree from a WS network includes longer times resulting in taller trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This is mainly because WS has higher clustering than ER or BA. Both the unobservable transmission tree and the observable virus genealogy show the same tree height information. Other tree statistics, however, show different patterns of network discrimination based on transmission tree or virus genealogy. The proportion of cherries per taxa is slightly less informative on virus genealogies than on transmission trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In particular, while there is a decrease for ER and WS (less balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees), it increases for BA (more balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees). A similar pattern is seen using Sackin’s Index or Colless’ Index (ER and WS less balanced in virus genealogy, BA more balanced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>)). Overall, differences between BA and WS become more evident in virus genealogies. Because Sackin’s Index and Colless’ Index are highly correlated we will only report Sackin’s Index from now on.
