<p>The next stage of introducing realistic host evolutionary dynamics is to model patient specific differences. We did that by introducing variability in the overall infectivity level while keeping the acute-chronic ratio at 10:1 (
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0, 3, 10). While it was clear that introducing a non-constant infectivity profile diminished genealogical differences between underlying contact network structures, it was less obvious what effect introducing between-patient variation had (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g005">Fig 5</xref>). While tree height remained with no power to discriminate between networks, internal to external branch length ratios became more discriminative (BA had lowest ratio, ER intermediary, and WS high). Individual variability seems to affect tree symmetry near the root more than towards the tips, since the Sackin’s Index shows much more variation than the number of cherries per taxa. However, they both improved their power to discriminate between contact network structures, and Sackin’s Index could differentiate WS from BA and ER networks. Thus, these simulations showed that the complex interactions that affect the resulting tree statistics when multiple levels of variability interact (within-host coalescence process, timing of infections relative to disease- and epidemic-stage, disease-stage infectivity differences, and patient individual variation), may induce non-trivial dynamic patterns.
