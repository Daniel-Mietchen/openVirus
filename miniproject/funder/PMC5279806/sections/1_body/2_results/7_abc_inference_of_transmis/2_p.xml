<p>To investigate model selection performance of the ABC algorithm, we record the number of times that the true model has the highest posterior model probability 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>M</italic>|
 <italic>D</italic>) among the three models for the 100 simulated datasets. The algorithm was able to discriminate among the network models quite well. For the first network model (ER), in 78 out of the 100 simulated datasets, the true model had the highest posterior probability among the 3 different network types. For the second model (BA), similar results were obtained; 76 out of the 100 simulated datasets identified BA. Outbreaks on the WS network were misclassified only 1 time out of 100. The corresponding network parameters were estimated reasonably well in most cases (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For illustration, we report the results of a randomly chosen experiment where the observed data were obtained from an epidemic spread on an ER network (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The parameters to estimate are the mean degree, diagnosis and infection rate for an outbreak on an ER network. The estimation of the removal (i.e. diagnosis) rate was sometimes skewed towards the upper bound, which probably is due to branch elongation induced by the within-host evolution model.
