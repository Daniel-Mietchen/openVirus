<p>We only estimate three parameters per network/epidemic model. In principle, it would be possible to add the rewiring probability, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>, of the WS network in the ABC inference and estimate it. However, the rewiring probability of the WS networks turns out to be quite difficult to identify in the model choice setting. This is because for large values of 
 <italic>ρ</italic> a WS network becomes indistinguishable from a ER network 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s010">S1 Table</xref>. At 
 <italic>ρ</italic> &lt; 0.1 there was typically still a good chance (
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>M</italic> = 
 <italic>m</italic>|
 <italic>D</italic>) = 0.70 − 0.95) to identify the correct network structure 
 <italic>m</italic>.
