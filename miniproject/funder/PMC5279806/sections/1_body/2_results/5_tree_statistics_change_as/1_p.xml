<p>If no influx of susceptibles occurs, the mean branch length increases as trees grow taller because it takes longer time to find uninfected hosts later in an epidemic (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s006">S4A Fig</xref>). At 100% sampling of infecteds at any time during an epidemic, the mean branch length increases as a function of total number of sampled infecteds (number of taxa, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). BA typically produces shorter tree branches than ER and WS as more individuals are sampled. Thus, if it were possible to sample everyone at time of infection, then the trend of adding longer tips towards the end of the epidemic becomes more pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The internal to external branch length ratios typically decrease as the epidemic progresses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s006">S4B Fig</xref>). This is mainly explained by the depletion of susceptible neighbors for individuals infected late in an epidemic, thus generating very long external branches. In addition, branches added later in the epidemic, resulting from chronic donors, divide already existing branches into shorter segments. BA trees show lower ratios than ER and WS throughout the epidemic, but WS and ER are less distinguishable during an epidemic. On the topological level, the Sackinâ€™s Index typically decreases as an epidemic matures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). At the end of an epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3</xref>), BA and ER show more unbalanced trees throughout an epidemic and the most imbalanced trees come from WS networks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Simulations on networks of size 5000 show similar results: for comparison, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">Fig 6</xref> with 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s007">S5 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s006">S4 Fig</xref> with 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s008">S6 Fig</xref>. Thus, while these statistics are indicative of the underlying contact network, they are confounded by epidemic stage and the size of the susceptible population. Consequently, to be able to infer the underlying contact network from genealogies we must also know what stage an epidemic has reached and the number of susceptibles.
