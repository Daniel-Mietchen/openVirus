<p>Infectivity is known to vary across HIV-1 pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Thus, rather than assuming a constant transmission rate throughout an infected person’s disease stages, we tested 7 different infectivity profiles varying the ratio between the acute and chronic transmission rates and measured how they affected network model discrimination. The transmission rate in the pre-AIDS stage was held constant. Tree height becomes much less informative of network type the bigger the difference is between acute and chronic stage infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). This is because higher acute stage infectivity causes more infections in the acute phase and consequently the epidemic spread is faster. Since infection happens so rapidly, the external branches become very long compared to the internal branches, as all internal nodes are pushed to the root the higher the ratio between acute and chronic stage infectivity. Therefore, the total tree height is dominated by the external branch lengths (which are on average 1/
 <italic>γ</italic>). Similarly, mean internal over external branch lengths, which was an important index when constant infectivity was assumed, is less informative if we assume high acute/chronic stage infectivity ratios. Differences observed between ER and BA assuming a constant infectivity profile diminish (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Hence, branch length and tree height measures are less informative of network type when differences in acute-chronic infectivity are considered. Topological tree measures, i.e., cherries per taxa, and Sackin’s Index, were less affected by differences in acute-chronic infectivities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Both these measures, calculated on the possible virus genealogies, still informed about the underlying contact network structure that HIV spread upon.
