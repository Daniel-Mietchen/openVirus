<p>While tree indices were different between the trees from the Swedish HIV-epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g008">Fig 8</xref>), and superficially in line with what one might expect comparing an outbreak scenario to a more endemic situation, e.g., mean branch lengths were 279 and 913, and tree height 4176 and 10527, respectively, they cannot be directly compared because these trees represent different stages in the respective epidemic. Furthermore, real data is rarely sampled at 100% of all infected or even diagnosed, so comparisons to our simulated overall network differences are difficult to evaluate. Thus, to evaluate genealogies from real epidemics we must consider epidemic stage and sampling fraction (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g006">6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g007">7</xref>).
