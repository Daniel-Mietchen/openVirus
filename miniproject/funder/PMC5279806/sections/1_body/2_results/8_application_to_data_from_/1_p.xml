<p>Inference of epidemic parameters as well as network type becomes more complex in real outbreaks. We consider two genealogies from separate IDU-associated HIV-1 CRF01 and subtype B epidemics in Sweden, respectively. The CRF01 tree was sampled from a rapid outbreak that was imported from Finland [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] around 2003, which was quiescent until the outbreak started in 2006. The subtype B tree was sampled from the more slowly, and typical, spreading IDU epidemic in Sweden [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
