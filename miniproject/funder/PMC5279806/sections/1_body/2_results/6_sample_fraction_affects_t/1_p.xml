<p>While a genealogical tree grows as an epidemic matures, the sampling fraction has no real effect on mean branch length, albeit with smaller sample fractions the estimation becomes somewhat more uncertain due to stochastic effects (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s009">S7 Fig</xref>). This happens because the remaining branches in the genealogy represent increased numbers of infected hosts. However, this effect does not cause additional confusion over that caused by epidemic stage, as the differences between BA, ER, and WS networks are distinct at all epidemic stages and number of infected. On the other hand, we do not usually know at what stage an epidemic is (i.e., number of actually infected) but only the number of sampled hosts. The mean branch length as a function of number of taxa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g007">Fig 7</xref>) could mislead the inference of underlying contact network, especially for small sample fractions. In fact, any branch length or tree height index would be affected by mistaking number of sampled hosts with stage of the epidemic because the number of infected grows faster than the number of sampled early in an epidemic.
