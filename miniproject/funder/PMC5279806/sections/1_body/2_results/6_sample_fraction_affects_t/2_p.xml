<p>The topological indices were also affected by sampling fraction. While general trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g003">Fig 3</xref>) remain constant through the cumulative number of samples over an epidemic, it is again important to know at what stage an epidemic is at time of sampling. Similar to branch length indices, topological indices can be misleading if sampling faction and stage of the epidemic are unknown.
