<p>To compare our simulation results, we used networks with the same mean degree (8) and a constant rewiring probability (
 <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.01) for the WS networks. The SIR-type models were characterized by a transmission rate of 0.01 per contact, a removal rate 
 <italic>γ</italic> = 2.8 year
 <sup>−1</sup> and sampling probability 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1, unless specified otherwise.
