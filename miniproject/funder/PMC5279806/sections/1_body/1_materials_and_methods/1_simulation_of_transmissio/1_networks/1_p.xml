<p>We considered three prototypic network models to represent population contact structure: the Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graph [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the Barabási-Albert (BA) graph [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the Watts-Strogatz (WS) graph [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with low rewiring probability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005316.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These three networks are characterized by different degree distributions and amount of clustering. The degree of a node in a network is the number of connections to other nodes it has and the degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network.
