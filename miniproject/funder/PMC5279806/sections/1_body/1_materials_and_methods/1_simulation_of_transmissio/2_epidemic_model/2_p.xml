<p>The first model specification assumed that the rate of transmission per contact between a susceptible and an infected individual, 
 <italic>λ</italic>, is constant over time. The removal rate of infected individuals 
 <italic>γ</italic> is also constant over time and includes both diagnosis and death. We denoted with 
 <italic>p</italic> the probability of being sampled at the moment of diagnosis (DNA sequences obtained from the virus of the diagnosed patient). We assumed that (i) diagnosis coincides with treatment start, (ii) the rate of transmission after treatment start is negligible, and (iii) nobody goes off treatment. We believe these assumptions to be reasonable for our analysis since Sweden has already achieved the 90-90-90 target set by UNAIDS in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] according to which (i) 90% of all people leaving with HIV will know their HIV status, (ii) 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive sustained antiretroviral therapy, and (iii) 90% of all people receiving antiretroviral therapy will have viral suppression [
