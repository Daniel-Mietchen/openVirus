<p>In the second model specification we considered three stages of HIV infection (acute, chronic, and pre-AIDS). Here, the transmission rates are dependent on the disease stage of the infected individual and denoted

 <sub>3</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005316.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). We assumed the removal rate to be independent on the disease stage. The acute stage was assumed to last 30 days for each individual [

 <sub>2</sub> with a mean of 8 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and the pre-AIDS stage lasted until death or diagnosis. The three transmission rates were calculated to preserve the individual total infectivity during their infectious period in order to make results comparable with the first model specification.
