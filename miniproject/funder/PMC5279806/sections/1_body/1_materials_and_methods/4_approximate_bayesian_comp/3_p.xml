<p>The three network models 
 <italic>M</italic> = {
 <italic>WS</italic>, 
 <italic>ER</italic>, 
 <italic>BA</italic>} were used to simulate outbreaks using the stage-varying infectivity profile with ratio 10:1 acute:chronic and patient infectivity variation (
 <italic>σ</italic> = 3). We assumed that network model and one network parameter were unknown. For ER, the network parameter of interest was the probability of drawing an edge between two arbitrary vertices; for BA it was the number of edges to add in each time step of the generating algorithm, and for WS it was the neighborhood within which the vertices of the lattice are connected. We also estimated the removal rate 
 <italic>γ</italic> and the infection rate in the acute phase 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> (infection rates in the chronic and immuno-compromised stage can be obtained deterministically from the acute phase infection rate). Therefore, 
 <italic>θ</italic> consists of 3 parameters for each type of network and they are model specific. All remaining parameters characterizing both the network structure and the epidemic process were considered known.
