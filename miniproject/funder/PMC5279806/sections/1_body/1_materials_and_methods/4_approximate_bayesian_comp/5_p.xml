<p>We chose to decrease the tolerance values following an exponential decay such that 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> exp(−0.5
 <italic>t</italic>) where 
 <italic>t</italic> is the current sequential step, as proposed in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A pilot run of 100 simulations for each model in 
 <italic>M</italic> was used to define the initial thresholds. Convergence was assumed when the acceptance rate of newly proposed particles had dropped below 1 in 100, and visual inspection of the posterior distribution showed no change in the last iterations. We found that convergence was achieved with 
 <italic>T</italic> = 10 iterations and 
 <italic>N</italic> = 1000 particles per iteration. The prior distributions on the parameters 
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>γ</italic> were Uniform (0.0001, 0.1) and (0.00025, 0.1), respectively. The computation time of the algorithm depended on the tree size and sampling fraction and it took between 1 and 2 hours in a parallel implementation on 8 processors. Further details of the algorithm and its computational cost can be found in
