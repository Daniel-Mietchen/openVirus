<p>To further investigate how well time-scaled phylogenies can estimate the epidemic process and identify the underlying contact network, we applied an inference framework for model selection and parameter estimation based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC is a methodology to estimate model parameters replacing the likelihood function with a simulation-based procedure and a distance function to measure the similarity between simulated and observed data. Various ABC algorithms have been proposed, from the simple ABC-rejection [
