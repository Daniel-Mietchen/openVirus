<p>Here, we use ABC-SMC as proposed by Toni et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] because it addresses some of the potential drawbacks of previous ABC algorithms, such as slow convergence rate, by sampling from a sequence of intermediate distributions. The SMC sampler introduces a number of intermediate steps decreasing iteratively the tolerance threshold 
 <italic>ϵ</italic> for samples acceptance. At the first iteration, 
 <italic>N</italic> particles 
 <italic>θ</italic>′ (representing the parameters of interest) are generated from the prior distribution and data are simulated from the model based on 
 <italic>θ</italic>′. The proposed parameters are accepted if the difference between the summary statistics of the simulated data 
 <italic>D</italic>′ and the observed data 
 <italic>D</italic> is below the threshold 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. At iteration 
 <italic>t</italic> &gt; 1, the particles are drawn from the previous population of the accepted samples at the iteration 
 <italic>t</italic> − 1 (with threshold 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>−1
 </sub>) with slight perturbations. In our work, data (observed virus genealogy) and simulated trees are compared through the use of summary statistics which correspond to the above listed tree statistics (
