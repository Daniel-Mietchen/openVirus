<p>The phylogeny of pathogens such as HIV-1 collected from infected persons in an epidemic reveals a considerable amount of information about the underlying transmission history since mutations are typically accumulated faster than transmission occurs. The common assumption that the internal nodes of a phylogeny correspond to transmission events between hosts over time is, however, unrealistic because transmitted lineages must already exist in the donor at the time of transmission. Thus, neglecting the time difference between the common ancestor and the transmission event (i.e. the pre-transmission interval, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) will bias the estimated time of transmission backwards in time.
