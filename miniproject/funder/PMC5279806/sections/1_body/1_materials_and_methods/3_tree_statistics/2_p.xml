<p>These tree statistics include topology measures, branch length summaries, and lineages through time progression. The Sackin’s index can be normalized according to a reference model (we used the Yule model) in order to obtain a statistic that does not depend on the tree size. Both Sackin’s index and Colless index depend only on the topology of the tree, and they are invariant under isomorphisms and relabeling of leaves. They reach their maximum value at caterpillars (ladder-like trees), and their minimum on the maximally balanced trees. A binary tree is considered to be perfectly balanced if each internal node in the tree divides the leaves descending from it into two equally sized groups. The expected number of cherries in a tree with n taxa under a Yule model is 
 <italic>n</italic>/3. In an asymmetric tree (more ladder-like tree), tips tend to coalesce with branches deeper in the tree, and there are fewer cherries than expected. The number of cherries and Sackin’s index complement each other well, as the number of cherries captures asymmetry in the recent evolutionary past, while Sackin’s index captures asymmetry over the entire evolutionary history of the sample. These two measures are only weakly correlated [

The tree height in a virus genealogy represents the time from the first infection to the last sampling event. Since epidemics progress at different speed on different networks, heterogeneities in tree heights are expected.
