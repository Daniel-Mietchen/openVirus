<p>The topological distance was obtained as twice the number of internal branches defining different bipartitions of the tips. A topological distance that takes branch lengths into account was also considered (the sum of the branch lengths that need be erased to have two similar trees.) The number of lineages through time was normalized in time and by the maximum number of lineages [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We used the R package ape (Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] to create and plot the phylogenies and the package apTreeshape [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for the evaluation of some tree statistics.
