<p>We applied the ABC inference method to the analysis of two HIV-1 DNA sequence sets sampled from different IDU transmission epidemics in Sweden [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To reconstruct the time-scaled virus phylogenies from the DNA sequences we used a Bayesian Skyline coalescent model in BEAST 1.8 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The general time reversible nucleotide substitution model was used with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and a discretized gamma distribution with four categories was used to model rate heterogeneity across the sequence. For the log-normal relaxed clock parameters, a uniform prior on the positive axis was assumed for the mean, and an exponential with mean 1/3 for the standard deviation. A Uniform prior on (0, 1) was used for the nucleotide frequencies. The MCMC was run for 10 million iterations, with a 10% burn-in period and samples saved every 10000 iterations. We selected the maximum credibility tree and the negative branches were set equal to zero.
