<p>We show that any tree index that one would measure is affected by sampling fraction and the stage of the epidemic. We show that phylogenies cannot be meaningfully interpreted without this additional knowledge, as tree statistics otherwise may mislead the inference of contact network. While our results relate to epidemic situations relevant to HIV epidemics, they may also be relevant to other measurably evolving pathogens such as hepatitis C and influenza.</p>
