<p>We do not investigate systematically if there is one factor that explains the expected genealogies simulated under the different network assumptions. Rather, the complex dynamic interaction of the heterogeneity factors included implies that a single cause for the differences observed may not exist. However, we compare only epidemic spread on three network types with the same mean degree and we used tree statistics to assess the differences. In certain settings, ER and BA behaved similarly (and differently from WS). In this case, it is likely that the difference is due to clustering, since there is no large difference between the degree distributions in the ER and WS, whilst WS is the only network (among the three considered) allowing clustering. In some other scenarios, WS and ER behaved more similarly (and differently from BA). This is most likely due to the different degree distributions.</p>
