<p>In this study we addressed several outstanding factors that could affect HIV phylogenetic tree shape in addition to the underlying contact network upon which HIV spreads. While previous studies have evaluated how contact networks affect the resulting tree [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], they ignored differences between transmission trees and virus phylogenies, varying infectivity over disease progression, among patient infectivity variation, sampling fraction, and epidemic stage. Here, we show that all these factors put further restrictions on what type of phylogeny one can expect, but also that these additional factors may confound the inference of contact network.
