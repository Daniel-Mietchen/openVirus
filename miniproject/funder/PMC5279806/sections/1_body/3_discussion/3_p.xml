<p>It is well known that infectivity is not constant over disease progression, albeit the literature is uncertain about how big the difference is between acute and chronic stage infectivity [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005316.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Indeed, we find that varying infectivity affects the expected phylogeny under different contact networks. In fact, this factor alone seems to diminish phylogenetic differences between contact networks. Somewhat surprisingly, patient variation in infectivity works in the opposite direction, i.e., it seemed to amplify differences in the contact network structures. The result is that virus genealogies do carry a signal of what type of contact network HIV spread upon, but the expectations are different than what one would expect from a na√Øve model where no virus diversity exists and all hosts are described by an identical constant infectivity over their pathogenesis.
