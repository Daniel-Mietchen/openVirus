  <title>Infectivity profiles.</title>
  <p>The first two model specifications represented: (i) constant rate (
   <italic>red line</italic>) and (ii) stage dependent infectivity (
   <italic>black lines</italic>). The length of the acute phase was assumed constant, 
   <italic>t</italic>
   <sub>1</sub> = 30 days while 
   <italic>β</italic> was assumed to be 1/8 year
   <sup>−1</sup>. We do not assume a length for the AIDS phase a priori, but if an individual reaches the third stage, he will stay in the third phase until he is diagnosed or until death occurs.
