  <title>Additional distance based tree statistics on virus genealogies as epidemic progresses on a network of size 5000.</title>
  <p>Mean branch length (MBL) as function of tree height (A) and internal/external branch length ratio (B) as function of the number of taxa for simulated outbreaks on networks of size 5000. The envelopes represent 95% confidence intervals around the medians. The curves are obtained using local regression (LOESS). WS (
