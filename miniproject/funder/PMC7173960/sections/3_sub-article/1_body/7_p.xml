<p>1) Please carefully review the claims and interpretations to ensure that they are justified and that alternative hypotheses are considered. For example, it is stated that: "both the increased affinity due to multimerization as well as the increase in overall size of the VHH complex, resulting in additional steric hindrance, explain why the complexes outcompeted the mixtures of VHHs" suggests that steric hindrance by SpyCatcher/Tag or human Fc is the mechanism of neutralization. Could there not be others?</p>
