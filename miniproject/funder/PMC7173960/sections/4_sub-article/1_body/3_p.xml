<p>We agree that potential anti-bacterial superglue immune responses are unfavourable and we indeed used the bacterial superglues primarily as an intermediate step before designing the bispecific human Fc-based molecules, thereby preventing the need to clone and express a large number of hIgG1Fc molecules. We have more clearly explained the rationale of our approach in the Discussion section.</p>
