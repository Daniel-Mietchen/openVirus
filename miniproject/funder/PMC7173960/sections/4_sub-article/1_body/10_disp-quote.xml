 <p>b) Subsection “Mapping of the SBV VHHs on the SBV-Gc
  <sub>head</sub> domain”: Authors described that SB11 and SB14 target the same antigenic site as 1C11. However, the blocking with 1C11 still did not block the binding of SB11 or SB14 (Figure 2B), indicating that those VHH bind to antigenic sites different from that for 1C11.
