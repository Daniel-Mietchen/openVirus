<p>After checking Figure 2E we confirmed that the data was presented correctly. In the presence of low nM concentration of SB10 (20 nM), WT SBV is neutralized efficiently, whereas no neutralization was observed with the SBV-Y541C mutant in the presence of high concentrations of SB-10 (512 nM). Nevertheless, to improve the interpretation of the figure, without the need to carefully read the Y-axis title we reversed the axis numbers in line with the neutralization data presented in Figure 3.</p>
