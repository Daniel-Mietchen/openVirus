<p>We agree with the reviewer that the blocking pattern is not fully conclusive with regard to binding sites and that binding sites may only partly overlap or do not overlap at all. The non-reciprocal pattern could be explained by the different size of the antibody molecules and steric hindrance. VHHs may be able to “squeeze” between paratopes of 1C11 whereas the VHHs block efficiently binding sites for 1C11 (since its variable domains would need more space to bind), Secondly, the non-reciprocal pattern could also be the result of differences in avidity of the VHHs versus 1C11. Another, more complex explanation for the non-reciprocal blocking might be that SB11 and SB14 specifically bind to the trimer interface, thereby explaining why 1C11, which is known to bind upon trimer dissociation [11], is not able to bind in this situation. Blocking with 1C11, will subsequently prevent oligomerization of the spike but this will not prevent binding of SB11 and SB14 as part of the epitope is still accessible.</p>
