<p>To determine the number of antigenic sites targeted by the different VHHs, RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub>-specific competition ELISAs were performed. The RVFV VHH panel (N = 16) was shown to target three independent antigenic sites within RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>, referred to as the red, blue and yellow antigenic sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When compared to the VHHs of the blue and the yellow antigenic sites, all of the VHHs of the red antigenic site did not show typical sigmoidal curves, suggesting markedly reduced avidity for monomeric Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The SBV-specific VHHs showed a more complex pattern of competition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). SB10 (beige) clearly targets an antigenic site that does not overlap with the sites targeted by the other five VHHs. SB12 and SB13 (orange) recognize the same antigenic site that does not overlap with the site targeted by SB11 (green). However, SB9 and SB14 (violet) show reciprocal competition with each other and SB9 competes (reciprocally) with SB11. SB14 shows non-reciprocal competition with SB12 and SB13, which strongly suggests that the epitopes of SB9, SB11, SB12, SB13 and SB14 are all in very close proximity (
