<p>RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs were isolated from VHH phage display libraries by pannings with the RVFV Gn ectodomain (RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>) (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">de Boer et al., 2010</xref>) or the SBV Gc head domain (SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>), previously described as the Gc 
 <italic>N</italic>-terminal subdomain of 234 amino acids (Gc Amino) (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Wernike et al., 2017</xref>). Both RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> are considered to be the main targets of neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses (

 <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> specificity by indirect ELISA and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). In total 62 unique RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>-specific clones that grouped into 16 CDR groups (15 CDR3 groups) and 15 unique SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub>-specific clones that grouped into 6 CDR3 groups were identified (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). One representative VHH per CDR group was subsequently produced in yeast (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). All yeast expressed VHHs were confirmed to recognize soluble RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>, or SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> by ELISA (
