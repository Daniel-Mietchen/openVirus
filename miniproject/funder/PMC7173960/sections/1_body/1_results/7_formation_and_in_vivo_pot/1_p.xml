<p>To improve the potency of the RVFV VHHs, we designed and constructed a llama-human chimeric bispecific format that encompass effector functions similar as conventional immunoglobulins. Moreover, we aimed to generate HCAbs that are suitable for therapeutic application in humans and with good manufacturability. We started with a human IgG
 <sub>1</sub> CH2 and CH3 backbone, which enables binding to complement factor C1q and Fc receptors of immune cells triggering their activation. The interface between the CH2–CH3 domains also contains the binding site for the FcRn, responsible for the prolonged half-life of IgG, placental passage, and transport of IgG through mucosal surfaces (

 <sub>1</sub>Fc-VHH fusions were constructed (

 <sub>50</sub> &lt;1 nM was mainly observed with the bispecific constellations (

 <sub>ecto</sub> that were highly similar (

 <sub>1</sub>Fc-104 and 107-hIgG
 <sub>1</sub>Fc-104 were subsequently produced at medium scale using a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell-based transient expression platform (20 L) in disposable rocking bioreactors (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The results show that 60-100% protection was achieved with prophylactic administration and, remarkably, 60% protection was achieved after therapeutic administration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>). Altogether, these results emphasize that VHH-based biotherapeutics hold great promise for the treatment of bunyavirus infections either prophylactically or therapeutically.
