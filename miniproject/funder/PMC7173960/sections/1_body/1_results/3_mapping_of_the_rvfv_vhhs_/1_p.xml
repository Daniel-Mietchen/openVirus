<p>The N-terminal 154–469 amino acids of RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>, now known as the RVFV-Gn head domain, was recently crystallized and shown to comprise three subdomains; subdomain A (or I), β ribbon domain (II) and domain B (III) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The results show that the yellow antigenic site, which is targeted by RV104, RV136 and RV148, is located on subdomain B and that the blue antigenic site, recognized by RV107 and RV115, is primarily located on the β-ribbon domain. The red antigenic site could not be mapped to a specific subdomain, suggesting that this site is present at a subdomain interface. Gn, as part of the Gn/Gc heterodimer, is organized similarly in both hexamers and pentamers on the RVFV particle, of which Gn is most exposed to the immune system. We mapped the antigenic sites to the previously proposed Gn structure within the pentameric capsomer density (
