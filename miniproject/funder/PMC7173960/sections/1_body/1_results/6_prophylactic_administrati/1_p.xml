<p>Following the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization experiments, selected bivalent and bispecific complexes were evaluated in mouse infection experiments. To extend the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> half-life, the complexes were expressed with an albumin binding domain (ABD) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B,C</xref>). Binding of a VHH complex to circulating albumin is expected to extend the half-life not only due to an increased size of the complex, but also as a result of recycling through the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (

 <sub>head</sub> domain simultaneously. To enable the construction of this trispecific complex we made use of a third bacterial superglue; SdyTag and SdyCatcher (

 <sub>ecto</sub> or SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> was confirmed by indirect ELISA (
