<p>For medium scale production of VHHs a yeast (
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) expression system was used. VHH gene fragments were either transferred from pRL144 or synthesized by GenScript and transferred into the yeast expression vector pRL188 (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et al., 2007b</xref>). The SpyTagged, SdyTagged and SnoopTagged versions of the VHHs were organized as follows: yeast signal sequence – VHH – 15 GlySer linker – Spy/Sdy/SnoopTag – GAA linker – HisTag (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells were induced for VHH expression using galactose and VHHs were purified from the culture supernatant by IMAC using Ni-NTA resin as described (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et al., 2007b</xref>). The buffer was exchanged to PBS using 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore).
