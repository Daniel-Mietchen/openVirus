<p>RVFV neutralization was assessed with the use of a highly sensitive VNT test as described (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Wichgers Schreur et al., 2017</xref>). SBV neutralization was assessed with the following method. In standard 96-well cell culture plates, 50 µl of two-fold dilutions of VHHs (starting at approximately 1000 nM) were incubated with 50 µl of a 10
 <sup>4.2</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml SBV suspension for 2 hr at RT, before adding them to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero E6 cells/well. VHH-SBV complexes and cells were incubated for 48 hr at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and subsequently stained using IPMA. The neutralization capacity was calculated as ND
 <sub>50</sub>.
