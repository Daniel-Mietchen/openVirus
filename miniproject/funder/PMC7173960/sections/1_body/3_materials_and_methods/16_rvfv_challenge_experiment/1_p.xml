<p>Six-week-old female BALB/cAnNCrl mice (Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided into groups of 5 mice, kept in type III filter-top cages under BSL-3 conditions, and allowed to acclimatize for 6 days. The group size was computed (power 80%) with an estimated mortality (including euthanasia at HEP) in the non-treated control group of 95% and an estimated mortality in the treated group of 15–25%

Mice were prophylactically (t = −6 hr) or therapeutically (t = 18 hr) treated with purified VHH complexes (150 µg) or antibodies (150–200 µg) via the intraperitoneal route (in 100 µl PBS). Mice were challenged at t = 0 via intraperitoneal route with 10
