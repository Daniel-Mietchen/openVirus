<p>An escape mutant was selected after serial passaging of SBV NL-F6 under selective pressure by SB10. Initially, 1 ml of 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml virus suspension was incubated with 1 ml of SB10 solution at 10 µg/ml for 2 hr at RT. The virus-VHH mixture was then inoculated into T25 flasks seeded with 8 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> Vero E6 cells, and subsequently incubated for 48–96 hr at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Virus harvested from the culture supernatants and again subjected to SB10-mediated neutralization was used for sequential rounds of passaging. Suspected mutants from the sixth passage exhibiting cytopathic effects were selected for total RNA isolation using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA was purified and concentrated using the RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo, Irvine, California) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) in combination with primer JR565 (
 <named-content content-type="sequence">GACAATTGATGACACATATAGCTT</named-content>) was used to reverse transcribe the SBV Gc head domain RNA. An SBV Gc
 <sub>head</sub>-specific PCR product was amplified using the Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) in combination with primer JR829 (
 <named-content content-type="sequence">ACAGAGCCTCTGAGAAATGTCTG</named-content>) and JR830 (
 <named-content content-type="sequence">GATTTGCATACCAGTATTGGTG</named-content>). PCR products were purified and concentrated using the DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo). Finally, samples were sent to BaseClear (Leiden, The Netherlands) for Sanger sequencing. SBV NL-F6 without being passaged and SBV NL-F6 passaged without prior incubation with SB10 were used as controls.
