<p>Two adult llamas (
 <italic>Lama glama</italic>, #9342, #9343) were intramuscularly (hind leg) immunized with 1 ml of RVFV strain Clone 13 (10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) and another two llamas (#9340, #9341) were inoculated via the same route with SBV NL-F6 (10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). Four weeks post immunization the VHH repertoire of the individual animals was amplified by RT-PCR from peripheral blood lymphocytes and inserted into phage display vector pRL144, as earlier described (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, a library was taken along from a llama (#3467) that was three times immunized with 20 µg RVFV VLPs (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">de Boer et al., 2010</xref>) using a four week interval between immunizations 1 and 2 and a three week interval between immunizations 2 and 3. A week post the second vaccination a blood sample was taken for library preparation. Of note, simultaneously with the RVFV VLP antigen, this llama was also immunized with influenza antigens for a different study (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et al., 2013</xref>). Libraries consisting of at least 10
 <sup>7</sup> unique clones were generated and phages were rescued (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et al., 2007b</xref>). Phage display selections were subsequently performed by consecutive rounds of biopanning using RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub> expressed with a N-terminal Twin-Strep-tag as a bait antigen coated to Strep-Tactin coated microplates (IBA Lifesciences, Göttingen, Germany). To assess the enrichment of phages displaying RVFV-Gn
 <sub>ecto</sub>- or SBV-Gc
 <sub>head</sub>-specific VHHs, parallel phage ELISA and phage display selection were performed. After panning round two or three, individual clones were picked and grown in suspension for small-scale VHH production.
