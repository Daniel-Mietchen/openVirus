<p>Facilitated by globalization and climate change, arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) increasingly pose a threat to human and animal health (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Gould et al., 2017</xref>). Although for some arboviruses vaccines are available that can be used to prevent or control outbreaks, for the vast majority of emerging arboviruses no countermeasures are available. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a phlebovirus within the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, is prioritized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as being likely to cause major epidemics for which no, or insufficient countermeasures exist. RVFV is currently confined to the African continent, the Arabian Peninsula and several islands off the coast of Southern Africa, where it causes recurrent outbreaks (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Clark et al., 2018</xref>). The world-wide distribution of competent mosquito vectors and susceptible animals underscores the risk for emergence in currently unaffected areas. In endemic areas, RVFV causes major epizootics among livestock, characterized by abortion storms and large-scale mortality among newborn ruminants. Importantly, the virus also infects humans, either through direct contact with infected animal tissues or via the bites of infected mosquitoes (
