<p>At the moment, no effective antiviral therapy is available to treat bunyavirus infections in humans. Patients essentially rely on supportive care. Some promising pre-clinical and clinical data have been obtained with small molecules, mainly nucleoside analogues, that interfere with viral replication (

Recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy/tomography data have provided novel insights into the bunyavirus glycoprotein architecture that may facilitate the development of bunyavirus antibody therapies in the future (
