<p>So far, VHHs have been explored as tools for a wide range of applications including their use as therapeutic agents (

The therapeutic potency of complexes consisting of multimers of the same VHH (multivalent) or combinations of VHHs targeting different antigenic sites (multispecific) is explained by their improved avidity, selectivity and kinetics compared to individual VHHs (
