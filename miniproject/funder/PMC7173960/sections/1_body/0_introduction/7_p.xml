<p>Here, we selected and characterized RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs targeting receptor binding glycoprotein domains, and used bacterial superglues to create virus neutralizing VHH complexes that reduced and prevented morbidity and mortality in mouse models. Selected RVFV VHHs were subsequently reformatted into human Fc-based bispecific chimeric HCAbs that showed protection in pre- and post-exposure treatments.</p>
