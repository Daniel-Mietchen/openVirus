<p>We specifically harnessed the advantageous characteristics of VHHs in combination with bacterial superglues to develop highly potent virus neutralizing complexes. A major advantage of the presented approach over more conventional approaches is the modularity and subsequent flexibility and directionality in complex construction, making selection of the most potent complexes a relatively easy task. This modularity additionally ensures efficient production, while genetic fusion of VHHs generally results in decreased production yields. Moreover, interference with CDRs is limited due to the flexibility in positioning of the superglue tags in the VHHs, particularly when compared to VHHs linked by genetic fusion, where N-terminal fusions can decrease affinity (

Multimeric complexes have not only proven effective in neutralizing viruses, but the presented bacterial superglue and module-based assembly strategy may also facilitate the development of biotherapeutics targeting cancer and toxins. Interestingly, a related approach primarily based on SpyTag-SpyCatcher interactions has recently shown promise to functionally inactivate the human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) complex (

A potential disadvantage of using bacterial superglues in therapeutics is their intrinsic immunogenicity, leading to immune responses that do not contribute to protection and may even reduce efficacy, particularly with successive treatments. Nevertheless, the bacterial superglue strategy finds its added value, as we showed, as a very efficient intermediate step for identification of potent VHH combinations. After optimal combinations of VHHs are identified, these can be used to develop bispecific constructs with human IgG
