<p>One of the most profound observations we made in our study was the very strong synergistic effects in neutralization upon targeting of two or three different antigenic sites simultaneously. The synergistic effect of mixtures of antibodies targeting two or more distinct antigenic sites on RVFV virions was already reported more than 25 years ago by 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Besselaar and Blackburn (1992)</xref>. They showed that conventional non-neutralizing RVFV monoclonal antibodies efficiently neutralized when they were used in combination (

The requirement to target more than one antigenic site for effective bunyavirus neutralization might be related to the broad range of receptor and attachment molecules used for viral attachment and entry in both insect and mammalian cells of which several are of non-proteinaceous nature (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Albornoz et al., 2016</xref>). Remarkably, we did not observe efficient neutralization by simply mixing VHHs targeting two distinct antigenic sites. Efficient neutralization required conjugation of the VHHs to a larger scaffold. Only these larger complexes were found to reduce or even prevent virus infection. Several mechanisms could explain the higher efficacy of multimeric complexes, including more efficient interference with receptor binding or interference with fusion through blocking viral glycoprotein conformational changes. Cross-linking of the glycoproteins may also reduce their overall degrees of freedom thereby preventing the glycoprotein shell to disassemble, which is a crucial step in the fusion process. Finally, binding of the complexes to multiple sites at the virion surface may facilitate complement activation and/or opsonization.
