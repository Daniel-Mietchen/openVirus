<p>The lack of knowledge about bunyavirus glycoprotein structures and immunogenic domains together with rudimentary knowledge on mechanisms of neutralization, have hampered the development of antibody-based bunyavirus therapies. However, novel structural data on the glycoproteins, obtained from combined X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy/tomography of whole virions for some members of the
