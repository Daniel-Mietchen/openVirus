  <title>Characterization of VHH binding sites.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) RVFV and (
   <bold>B</bold>) SBV-specific VHHs and antibodies were tested in competition ELISA using RVFV-Gn
   <sub>ecto</sub> and SBV-Gc
   <sub>head</sub> as antigens. Competition is expressed as percentage of blocking. A percentage above 50% is considered efficient blocking and strongly suggests that the test VHH binds at an overlapping site in the antigen as the blocking VHH. For SBV, competition was additionally assessed for the 1C11 and 4B6 mouse mAbs (
   <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>). The RVFV-specific VHHs clustered into three groups each targeting a different antigenic site in RVFV-Gn
   <sub>ecto</sub> and the SBV VHH panel was shown to target 4 different antigenic sites in SBV-Gc
   <sub>head</sub> (of which the green, violet and orange sites are shown to be partly overlapping). Since SB11 and SB14 showed efficient competition (although non-reciprocal) with 1C11, the green, violet and orange antigenic sites are expected to be located at the apical end of the SBV-Gc
   <sub>head</sub> domain. (
   <bold>C</bold>) SDS-PAGE of the baculovirus produced head, A, Î²-ribbon and B subdomains of RVFV-Gn
   <sub>ecto</sub>. The lowest band in the subdomain A lane is expected to be the result of proteolytic cleavage. (
   <bold>D</bold>) RVFV-Gn
   <sub>ecto</sub> subdomain-based VHH ELISAs. Wells were coated with the indicated subdomains and VHH binding was assessed with a HRP-conjugated goat anti-llama IgG. (
   <bold>E</bold>) SB10 escape mutant selection. Briefly, wildtype SBV was sequentially passaged in the absence or presence of SB10. Following passage 6, the Gc
   <sub>head</sub> coding region was sequenced and SB10 neutralization was quantitatively assessed. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Model of a pentameric RVFV spike. The RVFV Gn/Gc heterodimer within a penton (PDB: 6F9F, 
   <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Halldorsson et al., 2018</xref>) is color-coded by domains. The Gn head domain is outlined in black. Arrows indicate approximate positions of the two mapped antigenic sites. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Model of a trimeric SBV spike based on the monomeric SBV crystal structure (PDB: 6H3S, 
   <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hellert et al., 2019</xref>) and the trimeric BUNV cryo-ET map (EMDB: EMD-2352, 
   <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bowden et al., 2013</xref>). A protomer is color-coded by domains and the Gc head domain is outlined in black. The two N-glycans are labelled with the positions of their respective asparagine residues and the position of the SB10 escape mutation is indicated with a star. Arrows indicate approximate positions of the antigenic sites. Antigenic sites for which evidence is inconclusive are indicated with question marks (green and beige sites).
