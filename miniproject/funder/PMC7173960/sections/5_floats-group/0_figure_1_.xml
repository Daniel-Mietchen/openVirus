  <title>Selection and expression of RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the llama immunization strategy to obtain a source for RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs. (
   <bold>B</bold>) RVFV and SBV-specific virus neutralizing responses in llama sera determined by virus neutralization test (VNT) before (pre) and post immunization. Neutralizing antibody titers were measured by endpoint titration and calculated as 50% neutralization. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Schematic presentation of the VHH library construction and phage display selections. Blood lymphocyte RNA was used as a template for VHH-specific PCRs and purified fragments were cloned into phagemids generating a phagemid library. Following phagemid transduction, the purified phage library was screened for antigen-specific phages. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Summarizing table of the VHH clone selection showing the number (#) of unique clones identified and the number of CDR groups per antigen. (
   <bold>E</bold>) SDS-PAGE of yeast-expressed RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs. SB10 was shown to be partly N-glycosylated as confirmed by PNGase F based deglycosylation (lane SB10*). (
   <bold>F</bold>) RVFV-Gn

    <title>VHH amino acid sequence alignment.</title>
    <p>RVFV and SBV-specific VHHs belonging to different CDR groups were aligned, amino acids were numbered and CDR regions were defined according to the IMGT system (
     <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Lefranc, 2003</xref>). For comparison the older Kabat numbering system is also indicated. The framework regions are indicated in light green and the CDR regions in pink. The CDR3 sequence of RV126 is highly similar to the CDR3 sequence of RV124, however RV126 contains an unusual insertion in FR2 at IMGT position 48. SB-9 is a conventional-like VHH. RV141 and RV145 are predicted to be N-glycosylated at IMGT position 57 whereas SB10 is predicted to be N-glycosylated at IMGT position 84.

    <title>VHH specificity determined by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA).</title>
    <p>Vero E6 cells were infected at MOI 0.1 with either RVFV Clone 13 (blue boxes) or SBV NL-F6 (green boxes) and fixed 1 day post infection following permeabilization and VHH incubation at 10 µg/ml. VHH binding was visualized with a HRP conjugated goat anti-llama IgG conjugate and a AEC (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole) substrate.</p>
