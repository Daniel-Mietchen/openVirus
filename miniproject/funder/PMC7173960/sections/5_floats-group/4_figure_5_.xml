  <title>Efficacy of RVFV and SBV-specific ELP-based VHH complexes in mice.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Illustration of ELP-based VHH complexes comprising an albumin binding domain (ABD). (
   <bold>B</bold>) SDS-PAGE of purified RVFV and SBV-specific ELP-VHH complexes. Uncoupled VHHs were removed by a Strep-tag based purification following the coupling. The asterisks (*) indicate the glycosylated variants with higher molecular weights. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Species-specific albumin ELISA of the ABD containing ELP scaffold. Human, mouse or bovine albumin was coated at a 10 µg/ml concentration and the trispecific ELP scaffold containing an ABD domain (see 
   <bold>A</bold>) was incubated in a dilution series. Binding was visualized with a Strep-Tactin-HRP conjugate. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Indirect RVFV-Gn
   <sub>ecto</sub> and (
   <bold>E</bold>) SBV-Gc
   <sub>head </sub>ELISA of purified RVFV and SBV-specific VHH complexes. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Neutralizing activity of the purified VHH complexes as determined by RVFV and SBV-specific VNTs. The ND
   <sub>50</sub> values refer to the concentration of complexes. (
   <bold>G</bold>) Illustration of the RVFV and (
   <bold>H</bold>) SBV mouse models. (
   <bold>I</bold>) Survival curve of RVFV infected mice pre-treated with 150 µg of the RVFV-specific VHH complexes. (
   <bold>J</bold>) Survival curve of SBV-infected mice pre-treated with either 200 µg of SB10-ELP2
   <sub>ABD</sub>-SB10 or 100 µg SB10-ELP2
   <sub>ABD</sub>-SB9.
