  <p>Analysis of Human Plasma Binding to GFPDL-Identified GP Antigenic Site Peptides by SPR</p>
  <p>(A) Ten-fold dilution of plasma samples collected from EBOV survivors (#28, black; #43, blue; #79, red; and #92, purple) or humans vaccinated with ChAd3-MVA vaccine (#58, pink triangle and #64, green triangle) or mock control (#36, empty circle) were analyzed for total binding to chemically synthesized peptides containing the antigenic sites identified by GFPDL (
   <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A) in SPR. Total antibody binding is represented in SPR resonance units.
  </p>
  <p>(B–D) Total binding antibody (Max RU) of human plasma against antigenic site peptides (B) GP 469–498 (site V.7 in the C terminus of GP1), (C) GP 520–547 (site V.9 in fusion peptide at the N terminus of GP2), and (D) GP 617–645 (site VI in HR2-TM domain at the C terminus of GP2) correlated with the homologous virus neutralization (PsVN) titers. Pearson correlations are reported for the calculation of correlations between total anti-GP peptide antibody binding and PsVN titers.</p>
