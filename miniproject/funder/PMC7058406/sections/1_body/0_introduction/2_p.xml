<p id="p0030">In this study, we performed comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response following EBOV infection in survivors and following prime-boost vaccination with live ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccine in healthy adult volunteers (

ChAd3-MVA is a monovalent formulation of the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 (ChAd3)-vectored vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein of EBOV/Mayinga and boosted with the same ebolavirus gene in a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-vectored vaccine that also contains genes encoding Sudan ebolavirus and Marburgvirus glycoprotein and Tai Forest nucleoprotein. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of polyclonal plasma were performed to elucidate antibody epitope repertoires using gene fragment-phage display libraries (GFPDL) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology to measure real-time antibody binding kinetics, antibody cross-reactivity, immunoglobulin isotypes, affinity, and antibody specificity to each of the antigenic sites identified using GFPDL. Technically, since antibodies are bivalent, the proper term for their binding to multivalent antigens like viruses is avidity, but here we use the term affinity throughout since we do not describe any monovalent interactions. The focus was to identify the overall global pattern of antibody epitope diversity generated following human EBOV infection versus vaccination rather than fine antibody specificities in each individual. Previously, GFPDL spanning the entire genome of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Respiratory syncytial virus was used to map the antibody repertoires of convalescent sera from infected individuals and pandemic influenza vaccinations, which revealed several diagnostic and protective targets (
