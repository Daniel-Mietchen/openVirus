<p id="p0085">To follow up on antigenic sites identified using GFPDL analysis, peptides representing most of the unique antigenic sites up to 70 amino acid residues long were chemically synthesized and evaluated for individual samples antibody binding in SPR (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A and see 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Transparent Methods</xref>). The post-infection survivor samples (close circles) showed higher antibody binding to few antigenic site peptides compared with post-vaccination plasma (triangles), whereas for other sites, there was overlap in the extent of peptide binding by post-infectious and post-vaccination serum. The measured plasma sample reactivity against each peptide in SPR is possibly an aggregate sum of different antibodies recognizing overlapping epitopes in multiple antigenic sites (as defined by the GFPDL in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) contained in that peptide. Sites II.2 (GP 195–226), III.2 (GP 226–253), IV.4 (GP 319–334), and V.9 (GP 520–547) showed moderate/strong antibody binding only to post-infection samples with minimal or no binding with post-vaccination plasma antibodies (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). EBOV survivor samples also showed 2-to 10-fold higher antibody binding to antigenic site in the C terminus of GP1 (site V.7; 469–498) and 5- to 20-fold higher binding for the C terminus of GP2 (site VI; 617–645). ChAd3-MVA vaccination induced comparable or modestly higher antibody binding to antigenic sites IV. (GP 282–305), V.2 (GP 372–420), V.4 (GP 424–447) in the MLD of GP1, and V.10 (GP 585–599) in the HR1 of GP2. Relationship analysis of antibody binding titers to each antigenic site peptide with PsVN titers showed a significant correlation of antibody binding to peptides GP 469–498 (site V.7 in the C terminus of GP1), GP 520–547 (site V.9 in fusion peptide at the N terminus of GP2), and GP 617–645 (site VI in HR2-TM domain at the C terminus of GP2) (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>B–4D). In this specific case, it is quite interesting that individual survivors had a more diverse response than that seen in pooled vaccines.
