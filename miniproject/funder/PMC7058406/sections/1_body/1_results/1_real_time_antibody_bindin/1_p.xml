<p id="p0035">A high-titer and a low-titer pool (samples #58 and #64, respectively) of human plasma from individuals primed with ChAd3-vectored EBOV/Mayinga GP and boosted with MVA-vectored EBOV/Mayinga GP, SUDV GP, MARV GP, and TAFV nucleoprotein were obtained as a part of a WHO collaborative study (originally from Oxford, UK vaccine trial). Individual plasma from three survivors from the 2014 Western Africa EBOV outbreak were obtained at 2 (sample #43), 3 (sample #79), or 6 (sample #28) months post-EBOV infection (pi), and a pooled convalescent plasma (sample #92) was obtained from six Sierra Leone patients who recovered from EVD and did not receive any experimental treatment (

Since no individual vaccinated serum was tested in this study, all antibody comparisons between vaccination versus EBOV infection reflects individual/pooled EVD survivor samples with pooled ChAd3-MVA vaccinee samples. The samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against a wild-type EBOV strain in a BSL4 laboratory and against a VSV virus expressing the EBOV GP in a pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assay (
