<p id="p0045">To further evaluate anti-GP antibody affinity following vaccination and EBOV infection, the antibody-antigen complex dissociation rates (off-rate constants) were determined as a surrogate for antibody affinity using SPR. Antibody dissociation kinetics of antigen-antibody complexes are independent of antibody concentration and provide a measure of overall average affinity of polyclonal antibody binding (

To that end, serially diluted plasma at 10-, 100-, 200-, 400-, and 800-fold dilutions were injected at a flow rate of 50 μL/min (120-s contact time) for association, and dissociation was performed over a 600-s interval (at a flow rate of 50 μL/min) (

Antibody off-rate constants, which describe the fraction of antigen-antibody complexes that decay per second, were determined directly from the plasma antibody interaction with GP in the dissociation phase only for the sensorgrams with maximum RU in range of 10–100 RU using SPR (

The off-rates of polyclonal plasma antibodies bound to GP were much slower (indicating stronger antibody affinity) in EBOV survivors (0.00327/s for #28, 0.001407/s for #43, 0.00129/s for #79, and 0.00101/s for #92) in comparison with ChAd3-MVA vaccine recipients (0.0699/s for #64 and 0.0294/s for #58), even though the total anti-GP-binding antibodies of post-vaccination plasma #58 were comparable with those of post-infection sample #28 (

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>D). These observations suggest that the EBOV infection promoted 10- to 60-fold higher antibody affinity (based on antigen-antibody dissociation rates) to GP compared with antibodies induced by ChAd3-MVA prime-boost vaccination.
