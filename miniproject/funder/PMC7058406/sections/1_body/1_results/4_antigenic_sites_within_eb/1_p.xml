<p id="p0075">Analyses of neutralizing/protective MAbs against EBOV were previously shown to predominantly recognize epitopes within or flanking the MLD, glycan cap, GP1 core, or the base of GP (epitopes for MAb cocktail ZMapp and MAb 114 are depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Survivors of EBOV infection and prime-boost vaccination with ChAd3-MVA generated an antibody response defined by seven antigenic regions (herein referred to as I through VII) with some overlaps (i.e., between regions II and III, III and IV, IV and V, VI and VII) and 21 smaller antigenic sites (II.1 through V.11) within EBOV GP (

The antigenic regions/sites (8–247 amino acid residues) were defined based on antibody recognition by at least 4% of phage clones obtained after affinity selection with at least one plasma sample in this study or by the rVSV-EBOV GP vaccination-induced antibodies in the previous study. The frequency of phages expressing these GP antigenic sites selected by plasma following EBOV infection (
