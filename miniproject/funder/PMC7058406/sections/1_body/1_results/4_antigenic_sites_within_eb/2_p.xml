<p id="p0080">Importantly, EBOV infection (black, blue, red, and purple bars in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B) induced a more diverse anti-GP antibody response across both GP1 and GP2 that included antigenic sites I, III.2, IV.4, V.9 (fusion peptide), VI (C terminus of GP2), and VII that were preferentially recognized by post-infection survivor antibodies compared with post ChAd3-MVA vaccination plasma samples (pink and green bars in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). Interestingly, the later (6 months) post-infection plasma (#28) contained antibodies that recognized two sites with high frequency in GP1 (III.1; GP 210–220 and V.6; GP 456–484) that were selected minimally by convalescent plasma at early time points post-EBOV infection (2 and 3 months post-infection) or the ChAd3-MVA post-vaccination-induced antibodies. However, it is possible that this may reflect different individuals rather than expanding repertoire. The ChAd3-MVA vaccination generated antibodies that primarily recognized antigenic sites in glycan cap (sites IV, IV.1, IV.2) and MLD (sites V.1 to V.8) in either the high (#58) or low (#64) neutralization titer plasma pool (

 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Antigenic sites V.5 (GP 436–491), V.11 (GP 439–465), and VII (GP 603–624) were recognized at higher frequency by plasma sample #92 compared with other survivor plasma (#28, #43 and #79) samples (

 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>) compared with the prior epitope profiling in the VSV-EBOV GP vaccination study, including sites II.3, III.2, III.3, IV.4, V.8, and V.11 in GP1, an immunodominant sequence (V.9) in the N-terminal part of GP2 near the fusion peptide and sites V.8, V.10, and VII in GP2.
