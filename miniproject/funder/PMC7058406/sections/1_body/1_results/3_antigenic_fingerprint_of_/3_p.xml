<p id="p0065">Negative control human plasma (#36) bound very few phages. For EBOV survivors' plasma, the number of bound phages was highest for sample #79, followed by #92, #43, and then #28 (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). For the post-vaccination plasma, sample #58 showed an ∼4-fold higher titer compared with the lower-titer (#64) sample (5.4 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 1.3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> phages, respectively) (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). Sequencing of the GP fragments expressed by phages bound by post-infection survivor plasma antibodies showed a diverse epitope repertoire distribution, displaying both small and large sequences (8–247 amino acid residues) spanning across the N-terminal GP1 head domain and to the C-terminal GP2 stalk domain of the Makona GP (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The antibody epitopes mapped to the Glycan cap and mucin-like domain (MLD) and identified immunodominant sites in the fusion peptide at the N terminus of GP2 as well as in heptad repeat (HR)/transmembrane of GP2 for the convalescent samples.
