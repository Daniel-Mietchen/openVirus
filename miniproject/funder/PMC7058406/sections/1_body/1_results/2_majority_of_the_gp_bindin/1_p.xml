<p id="p0050">Isotype analysis of GP-binding antibodies was performed by SPR that demonstrated representation of all isotypes (IgA, IgG, IgM) and IgG subclasses in the post-infection/vaccination plasma (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>E). Secondary MAb analytes with similar affinity/binding patterns with specificity against Fc region of human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, or IgM were used for isotyping. The anti-GP-binding antibodies in survivor plasma comprised 60%–70% IgG isotype predominated by the IgG1 subclass. Three of four survivor plasma contained 0.7%–2.7% of IgG3 and 1.5%–6.9% of IgG4 GP-bound antibody isotype. Plasma sample #92 obtained from six EVD survivors in Sierra Leone (who did not receive any experimental treatment) contained 8.3% GP-binding antibodies of IgG2 isotype. In contrast, only 12% (#64) or 49% (#58) of the GP-binding antibodies were of IgG isotype even after prime-boost ChAd3-MVA vaccination, with 88% (#64) or 46% (#58) of GP-binding antibodies representing IgM isotype antibodies (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>). No GP antibody binding for negative control plasma (#36) excluded the possibility that this IgM response following vaccination or infection may be due to polyreactive natural antibodies (i.e., sticky antibodies not induced by GP). Furthermore, in our previous study, the purified IgM antibodies following the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccination showed EBOV neutralizing activity confirming the GP specificity of IgM binding antibodies in SPR (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>). GP-bound IgA antibodies ranged from 3% to 15% in EBOV survivors plasma compared with 4.2% in ChAd3-MVA post-vaccination plasma (#58).
