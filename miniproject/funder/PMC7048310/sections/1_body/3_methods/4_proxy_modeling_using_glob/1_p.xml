<p>We developed proxy models to predict the cluster success of 6271 geographically diverse influenza A/H3N2 sequences sampled from 2006–2018. Clusters were distinguished by single mutations in epitope sites on the HA1 sequence. All strains within a cluster have the same number of epitope mutations with respect to a reference strain, which is defined as having zero epitope mutations. Thus, clusters in the empirical data are defined by the number of epitope mutations. This is in comparison to clusters in the simulated data, which are defined by their degree of immune escape conferred by antigenic mutations. To estimate frequency in the population, we calculated the number of sequences belonging to a cluster over all sequences sampled in a two-month moving window. Using the estimated frequency and the number of epitope mutations in a cluster, we derived twenty measures of fitness and competition based on the first two time points a cluster was sampled (

Only 378 of the 1516 unique clusters sampled from 2006–2018 were sampled at least twice and thus used to fit the models. We tested all combinations of fitness and competition measures (N = 121) in a logistic regression framework, using the AUC, positive predictive value, and sensitivity as performance measures (
