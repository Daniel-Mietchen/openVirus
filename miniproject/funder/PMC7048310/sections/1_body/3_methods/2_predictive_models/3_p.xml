<p>We evaluated model performance by predicting the evolutionary outcomes of clusters in the held-out test subset. We calculated three metrics: the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), the sensitivity (the proportion of all positives predicted as positive), and the positive predictive value (the proportion of true positives of all predicted positives). The model predicts the probability that a cluster will establish. To translate these outputs into discrete binary predictions of future success, we applied a probability threshold which maximized the F1 score [

When we included historical data of candidate predictors, i.e. the value of a candidate predictor at an earlier surveillance threshold, positive predictive values were marginally higher, while sensitivity values were similar to those from models only the current surveillance threshold data (
