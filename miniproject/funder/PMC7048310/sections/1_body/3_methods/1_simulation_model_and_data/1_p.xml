<p>We implemented a published stochastic individual-based susceptible-infected (SI) phylodynamic model of influenza A/H3N2 [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to repeatedly simulate 30 years of transmission in a well-mixed population of constant size (40 million hosts) with birth and death dynamics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In brief, each individual host is characterized by its infection status––susceptible or infected––and a history of prior viral infections. Viruses are defined by a discrete antigenic phenotype, which determines the degree of immune escape from other phenotypes, and a deleterious genetic mutation load (
 <italic>k</italic>) which affects the virus’ transmissibility. Antigenic mutations occur stochastically and confer advanced antigenicity to the virus. We assume that the degree of immune escape conferred by the antigenic mutations follows the gamma distribution described in Koelle &amp; Rasmussen [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (mean 0.012, shape parameter = 2). New antigenic clusters (phenotypes) are generated when the conferred advanced antigenicity exceeds the mean of this distribution. The probability that a given virus will infect a given host is determined by how similar the antigenic phenotype of the challenging virus is to the antigenic phenotype of the host’s most related previous infection. This probability, or degree of immune escape, is tracked through the simulation by the evolutionary history of clusters (parent-child relationships).
