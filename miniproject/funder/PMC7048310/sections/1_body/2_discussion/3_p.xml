<p>The second most informative predictor selected across all models––the population-wide variance in the effective growth rate, var(
 <italic>R</italic>)––requires a more nuanced interpretation. The greater the background variance at the time a cluster is emerging, the less likely the cluster is to succeed. To unpack this result, we analyzed the competitive environment of emerging clusters with only modest growth rates; rapidly growing clusters are likely to succeed regardless of their competition. Within this class of slowly emerging viruses, those that initially face a single high frequency dominant cluster and fewer co-emerging competitors are more likely to succeed [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A recent sweep by a dominant cluster leaves a wake of immunity that can be exploited by antigenically-novel clusters that stochastically battle for future dominance. We hypothesize that these two conditions––a reigning dominant cluster and reduced competition with emerging novelty––reduce the overall variance in viral growth rate and explain the negative correlation between this quantity and the future ascent of an emerging cluster.
