<p>Until we develop an effective universal flu vaccine, seasonal vaccines will remain the frontline of influenza prevention. The severe 2017–2018 influenza season was a stark reminder that anticipating dominant strains with sufficient lead time for incorporation into vaccines is paramount to public health. Here, we analyzed over 1500 years of simulated influenza phylodynamics to explore the predictability of antigenic emergence and identify early predictors of future evolutionary success that can be plausibly monitored via ongoing surveillance efforts. We compared our results derived from a detailed omnipotent simulation to a simulated scenario that places restrictions on the data available for virus characterization and to an empirical dataset of influenza sequences from 2006–2018.</p>
