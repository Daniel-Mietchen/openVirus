<p>We fit classifier models to the empirical data using relative epitope number and other proxies for fitness (e.g. fold change and growth rate between sequential sampling of a cluster) and competition, (e.g., the number of co-circulating clusters) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s014">S6 Table</xref>) for all clusters that reached at least 1% relative frequency. Given the limited data, we estimated fitness and competition proxies using the first two sample points for each cluster that had not yet reached 20% relative frequency. Several of these proxies were able to predict future evolutionary success. However, our best two-predictor model, which considered a clusterâ€™s frequency at its first sample point and the number of competing clusters lost by the second sample point, achieved only a sensitivity of 56% and PPV of 50% at predicting the evolutionary fate of a cluster (

Both sensitivity and positive predictive values were below those of the simulated-based models built on the 1% surveillance threshold (69% and 62% respectively) and the simulated-based models built on an opportunistic sampling scheme that more closely reflected the structure of the empirical data (75% and 70% respectively,
