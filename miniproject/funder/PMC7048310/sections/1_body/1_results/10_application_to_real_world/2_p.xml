<p>We could not directly estimate the growth rate of each emerging cluster from available data (as in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the epitope mutations in the empirical data were a proxy for the antigenic mutations that were tracked in the simulated data. However, while in the simulated data we could capture the immune escape effect associated with each antigenic mutation, in the empirical data, we could only note presence-absence of epitope mutations. Since growth rate advantages may stem from mutations in the epitope region of the virus and such mutations can be readily identified and counted using available sequence data, we evaluated the presence of epitope mutations as a possible proxy for growth rate. Specifically, we divided the average number of epitope mutations in viruses within a given cluster by the average number found in other co-circulating viruses. For clusters that reached at least 1% relative frequency, this quantity was less than one for clusters that eventually established (N = 18) and greater than one for transient clusters that did not establish (N = 1516); this difference was statistically significant (Holm’s P. adjusted, p = 0.03) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). As noted, the absolute number of epitope mutations does not capture the effect on immune escape. A possible explanation for why emerging clusters had fewer epitope mutations is that individual mutations of large fitness effects provided a competitive advantage over multiple mutations of smaller effect. However, this difference was not significant when measured for clusters reaching at least the 2% relative frequency surveillance threshold (Holm’s P. adjusted, p = 0.18). Therefore, single mutations of large effect are most influential in overcoming the initial stochastic hurdle to emergence.
