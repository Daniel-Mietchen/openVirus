<p>The primary predictor across all models––the relative growth rate of a cluster––cannot easily be estimated from available surveillance data. Thus, we built and evaluated bivariate logistic regression models on simulated data that predict future success using more easily attained proxies (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). One model considered the time taken for the cluster to rise from 6% to 10% relative frequency and the total number of clusters that grew during this period; the other considered the fold-change in the relative frequency of the cluster between these time points and the background variance in fold-change. Of the four proxies, all but the relative fold-change of the cluster were statistically significant predictors, with negative effects on the probability of cluster success (

These resulting models had higher sensitivity than positive predictive values, but both sensitivity and positive predictive value were lower in these models than the model using the complete simulated data at the 10% surveillance threshold. We also tested analogous models using statistics calculated at alternative surveillance checkpoints (1% to 5%, 3% to 5%, and 8% to 10%), and found that the 6%-10% comparison performed best (
