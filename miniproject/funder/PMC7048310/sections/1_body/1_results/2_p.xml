<p>We assumed that clusters become detectable once they cross a relative frequency threshold of 1% and were fully established if they maintained a relative frequency above 20% for at least 45 weeks. In our simulations, 2% of the approximately 200 novel antigenic clusters per year overcame early stochastic loss to reach detectable levels. As the relative frequency of a newly emerging cluster increased, the probability that the cluster will ultimately establish also increased. There was an inverse relationship between the number of clusters that reached a threshold and the probability of future success. For example, far fewer clusters reached a relative frequency of 10% than 1%. If a cluster succeeded in reaching relative frequency thresholds of 1%, 6%, and 10%, its probability of establishing increased from 13% to 50% to 67% (
