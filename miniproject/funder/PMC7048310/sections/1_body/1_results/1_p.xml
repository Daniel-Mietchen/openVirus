<p>Our simulations roughly reproduced the global epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of H3N2 influenza over a 25-year period. Without seasonal forcing, prevalence rose and fell, peaking every 3.2 years on average (s.d. = 1.6). These dynamics reflected the turnover and competition of antigenic clusters. The median of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our simulations was 5.9 years (IQR 4.62–7.9), which is higher than empirical estimates of 3.89 years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The median life span of established clusters was 1128 days (s.d. = 480), corresponding to roughly 3.5 years. However, the annual incidence of influenza in our model (4.0%, 95% CI 0.37–9.7%) was lower than empirical annual incidence estimates of 9–15% [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the model only simulated the transmission of H3N2 and not all circulating influenza types, our annual incidence was comparable to empirical estimates [
