<p>When forecasting influenza dynamics, there may be tradeoffs between prediction certainty, the extent advanced warning, and the surveillance effort required to detect and characterize emerging viruses. Across our ten models, there was a marked trade-off between lead-time and reliability, with low surveillance thresholds providing earlier but less accurate indication of future threats (
