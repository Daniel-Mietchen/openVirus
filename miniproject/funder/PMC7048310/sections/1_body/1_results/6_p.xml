<p>The background variance in viral growth rates, var(
 <italic>R</italic>), was the second most informative predictor. The lower the variance, the more likely a cluster was to establish. However, it was a weaker predictor than 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>/〈
 <italic>R</italic>〉’s; the estimated logit coefficient of the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>/〈
 <italic>R</italic>〉 was approximately four times that of var(
 <italic>R</italic>) (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The var(
 <italic>R</italic>) tended to increase as a cluster expanded from 1% to 10% relative frequency (Wilcox, p &lt; 2.2e-16). This may stem from diverging fitnesses of the newly expanding cluster and the receding dominant cluster, which had likely accumulated a considerable deleterious load and burned through much of its susceptible host population. A higher var(
 <italic>R</italic>) decreased the probability of a cluster being successful, particularly when a cluster had only a modest growth rate. Clusters with high 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>/〈
 <italic>R</italic>〉’s were successful even when emerging in highly variant environments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). High variance may reflect high levels of inter-viral competition. If we considered both transient and established clusters with similar 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>/〈
 <italic>R</italic>〉 (ranging from 1.025 to 1.03), successful clusters encountered significantly fewer co-circulating clusters, and the frequency of the resident dominant cluster was significantly higher (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This may reflect suppression of competition by the dominant cluster, creating a vacuum for a moderately fit cluster to fill.
