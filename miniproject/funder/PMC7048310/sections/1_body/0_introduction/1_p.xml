<p>Seasonal influenza A/H3N2 causes significant annual morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as severe economic losses [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the United States, the 2017–2018 season was unusually long and severe, lasting over 16 weeks and causing over 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 fatalities, including 183 pediatric deaths [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The global health community continually tracks H3N2 and annually updates the H3N2 component of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, annual influenza epidemics continue to impart a significant public health burden. The rapid antigenic evolution of the influenza virus via mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins and neuraminidase (NA) enzymes [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and logistical requirement of selecting vaccine strains almost a year prior to the flu season pose a significant challenge. Vaccines target the antigen-binding regions of dominant influenza subtypes. While a particular subtype may circulate for a few years, strong positive selection for new antigenic variants will eventually produce antigenic drift [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], rendering a vaccine less effective if new mutations in the antigen-binding regions are not included in vaccine chosen strains [
