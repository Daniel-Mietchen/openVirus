   </bold> Because the top selected predictors across all models cannot easily be estimated using readily available surveillance data, we evaluated several proxy measures of viral growth rates and viral competition. We compared approximations that measure growth rates. Contour lines indicate the density of values for clusters that establish (black, N = 1126) and those that transiently circulate (grey, N = 723). Values along the x-axis indicate the empirical relative growth rate of a cluster the moment it reaches the 10% surveillance threshold. Values along the y-axis indicate the proxy measure (rate of change in (a) and relative fold change in (b) for the cluster, approximated for the time between the 6% and 10% surveillance thresholds.) The rate of change, measured in the number of days between the two thresholds, is a better proxy measure than relative fold change.
