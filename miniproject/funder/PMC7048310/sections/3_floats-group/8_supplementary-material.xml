  <title>Distinguishing cluster behavior.</title>
  <p>(a) Histograms of the number of days established and transient clusters were above 20% relative frequency. The red line designates the 45-day threshold we used in criteria for defining successful clusters. (b) Established clusters circulate longer at higher frequencies than transient clusters. Considering a cluster's maximum relative frequency in the population and how many days it circulated above 20% relative frequency, two groups of clusters emerge around the one to two-month mark (dashed lines). We do not suspect our results would be sensitive to slight changes in the day criterion within this range as the number of clusters in this range represent less than 1% of our sample. We chose 45 days as a balance between confirming the cluster circulated at a sufficient level to possibly warrant public health attention and reducing false positives</p>
