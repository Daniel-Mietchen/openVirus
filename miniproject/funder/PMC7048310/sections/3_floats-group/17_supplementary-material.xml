  <title>Evaluating proxy measures for different phases of a novel antigenic cluster's early expansion.</title>
  <p>Model 1 shows the performance of the best-fit model using the actual values of relative fitness (relative growth rate) and competition (variance in the population growth rate) for clusters that reached the 5% surveillance thresholds (top two sections) and the 10% surveillance threshold (bottom two sections). Within each section, Model 2 substituted a time proxy for the fitness term and the absolute number of clusters that were growing for the competition term. Model 3 substituted a relative fold change for the fitness term and the population-wide variance in fold change for the competition term.

   </sub> is when the same cluster reaches the higher surveillance threshold (5%, 10%) Performance metric values are the median across the five folds in cross-validation. Balanced accuracy measures the accuracy of the model, accounting for the imbalance in outcomes (i.e. number of transient versus established clusters) in the data set. In addition, to the terms included in the table, we tested the fold change of the dominant cluster from
