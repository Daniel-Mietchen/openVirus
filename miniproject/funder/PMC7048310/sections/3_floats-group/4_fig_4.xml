  <title>Model performance across surveillance thresholds.</title>
  <p>(A) Area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) suggests that models can predict successful from unsuccessful clusters by the time they reached 1% of circulating viruses, with discriminatory power declining slightly as clusters rose in frequency. Bars represent the max, median, and minimum AUC values across 5-fold cross validation. (B-C) There was a trade-off between lead time and model performance. The horizontal bars represent the IQR of time between the moment the expanding antigenic cluster reaches the surveillance threshold and when it reaches the success criteria. Vertical bars represent the range and median positive predictive value (B) and sensitivity (C), across five-fold evaluation. Colors correspond to the best fit model for each surveillance threshold. Dashed gray lines indicate lead times of nine months, which represents the current time between the Northern Hemisphere vaccine composition meeting in February and the following start of the influenza season in October.</p>
