   <bold>Out-of-sample predictions of antigenic cluster evolutionary success at relative frequency thresholds of 1% (A) and 10% (B).</bold> Grey shading indicates clusters that surpass the surveillance threshold, but do not establish. Other colors correspond to distinct antigenic clusters that eventually establish. The top time series graphs depict the absolute prevalence of antigenic clusters; the middle graphs give their relative frequencies. The bottom panels indicate the timing and accuracy of out-of-sample predictions based on the optimized model for each surveillance threshold. The top row of symbols indicate clusters predicted to succeed, with true positives indicated by circles and false positives indicated by crosses; the bottom row indicates clusters predicted to circulate only transiently, true negatives indicated by triangles and false negatives indicated by squares. The number of predictions in each category is provided in the legend.
