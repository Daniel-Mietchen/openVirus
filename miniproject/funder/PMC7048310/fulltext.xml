Anticipating the timing and outcome of transitions is critical to developing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Using a published phylodynamic model of influenza transmission, we identified indicators of future evolutionary success for an emerging antigenic cluster and quantified fundamental trade-offs in our ability to make such predictions. The eventual fate of a new cluster depends on its initial epidemiological growth rate&#x02013;&#x02013;which is a function of mutational load and population susceptibility to the cluster&#x02013;&#x02013;along with the variance in growth rate across co-circulating viruses. Logistic regression can predict whether a cluster at 5% relative frequency will eventually succeed with ~80% sensitivity, providing up to eight months advance warning. As a cluster expands, the predictions improve while the lead-time for vaccine development and other interventions decreases. However, attempts to make comparable predictions from 12 years of <italic>empirical</italic> influenza surveillance data, which are far sparser and more coarse-grained, achieve only 56% sensitivity. By expanding influenza surveillance to obtain more granular estimates of the frequencies of and population-wide susceptibility to emerging viruses, we can better anticipate major antigenic transitions. This provides added incentives for accelerating the vaccine production cycle to reduce the lead time required for strain selection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The efficacy of annual seasonal influenza vaccines depends on selecting the strain that best matches circulating viruses. This selection takes place 9&#x02013;12 months prior to the influenza season. To advise this decision, we used an influenza A/H3N2 phylodynamic simulation to explore how reliably and how far in advance can we identify strains that will dominate future influenza seasons? What data should we collect to accelerate and improve the accuracy of such forecasts? And importantly, what is the gap between the theoretical limit of prediction and prediction based on current influenza surveillance? Our results suggest that even with detailed virological information, the tight race between the antigenic turnover dynamics and the vaccine development timeline limits early detection of emerging viruses. Predictions based on current influenza surveillance do not achieve the theoretical limit and thus our results provide impetus for denser sampling and the development of rapid methods for estimating viral fitness.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>LAC was supported through the National Defense Science &#x00026; Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program.

In the United States, the 2017&#x02013;2018 season was unusually long and severe, lasting over 16 weeks and causing over 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 fatalities, including 183 pediatric deaths [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The global health community continually tracks H3N2 and annually updates the H3N2 component of the seasonal influenza vaccine. However, annual influenza epidemics continue to impart a significant public health burden. The rapid antigenic evolution of the influenza virus via mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins and neuraminidase (NA) enzymes [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and logistical requirement of selecting vaccine strains almost a year prior to the flu season pose a significant challenge. Vaccines target the antigen-binding regions of dominant influenza subtypes. While a particular subtype may circulate for a few years, strong positive selection for new antigenic variants will eventually produce antigenic drift [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], rendering a vaccine less effective if new mutations in the antigen-binding regions are not included in vaccine chosen strains [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The typical reign of a dominant subtype ranges from two to eight years [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis of test-negative design studies found that the H3N2 component of the seasonal flu vaccine had an estimated average efficacy of 33% (CI = 26%-39%) from 2004&#x02013;2015 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The World Health Organization&#x02019;s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) coordinates influenza surveillance efforts to survey and characterize the diversity of influenza viruses circulating in humans. Viral samples are rapidly analyzed via sequencing of HA and NA genes, serologic assays, and other laboratory tests to identify newly emerging antigenic clusters. Within the past decade, the number of complete HA gene sequences in the GISAID EpiFlu [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] database has increased tenfold, from fewer than 1,000 in 2010 to over 10,000 in 2017 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Molecular data at high spatiotemporal resolution could potentially revolutionize influenza prediction. However, the research and public health communities have just begun to determine effective strategies for extracting and integrating useful information into the vaccine selection process.</p><p>Phylodynamic models describe the interaction between the epidemiological and evolutionary processes of a pathogen [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The availability of molecular data coupled with the recent development of detailed, data-driven phylodynamic models has galvanized the new field of viral predictive modeling [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These models aim to predict the future prevalence of specific viral subtypes based on past and present molecular data. For example, one approach generates one-year ahead forecasts of clade frequency using a fitness model parameterized by the number of antigenic and genetic mutations that dictate the virus&#x02019; antigenicity and stability respectively [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another method maps antigenic distance from hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data onto an HA genealogy to determine whether the changes in antigenicity among high-growth clades necessitate a vaccine composition update [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A third model predicts which clade will be the progenitor lineage of the subsequent influenza season by estimating fitness using a growth rate measure derived from topological features of the HA genealogy [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. All three approaches have been tested on historical predictions. &#x00141;uksza&#x02019;s &#x00026; L&#x000e4;ssig&#x02019;s model [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] predicted positive growth for 93% of clades that increased in frequency over one year. Steinbruk <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] predicted the predominant HA allele over nine influenza seasons with an accuracy of 78%.

Since 2015, both these models have been used to provide recommendations on vaccine composition for the upcoming influenza seasons [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, this body of work points to the promise of predictive evolutionary models. Phylodynamic simulation models provide a complementary window into the molecular evolution of emerging viruses. By observing influenza evolution <italic>in silico</italic>, we can take a rigorous experimental approach to test hypotheses about early indicators of cluster [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] success and design surveillance strategies to inform vaccine strain selection. Here, we simulate decades of H3N2 evolution and transmission using a published phylodynamics model [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and analyze the simulated data to identify early predictors of a cluster&#x02019;s evolutionary fate. Viral growth rates&#x02013;&#x02013;both for an emerging cluster and its competitors&#x02013;&#x02013;are the most robust predictors of future ascents. When a new antigenic cluster first appears at low frequency (e.g., 1% of sampled viruses), our statistical logistic regression models can predict whether it will eventually rise to dominance (e.g., maintain a relative frequency greater than 20% of sampled viruses for at least 45 days) with reasonable confidence and advanced warning. We also attempt to adapt these statistical models into actionable guidelines for global influenza surveillance by developing proxy indicators that can be readily estimated from available data. Using both simulated data and 6,271 influenza sequences collected between 2006 and 2018, we quantify the limits in the accuracy, precision and timeliness of predictions, and construct models to predict future frequencies of emerging clusters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>Our simulations roughly reproduced the global epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of H3N2 influenza over a 25-year period. Without seasonal forcing, prevalence rose and fell, peaking every 3.2 years on average (s.d. = 1.6). These dynamics reflected the turnover and competition of antigenic clusters. The median of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) in our simulations was 5.9 years (IQR 4.62&#x02013;7.9), which is higher than empirical estimates of 3.89 years [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The median life span of established clusters was 1128 days (s.d. = 480), corresponding to roughly 3.5 years. However, the annual incidence of influenza in our model (4.0%, 95% CI 0.37&#x02013;9.7%) was lower than empirical annual incidence estimates of 9&#x02013;15% [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the model only simulated the transmission of H3N2 and not all circulating influenza types, our annual incidence was comparable to empirical estimates [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>We assumed that clusters become detectable once they cross a relative frequency threshold of 1% and were fully established if they maintained a relative frequency above 20% for at least 45 weeks. In our simulations, 2% of the approximately 200 novel antigenic clusters per year overcame early stochastic loss to reach detectable levels. As the relative frequency of a newly emerging cluster increased, the probability that the cluster will ultimately establish also increased. There was an inverse relationship between the number of clusters that reached a threshold and the probability of future success. For example, far fewer clusters reached a relative frequency of 10% than 1%. If a cluster succeeded in reaching relative frequency thresholds of 1%, 6%, and 10%, its probability of establishing increased from 13% to 50% to 67% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Our logistic regression model classified clusters as either <italic>positives</italic> that are likely to establish or <italic>negatives</italic> that are expected to circulate only transiently. As we increased the surveillance threshold, the fraction of successful clusters that were misclassified as negatives decreased. In a representative out-of-sample 25-year simulation, 17 of 132 detectable clusters eventually rose to dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Of these, 65% and 88% were correctly predicted when they reached the 1% and 10% surveillance threshold, respectively. The number of true negative events decreased considerably, from 109 at the 1% surveillance threshold to only 11 at the 10% surveillance threshold, while the other types of events held relatively constant.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007683.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007683.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p><bold>Out-of-sample predictions of antigenic cluster evolutionary success at relative frequency thresholds of 1% (A) and 10% (B).</bold> Grey shading indicates clusters that surpass the surveillance threshold, but do not establish.

As newly emerging clusters rose in relative frequency from 1% to 10%, their relative growth rate declined towards one. That is, they approached the population average fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The relative growth rate was significantly higher for clusters that will eventually establish than those that will burn out, with the separation between the two groups increasing as the clusters ascend in frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This predictor is a composite quantity, estimated based on both mutational load and effective susceptibility. We compared these two quantities at two time points, when the clusters reached 1% and 10% frequencies. Mutational load increased and effective susceptibility decreased in ascending clusters, with more extreme changes occurring in clusters that ultimately failed to establish. We also measured the changes in these two quantities for the entire population, and found that the background mutational load remained relatively constant and background effective susceptibility increased slightly. The background effective susceptibility peaked when a new cluster began to constitute a major proportion of the circulating types&#x02013;&#x02013;at this point the immunity from previous infections was not strongly protective against the newly dominant cluster. The decline in cluster fitness likely stems from the accumulation of deleterious mutations and exhaustion of the susceptible population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). While this occurred within both established and transient clusters, the mutational loads in established and transients increased by averages of 1.4 and 2.04 mutations, respectively (Wilcox, p &#x0003c; 2.2e-16).</p><fig id="pcbi.1007683.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007683.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Relative growth rates predicted future success.</title><p>(A) Clusters that eventually establish had significantly higher <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>/&#x02329;<italic>R</italic>&#x0232a; than those that fail to establish.

Clusters were distinguished by single mutations to epitope sites on the HA1 sequence and successful clusters were those that reached a relative frequency of at least 20% for at least 45 days. Despite sparse sampling, the dynamics of antigenic transitions resembled those produced by our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

We divided the number of epitope mutations of a focal cluster by the average number of mutations of simultaneously circulating clusters.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1007683.g005"/></fig><p>We could not directly estimate the growth rate of each emerging cluster from available data (as in <xref rid="pcbi.1007683.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the epitope mutations in the empirical data were a proxy for the antigenic mutations that were tracked in the simulated data. However, while in the simulated data we could capture the immune escape effect associated with each antigenic mutation, in the empirical data, we could only note presence-absence of epitope mutations. Since growth rate advantages may stem from mutations in the epitope region of the virus and such mutations can be readily identified and counted using available sequence data, we evaluated the presence of epitope mutations as a possible proxy for growth rate. Specifically, we divided the average number of epitope mutations in viruses within a given cluster by the average number found in other co-circulating viruses. For clusters that reached at least 1% relative frequency, this quantity was less than one for clusters that eventually established (N = 18) and greater than one for transient clusters that did not establish (N = 1516); this difference was statistically significant (Holm&#x02019;s P. adjusted, p = 0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). As noted, the absolute number of epitope mutations does not capture the effect on immune escape. A possible explanation for why emerging clusters had fewer epitope mutations is that individual mutations of large fitness effects provided a competitive advantage over multiple mutations of smaller effect. However, this difference was not significant when measured for clusters reaching at least the 2% relative frequency surveillance threshold (Holm&#x02019;s P. adjusted, p = 0.18). Therefore, single mutations of large effect are most influential in overcoming the initial stochastic hurdle to emergence.</p><p>We fit classifier models to the empirical data using relative epitope number and other proxies for fitness (e.g. fold change and growth rate between sequential sampling of a cluster) and competition, (e.g., the number of co-circulating clusters) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s014">S6 Table</xref>) for all clusters that reached at least 1% relative frequency. Given the limited data, we estimated fitness and competition proxies using the first two sample points for each cluster that had not yet reached 20% relative frequency. Several of these proxies were able to predict future evolutionary success. However, our best two-predictor model, which considered a cluster&#x02019;s frequency at its first sample point and the number of competing clusters lost by the second sample point, achieved only a sensitivity of 56% and PPV of 50% at predicting the evolutionary fate of a cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s015">S7 Table</xref>). Both sensitivity and positive predictive values were below those of the simulated-based models built on the 1% surveillance threshold (69% and 62% respectively) and the simulated-based models built on an opportunistic sampling scheme that more closely reflected the structure of the empirical data (75% and 70% respectively, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec005"><title>Discussion</title><p>Until we develop an effective universal flu vaccine, seasonal vaccines will remain the frontline of influenza prevention. The severe 2017&#x02013;2018 influenza season was a stark reminder that anticipating dominant strains with sufficient lead time for incorporation into vaccines is paramount to public health. Here, we analyzed over 1500 years of simulated influenza phylodynamics to explore the predictability of antigenic emergence and identify early predictors of future evolutionary success that can be plausibly monitored via ongoing surveillance efforts. We compared our results derived from a detailed omnipotent simulation to a simulated scenario that places restrictions on the data available for virus characterization and to an empirical dataset of influenza sequences from 2006&#x02013;2018.</p><p>Phylodynamic models provide insight into both the interplay of evolutionary and epidemiological processes and how these dynamics are manifested in observable data. In simulated data, the strongest predictor of future dominance across all of our models is the relative effective reproductive number of a cluster, that is, the growth rate of the cluster compared to the average growth rate across the viral population. This measure of viral fitness incorporates both the real-time competitive advantage (vis-a-vis the immunological landscape) and deleterious mutational load. Intuitively, faster growing clusters are more likely to persist and expand. Our ability to predict the fate of an emergent virus improves as the cluster increases in relative frequency. Both sensitivity&#x02013;&#x02013;the proportion of successful clusters detected by the model&#x02013;&#x02013;and positive predictive value&#x02013;&#x02013;the proportion of predicted successes that actually establish&#x02013;&#x02013;surpass 80% by the time a cluster has reached 10% relative frequency.</p><p>The second most informative predictor selected across all models&#x02013;&#x02013;the population-wide variance in the effective growth rate, var(<italic>R</italic>)&#x02013;&#x02013;requires a more nuanced interpretation. The greater the background variance at the time a cluster is emerging, the less likely the cluster is to succeed. To unpack this result, we analyzed the competitive environment of emerging clusters with only modest growth rates; rapidly growing clusters are likely to succeed regardless of their competition. Within this class of slowly emerging viruses, those that initially face a single high frequency dominant cluster and fewer co-emerging competitors are more likely to succeed [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A recent sweep by a dominant cluster leaves a wake of immunity that can be exploited by antigenically-novel clusters that stochastically battle for future dominance. We hypothesize that these two conditions&#x02013;&#x02013;a reigning dominant cluster and reduced competition with emerging novelty&#x02013;&#x02013;reduce the overall variance in viral growth rate and explain the negative correlation between this quantity and the future ascent of an emerging cluster.</p><p>Our top predictors of viral emergence require a comprehensive sampling of the viral and host population. Although exact measurements of these quantities are practically infeasible, our results suggest that targeting molecular surveillance towards precise and accurate estimation of viral growth rates, both for newly emerging clusters and the resident circulating viruses, may enhance influenza prediction. One approach is to target the two key components of growth rate separately&#x02013;&#x02013;mutational load and effective susceptibility. Changes in the mutational load can be estimated from sequence data, comparing the number of differences that occur in non-epitope portions of the genome over time [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our parameterization of <italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub> follows the empirical method of [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with fitness costs based on nonsynonymous amino acid differences between a given strain and its most recent common ancestor. Estimating the effective susceptibility is more challenging, as it depends on the interaction between an individual&#x02019;s exposure history [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and new amino acid substitutions in epitope coding regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nonetheless, several studies introduce innovative methods for estimating susceptibility from the historic distribution of influenza subtypes, seasonal influenza prevalence, and HI-titers. For example, Neher <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] predict antigenic properties of novel clades by mapping both serological and sequence data to a phylogenetic tree structure of HA sequences. &#x00141;uksza &#x00026; L&#x000e4;ssig estimate effective susceptibility by first estimating the historic frequency of clades in six-month intervals and then estimating cross-immunity between those clades and the focal cluster based on amino acid differences in epitope regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, both methods only consider clusters that have already surpassed 10% relative frequency, at which point strains are thought to be geographically well-mixed and less prone to geographic sampling bias.</p><p>Another approach to estimating the growth rate of an emerging cluster is to treat it as a composite quantity. We evaluated several proxy measures of cluster growth rate, including the relative fold-change in frequency between two time points. Models based on fold change rather than the true growth rate actually have greater sensitivity, that is, they are more likely to detect clusters destined for dominance when they first emerge. However, the positive predictive values of our best models drop from 0.81 to 0.67, meaning that replacing the true growth rates with an approximation increases the rate of false alarms. Importantly, the proxy model improves with the addition of a second predictor, the variance in fold-change across the viral population, which can also be readily estimated from surveillance data. Thus, variance in fitness appears to be a robust secondary predictor of future sweeps, regardless of how fitness is quantified. Surprisingly, a model based on seemingly naive approximations of growth rate&#x02013;&#x02013;the time elapsed between two frequency thresholds and the number of other co-circulating clusters rising in frequency&#x02013;&#x02013;was even more accurate, though still inferior to the true growth rate models. We did not evaluate a promising alternative strategy for approximating fitness, based on the phylogenetic reconstruction of currently circulating sequences [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Unlike the proxies we considered, this does not require historical data but does rely on pathogen sequencing. Finally, although not as informative as predictors that quantify the evolutionary and immunological state of the population, easily quantifiable predictors such as the total number of infected individuals or the frequency of the circulating dominant cluster, can be incorporated into future predictive models.</p><p>Our attempts to apply the optimized models to empirical data were of limited success. While the global evolutionary dynamics of influenza A/H3N2 clusters visually resemble those observed in our simulations, the sparse genotypic data available do not permit estimation of the phenotypic predictors identified in our study. In the absence of these phenotypic predictors, we identified proxies of fitness and competition in the number of epitope mutations and frequency. The number of epitope mutations in a newly emerging cluster relative to co-circulating viruses provides early indication of future success. This provides proof of concept that the evolutionary viability of influenza viruses is predictable but will require better models for estimating viral fitness from sequence data and the expansion of surveillance efforts [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] to collect phenotypic data reflecting the mutational loads of viruses and dynamic trends in population susceptibility early in their circulation. The poor model performance likely stems from both data quality and data quantity. At the 10% surveillance threshold, we trained and tested each <italic>simulation</italic> model on an average of 1488.8 antigenic clusters (s.d. 23.79) and 372.2 clusters (s.d. 23.79), respectively. In contrast, the <italic>empirical</italic> models were trained and tested on 303 and 75 clusters (only three of which eventually established), respectively. The empirical models may also be limited by real-world complexity that is not captured in the simulation model. Whereas the model assumes a well-mixed population of 40 million people, actual influenza circulation occurs in a larger and more heterogeneous population in which the fate of a newly emerging virus may be far more context dependent and thus less predictable.</p><p>Nonetheless, we believe that our simulation results provide robust insight into the limits of influenza surveillance and molecular forecasting. While the certainty of our predictions improves as clusters increase in relative frequency, there is a trade-off with lead time. The longer we wait to assess a rising cluster, the less time there will be to update vaccines and implement other intervention measures. For a successful cluster detected at a relative frequency of 1%, there will be, on average, 10 months before the cluster becomes established (maintains a relative frequency over 20% for 45 days). If detected only after reaching a relative frequency of 10%, the expected lead time shrinks to four months. Although real-world surveillance is noisy and dependent on sufficient sampling depth and geographic coverage, our results suggest that, with a perfect knowledge of the host and viral populations, predictions can be made with at least 85% sensitivity and confidence before a cluster rises to 10% of all circulating strains.</p><p>As policy-makers consider new strategies for antigenic surveillance and forecasting, the trade-off between prediction accuracy and lead time has practical implications. For example, a detection system targeting new viruses as soon as they reach 1% relative frequency has the benefit of early warning and drawback of low accuracy, which translate into economic and humanitarian costs and benefits. On the positive side, early warning increases the probability that seasonal vaccines will provide a good match with circulating strains, and thus lowers the expected future morbidity and mortality attributable to seasonal influenza. Based on the vaccine production and delivery schedule, the surveillance window for emerging clades is from October to February for the Northern Hemisphere and vaccine composition is determined at an international meeting in February [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our analysis suggests that, at nine months before an emerging cluster sweeps to dominance, it is likely to be circulating at a low relative frequency in the range of 1% to 4%. On the negative side, the low surveillance threshold for candidate clusters and consequent lower accuracy require far more surveillance and vaccine development resources than higher surveillance thresholds. In our simulations, for example, the number of clusters screened at the 1% threshold is an order of magnitude higher than at the 10% surveillance threshold and the number of false positive predictions potentially prompting further investigation is also manifold greater.</p><p>While our study provides actionable suggestions for improving both the surveillance and forecasting of antigenic turnover, it is limited by several assumptions. One caveat of our method is that we do not capture the explicit phylogenetic structure of the influenza population. Therefore, we do not distinguish between clusters that are successful because of one mutation and clusters that are successful because of a series of mutations. If for instance, a novel antigenic mutation caused the emergence of a new cluster (phenotype) that circulated briefly before a second novel antigenic mutation caused a second phenotype that eventually achieved our defined criteria, we ignore the fact that the established cluster is a subclade of the first and that the antigenic mutation that conferred the first phenotype is fixed along with the second antigenic mutation [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This scenario follows Koelle &#x00026; Rasmussen&#x02019;s description of a two-step antigenic change molecular pathway that leads to antigenic cluster transitions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our analysis is therefore relevant for scenarios that depict their described jackpot strategy&#x02014;a combination of one large antigenic mutation occurring on a low deleterious background. Second, the simulation represents global H3N2 dynamics and ignores both differences in temperate and tropical transmission dynamics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and the emergence of a novel antigenic cluster via importation. Prior studies have revealed considerable global variation in transmission rates, which should positively correlate with the frequency of cluster transitions. Furthermore, viruses that emerge in tropical regions are more likely to be the source of viruses that eventually circulate in temperate regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Temperate regions produce more extreme seasonal bottlenecks, potentially leading to greater stochasticity in viral dynamics, which makes it more difficult for novel strains that emerge in temperate regions to spread globally [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For imported viruses, we expect the predictors of success to be similar to those arriving via mutation. However, an importing virus with a large antigenic jump may change the rate of establishment and reduce the time horizon for prediction. We also do not consider selective pressures imposed by seasonal vaccination. Its impact on antigenic turnover depends on vaccination rates and the immunological match between the vaccine and all co-circulating viruses. Seasonal vaccination could differentially modify the effective susceptibility of clusters, suppressing some while creating competitive vacuums for others. Theoretical study suggests that antigenic drift should slow down [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and the circulation of co-dominant clusters may become more common [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Given these caveats, we emphasize our qualitative rather than the quantitative results. Our study highlights promising predictors of viral success, characterizes robust trade-offs between the timing, costs and accuracy of such predictions, and serves as proof-of-concept that model-derived surveillance strategies can accelerate and improve forecasts of antigenic sweeps. If we fit similar models to surveillance data as it becomes increasingly available, the resulting predictions will likely reflect greater uncertainty but perhaps naturally reflect global variation in influenza dynamics and vaccination pressures.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that the early detection of emerging influenza viruses is limited by a tight race between the typical dynamics of antigenic turnover and the annual timeline for influenza vaccine development. The relatively poor performance of our models on empirical data provides impetus for denser sampling and the development of rapid computational and biological methods for estimating viral fitness. Nonetheless, it provides a foundation for analyzing the costs and benefits of expanding surveillance capacities and shortening the vaccine production pipeline. As we strive to expedite and improve molecular surveillance for vaccine strain selection, even incremental progress is valuable. Earlier detection of antigenic sweeps, regardless of vaccine efficacy, can inform better predictions of severity, public health messaging regarding personal protective measures, and clinical preparedness for seasonal influenza.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Simulation model and data</title><p>We implemented a published stochastic individual-based susceptible-infected (SI) phylodynamic model of influenza A/H3N2 [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to repeatedly simulate 30 years of transmission in a well-mixed population of constant size (40 million hosts) with birth and death dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007683.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In brief, each individual host is characterized by its infection status&#x02013;&#x02013;susceptible or infected&#x02013;&#x02013;and a history of prior viral infections. Viruses are defined by a discrete antigenic phenotype, which determines the degree of immune escape from other phenotypes, and a deleterious genetic mutation load (<italic>k</italic>) which affects the virus&#x02019; transmissibility. Antigenic mutations occur stochastically and confer advanced antigenicity to the virus. We assume that the degree of immune escape conferred by the antigenic mutations follows the gamma distribution described in Koelle &#x00026; Rasmussen [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (mean 0.012, shape parameter = 2). New antigenic clusters (phenotypes) are generated when the conferred advanced antigenicity exceeds the mean of this distribution. The probability that a given virus will infect a given host is determined by how similar the antigenic phenotype of the challenging virus is to the antigenic phenotype of the host&#x02019;s most related previous infection. This probability, or degree of immune escape, is tracked through the simulation by the evolutionary history of clusters (parent-child relationships).</p><p>Antigenic and deleterious non-antigenic mutations occur only during transmission events; the model assumes that viruses within a single individual host are genotypically homogeneous.

For each antigenic cluster, we predicted its evolutionary future (i.e., whether it ultimately becomes established) at specified surveillance thresholds, such as 5% relative frequency. Specifically, we recorded all candidate epidemiological and evolutionary predictors at the moment each cluster crossed the threshold. We analyzed all ten surveillance thresholds ranging from 1% to 10% at 1% increments. When a rising cluster reached 1% relative frequency, the median prevalence of infections caused by the cluster was 118 (IQR: 65&#x02013;205); at 10% relative frequency, the median prevalence was 1039 (IQR: 503&#x02013;1940).</p><p>For each surveillance threshold, we centered and scaled candidate predictors and removed collinear factors. Using five-fold cross validation, we partitioned the data into five subsets, keeping data from individual simulations in the same subsets.

Predictors were added sequentially based on which term lowered the average Akaike Information Criterion of the five training folds the most and provided a statistically significant better fit than the reduced model.</p><p>We evaluated model performance by predicting the evolutionary outcomes of clusters in the held-out test subset. We calculated three metrics: the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), the sensitivity (the proportion of all positives predicted as positive), and the positive predictive value (the proportion of true positives of all predicted positives). The model predicts the probability that a cluster will establish. To translate these outputs into discrete binary predictions of future success, we applied a probability threshold which maximized the F1 score [<xref rid="pcbi.1007683.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which is the harmonic mean of a model&#x02019;s positive predictive value and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s010">S2 Table</xref>).

We built models based on data sampled from ten random time points in each of the 62 25-year simulations.

Clusters were distinguished by single mutations in epitope sites on the HA1 sequence. All strains within a cluster have the same number of epitope mutations with respect to a reference strain, which is defined as having zero epitope mutations. Thus, clusters in the empirical data are defined by the number of epitope mutations. This is in comparison to clusters in the simulated data, which are defined by their degree of immune escape conferred by antigenic mutations. To estimate frequency in the population, we calculated the number of sequences belonging to a cluster over all sequences sampled in a two-month moving window. Using the estimated frequency and the number of epitope mutations in a cluster, we derived twenty measures of fitness and competition based on the first two time points a cluster was sampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007683.s014">S6 Table</xref>). Only 378 of the 1516 unique clusters sampled from 2006&#x02013;2018 were sampled at least twice and thus used to fit the models.
