<p>In the Tshwane District of South Africa, circumcisions performed by CAs were just as safe and effective compared with circumcisions performed by doctors. This finding is similar to the study done in Tanzania where the majority of the circumcisions was done by Clinical Officers with no difference in quality. [

Clients who were circumcised by CAs were significantly older than those circumcised by doctors. Clinical associates do not circumcise children younger than thirteen years old, as such the scope of practice may drive age differences in clients circumcised by doctors and CAs. [
 <xref rid="pone.0190795.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The clientsâ€™ general health did not differ between the two groups. Clinical associates spent less time doing circumcisions than doctors. Clinical associates may be more efficient and experienced due to high client volumes, alternatively doctors may be circumcising clients with complicated conditions such as phimosis and paraphimosis. Typically circumcision of clients with these conditions is more time-consuming.
