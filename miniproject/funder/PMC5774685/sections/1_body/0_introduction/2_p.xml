<p>One of the challenges of scaling up VMMCs is a shortage of human resources. Sufficient numbers of available healthcare professionals are needed to ensure surgical and non-surgical efficiency gains of low cost procedures such as VMMCs.[
 <xref rid="pone.0190795.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In 2008, the South African National Department of Health (NDoH) launched a new cadre of mid-level medical worker called Clinical Associates (CAs) to increase the number of healthcare professionals in the public sector, particularly in rural areas.[
 <xref rid="pone.0190795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Clinical associates are similar to physician assistants in other parts of the world. With more than 516 graduates deployed in eight provinces in 2015, CAs could be critical in the provision of VMMCs. To address the short supply of medical doctors in the public sector, the NDoH has identified task shifting of VMMCs from medical doctors to CAs to meet the demands of this prevention strategy.[

 <xref rid="pone.0190795.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] from a more qualified health worker to a less qualified health worker with the skills and knowledge to perform that particular task.[
