<p>The quality and clinical outcomes of VMMCs can be measured by measuring the presence and severity of these common adverse events. The NDoH in SA has scaled up the provision of VMMCs through task shifting from medical doctors to CAs to meet the high target for VMMC coverage. We conducted a retrospective analysis, measuring and comparing the presence of adverse events associated with VMMCs conducted by CAs and doctors. This provides a measure of quality and sustainability for enhanced provision of VMMCs using a task shifting approach.</p>
