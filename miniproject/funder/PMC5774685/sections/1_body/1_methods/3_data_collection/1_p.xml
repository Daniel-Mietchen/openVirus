<p>We designed a data collection tool based on the information recorded in the standardized CHAPS’ client files. Using the data collection tool, we recorded information from the pre-operative assessment, the intra-operative procedure and post-operative information including any adverse events. For each category of healthcare professional, we recorded the number of procedures and their durations. We recorded patient age, pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and pre-existing penile conditions such as phimosis. We recorded any intra- or postoperative adverse events such as swelling and bleeding. All data were entered into an Excel 93(2003, Microsoft, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington) spreadsheet by three trained data capturers. All the data capturers were computer literate and were trained on how to extract data from the clients’ files. The training included issues of confidentiality, data entry, review, storage, the data set code book and basic terms commonly used in the files. This training was led by the principal investigator. Each data capturer had to record at least 20 files under supervision to demonstrate competence. The principal investigator reviewed a random sample of patient files to ensure correct data extraction.</p>
