<p>We conducted a retrospective analysis among the Tshwane Districtâ€™s clinics and hospitals that provided free VMMCs during the 16-month study period. Tshwane District has a large population and many VMMC sites that provide free services. All the centres in this study are supported by CHAPS. We analyzed records from the January 2014 onwards to encapsulate the impact of CAs on the provisioning of VMMCs. Prior to this, very few CAs had entered the open job market.</p>
