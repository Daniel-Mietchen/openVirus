<p>We sampled all 4 850 files of clients who underwent surgical VMMCs. Data from client files were divided into 2 groups, those circumcised by doctors and those circumcised by CAs. Files were included if clients had a VMMC in the 16 months of the study period and were 10 years or older at the time of circumcision. Files with no client name or type of healthcare professional were excluded.</p>
