<p>The current burden of HIV/AIDS in SA calls for more action in reducing the number of new infections and VMMC is one of those strategies. However there are not enough doctors in the public sector to circumcise the required numbers to achieve 80% coverage. We demonstrate that the clinical standard of VMMCs done by CAs is comparable to that provided by doctors, and that task shifting is justified. Clinical associates could play a pivotal role in the provision of VMMCs, especially in light of the many VMMCs that still need to be done.</p>
