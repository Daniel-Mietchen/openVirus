<p>The use of routinely collected client information limited the examination of other possible measures of quality. The clinical record that was used at that time did not include the classification of any adverse events—only whether they occurred and when they occurred. This absence limited the researchers’ ability to draw any conclusions based on the severity of adverse events. Study results might not be generalizable to other populations as this study was only done in CHAPS-supported health facilities in one district. The correctness of the clinical information of patient files could not be validated.</p>
