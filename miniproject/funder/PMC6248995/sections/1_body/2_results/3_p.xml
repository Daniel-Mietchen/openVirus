<p>The monthly DENV importation risk from nine countries of SEA into a province of China have increased from a median of 0.18 (IQR 0.03–0.57) in 2005 to 0.98 (0.72–1.0) in 2015 (

Both Chinese travelers and SEA residents contributed to increasing risk over that decade, but Chinese travelers (median 0.26, IQR 0.03–0.88) were more likely to introduce dengue into China than SEA residents (0.14, 0.02–0.56), particularly since 2011 (Figs G-I in

Across all years, the lowest risk (median 0.22, IQR 0.03–0.82) was in March, and the highest (0.65, 0.12–1.0) was in August when 23 cities (13.9% of 165 cities) had an average risk greater than 0.5 between 2005 and 2015 (
