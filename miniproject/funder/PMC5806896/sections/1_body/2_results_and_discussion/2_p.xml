<p>Fitting the time-varying hierarchical binomial model to the data quantified variation in reporting rate over time and among districts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006161.g003">Fig 3</xref>, bottom row). Midline estimated reporting rate in Western Area Urban on Oct 20, 2014 was 0.68 (credible interval: {0.45, 0.73}). However, estimates for the same date in other districts were significantly lower, at 0.55, 0.27 and 0.33, for Western Area Rural, Bombali, and Bo respectively. Reporting rates increased over the course of the epidemic in all districts in the data, so that by March 30, 2015, reporting rates in all districts were estimated to be at or above Scarpino et al.â€™s estimate of 0.83 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, reporting rates outside the capital district stayed lower for longer before beginning to increase. For instance, while the midline estimated reporting rate in Western Area Urban on the week of January 5, 2015 had risen to 0.96 (credible interval: {0.93,0.98}), estimates for the same date in Bombali and Bo remained close to their initial values (see
