<p>Accounting for variation in reporting can significantly modify our understanding of disease spread and control, but variation in reporting rate over space and time is rarely accounted for during analyses of epidemic dynamics. In particular, most models of Ebola transmission to date have assumed constant reporting rates across space and over time [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here we used community-based data on non-hospitalized deaths to infer variation in patterns of reporting, finding significant spatiotemporal variability in case ascertainment. This spatiotemporal variability echoes recently described heterogeneity in transmission patterns in non-hospitalized Ebola data, where the importance of superspreading events was demonstrated [
