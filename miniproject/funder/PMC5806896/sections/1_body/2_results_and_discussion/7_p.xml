<p>Future epidemic models may be improved by incorporating a process-based representation of reporting dynamics. More specifically, future models could treat reporting rate as a state variable, driven by human behaviors associated with both disease spread and public health response, and including inequities in access to medical care. Improving our quantitative understanding of what determines reporting rates could also allow stronger links between field outbreak response teams and modeling teams, which would improve contextualization and understanding of data limitations, with the potential to improve predictive models of epidemics and enhance the design of control measures.</p>
