<p>The reproduction number of Ebola estimated from the WHO data varied over time and among districts, as in previous estimates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The transmission rate of Ebola may be particularly variable in a community context, due in part to variation in the relative risk of different transmission routes that may occur in a community setting, particularly care-giving outside of hospital [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To quantify the effect of reporting variation on estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> in Ebola incidence data, we compared results for time series that were corrected for underreporting (using our midline estimates of reporting rate in each district over time) with uncorrected time series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006161.g004">Fig 4</xref>). While in the Western Area districts (around the capital of Freetown) correcting for temporally variable underreporting did not significantly change estimates of

 <sub>

 </sub>, in Bo and Bombali the corrected estimates diverged significantly from the uncorrected estimates, particularly earlier in the epidemic.
