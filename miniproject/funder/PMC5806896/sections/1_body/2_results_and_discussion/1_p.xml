<p>Ebola prevalence in the SDB data was strongly correlated with reported prevalence in the WHO situation reports, however, the relationship between burial prevalence and reported prevalence varied across districts (

In the capital district of Western Area Urban and the adjacent district of Western Area Rural, burial prevalence accrued more slowly under increasing reported prevalence, while in the districts of Bo and Bombali, burial prevalence rose more steeply under increases in reported prevalence. This is consistent with the hypothesis that reported Ebola prevalence outside of the capital was indicative of a proportionally larger number of unreported, non-hospitalized cases (
