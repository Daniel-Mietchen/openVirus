<p>A central problem is that non-hospitalized cases are less likely to be reported, compared to hospitalized cases: the WHO 2014â€“2016 Ebola case line-list predominantly includes cases who have been hospitalized [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As a result, non-hospitalized cases are underrepresented in Ebola surveillance data, and the observed pattern of cases over time reflects the dynamics of hospital bed capacity and access to formal care as well as the underlying trajectory of the epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A community case may be detected outside of clinical care through interaction with other epidemic response measures, for instance by inclusion in contact tracing, or by laboratory testing of a specimen collected before or after death. However, during the recent epidemic these measures were implemented heterogeneously, due to constraints on public health systems in the affected countries.
