<p>Estimates of the reporting rate—the proportion of the total number of infected individuals over a specified time period that are reported as cases—range from 0.33 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to 0.83 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which bound the initial estimate by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of 0.40 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The differences among these estimates may stem in part from the different analytical methods used, including capture recapture methods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], inference from viral sequence data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and comparison of hospitalized cases with the projections of a compartmental epidemic model [
