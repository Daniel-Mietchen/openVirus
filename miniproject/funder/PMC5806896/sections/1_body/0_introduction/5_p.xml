<p>Here we disentangle reporting and epidemic dynamics for the recent Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone using individual-level records of burials performed in the Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) program that was coordinated by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Sierra Leone. Safe and dignified burial was required by law for every community death in Sierra Leone, during the timespan of the data analyzed here (Oct 20, 2014 â€“March 30, 2015). Safe burials were to be conducted in the same way regardless of the suspected cause of death, including collecting a skin swab sample for Ebola testing [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, in practice safe burial was not conducted for every community death, and not all community deaths were tested for Ebola. Non-hospitalized Ebola deaths that did not interface with the SDB program, or where a swab sample was not tested, represent a primary source of underreporting in the epidemic, as well as a significant potential source of onward transmission.
