<p>Despite the unprecedented scale of the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], significant uncertainty remains about the precise number of cases involved, and about the spatiotemporal dynamics of transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The numbers of non-hospitalized, community-based cases over time and among locations, are particularly uncertain. Ebola cases who become sick and die in the community are at increased risk of onward transmission, with caregiving and fluid contact as especially important transmission routes [
