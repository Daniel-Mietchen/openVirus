<p>Below we describe how the prevalence of Ebola in burial swab samples can be used to estimate the total number of non-hospitalized cases, which can in turn be used to estimate location- and time-specific reporting rates. Using these data, we examine how reporting rates varied over time and across districts, and reconstruct the epidemic curves in each district, accounting for unreported cases. Finally, we address the question of how spatiotemporal dynamics in reporting might affect estimates of disease transmission rates. Our results agree with previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showing that a substantial fraction of Ebola cases in the 2014–2015 epidemic were unreported. In addition, we find substantial systematic variation across geographic regions and over time in the level of underreporting. In some cases, this variation was sufficient to systematically alter estimates of the reproduction number of the epidemic.
