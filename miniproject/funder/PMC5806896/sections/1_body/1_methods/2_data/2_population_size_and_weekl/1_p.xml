<p>Estimates of population size in each district were taken from the 2015 census [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Estimates of weekly all-cause community mortality were taken from a household survey conducted in the capital district of Western Area Urban in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This survey reported raw all-cause mortality of 36 deaths at home over a recall period of 267 days for 898 households, with a mean household size of 6.66 individuals. This yields an all-cause mortality rate of 8.22 deaths at home per thousand population per year. This was converted to expected deaths per week in each district by rescaling the time units, and multiplying by the estimated population size of the district. This approach, designed to work with available recent data, makes the necessary assumption that community mortality rates in each district in the study are similar to that observed in the capital district.
