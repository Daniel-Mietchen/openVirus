<p>Fluctuations in all-cause non-hospitalized mortality rate could influence our estimates of Ebola reporting rates. For instance, if all-cause mortality was higher outside the capital district (where our estimate of all-cause mortality came from) then our approach will overestimate the number of non-hospitalized Ebola deaths that were buried by the SDB program, and, in turn, underestimate reporting rates. However, as described below, the magnitude of geographic and temporal variation in reporting rate the we observed, where in districts outside the capital reporting rate more than doubled over the course of the epidemic, is unlikely to be driven primarily by fluctuations in background mortality, because these would need to be unrealistically large.</p>
