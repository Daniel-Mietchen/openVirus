<p>Now that we have a method of converting from unreported deaths to unreported cases, we continue by estimating unreported deaths from the SDB data. Community deaths overall can be classified using a dichotomous tree, reflecting their interaction with the SDB program and their Ebola status (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006161.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The structure of the tree makes it possible to estimate the total unreported non-hospitalized Ebola deaths in a district and week,
