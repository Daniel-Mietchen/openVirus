<p>We are interested in unreported cases, 
 <italic>c</italic>, but the SDB data consists entirely of deaths, some of which were Ebola positive, and some of which were reported. We first setup a framework for converting from unreported Ebola deaths to unreported Ebola cases, then describe how we use the SDB data to estimate unreported Ebola deaths. Let 
 <italic>d</italic> represent the number of unreported deaths, which is related to the number of unreported cases by 
 <italic>d</italic> = 
 <italic>γc</italic>, where 
 <italic>γ</italic> is the fraction of unreported cases in a week that die in that week (and where the death is also unreported). For the average Ebola fatality in the recent epidemic, death occurred within approximately two days of WHO notification, if the case was reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>c</italic> must approach 
 <italic>d</italic> as case fatality rate (CFR) increases. We therefore assume that 
 <italic>γ</italic> is equal to the CFR for Ebola. This approach introduces uncertainties into the analysis: for example, a death may be more likely to be reported than a case, and estimates of CFR for Ebola are wide-ranging, and may vary systematically with different contexts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To address these uncertainties, we used a wide range of values for 
 <italic>γ</italic>, specifically the set {0.25, 0.5, 0.9}.
