<p>We estimated the time-varying reproduction number (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to time series of the number of new infectious individuals each day, reconstructed from the weekly WHO case data, using a time window of 7 days, and a vague prior for the values of R consisting of a gamma distribution with a mean and standard deviation of 5. To reconstruct the daily infectious time series we used a Monte Carlo scheme, projecting each case in the WHO data backward to its time of first infectiousness by sampling from a gamma distribution for the time from the appearance of symptoms to reporting, parameterized from IFRC line list data from Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) operations (gamma distribution with mean 5.1 days and standard deviation 3.5 days). Note that the results of this operation are independent and identically distributed over cases, so the resulting daily infectiousness time series did not project significant uncertainty forward into the analysis, due to the large number of independent cases over which the reconstruction method was applied. When estimating

 </sub>, we used a gamma distribution with mean 15.3 days and standard deviation 9.1 days for the serial interval of Ebola [
