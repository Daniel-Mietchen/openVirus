  <title>Contrasting estimates of Ebola incidence and reporting rates over space and time.</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Upper row</italic>: The heights of the black polygons show weekly numbers of confirmed plus probable cases from the WHO data. Colored polygons enclose credible intervals for total number of cases per week (both reported and unreported). 
   <italic>Lower row</italic>: Estimated reporting rates over time and across districts; polygons enclose the credible intervals. Horizontal lines show static reporting rates estimated by [
   <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (lower, solid), [
   <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (middle, dashed) and [
   <xref rid="pntd.0006161.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (top, dotted). The central white region of each plot shows the temporal coverage of the SDB data. To illustrate the temporal coverage of our data relative to the epidemic as a whole, total cases and reporting rates in the grey regions are extrapolated using the mean of the nearest month of burial data. While extrapolated values match published estimates of static reporting rates, these extrapolations are not used in any of the analyses.
