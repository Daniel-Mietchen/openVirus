<p id="Par63">Where possible, the study will collect data from existing data sources (i.e. patient’s chronic care files, facility registers) to inform the research. Data will also be collected from individual study participants at each visit. For data collected on-site outside of existing Swaziland Ministry of Health procedures, paper-based data collection forms will be used. Two copies of this form are kept: one copy in the patients’ clinical file and the second copy as part of the study records.</p>
