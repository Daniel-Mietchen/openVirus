<p id="Par61">Each patient will provide samples every six months for viral load testing. For drug resistance testing, a pre-treatment sample will be collected from each patient upon study enrollment and at ART initiation. Upon initial signs of ART failure (two consecutive viral load &gt;1000 copies/mL), a post-treatment sample will be collected for drug resistance testing.</p>
