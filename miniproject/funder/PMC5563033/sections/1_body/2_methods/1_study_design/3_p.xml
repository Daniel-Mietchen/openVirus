<p id="Par41">Sites are grouped to transition two at a time from the control (national eligibility guidelines or current standard of care) to the intervention (EAAA) stage every four months. As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the study will enroll all eligible HIV-positive patients who arrive at the facility in Month 1. All sites will start in the standard of care stage (“C”), and then each site will have a four-month transition period (“T”) to transition consecutively until all sites are in the intervention (“I”) stage. The sites will start implementing the intervention on the first day of the transition period.
