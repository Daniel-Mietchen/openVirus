<p id="Par43">During the transition period (“T”) and the intervention (“I”) stage, all HIV-positive patients will be offered ART per the EAAA intervention (an offer of immediate ART initiation irrespective of CD4). Study participants who were already in pre-ART at the start of the study or who were enrolled into pre-ART during the control stage according to national standard of care will be offered ART at their first follow-up appointment at their enrollment site following the site’s transition to the intervention stage. This way, everyone who is enrolled into the study population will eventually be offered the EAAA intervention (Fig.
