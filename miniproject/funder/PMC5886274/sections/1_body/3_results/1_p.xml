<p>Overall, the analysis found inconsistent incorporation of sex-disaggregated HIV targets within NSPs of Sub-Saharan African countries. For the eighteen countries included in this review, the proportion of general population targets that were sex-disaggregated ranged from 0% (Botswana, Cameroon and Mozambique) to 92% (Zambia), with an average of 31% across countries (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="czx101-T1">Table 1</xref>). Only the NSPs from South Africa, Swaziland and Zambia disaggregated a majority (&gt;50%) of their targets by sex. Sex-disaggregation was more common among targets related to the early phases of the HIV care continuum, with 83% (15/18) of countries including sex-disaggregated targets related to HIV prevention (i.e. condom use and reducing high-risk sexual behaviours). In contrast, sex-disaggregated targets are less common in the later phases of the care continuumâ€”with 56% (10/18) of countries setting targets related to HIV testing and linkage to care, 22% (4/18) setting targets for improving ARV treatment coverage and 11% (2/18) disaggregating targets by sex aimed at increasing long-term access and retention in ARV treatment programmes. Sex-disaggregated national targets for reducing HIV prevalence, incidence or mortality were found in 33% (6/18) of countries. Only Zambia and South Africa set at least one sex-disaggregated target across all pillars of the HIV care continuum. Examples of commonly included targets (both sex-disaggregated and non-disaggregated) are presented in
