    <p>National Strategic Plans (NSPs) for HIV/AIDS are critical planning documents that set priorities and targets for a countryâ€™s response to the HIV epidemic, influence donor funding priorities, and guide data collection for domestic and international monitoring and evaluation.</p>

    <p>Given the disproportionately high HIV burden among young women and adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa, disaggregation of national targets by sex and age is important for identifying priority populations and monitoring the progress towards achieving international HIV goals.</p>

    <p>This analysis reveals that NSPs for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with high HIV burden in young women, do not consistently set targets for men and women separately along the HIV care continuum or create targets designed to advance gender equality.</p>

    <p>Strengthening NSPs to include gender equality and sex-disaggregated targets is crucial for monitoring and evaluating outcomes for both men and women, aligning donor investments with highest need, improving government accountability, and achieving a more robust domestic and international response to HIV/AIDS.</p>
