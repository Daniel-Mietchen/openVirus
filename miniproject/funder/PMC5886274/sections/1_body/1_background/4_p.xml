<p>The extent to which NSPs are responsive to gender disparities in HIV can also be assessed through the inclusion of targets specifically aimed at reducing gender inequality in health outcomes. Recent WHO guidance (2016) for increasing gender responsive national monitoring and evaluation systems defines a gender inequality target as one ‘that measures gender inequality directly or through proxies’. These include targets for social or structural factors that are linked to HIV acquisition in women including economic marginalization, gender-based violence (GBV), and gender-based norms that disempower women in intimate partnerships (

PEPFAR’s DREAMS programme (Determined Resilient AIDS Free Mentored and Safe) was specifically designed to address not only the behavioural but also the social and structural determinants of HIV among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in Sub-Saharan Africa (
