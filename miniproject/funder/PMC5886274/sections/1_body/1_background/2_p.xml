<p>Monitoring progress toward international HIV goals is fundamentally dependent on the systematic collection and reporting of quality country-level data. In the majority of countries with high HIV disease burden, governments periodically release strategic documents detailing their national public health priorities and targets. These National Strategic Plans (NSPs) for HIV/AIDS serve as a central guide by which programmes and activities will be prioritized in a 5-year evaluation period, and identify which targets should be measured and monitored in order to quantify success toward the countryâ€™s strategic objectives. Country data collected in order to measure progress toward NSP targets serve as the basis for tracking international priorities such as the UN Fast-Track and the SDGs targets. Additionally, as part of its country-led approach, the Global Fund encourages countries to base their applications for funding on NSPs, further emphasizing their importance in driving country programming and resource allocation.</p>
