<p>Despite the importance of high-quality HIV targets and gender responsive NSPs, research and reviews to monitor government HIV targets has been limited. This may be in part because NSPs are country-specific, are not stored centrally, and do not follow standardized structures, making the extraction of information difficult and complicating country comparisons. However, the analysis of these documents is a valuable strategy to examine country priority-setting and identify gaps in both domestic and international HIV monitoring capacity. The primary objective of this analysis is to assess the extent to which sex-disaggregated and gender-equality HIV targets are included in the NSPs for HIV/AIDS of high burden countries in Sub-Saharan African.</p>
