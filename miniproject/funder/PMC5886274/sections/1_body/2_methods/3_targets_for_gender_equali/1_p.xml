<p>All targets related to improving gender equality in health outcomes, defined as indicators to measure the social or structural drivers of HIV for AGYW (
 <xref rid="czx101-B42" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2016</xref>), were extracted (
 <italic>n</italic> = 43). All targets which the authors deemed to (i) meet the WHO criteria for a gender-equality target and, (ii) respond to current evidence in the field for social or structural drivers of HIV in AGYW, were thematically coded using an inductive approach. Initial codes were grouped into sub-themes and then categorized into five larger themes including: (i) integration of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIV programming, (ii) improving pregnancy outcomes or increasing the use of modern contraception (methods other than fertility awareness and withdrawal), (iii) reducing gender-based or sexual violence, (iv) improving rights or access to resources for women and girls and (v) improving AGWYâ€™s school attendance/access.
