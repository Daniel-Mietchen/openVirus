<p>To measure the percent of country targets that are disaggregated by sex, the authors included only targets for topic areas where disaggregation was possible; for example, it is both possible and logical to track new infection rates and the proportion of people receiving treatment and retained in care, by sex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="czx101-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Targets that could not be disaggregated by sex were excluded (
 <italic>n</italic> = 470). These included targets related to policy, health system governance, and health facilities. Sex-specific (i.e. for women or men) targets were also excluded. These included targets related to reducing mother-to-child transmission, addressing HIV in men who have sex with men or female sex workers, increasing male circumcision, or reaching infants/children between 0 and 5 years. All targets were independently reviewed by two investigators and coded as sex-disaggregated if a numeric target was set for men and for women separately, or if any data related to the monitoring of the target (i.e. baseline or interim data) were reported for both men and women. Targets were coded as non-disaggregated if the target was set for ‘adults’ or ‘adolescents’ overall, without reporting any baseline or progress data separately by sex. All coder disagreements were discussed and targets were re-reviewed to yield agreement. In the cases of target ambiguity, for example, when a target referenced men and women but did not present data separately for each sex, targets were coded as non sex-disaggregated. The percent of targets disaggregated for each country was calculated as the number of sex-disaggregated targets divided by the total number of targets that could be disaggregated in each country.
