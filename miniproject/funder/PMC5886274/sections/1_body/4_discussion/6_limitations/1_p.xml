<p>This analysis is limited by accessibility of country NSPs. Although every effort was made to obtain the most recent NSP from each country, it is possible that there are other national documents containing HIV targets, which have not been made publicly available and were therefore not included in this review. However, this review does reflect those targets which have been published and for which national governments are responsible. Additionally, in the current analysis, targets that were ambiguous were coded as non-disaggregated, which may have resulted in an underestimation of the number of sex-disaggregated targets in NSPs. Indeed, targets may have been set for the general population and subsequently analysed for sex differences, but these would not be identified as sex-disaggregated. Such population aggregated targets are not guaranteed to result in sex-disaggregated data collection and reporting, and therefore this coding decision reflects the need for greater specificity in target formulation for both sexes.</p>
