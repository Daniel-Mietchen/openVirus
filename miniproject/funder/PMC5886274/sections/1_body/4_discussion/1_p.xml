<p>The results of this study indicate a lack of consistent disaggregation by sex for national HIV targets in Sub-Saharan African countries with the highest HIV burden in youth. Aggregated outcome and progress data may mask significant inequalities in sub-populations. Indeed, countries that report only HIV data combined for men and women may suggest population-level achievements while masking significant sex-differences. The future development of NSPs must ensure that all general population targets are disaggregated by sex and age, where applicable. This analysis also reveals that sex-disaggregation is most often specified for targets in the area of HIV prevention but less so in the areas of treatment and retention in care. Since sex differences occur in the acquisition of HIV, its diagnosis, treatment initiation, and retention in care, it is crucial for national governments to include sex-disaggregated targets at all stages of the care continuum. International funders and technical partners, such as the Global Fund, that participate in NSP development should provide increased technical assistance around target setting to ensure that sex-disaggregated targets are set and that data are reported for any differences.</p>
