<p>This analysis further showed gaps in the incorporation of gender-equality targets NSPs across countries, and therefore demonstrates a significant opportunity to improve the gender-responsiveness of plans through increased inclusion of gender-equality targets. Since NSP targets must be responsive to the local social drivers of HIV in women and girls, it cannot be asserted that every country should include every category of gender-equality target presented here. However, these broad social and structural factors have been shown to be key influencers of the HIV epidemic in AGYW across many Sub-Saharan African settings. NSPs that are highly gender-responsive will move beyond targets that track individual behaviour to also include a comprehensive set of targets to measure gender equality as a major structural driver of local epidemics.</p>
