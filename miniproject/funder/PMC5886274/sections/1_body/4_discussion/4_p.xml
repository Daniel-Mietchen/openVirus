<p>This article provides an analysis of sex-disaggregation in NSP targets, as well as an overview of which countries have included gender-equality targets across several categories of social and structural drivers of HIV. Although a formal analysis of the quality of these targets is outside the scope of this article, it is worth noting that some targets/indicators lacked the specificity and precision to be effective and measurable indicators. For example the target, ‘Reduced social exclusion for PLHIV, key populations, women, men, boys and girls’ (
 <xref rid="czx101-B15" ref-type="bibr">Kenya Ministry of Health 2014</xref>), does not include a specific target population or define the type of activities that are prescribed. It is unclear how this target will be measured or if it can be used to track changes in the inclusion of marginalized populations in Kenya. Governments could improve the gender-responsiveness of NSPs by setting targets for one relevant subpopulation or age group of women and by defining the specific intervention to be measured—taking into account what is feasible given available data. Successful targets may narrow in on one measurable outcome that can be used to track the success of a programme or indicate gender inequalities more broadly. For example the target ‘Increase the percent of women and men aged 60+ who have received an old age grant in the past 12 months to 70%’ (
 <xref rid="czx101-B25" ref-type="bibr">Republic of Namibia 2010</xref>) is focused on one measurable outcome. Improvements could still be made to ensure that these data were disaggregated by sex.
