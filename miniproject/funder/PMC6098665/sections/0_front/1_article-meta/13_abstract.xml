  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are a family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), of which 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic>, are the main representative members. Many investigations have focused on the role of 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic> in the innate immune response in Cypriniformes and Siluriformes. As an important economic fish in Perciformes, little is known about the function of 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic> in mandarinfish (
   <italic>Siniperca chuatsi</italic>).

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par2">The full-length 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic> cDNA sequence was obtained using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The mandarinfish 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic> cDNA sequences contain 3247 bp and 3257 bp, and encode 918 amino acids and 988 amino acids, respectively. Multiple sequence alignments showed that mNOD1 and mNOD2 share high similarity with that from other vertebrates. RT-PCR analysis revealed that relatively high levels of m
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
   <italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA were detected in gill and head kidney tissues, compared with the heart, spleen, liver, muscle, and intestine. In addition, the relative levels of m
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
   <italic>NOD2</italic> transcripts were significantly upregulated in three tissues when the fishes were challenged with LPS and Poly I:C, interestingly, the 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> mRNA got peaked earlier than 
   <italic>NOD</italic>2 after LPS induction in the spleen, gill, and head kidney, and during Poly I:C treatment, the NOD2 mRNA got peaked at 8 h in spleen and gill, while 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> showed significant higher expression at 24 h post infection, besides, in head kidney, the NOD2 mRNA showed a great increasing trend and 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> got peaked at 16 h. Therefore the m
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
   <italic>NOD2</italic> may act differently within different tissues in different time during antiviral and antibacterial defense.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par3">These results revealed the dynamic m
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
   <italic>NOD2</italic> expression during viral and bacterial infections, which suggested the 
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
   <italic>NOD2</italic> play important roles in innate immune of mandarinfish.
