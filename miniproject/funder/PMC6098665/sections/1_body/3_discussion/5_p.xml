<p id="Par37">In addition, some studies have showed that 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> could prove to participate in antiviral defense, such as human [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], olive flounder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], rohu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], grouper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and grass carp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In human, 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> was significantly induced following stimulation with human cytomegalovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and in grass carp activation of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was reported in reovirus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mandarinfish, both the NOD1 and NOD2 gene were found to be activated in viral infection, mimicked by treatment with the viral analogue Poly I:C, revealing that NODs are sensitive to the protective immune response against viral invasion. Interestingly, mandarinfish 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> showed a more significant increasement when stimulated by PolyI:C than did 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> in vivo, however, 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> showed significantly higher expression at 24Â h post infection in spleen and gill during PolyI:C stimulation, demonstrating that mandarinfish 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> may act differently within different tissues in antiviral defense. In addition, the expression levels of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA after LPS stimulation generally peaked at an earlier time point than that observed with Poly (I:C) treatment, revealing that both of them were more sensitive to the antibacterial sensitive response than to viral invasion, indicating that these proteins more easily identify bacterial peptidoglycans and induce signaling pathways by acting as PRRs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], meanwhile, some other subfamilies of NOD-like receptors may be responsible for inducing 
 <italic>mNOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>mNOD2</italic> in response to LPS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which needs further studies.
