<p id="Par36">NODs are a recently characterized group of pathogen recognition receptors, they are believed to be intracellular bacteria-recognizing receptor. The bacterial component, LPS, has been shown to influence NOD1 and NOD2 mRNA expression in mouse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], rohu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and channel catfish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In channel catfish, after bacterial induction, 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> were highly upregulated in head kidney and spleen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A significant observation in this study was that the expression of NOD1 and NOD2 genes were upregulated in vivo following LPS stimulation, suggesting the involvement of these genes in antibacterial response. In addition, mandarinfish 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was activated to a greater extent, but 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> peaked earlier than 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> after LPS induction in spleen, gill and head kidney, indicating that 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> appear to play a unique role in initially sensing pathogenic and may work in different response time in defense against bacterial invasion.
