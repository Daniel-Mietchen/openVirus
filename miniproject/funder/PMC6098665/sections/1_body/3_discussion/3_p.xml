<p id="Par35">In healthy mandarinfish, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes were widely expressed in all the tissues collected. RT-PCR analysis revealed that m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA were expressed at higher levels in the heart, spleen, gill, and head kidney than in other tissues, particularly in the head kidney and gill; moreover, the expression of m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was generally higher than that of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> in these four tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), although this result was markedly different from that observed in grouper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], grass carp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], mrigal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and channel catfish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In grass carp, the highest expression of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> was in the liver, whereas 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was highly expressed in head kidney [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In mrigal, significant expression of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> was detected in the liver, whereas 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was abundantly expressed, with the highest levels observed in spleen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As an important immune organ of fish, the head kidney has high expression levels of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic>, which is to be expected. In addition to the important immune organ, scattered lymphocyte germinal centers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] are found in the mucous tissues of the gills, indicated that the gill might function as the first line of defense in the innate immune response, and high levels of NOD1 and NOD2 gene expression in the gill is also expected. Besides, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes of mandarinfish were also observed to be expressed at high levels in head kidney, speculating that 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> may take part in the anti-pathogen response.
