<p id="Par34">To better understand the mechanism of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> function in mandarinfish against pathogenic microorganisms, we isolated and identified the NOD1 and NOD2 cDNA sequence and characterized their sequence. The conserved domains of mandarinfish predicted by the CCD tool (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref>) showed that both of them had similar conserved domains containing CARD-NACHT-LRR domains. NOD2 had one more CARD domain than NOD1, and NOD1 had seven LRRs, whereas NOD2 only had six; however, both of them had a similar structure to grouper and miiuy croaker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The high conservation of LRR domains in NOD1 and NOD2 implied that they may possess similar functional properties as those of other fishes in the recognition of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, amino acid homology analysis and phylogenetic analysis of mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 revealed that they shared high similarities with NOD1 and NOD2 proteins from other teleost fishes, but low similarities with those of mammals and birds. Our results showed that 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> were evolutionarily conserved not only in terms of their protein sequences but also in terms of functionally significant domains.
