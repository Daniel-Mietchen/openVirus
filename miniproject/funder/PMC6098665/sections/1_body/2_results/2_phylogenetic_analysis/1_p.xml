<p id="Par30">To evaluate the molecular evolutionary relationships between mNOD1 and mNOD2 and NODs orthologs in other vertebrates, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of mammalian, avian, and fish NODs. The inferred phylogeny of the NOD1 and NOD2 genes is presented in two distinct clusters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Mandarinfish NOD1 was in the same branch as that of grouper, bastard halibut, grass carp, and zebrafish, but had a distant evolutionary relationship with mammals and birds, illustrating the closer relationships between mandarinfish NOD1 and those of other fish species. Mandarinfish NOD2 was most closely related to those of grouper, fugu, rainbow trout, and zebrafish, in a branch separate from that of the mammals.
