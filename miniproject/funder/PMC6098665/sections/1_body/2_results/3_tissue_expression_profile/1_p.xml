<p id="Par31">To determine the tissue expression levels of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic>, RT-PCR was performed. mRNA expression of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was detected in all seven tissues collected. We found that m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> mRNAs were highly expressed in heart, spleen, gill, and head kidney, particularly in head kidney and gill, and the expression of m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was generally higher than that of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> in these four tissues. On the other hand, relatively low expression of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> was detected in the liver, muscle, and intestine (Fig.Â
