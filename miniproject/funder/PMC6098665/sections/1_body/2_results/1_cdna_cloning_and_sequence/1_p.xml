<p id="Par29">Using RT-PCR and RACE technology, the full-length sequence of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> was obtained, which included a 124-bp 5’ UTR, a 2757-bp open reading frame (ORF) and a 366-bp 3’ UTR, and encodes 918 amino acids. The m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> cDNA was cloned with 124-bp 5’ UTR, a 2967-bp ORF encoding 988 amino acids, and a 166-bp 3’ UTR. The primers used are shown in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. The sequences of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> were submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession number KY974318 and KY974317, respectively). Furthermore, using the NCBI Conserved Domains Database Tools (CDD Tools) to predict the conserved domains of mNOD1 and mNOD2, we found that mNOD1 has one CARD domain (residues 13–97), one NACHT domain (residues 189–360), and seven LRRs (residues 670–868) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), whereas mNOD2 includes two CARD domains (residues 7–91 and 115–195), one NACHT domain (residues 273–443), and six LRRs (residues 757–979) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). A comparison of the coding sequence (CDS) and amino acid sequence of mNOD1 and mNOD2 to the NOD1 and mNOD2 genes of other species, including multiple alignments and amino acid sequence, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, respectively.
