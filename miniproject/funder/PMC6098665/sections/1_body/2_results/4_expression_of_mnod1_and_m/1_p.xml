<p id="Par32">To further determine the regulation of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> expression by LPS or Poly (I:C) in vivo, different tissues from treated and untreated groups were collected following treatment with saline、LPS or Poly (I:C). The mRNA expression levels of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> in different tissues were detected by qRT-PCR at various time points after injection (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h). The mRNA expression of mNOD1 and mNOD2 showed no significant change in different tissues when injecting saline. And the relative transcript levels of m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> in spleen and head kidney were upregulated at 16 h after LPS stimulation and then gradually decreased, and in gill m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> mRNA showed a gently trend; however, the peak time of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> mRNA appeared 2 h after the infection in spleen and gill, and 8 h in head kidney, and in spleen, the m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> mRNA got peaked again at 16 h (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">f</xref>). However, following Poly (I:C) injection, the expression levels of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> in these three tissues showed a persistently increased trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">h</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref>), with the exception of m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> in the spleen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>) and m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> in the head kidney (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>).
