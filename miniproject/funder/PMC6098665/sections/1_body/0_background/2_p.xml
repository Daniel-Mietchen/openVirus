<p id="Par20">However, the NLRs do not contain a signal peptide or transmembrane domain, which indicate their locations in the cytosol. The C-terminal LRR domain is the potential ligand recognition site and the NACHT domain mediates self-regulation and oligomerization. The N-terminus is responsible for protein–protein interaction, signal transduction and initiation of the downstream immune cascade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Based on the specific N-terminal domain present, NLRs are divided into three subfamilies including NODs (containing the CARD domain), NALPs (containing the PYR domain) and NAIPs (containing the BIR domain) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both of NOD1 and NOD2 are part of NODs subfamily with CARD, NACHT and LRR, which share three functional domains in mammals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among them, NOD1 contains an N-terminal CARD domain, but NOD2 possesses two N- terminal CARD domain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous studies have proved that NOD1 and NOD2 recognized bacterial and viral products through their C-terminal LRRs in mammals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although the adaptive immune system of fish has well been developed, which can produce antibody response against infection. Innate immunity also plays an important role in protection against disease in fish. Some studies have found that after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (Poly (I:C)) stimulation, the expression of

 <italic>NOD2</italic> was significantly upregulated in grouper fish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], rainbow trout [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], carp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], mrigal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], catfish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and goldfish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similar results were also found in the spleen tissue of grass carp [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Upon ligand recognition, both NOD1 and NOD2 recruit RIPK to the receptors via CARD–CARD interactions, which lead to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The activation of NF-kB and MAPK mediated by NOD1 and NOD2 could induce transcription and production of inflammatory mediators and antimicrobial peptides, and induce apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the NOD1 and NOD2 genes play an important role in the resistance of fish to the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms.
