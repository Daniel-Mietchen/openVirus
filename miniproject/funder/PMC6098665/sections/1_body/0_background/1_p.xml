<p id="Par19">In vertebrates, the innate immune system is the fundamental defense mechanism, and plays a beneficial role in defending against invasion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The innate immune system rapidly recognizes conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP) via the presence of the host’s own pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). At present, PRRs, which have been extensively studied, include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoid acid–inducible gene-1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and DNA receptors. Studies have increasingly shown that RLRs and TLRs play an important role in the innate immunity of the organism and form the first line of defense against infectious pathogens [

Unlike TLRs and RLRs, NLRs are a recently identified large group of the intracellular PRR family characterized by multi-domain proteins, which contain an N-terminal protein-protein binding domain such as the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), pyrin (PYD), or baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) domain, in addition to a central nucleotide oligomerization (NACHT) domain and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain [
