<p id="Par21">Among carnivorous freshwater fish, mandarinfish (
 <italic>Siniperca chuatsi</italic>), is a precious aquaculture species in China, with high economic value, but it is very sensitive to bacterial and viral infection. In recent years, outbreaks of disease epidemics such that of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and other epidemic diseases, such as Iridovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and EHNV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], have caused serious damage to the freshwater aquaculture industry in China; however, there have been few reports of the function of NOD1 and NOD2 genes against bacteria and virus in mandarinfishes. Based on this background, we performed the molecular cloning and characterization of the mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 genes and analyzed their expression levels during LPS and Poly (I:C) treatment in vivo. These data might facilitate a better understanding of the role of 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> in bacterial and viral infections, which is beneficial not only to the understanding of innate immunity mechanisms in mandarinfish, but also to monitor the disease occurrence in the aquatic culture industry.
