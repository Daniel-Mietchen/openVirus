<p id="Par38">In summary, we first cloned and characterized the NOD1 and NOD2 cDNA sequences in mandarinfish, and demonstrated that the mandarinfish NOD1 and NOD2 genes are functionally similar to their counterparts from other teleosts. Transcriptional analysis showed ubiquitous expression of NOD1 and NOD2 gene in seven examined tissues. Expression analyses showed that NOD1 and NOD2 gene were significantly enhanced in vivo after LPS or Poly (I:C) stimulation, indicating that 
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and 
 <italic>NOD2</italic> may appear to play a unique role in initially sensing pathogenic and may work in different tissues in defense against bacterial and viral invasion. Taken together, our results revealed that the m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> might be involved in innate immune protection in mandarinfish.
