<p id="Par26">Total RNA was extracted from the tissues (heart, liver, spleen, gill, head kidney, muscle, and intestine) of healthy mandarinfish using TRIZOL (Invitrogen), 1 μg RNA was used with gDNase (TIANGEN, China) during reverse transcription for RT-PCR. The process included an initial phase at 42 °C for 3 min and then incubation at 42 °C 15 min followed by 95 °C for 3 min. The cDNA stored at − 80 °C. The primers are listed in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1. The reaction conditions included 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. The products of PCR were separated on 2% (
