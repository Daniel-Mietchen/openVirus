<p id="Par22">A total of fifty-seven mandarinfishes with 400-600 g in body weight were obtained from the the Gaoyou Dongshi Special Aquatic Products Company (Yangzhou, China). Fish were kept in aquarias with a flowthrough water system and aerated freshwater at 29 °C. Tissues, including heart, liver, spleen, gill, head kidney, muscle, and intestine, were collected from three healthy mandarinfishes. Tissue samples were harvested and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until needed. Total RNA was extracted from all tissues with TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).</p>
