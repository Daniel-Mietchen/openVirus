<p id="Par24">Total RNA was isolated from the spleen of healthy mandarinfish with TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the quality of the isolated RNA was assessed by visualizing the ribosomal RNA bands after electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. The PrimeScript™ 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TAKARA, Dalian, China) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions with 1 μg of total RNA as a template to produce cDNA. Based on the conserved sequences of 
 <italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Larimichthys crocea</italic>, 
 <italic>Lateolabrax japonicas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Paralichthyidae</italic>, forward and reverse primers for m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> were designed to obtain the internal region (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). For all genes, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was conducted using LA Taq (TAKARA) with the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-ready first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a Takara RACE cDNA amplification kit (Takara, China) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol and RACE primers were designed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). Subsequently, RACE was performed on the 5′ and 3′ ends of the m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> cDNA. The sequences of m
 <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
 <italic>NOD2</italic> were submitted to GenBank under the accession numbers KY974318 and KY974317, respectively. All the primer sequences mentioned above are shown in Additional file
