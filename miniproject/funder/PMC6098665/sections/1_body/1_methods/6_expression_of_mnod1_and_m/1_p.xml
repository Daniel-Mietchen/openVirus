<p id="Par27">RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to perform the assay, and qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) to determine the pattern of mNOD1 and mNOD2 mRNA expression after challenge with Poly (I:C) and LPS, the following reaction conditions were conducted including 1 cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s, and a final cycle of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. The relative expression of mRNA was calculated using the 2
 <sup>-△△CT</sup> method, and the β-actin gene was used as an internal control.
