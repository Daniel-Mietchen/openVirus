  <p>mRNA expression levels of m
   <italic>NOD1</italic> and m
   <italic>NOD2</italic> in vivo following saline, LPS or Poly (I:C) injection. (
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold>) Fish were injected intraperitoneally with saline in the spleen, gill, and head kidney after 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h post-injection, (
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold>) LPS and (
   <bold>g</bold>, 
   <bold>h</bold>, 
   <bold>i</bold>) Poly (I:C). Gene expression was determined using real time RT-PCR and was normalized to β-actin. Relative transcription level was obtained by comparing the normalized expression levels between different time points. Vertical bars represent the mean ± S.E. (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). Asterisks represent significant differences relative to controls (
