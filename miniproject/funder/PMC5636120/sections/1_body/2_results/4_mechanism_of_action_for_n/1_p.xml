<p>Development of gel based assays using recombinant polymerase complex and defined templates enabled characterization of mechanisms of action of nucleotide inhibitors, which could not be distinguished using cRNP complex containing viral RNA. The mechanisms of action for five guanosine triphosphate analogs were examined in a gel-based assay using the miniHA template and a capped radiolabeled mRNA m

 <sup>1</sup>67. After pre-cleavage of the radiolabeled primer, a specific endonuclease inhibitor 4-(1,4-bis(4-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid was added to inhibit endonuclease activity and prevent cleavage of the newly elongated transcripts formed in the presence of NTPs or NTP analogs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the template sequence allows visualization of multiple guanosine or adenosine analog incorporations. In the reaction containing all four natural NTPs at 500 μM concentration (lane 1), the majority of radiolabeled products accumulated near the top of the gel. When 2’FdGTP was substituted for GTP (lane 2), a reduced amount of radiolabeled RNA was present at the top of the gel; however, the lack of chain-terminated transcripts suggested that the analog was stably incorporated into RNA. T-705-RTP has been reported to be incorporated through base-pairing with either cytosine or uracil by influenza RdRp, terminating RNA synthesis after two consecutive incorporations [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g003">Fig 3</xref> is in general agreement with these observations. In lane 3, T-1106-TP shows competition with ATP for incorporation opposite U as well as GC base pairing, and delayed chain termination. This blocks formation of long transcripts after multiple incorporations. The 4’-vinyl and 4’-cyano-FdGTP analogs (lanes 4 and 5) showed direct chain-termination at the first guanosine incorporation site and blocked formation of long products. Interestingly, even though T-705-RTP (lane 6) and T-1106-TP are close analogues, T-705-RTP generated a product pattern significantly different from that of T-1106-TP. T-705-RTP decreased competition with adenosine with a clear ladder of different sized products; decreased accumulation of the first GTP incorporation product; and could stably incorporate and increase long product at the top of the gel. In the absence of GTP or its analog (lane 7), the polymerase was able to bypass the first GTP site through mis-incorporation of other NTPs, but transcription is stalled at the second GTP incorporation site and no formation of longer transcripts were observed. The recombinant RdRp heterotrimer enabled the detailed study of these five structurally diverse compounds which was not feasible using cRNP (
