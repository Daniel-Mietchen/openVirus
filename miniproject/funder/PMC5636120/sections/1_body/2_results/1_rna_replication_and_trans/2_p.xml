<p>A comparison of the enzymatic activities of cRNP and recombinant RdRp is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g002">Fig 2</xref>. 2A shows GTP incorporation rate by crude replication complex as a function of viral particles, and 2B shows incorporation rates as a function of recombinant polymerase concentration using the PA-30 template. Although the templates were different for the recombinant RdRp and the cRNP, the relative replication and transcription activities were comparable between these two sources of polymerase. Replication and transcription activities of cRNP and the recombinant polymerase were linear over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>), and neither recombinant RdRp nor cRNP showed de novo RNA synthesis in the absence of a primer (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185998.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This allowed for analysis of the two distinct modes of RNA synthesis: ApG-primed RNA replication or capped mRNA-primed RNA transcription.
