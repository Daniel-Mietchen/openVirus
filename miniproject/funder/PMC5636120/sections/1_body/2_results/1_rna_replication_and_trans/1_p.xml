<p>The polymerase activity of the purified RdRp heterotrimer complex was characterized in a filter binding assay utilizing the RNA template PA-30, a 30-mer containing a conserved 12 nucleotide sequence from the 3’-end of the Influenza A RNA encoding the PA protein, and a partially complementary 15-mer promoter sequence mimicking the 5’end of the viral genome, PA-Pro (

A dinucleotide ApG primer was used to investigate the replication step, while rabbit globin mRNA was used to study mRNA-primed transcription. Recombinant RdRp with exogenous template was assayed in parallel with cRNP from detergent disrupted viral particles containing endogenous viral RNA templates. The incorporation of radiolabeled GTP was used to measure the product formation.
