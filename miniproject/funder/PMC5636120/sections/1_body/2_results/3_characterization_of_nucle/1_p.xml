<p>Five guanosine nucleotide analogs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g001">Fig 1</xref>) were tested for inhibition of ApG-primed RNA synthesis catalyzed by cRNP complex in filter binding assays. The longer endogenous viral template and low polymerase concentration in cRNP afforded better sensitivity than the recombinant polymerase trimer for IC
 <sub>50</sub> measurements. Antiviral activity was measured in cell-based viral replication assays. Potency and cytotoxicity data from these assays are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0185998.t001">Table 1</xref>. The biochemical potency of the triphosphates ranged from 0.17 μM to 80 μM, in the order of T-1106-TP &gt; T-705-RTP &gt; 2F’dGTP &gt; 4’vinyl-FdGTP &gt; 4’CN-FdGTP. In the cellular anti-viral assays, T-705 showed the highest activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.2 μM, followed by 2’FdG, T-1106, and 4’vinyl-FdG with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 18, 27 μM, and 110 μM, respectively, while 4’CN-FdG remained inactive at the highest concentration tested (200 μM). The rank ordering of compounds in the biochemical assay paralleled that of the cellular assays, with the exception of T-1106-TP. This compound was 3-times more potent than T-705-RTP in the biochemical assay, but was 12-times less potent in the antiviral assays. We speculate that this discrepancy may be caused by insufficient formation of active triphosphate of T-1106 in the MDCK cells used in the antiviral assay.
