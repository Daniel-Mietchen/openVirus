<p>The polymerase activity of RdRp heterotrimer complex was further characterized in parallel with that of the cRNP in a gel-based assay in which the RNA products could be visualized. No exogenous RNA template was provided for cRNP whereas two RNA templates, PA-30 and miniHA, were used with RdRp. Results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g002">Fig 2E</xref>. Shown in lane 1, cRNP generated long transcripts near the top of the gel and short abortive initiation products. Lane 2 shows a transcript of the PA-30 template generated by the recombinant trimer and short abortive initiation products. Similarly, the recombinant trimer generated transcripts corresponding to the miniHA template, as well as intermediate length transcripts and abortive initiation products (lane 3). In mRNA primed reactions with recombinant trimer (lanes 4 and 5), abortive initiation was not observed and the products are correspondingly ~9–11 nucleotides longer than the PA-30 template (lane5) and miniHA template (lane 6). MiniHA has been predicted to form a double hairpin ‘panhandle’ promoter structure by mimicking the viral genome and thus enhancing RdRp activity[
