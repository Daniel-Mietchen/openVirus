<p>The recombinant polymerase assay system also enabled comparison of substrate incorporation efficiency between natural substrates and nucleotide analogs. We studied single nucleotide incorporation for three GTP analogs with a pre-formed RdRp-RNA primer/template elongation complex. While we were unable to define pre-steady state kinetic parameters 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>pol</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub> due to the slow, highly abortive initiation and mis-incorporation of natural nucleotides, we measured the concentration of nucleotide analog required to elongate 50% of a RNA 9-mer to 10-14-mer products in a fixed short reaction time (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>), which provides a relative comparison of substrate efficiency. The

 <sub>app</sub> values for GTP, T-1106-TP, and 4’-vinyl-FdG are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g004">Fig 4B</xref>. The ratio of

 <sub>
  <italic>app</italic>
 </sub> for GTP was calculated to be 9 nM, consistent with the reported value of 8 nM [

 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>app</italic>
 </sub> value of 27 nM for T-1106-TP yields a selectivity factor of 3 for natural GTP over T-1106-TP, 6.3 times lower than the reported selectivity over T-705-TP [
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These data were consistent with the 3-fold lower enzymatic IC
