<p>Xing, et al recently described the purification of the recombinant influenza polymerase heterotrimer and showed that the endonuclease activity was significantly increased over the broadly used N-terminal truncated PA subunit[
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this paper, we evaluated the RdRp activity of this heterotrimer complex during both ApG-primed RNA replication and mRNA-dependent RNA transcription. Similar to the viral-derived cRNP, the recombinant RdRp appears to be 2-fold more efficient during replication than transcription, indicating endonuclease cleavage could be rate-limiting during mRNA transcription. Using the recombinant RdRp and sequence-defined RNA template and primer, we were able to investigate the mechanism of action for nucleoside analogs active against influenza virus. Most of the marketed nucleoside antivirals exert their effects by incorporation into nascent DNA or RNA and subsequent chain termination. However, nucleoside inhibitors of influenza virus demonstrated distinct modes of action. The stable incorporation of 2’FdGTP suggested a kinetic inhibition mechanism of action, in which the nucleoside analog disrupts and delays extension of RNA. However, this observation was in direct conflict with Tisdale’s report of direct chain-termination upon 2’FdGTP incorporation [

 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The fact that T-705RTP and its close analog T-1106-TP can be incorporated as either “A or G” bases also suggests hypermutation as an antiviral mechanism, described by Crotty et al as accumulation of mutations in viral RNA leading to a drop in viral fitness[
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While these two analogs cause chain termination after two or more subsequent incorporations, the likelihood of more than two subsequent incorporations of these analogs in the presence of physiological levels of natural NTP is small. The increased potency of T-1106-TP with respect to T-705-RTP correlates with its enhanced ability to be incorporated as adenosine (

Understanding modes of action of nucleotide inhibitors may identify potential efficacy or toxicity liabilities and guide drug development. Using crude replication complex we were unable to observe incorporation of T705-RTP or the 4’vinyl and 4’CN-FdGTP analogs, suggesting that they may not be substrates of influenza polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185998.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The recombinant polymerase complex and defined templates also demonstrated reduced mis-incorporation of natural nucleotides, allowing distinction between stably incorporated analogs such as 2’FdGTP and the chain terminators 4’vinyl- and 4’CN-FdGTP. The 4’vinyl- and 4’CN-FdGTP did not block formation of long transcripts in cRNP assays due to poor substrate efficiency combined with significant mis-incorporation of natural nucleotides. Recombinant influenza A polymerase heterotrimer provided a useful tool to elucidate subtle mechanisms of action differences for nucleoside antivirals. By using highly purified recombinant influenza A polymerase heterotrimer and defined RNA templates, we have shown how five different nucleotide analogs with seemingly subtle structure modifications could lead to very different mechanisms of action. These findings will enable future efforts to develop more effective and selective nucleoside antivirals targeting influenza polymerase.
