<p>MDCK cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in 100 μL of MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Medium was removed the next day and the cells were washed twice with 100 μL MEM medium supplemented with 0.125% (w/v) BSA (MEM-BSA). Serially diluted compounds were added to cells in 150 μL MEM-BSA and cells were infected with influenza A (A/Hong Kong/8/68, Advanced Biotechnologies Inc.) at MOI 0.005 in 50 μL of MEM-BSA medium supplemented with 8 μg/mL trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ). After five day incubation at 37°C, virus-induced cytopathic effect was determined by adding CellTiterGlo viability reagents (Promega, Madison, WI) and the luminescence signal was measured using Perkin Elmer’s Envision MultiLabel plate reader (Santa Clara, CA). The cytotoxicity of compounds in MDCK cells was determined in replicate plates with the same setup as used in the antiviral assay, except no virus was added to the cell culture. EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) and four parameter logistic sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equations.
