<p>The PA, PB1 and PB2 genes of Influenza A virus RNA polymerase were amplified by reverse-transcription and PCR from H1N1 strain A/PR/8. The 3x FLAG tag was added to the N-terminal full-length PA and cloned into pFastBac1 vector (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Full-length PB1 and PB2 genes were cloned into pFastBac Dual vector (Life Technologies) as described previously[
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Recombinant baculovirus was generated for PA and PB1/PB2 using Sf9 cells and was used to co-infect 
 <italic>Trichopulsia ni</italic> cells (Hi5) at 1.5 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml in ESF-921 medium (Expression Systems, David, CA). Purification and biochemical characterization of the polymerase heterotrimer was described previously [
