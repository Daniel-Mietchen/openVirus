 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. 250 nM recombinant polymerase trimer was pre-incubated with 2.5 μM SNI-G template, 1 μM SNI-Pro promoter, and 400 μM ApG primer in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 20 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT, and 0.2 U/μL RNasin at 37°C. The reaction was initiated by adding a mixture of 25 μM CTP, 25 μM UTP, 25 μCi of α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-UTP, and various concentrations of GTP or analogs. Reactions proceeded for 35 minutes and were quenched with equal volumes of loading dye containing 90% formamide, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) amount of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. The products were separated by 25% PAGE, visualized, and quantified by autoradiography as described above. Data were fit with
