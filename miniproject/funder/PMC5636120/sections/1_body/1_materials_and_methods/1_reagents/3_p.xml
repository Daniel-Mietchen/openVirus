<p>The radiolabeled cap-1 mRNA primer 
 <sup>33</sup>P-m
 <sup>7</sup>G
 <sup>1</sup>67 was prepared as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, 10 μg pGEM zf(+) plasmid was digested with 800 U SmaI at room temperature overnight and purified by ethanol precipitation. RNA transcription was carried out at 37°C overnight using the MegaScript Sp6 transcription kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 10 minute incubation with DNAse I, the final RNA was recovered by phenol chloroform extraction. 5’-capping was achieved by the following: 60 μg of RNA transcript was denatured by heating at 95°C for 10 minutes, cooled to room temperature and added to a capping reaction mixture containing the ScriptCap m
 <sup>7</sup>G Kit, 2’-O-methyl transferase enzyme (CellScript, Madison, WI), and 500 μCi of α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-GTP for 6 hours at 37°C in a final volume of 100 μL. The final cap-1 RNA product was inactivated at 95°C for 10 minutes and passed through G25 spin columns (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) to remove unincorporated nucleotide.
