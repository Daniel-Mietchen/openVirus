<p>All natural nucleotide triphosphates ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP were obtained from GE Healthcare (Pittsburgh, PA). Radiolabeled nucleotides α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-GTP, UTP, and ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/mL) were purchased from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). All of the nucleoside analogs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and their triphosphate (TP) forms were synthesized at Gilead Sciences except 2’FdG for which TP was from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). All synthetic RNA oligonucleotides (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185998.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies. These include PA-30, a 30-mer template analogous to the 3’ end of the PA gene; PA-Pro, a 15-mer promoter with partially complementary sequence to PA-30, SNI-G, a template for single nucleotide incorporation (SNI) with GTP or GTP analog; SNI-Pro, the corresponding promoter oligo used in SNI studies as described by Jin et al. [
