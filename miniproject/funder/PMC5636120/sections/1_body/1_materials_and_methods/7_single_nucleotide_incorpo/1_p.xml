 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was added to the reaction mixture. The polymerase reactions were initiated by adding nucleotide analogs and three other natural NTPs (all at final concentrations of 500 μM) and 10 μCi α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-ATP. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and quenched with equal volumes of gel loading dye containing 90% formamide, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis (25% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea). The dried gels were exposed to phosphorimager screen and visualized using the Typhoon Trio and ImageQuant Software (GE, Piscataway, NJ.)
