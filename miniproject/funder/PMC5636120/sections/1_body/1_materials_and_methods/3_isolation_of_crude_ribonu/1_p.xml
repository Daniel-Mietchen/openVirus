 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, 3 mg influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) viral stock (~1.8 x 10
 <sup>12</sup> viral particles, Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Eldersburg, MD) was pelleted at 54,000g for 2 hours. The pellet was disrupted by exposure to 2% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature in a total of 100 μL buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM KCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 U/mL RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and 2 mg/mL Lysolechithin type V (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Aliquots of cRNP were stored at -80°C.
