<p>Nucleotide analog inhibitors were serially diluted 3-fold in water and added to reaction mixture containing 10% virus cRNP (v/v), 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton-101 (reduced), 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.4 U/mL RNasin, and 200 μM ApG dinucleotide primer (TriLink, San Diego, CA). Reactions were initiated by addition of ribonucleotide triphosphate (NTP) substrate mix containing 1 μM GTP (at 0.5 x

 <sub>m</sub>), 0.01 μM α-
 <sup>33</sup>P GTP, and 100 μM of ATP, CTP, and UTP (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 90 minutes then spotted onto DE81 filter paper. Filters were air dried, washed with 0.125 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO4 (3×), water (1×), and Ethanol (1×) and air dried before exposure to Typhoon phosphor imager screen. Product formation was quantified on a Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated for inhibitors by fitting the data to a four-parameter sigmoidal dose response with variable slope in GraphPad Prism.
