<p>The polymerase activity of RdRp was studied in a similar manner as in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> assay described above. The recombinant polymerase trimer was pre-incubated for 5 minutes in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.25 U/μL RNAsin, 1.6 μM PA-30 template, 1.6 μM PA-Pro promoter or miniHA template and one of the two RNA primers: 300 μM ApG dinucleotide primer (TriLink, San Diego, CA) for replication activity, or 13 ng/μL rabbit globin mRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) for transcription. Reactions were initiated by addition of NTP substrate mixture containing 0.01 μM α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-GTP,1 μM GTP, and 100 μM for each of the rest of NTPs: ATP, CTP and UTP (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). For the activity assays, reactions were incubated at 30°C and 5 μL aliquots were spotted onto DE81 filter paper over a 60-minute time course. The filters were processed as mentioned above and exposed to a phosphor imager and the amount of α-
 <sup>33</sup>P-GTP was quantified on a Typhoon Trio (GE Healthcare, Piscataway NJ). Unwashed filters containing known quantities of radiolabel were used to calculate rates of incorporation for 
 <sup>33</sup>P-GTP. To visualize products, aliquots of the reactions were quenched with equal volumes of gel loading dye containing 90% formamide, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea). The dried gels were exposed to phosphorimager screen and visualized using the Typhoon Trio and ImageQuant Software (GE, Piscataway, NJ.)
