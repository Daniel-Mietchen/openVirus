<p>Influenza A viruses cause recurrent epidemics and global pandemics that claim the lives of millions. The emergence of novel strains and variants will continue to pose challenges to public health [

 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Like all members of this family, the viral genome is composed of eight segments of single-strand, negative-sense RNA that encode 10 viral proteins: three proteins that form viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (PA, PB1 and PB2), four structural proteins (HA, NA, M1 matrix protein and the M2 ion channel protein), two nonstructural proteins (NS1A and NS2/NEP), and a nucleoprotein (NP) [
