<p>Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs have played key roles as antiviral agents for herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and most recently Ebola virus (EBOV) [

In recent years, several groups have studied recombinant RdRp either in the form of partially purified protein, with PA subunit in significant excess, or using chimeric complexes with subunits expressed from different viral strains [
