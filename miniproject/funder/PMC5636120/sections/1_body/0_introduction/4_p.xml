<p>We recently reported the expression and purification of a homogeneous trimeric polymerase complex[
 <xref rid="pone.0185998.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we have characterized the replication and transcription activities of the recombinant polymerase complex and used it to determine distinct modes of action for five nucleoside inhibitors of influenza virus. The recombinant polymerase complex and defined templates allowed visualization of single nucleotide incorporation of the active metabolite of Favipirivir and related analog T-1106 triphosphate, which were not direct chain terminators and could not be observed in RNP or crude polymerase reactions. Further engineering of template sequences elucidated unique modes of action of Favipiravir and related analog T-1106 triphosphate, as well as 2â€™FdG and two additional modified guanosine analogs. In addition to mode of action, the recombinant polymerase complex was used to determine relative incorporation efficiency, one of the measures of intrinsic potency for nucleotide antivirals.
