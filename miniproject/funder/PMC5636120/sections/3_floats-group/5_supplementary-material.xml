  <p>Methylation of m
   <sup>7</sup>G
   <sub>0</sub>-67mer RNA was assessed by incorporation of 
   <sup>14</sup>C from trace labeled S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), (PerkinElmer, Walthham, MA) using the ScriptCap vaccinia virus 2‘-O-Methyl transferase kit (CellScript, Madison, WI). 5 μg (229 pmoles) of m
   <sup>7</sup>G
   <sub>0</sub>-67mer RNA prepared as described previously was incubated with 25 μmoles SAM and 13 pmoles 
   <sup>14</sup>C-SAM in ScriptCap reactions prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions. A sham reaction was included containing all reagents except 2‘-O-Methyl transferase enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then passed through G-25 Sepharose columns twice to remove unreacted SAM. 10 μL of complete reaction mixtures were spotted on filter papers and 
   <sup>14</sup>C incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. (A) 
   <sup>14</sup>C incorporation in ScriptCap methyltransferase reactions was measured by scintillation counting in parallel with background samples and sham samples; (B) A 
   <sup>14</sup>C-SAM standard curve was used to calculate the amount of 
   <sup>14</sup>C in samples (μCi); (C) Specific activity of the 
   <sup>14</sup>C-SAM mixture allowed calculation of reaction efficiency by average pmoles of the trace labeled 
   <sup>14</sup>C incorporated per pmol RNA.
