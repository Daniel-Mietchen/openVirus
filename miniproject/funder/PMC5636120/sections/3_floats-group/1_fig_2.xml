  <title>Activity of RNA replication and transcription by recombinant influenza RdRp heterotrimer.</title>
  <p>(A) The rate of 
   <sup>33</sup>P-α-GTP incorporation by cRNP is proportional to the estimated viral particles used to generate cRNP; (B) The rate of 
   <sup>33</sup>P-α-GTP incorporation by recombinant RdRp is proportional to the PA/PB1/PB2 trimer protein concentration; (C and D) The product formation presented by an arbitrary unit on the phosphor imager is linear with time and similar between the replication and transcription rates observed with cRNP (panel C) and recombinant RdRp (panel D) during ApG-primed RNA replication (●) or rabbit globin mRNA-primed RNA transcription (■). (E) Product formation using different RNA templates was analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In contract to cRNP-catalyzed RNA synthesis (far left lane) which generated a smeared ladder of long products at the top of the gel, recombinant RdRp generated approximately template length products during ApG-primed RNA replication (D, B). Furthermore, transcripts of PA-30 and mini-HA containing an additional 9–11 nucleotides were generated during rabbit globin mRNA-primed RNA transcription (C, A).
