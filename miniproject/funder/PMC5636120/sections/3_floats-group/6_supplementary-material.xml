  <title>De novo vs. primed transcription of miniHA.</title>
  <p>Gel images show de novo synthesis (left lane) and primed RNA synthesis (right lane). RdRp was pre-incubated for 5 minutes in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.25 U/μL RNAsin, 1.6 μM miniHA template in the presence and absence of 300 μM ApG (Trilink Biotechnologies). Reactions were initiated by addition of NTP substrate mixture containing 0.01 μM α-
   <sup>33</sup>P-GTP, 1 μM GTP, and 100 μM for each of the rest of NTPs: ATP, CTP and UTP (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT). To visualize products, aliquots of the reactions were quenched with equal volumes of gel loading dye containing 90% formamide, 100 mM EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol. Products were separated by electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea). The dried gels were exposed to phosphorimager screen and visualized using the Typhoon Trio and ImageQuant Software (GE, Piscataway, NJ.)
