 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has extended its range globally due to its capacity to adapt to the environment and climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The exploration of the environmental factors influencing its distribution range in China could facilitate the formulation of effective monitoring and risk assessment programs, since new dengue fever outbreaks are a threat to public health. Indeed, recent dengue fever epidemics have occurred in different regions ranging from Guangzhou, in southern China, in 2014, to Yuzhou in Henan province, which is on the south bank of the Yellow River in central China, 1400 km straight north of Guangzhou, in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Almost all the recent epidemics were caused solely by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The 2013 dengue fever epidemic in Yuzhou, initiated by an imported index case, pointed to the suitability of the local environment-climate in central China. The danger lies in the fact that imported cases have been reported all over China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]; therefore, there is a need to update the vector distribution maps and reassess environmental suitability based on the updated distribution data. Although our analysis introduced new sampling sites in China, we anticipated 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> distributional potential similar to that reported in the previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The five most notable sites included two in northwestern China (Jiayuguan City in Gansu and Beitun City in Xinjiang) and one in northeastern China (Ning’an County in Heilongjiang), and two sites in Jiulong and Lixian counties in western Sichuan province, which are located at high altitude (close to 3000 m above sea level) on the east slope of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using environmental data from the new sites, the present study generated a new risk map with risk ranges extended considerably in summer, particularly in northeastern China in areas bordering Russia and on the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in southwestern China. The predicted regions with suitable climates from May to September extended beyond the areas predicted substantially even in other recent studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Whether or not the expansion in the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population range is linked to global climate change or the biological adaptation of vectors requires further study.
