<p id="Par29">Finally, systematic sampling, i.e., good spatial coverage and sufficient longitudinal follow-ups, is key for the determination of the distribution ranges conduciveness of climatic conditions for 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Currently, systematic survey data on 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are only available for four provinces in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention has implemented a cross-country surveillance system and conducted longitudinal surveys, the spatial coverage is too coarse for a comprehensive nationwide evaluation of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> distribution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. June–September is an important season for mosquito population dynamics monitoring, based on the results of this study. We emphasize that both spatial coverage and sampling seasons are essential for determining the northern geographic margins of distribution of the vector.
