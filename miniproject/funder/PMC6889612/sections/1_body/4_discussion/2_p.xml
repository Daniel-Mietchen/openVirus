<p id="Par25">Based on the updated distribution data, the present study predicted that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> could occur seasonally in semiarid or even arid areas, as long as temperature and precipitation conditions are favorable, which suggests a need to consider seasonal climate suitability as opposed to focusing on specific annual periods. In addition to temperature, water availability influences mosquito distribution [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in the region, which has occurred in Japan in regions at similar latitudes and in the northeastern United States [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in semiarid and arid areas, the key examples are Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, where dengue fever outbreaks have been reported previously [
