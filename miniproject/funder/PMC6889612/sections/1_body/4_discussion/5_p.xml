<p id="Par28">A previous study conducted in Shandong province, along the banks of the Yellow River, trapped 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> outdoors in November [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], which our model predicted as ‘absence’ with zero probability. This could be due to 1) old climatic data used in the modeling activity; 2) annual climate variability; or 3) real temperature increase or climate change, which warrant further investigation. Another limitation of the present study is the lack of human distribution data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. While environmental factors influence vector population growth, human population distribution influences the transmission of disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In the arid areas of northern and northwestern China and in numerous parts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the human population distribution is sparse; therefore, potential dengue fever risks are low, particularly in the frigid area on top of the plateau. However, how climate and environmental factors interact with human distribution in landscapes and biological competitors, and their combined influence on 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population establishment and distribution require further investigation. Since the sampling sites in the present study were point data, further analyses, such as spatial extrapolation studies, are required, so that expansion ranges and increased risks in populations can be estimated in combination with population density maps. A further prospect would be analyzing local climate trends in the past and linking them with observed dengue fever outbreaks, which would be more appealing from a public health perspective than simply focusing on vector distribution ranges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, when mapping the distribution and seasonality of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and dengue fever outbreaks in China, it could be more appropriate to use only meteorological data from stations in China and international stations near the borders. This warrants further explorations and it is the objective of our ongoing project.
