<p id="Par27">The present study has some major limitations. The model applied climatic data from 1971 to 2000, which may have limited its capacity to predict the recent expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> ranges, although WorldClim data has been widely used for the prediction of the impact of global change on the expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> ranges [
