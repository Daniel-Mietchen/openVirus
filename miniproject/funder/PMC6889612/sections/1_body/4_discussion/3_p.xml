<p id="Par26">Other 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> risk areas of interest are the southwestern international border areas and the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Could the environmental conditions in such regions facilitate 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population establishment? In the present study, five 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurrence sites had elevations &gt; 2000 m above sea level, with the highest at approximately 2900 m. Dengue fever epidemics and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> have been reported in northern Pakistan, not far from the China-Pakistan border [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, dengue fever epidemics and both 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have been reported in Nepal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], which lies on the south slope of the Himalaya mountain range, also bordering southwestern China. Such studies indicate that vectors of tropical infectious diseases could adapt to the environmental conditions in the low altitude section of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and could even transmit the diseases there. Again, the influence of global climate change on such dynamics is a subject for further study.
