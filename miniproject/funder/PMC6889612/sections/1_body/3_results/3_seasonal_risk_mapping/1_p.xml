<p id="Par23">The model unequivocally predicts that in the winter months (December–February) 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will be observed only in southern China, as depicted in the risk maps (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The major expansion of the range of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> adults begins in April, when the predicted occurrence covers most of the areas south of the Yellow River (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). By May, it covered all of China, including a few places in northwestern China, although risk probabilities are low in the northeast and southwest regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In June–September, the major dengue fever transmission season in China, the model predicts the greatest range of climate and environmental suitability. The most notable areas are included northeastern China, and the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwestern China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which have been predicted in previous studies to have unsuitable climates. Predicted ranges decreased considerably by October compared to June–September, when the risk map is similar to the map of April. In November, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> adults remained active across most regions south of the Yangtze River and in a small portion of the areas north of the Yangtze River (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
