<p id="Par21">Two hundred and forty-two sampling locations were included in the present study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was recorded in 200 sites and no 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were observed in the rest of the 42 sites. Only four provinces had ongoing systematic surveillance programs, including two southern provinces, Zhejiang and Hainan Island, representing the subtropical-tropical areas; one southwestern province, Guizhou, which is a high-elevation mountainous area; and Shaanxi province, representing northern China, and potentially the northern distribution margin of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Data records included 31 sampling sites (county or city) in Shaanxi province, in which 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurred in 20 sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1). Gansu province, in the semiarid and arid area of northwestern China, had 22 sampling sites, of which 14 had 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). No 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were observed in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, or Qinghai province, which are all located in the semiarid, arid or Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau temperate areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). No sampling has been conducted previously in the Tibet Autonomous Region, and very few collections have been carried out in Qinghai province, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; the three provinces represent some of the provinces with the largest land areas and the harshest climatic and environmental conditions in western China (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1). Most of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> positive sites in the present study are in areas where ,the species have been found before, and the areas are considered to have suitable climatic conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Notably, however, some more recent reports of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are far outside the conventional suitable climate ranges including a site in Heilongjiang province in northeastern China, which borders the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a site in the far west of Gansu province, in the desert city of Jiayuguan, and a site in northern Xinjiang, which borders Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). There are also several 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> positive sampling sites in northern Liaoning province, in which the vector has never been reported previously, in addition to two sites on the east slope of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in western Sichuan province (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1).
