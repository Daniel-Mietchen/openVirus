<p id="Par22">Climatic and environmental similarity analysis results suggested that the observational data points could be clustered into nine clusters because all the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurrence sites corresponded to the June–September period; therefore, regression trees were developed for 9 months or clusters of months, with June–September considered one cluster. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the models, in addition to the AUC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Using a cutoff yield the optimal accuracy for each month or cluster of months. The average model accuracy was 98.4% (range: 97.1–99.9%) and the average AUC was 99.1% (range: 95.7–99.9%). The sensitivity rate was 97.2% on average (range: 94.4–98.2%), with the lowest value in January and the highest in April. The specificity rate was 99.1% on average (range: 97.1–100%).
