<p id="Par13">Comprehensive 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> field surveillance records and GPS location data from China for the 1998–2017 period were collected (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). Since 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has been observed frequently in southern China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], to minimize redundancy during modeling, repeated sampling activities in similar locations (e.g., the same city) in southern China (e.g., Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other provinces) were not included [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Information extracted from the surveillance records included prevalence and months of occurrence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Incomplete occurrence period records were filled in using k-medoids clustering based on climate similarity (see Data analysis below). If a specific location was included in the published record, the GPS readings of that record were extracted. If only the name of the sampling location was included (usually the name of the city or county where the sample was collected), a GPS location was arbitrarily selected within the city or the major town (usually the capital) of the county. The GPS readings were used to extract the climatic and environmental data described in the following section.
