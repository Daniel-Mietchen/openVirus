<p id="Par14">We used WorldClim 2.0 as major reference climatic data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. High resolution (30 arcsec or approximately 1-km
 <sup>2</sup> spatial resolution) WorldClim 2.0 data were generated based on averages during 1971–2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Climatic data variables included monthly mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures, and monthly total precipitations. Climatic data that assigned to each sampling point were from the nearest grid points in WorldClim 2.0. Climatic-environmental zones were established based on previous literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The environmental regions were divided into four categories, including humid, sub-humid, semiarid, and arid regions. Climatic zone comprised nine categories, including south subtropical, mid-subtropical, north subtropical, warm temperate, mild temperate, cool temperate, plateau subtropical, plateau temperate, and plateau sub frigid zones. Each sampling location was assigned its corresponding climatic and environmental categories.
