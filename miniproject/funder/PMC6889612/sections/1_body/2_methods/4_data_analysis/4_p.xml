<p id="Par19">Once the models were established, climatic-environmental suitability maps were generated for each month based on climatic surface, climatic zone, and regional environmental data. Suitability was predicted as the average predicted suitability probability of the 10 models developed during the 10-fold cross-validation modeling process, and spatial resolution was 30 arcsec or approximately 1 km
