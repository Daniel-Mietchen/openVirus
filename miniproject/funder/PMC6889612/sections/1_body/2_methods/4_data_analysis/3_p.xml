<p id="Par18">The machine learning classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to predict the monthly/seasonal distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. The binary values, 0 and 1, representing ‘presence’ and ‘absence’, respectively were assigned to each month for all sampling points based on field observation or the results of k-medoids clustering. The binary variables were then used for CART modeling as the dependent variables, while environmental variables were the independent variables. We have adapted the commonly used 10-fold cross-validation rule in the present study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Consequently, 10 prediction models were produced for each month. The training sets were used to grow the tree and the testing sets were used for cross-validation to prune the tree. We set a minimum data points of five for all terminate nodes. Since 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was only present in a small area in southern China in winter (December–February) and absent in a small area in northern China in summer (July–September), the stratification (i.e., rearrangement of the data) 10-fold cross-validation method was used to ensure that each fold was an appropriate representative of the whole to minimize sampling bias induced by 10-fold random selection [
