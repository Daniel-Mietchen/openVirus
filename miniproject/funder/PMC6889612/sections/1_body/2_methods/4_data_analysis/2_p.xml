<p id="Par17">The following are briefs of the k-medoids clustering. k-medoids is a classical partitioning clustering technique that clusters a dataset of objects into k groups known a priori [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The k-medoid clustering applied most extensively is the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which was selected for the present study. The method initially selects k data points as the medoids, and the points represent different clusters. Each data point is associated with the closest medoid through a stepwise method to minimize the cost of the configuration, i.e., sum of distances of points to their medoid. Briefly, for each medoid and non-medoid data point, swap medoid with non-medoid, and re-compute the cost. If the total cost of the configuration decreases, then continue, otherwise undo the swap. The process continues until all data points are assigned to clusters. In the study, we knew that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurred all-year-around in tropical China, in regions such as Hainan Island; however, one may observed adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> only in summer from June to September in northern China, in regions such as in Liaoning province (Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S1). The initial k value was set as 12, and values including 11, 10, 9, and 8 were also examined. We used data points with known 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> occurrence months as training data then used clustering results to assign occurrence months to each record in cases where they were missing due to a lack of longitudinal observations.
