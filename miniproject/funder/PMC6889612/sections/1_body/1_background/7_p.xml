<p id="Par12">In the present study, our aim was to model the seasonal distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in China based on comprehensive data from published literature. Our models used environmental data to predict distribution and seasonality, particularly in the earliest and latest months of occurrence of the species, at high spatial resolution. The present study focuses solely on the distribution of adult
