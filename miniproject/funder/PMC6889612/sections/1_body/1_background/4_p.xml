<p id="Par9">Numerous studies have mapped regional or global distribution ranges of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> based on the biological or physiological characteristics of the species. Majority of the studies have examined how climatic conditions limit the distribution of the species, often focusing on temperature exclusively. Some studies have used laboratory-based results to predict how climatic factors, i.e., temperature and precipitation, affect the northern limits of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in different regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and potential ranges of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> under present-day and future climate conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Such studies present the most recent trends in research on 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> risks. It is essential to examine how local environments influence 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> ranges, particularly their seasonality in China, based on a more comprehensive review of field observational data since it could provide insights into the underlying factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Prediction of seasonality is particularly critical because could facilitate better allocation of resources and guarantee cost-effectiveness in disease prevention and control.
