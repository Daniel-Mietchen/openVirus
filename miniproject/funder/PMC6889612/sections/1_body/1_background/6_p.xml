<p id="Par11">Field studies from different areas have delineated high seasonality in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population dynamics and distribution. For example, in Croatia, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> oviposition activity began in April and ended in November, with high seasonality and spatial heterogeneity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the northern temperate areas of Japan, adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were observed from May through October [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similarly, in southern China, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were active all year round [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]; however, in central China, adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were observed only from May to October [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Despite such findings in the field, modeling studies have rarely analyzed the seasonal influence of environment on 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations and their distribution [
