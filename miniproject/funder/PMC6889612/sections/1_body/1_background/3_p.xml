<p id="Par8">Local environmental conditions are key factors influencing the distribution, survivorship, and development of both larval and adult 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The high capacity of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to adapt to diverse environments and climates makes it a potential invasive species in numerous localities globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The dynamic expansion in range raises questions about how environmental factors influence the distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. For example, can 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> extend its distribution range to temperate regions such as northern China? If the answer is ‘Yes’, since winters are very cold in northern China, can 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> adults survive the winters or only emerge in summer in northern China?
