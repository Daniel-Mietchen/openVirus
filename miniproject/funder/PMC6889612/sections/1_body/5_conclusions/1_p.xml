<p id="Par30">Both climatic and environmental factors both influence 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> distribution in China. The current predicted seasonal distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in China may extend well beyond the ranges predicted previously, particularly the northern limit, due to either global climatic change or the adaptation of biological vectors. Considering the sustained movement of dengue fever epidemics northward in central and eastern China, the timely monitoring of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations and their expansion, the assessment, and frequent reassessment of epidemic risks in such areas, and the assessment of risks based on recent dengue fever outbreaks in China, particularly in central and northern China, are crucial for epidemic preparedness and disease control, particularly in the wake of global climate change.
