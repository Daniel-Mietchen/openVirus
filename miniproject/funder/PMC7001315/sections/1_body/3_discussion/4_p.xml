<p id="Par20">This study had several strengths. Firstly, this study was a community-based case-control study, which was less prone to selection bias than hospital-based case -control study, and the neighborhood-matched design made cases and control subjects similar for certain variables. A number of potential confounding factors including social status, economic conditions, health status, housing conditions, etc. were able to be adjusted. Meanwhile, the neighborhood controls were chose in the same community but not adjacent to the cases, ensuring that the factors including career choices, environmental exposure, etc. were not over over-matched. Secondly, investigations were conducted within 1 week after the disease onset, which could reduce the recall bias in reporting the lifestyle characteristics. Last but not least, the investigation lasted over 1 year, covering all the peak incidence of the whole year. More detailed information could be collected compared to some studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] with shorter investigation time. Lastly, the study was representative of the population in Liangyungang because of the use of community-based study subjects, which made it meaningful for us to carry out suitable prevention and control measures.
