The reason why cleaning spare rooms was the influencing factor might be that the human activities in the spare rooms were infrequent and these rooms were poorly ventilated, which was conducive to rodent reproduction. When people enter these closed rooms to clean, they are likely to be infected by inhaling aerosols containing the virus. Ruan’s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Li’s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] researches showed that sprinkling during cleaning had a protective effect for the infection. Unfortunately, sprinkling while cleaning spare rooms at home did not enter the equation in this study, the influence of this factor could not be further analyzed.
