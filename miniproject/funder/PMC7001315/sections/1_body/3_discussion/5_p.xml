<p id="Par21">This study was also subject to several limitations. Firstly, the sample size was relatively small compared to previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Secondly, the incidence varies significantly in different seasons according to the disease surveillance. This study was only carried out in two epidemic areas of the same city, thus it might not be representative of the general Chinese population.
