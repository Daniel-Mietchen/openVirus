<p id="Par10">A standardized questionnaire was used to investigate both cases and controls. Trained investigators interviewed the study subjects about their demographics (age, gender), living and working environment (e.g. presence of rats, pond, frequency of airing quilts), exposure history within 1 month prior to disease onset (e.g. raising live stocks or poultry, contacting with rats and/or their excreta, resting on grass field, broken skins, mite bites) and other possible risk factors (e.g. having underlying diseases, annual household income, taking rodent control measures). The questionnaires of cases were completed within 2 weeks after laboratory diagnosis. All questionnaires were systematically verified by JSCDCâ€™s research coordinators for data integrity.</p>
