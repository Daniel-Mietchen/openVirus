<p id="Par7">The cases in this study were defined as confirmed cases that had disease onset during October 2015 and December 2016. Serum samples from suspected patients and identified matched controls were collected from Lianyungang City of Jiangsu Province. The diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases were based on the Diagnosis Criteria for Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (WS278–2008) issued by the former Ministry of Health, People’s Republic of China as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Confirmed HFRS patients were defined as persons who present with specific IgM antibodies against hantavirus. The eligible controls were defined as neighbors of the case subjects who were matched by age (within 5 years), sex, occupation (farmer or non-farmer), length of local residence (longer than 6 months), and who were negative for specific IgG antibodies and without HFRS vaccine history. The controls were chose among the people who lived in the same community or village but at least 3 households (about 100 m) apart from the case subjects.
