<p id="Par11">Data was double entered into Epidata 3.1 (the Epidata Association, Denmark, Europe), and a database consistency check was performed. SPSS version 18.0 (the Statistical Product and Service Solutions, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify the risk factors for HFRS. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the association strength between variables. Variables with 
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression model. The backward stepwise elimination procedure was applied to exclude the variables with 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05 in the multivariate regression model.
