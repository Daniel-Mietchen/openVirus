<p id="Par5">Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), formerly known as epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF), is caused by several rodent-borne hantaviruses in the Hantaviridae family of the order Bunyavirales [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HFRS is clinically characterized by fever, haemorrhage, kidney disease, headache, back pain, abdominal pain and hypotension [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Every year, thousands of people are infected by hantaviruses in developing and developed countries alike, case fatality rates range from 0.5 to 40% depending on the viral strain [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. HFRS cases have occurred mainly in China, the Republic of Korea, and the Far East region of the Russian Federation in Asia, as well as in Finland, Sweden and western and central Europe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 patients with HFRS are hospitalized each year throughout the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. With the highest occurrence of HFRS, China has experienced approximately 90% of the cases worldwide over the last few decades [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. From 2008 to 2018, a total of 118,124 cases of HFRS were reported in the country, making HFRS a critical public health issue. Transmission of hantaviruses is thought to occur mainly through contact with infected animal excreta or ingest food contaminated with infected animal excreta (faeces, urine and saliva). Though the aerosol route of infection is undoubtedly the most common means of transmission among rodents and to humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], virus transmission by bite occurs among rodents and may also result in human infection [
