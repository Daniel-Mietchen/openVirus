<p>We used a grounded theory approach to viral hepatitis management because it is recognised as a powerful tool to describe novel and poorly understood phenomena
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and because it allowed the research team to adapt the interview and observation guides to new questions which emerged during data collection. Preliminary results were first discussed during two workshops with the qualitative researchers and then with the whole EVOLCAM team, in order to triangulate qualitative evidence with quantitative results and to incorporate new items into the data collection tools, if needed. Audio recordings of interviews and notes taken during observations were transcribed, analysed and coded manually. Codes were defined together with the research team around issues including accuracy of knowledge on hepatitis, amount and quality of information, health expenses, time between consultation and examinations, expectations of care and reference to HIV programmes. Analysis of patientsâ€™ and HCP interviews was performed using the same inductive method, whereby analytical themes were generated by hypothesis and confirmed or re-evaluated by data collection. Textual analysis was then undertaken, identifying specific subthemes through occurrences and recurrences and analysis of correlations.
