<p>Cameroon is a lower middle-income country of Central Africa with a yearly gross domestic product (GDP) of US$1354 per capita in 2015 and a literacy rate of 80% in young adults (15–24 years).
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, human development indicators remain low: with a human development index of 0.55 in 2018, Cameroon is ranked 151 out of 188 countries, with 38% of the working population earning US$3.10 (in purchasing power parity) per day or less.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The country’s health system is mainly funded by private health expenditures through out-of-pocket payments which represent approximately two-thirds of total health expenditures.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Social security expenditures on health represent only 2.6% of government health expenditure. In addition, safety nets for the poor are almost non-existent: theoretically, hospitals should have a social service to provide some financial support for the needy, but in reality there is no government funding for this service, and accordingly it is often dysfunctional.
