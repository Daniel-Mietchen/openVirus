<p>Currently, Cameroon has no national viral hepatitis programme or national guidelines for screening, diagnosis, care and treatment. At the time of the present study, hepatitis testing was mainly proposed when patients presented with symptoms, or were diagnosed HIV-positive. Systematic HBV screening is recommended during antenatal care. In addition, screening for both diseases is compulsory to register for national competitive examinations for enrolment in the national police force and national school of administration. However, no specific education material on hepatitis and its prevention, care and treatment has been developed to help effectively carry out pretest and post-test counselling sessions. Specifically, no billboards were available in hospital services and, except for hepatogastroenterologists, other HCP in general have not been trained in counselling on viral hepatitis. At the beginning of the 2010s, the Cameroon Society of Gastroenterology, comprising a dozen hepatogastroenterologists, initiated a collaborative project with public health officials and researchers to promote access to hepatitis treatment. With respect to HBV infection, access to antiretroviral treatment (tenofovir or lamivudine) was initially only available within the national HIV programme. Accordingly, only HIV-HBV co-infected patients benefited from it. This policy changed in April 2014 when tenofovir prescription was allowed outside the HIV programme at a price of €6.80 per month, but only in Douala’s and Yaoundé’s main referral hospitals. For HCV infection, only interferon-based treatments were available in 2014. Eligibility committees set up in Yaoundé and Douala by the Ministry of Public Health in August 2012 decided which patients could access treatment, at a cost to the latter of €7500 and €11 200 (for 48 and 72 weeks, respectively, depending on treatment response), including a discount of 33% (increased to 50% in 2014) (
