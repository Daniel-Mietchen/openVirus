<p>Individual in-depth interviews targeted three main categories of individuals who were invited to participate in the study: (i) key stakeholders involved in the care and treatment of hepatitis, both at the national and international levels, including senior ministry of health officials and leaders of international non-governmental organisation (NGO), (ii) HCP, mainly gastroenterologists working in infectious disease departments and involved in the consultation of patients affected by viral hepatitis in three reference hospitals of Yaoundé (Hôpital Central, Hôpital Général and CHU), one private clinic in Yaoundé, and one district hospital near Yaoundé; (iii) patients consulting for hepatitis-related symptoms in two of these five facilities (Hôpital Central and Hôpital Général). In addition, observations to assess doctor-patient relationships were conducted during medical rounds in the gastroenterology ward or outpatient medical consultation spaces of these two facilities. We used a non-standardised observation guide which was drawn up after analysing the data from a first series of observations. The main items examined included time spent during the consultation, clinical history taking, medical examination, prescription, quality of doctor-patient exchanges and patient participation in the interaction. Observations of consultations in gastroenterology services were only carried out at the Hospital Central while observations of HIV consultations were conducted in both hospitals.</p>
