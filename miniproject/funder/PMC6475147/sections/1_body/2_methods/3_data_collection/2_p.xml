<p>Study participation was proposed to patients after their consultation. Those who agreed to share their experiences and perceptions were contacted by phone to make an appointment for an interview outside of the hospital, usually at their home. The following themes were approached using a semi-structured guide: context of screening, quality of information and counselling, experience of diagnosis, risk perceptions, disclosure-related issues, costs engaged after diagnosis and difficulties encountered in seeking care and treatment. Interviews were repeated with some of the patients to obtain more insight into their social life and experience with the infection.</p>
