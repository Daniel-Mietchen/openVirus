<p>According to our observations, approximately 33% (16/49) of the consultations were related to patients who discovered they had hepatitis after the onset of symptoms such as long episodes of fatigue or ascites (accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity) and subsequent investigations by a gastroenterologist. The second most common reason for consultation was following diagnosis after blood donation: approximately 24% (12/49 consultations) had been referred from the hospital blood bank where they were tested positive for either HBV or HCV. In Cameroon, blood donations rely on ‘family replacement’, whereby the hospitalised patient’s closest relatives are responsible for obtaining blood at the blood bank. They can only obtain this blood if they themselves donate their own blood to the bank. Accordingly, they are tested for hepatitis at a particularly vulnerable emotional moment.</p>
