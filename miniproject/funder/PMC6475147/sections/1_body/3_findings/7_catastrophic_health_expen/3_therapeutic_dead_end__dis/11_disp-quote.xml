 <p>I’m not the type to tremble when someone tells me something. I shook once and my husband supported me… today I don’t have any more problems, no matter what they tell me, I try to manage according to my means and if that doesn’t work, I just let it go, and from time to time there are also little pieces of bark (traditional medicine) from home that also have their value, which we take from time to time.
