 <p>You see, in Africa we say that people really like going for traditional medicine because with say 100 000 FCFA (€152), you get traditional treatment. But with modern medicine, like, an exam costs 200 000 FCFA (€305), that means you need another 200 000 FCFA even before starting treatment… and that’s impossible if you haven’t already put it away somewhere.
