<p>This is the first study to explore contexts, experiences and perspectives of both HCP and patients regarding hepatitis screening, care and treatment in Yaoundé, Cameroon, where HBV and HCV are endemic. Our findings demonstrated that in this setting, hepatitis screening does not necessarily translate into access to care and treatment, mainly because of unaffordable related costs. Four major challenges to screening and diagnosing hepatitis B and hepatitis C emerged from the patients’ and HCP interviews. First, very often, hepatitis infection is discovered in difficult circumstances, when patients have already started to experience diseases symptoms or following a blood donation for a hospitalised family member. In both situations, the cumulative emotional and financial difficulties hamper patients from making sense of the diagnosis. Second, patients are not provided adequate information or counselling on risk factors and preventive measures including vaccination of relatives. This results in inadequate and stigmatising prevention practices, both from an epidemiological and clinical point of view. Little information and counselling about the chronic nature and severity of their disease and about treatment options also strongly affected patients psychologically. Third, in Cameroon, a positive diagnosis immediately leads to enormous out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures related to the pretherapeutic check-up, which is prescribed to assess the disease stage and decide whether treatment is needed. These tests cost between €220 and €440, that is, approximately two to four times the monthly Cameroonian per capita GDP,

Fourth, diagnosis of chronic hepatitis translates into having to cope with an infection, and produces a rupture in a person’s life trajectory. In this study, most patients interviewed were representative of the lower-middle socioeconomic class in Yaoundé: their income was irregular, coming from activities in the informal sector and they had no health insurance. The OOP expenditures required to perform pretherapeutic assessments were so high that they had detrimental consequences on all their life projects, like weddings, childbearing, education and business development. They also contributed to increase the patients’ social dependence and economic vulnerability, many risking poverty and debt and being obliged to sell their assets and/or to rely on the financial support of their social network.
