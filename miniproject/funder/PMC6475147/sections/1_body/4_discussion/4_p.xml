<p>This study has limitations. It was only conducted in Yaoundé and thus may not reflect what happens elsewhere in Cameroon, especially in rural areas. However, we can hypothesise that challenges to care access are even more severe there, as most specialists including gastroenterologists are located in Yaoundé and in Douala. In addition, the study took place in 2014 before the 2016 announcement by the Cameroonian ministry of Health about the availability of DAA.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Since then, DAA costs have substantially decreased. However, as previously seen, challenges related to access to pretherapeutic tests and to treatment are still relevant today given that current treatment prices are still far above the financial capacity of the population.
