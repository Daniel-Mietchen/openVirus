 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Most countries in the region lack national hepatitis prevention and treatment programmes. Vaccination against HBV is included in immunisation programmes but coverage is poor.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Immunisation at birth, which is now recommended to reduce vertical transmission, has only been adopted in a few countries.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Screening is suboptimal and late diagnosis (ie, when symptoms appear) is extremely frequent.
