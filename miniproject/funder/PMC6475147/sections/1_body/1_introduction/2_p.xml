<p>HBV and HCV are bloodborne infections but their main routes of transmission in sub-Saharan Africa differ.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> HBV is mainly transmitted at birth from mother to child (vertical transmission), during childhood through contact with infected blood (horizontal transmission) or through sexually (exchange of body fluids) or unsafe medical practices. HCV is mainly contracted parenterally through blood transfusion, unsafe medical practices and drug injection.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> HBV and HCV disease progression leads to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Antiviral treatments for HBV (eg, tenofovir) and direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for HCV can control viral replication, prevent disease-associated complications and even cure HCV.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Antiviral treatment for pregnant women living with chronic HBV infection is also required to prevent vertical transmission.
