<p>Our phylogeographic analysis found that these viral migrations of HIV across the border stemmed from recently formed putative transmission clusters (TMRCAs between 2000 and 2010), suggesting ongoing cross-border transmission. Although the bidirectional migration we inferred is based on our focused sampling of high risk groups along the border in Tijuana, this observed viral flow also demonstrates the importance of transmission in this area to the predominantly MSM epidemic in central San Diego. The impact of policies and demographic shifts on this mixing needs to further elucidated, but it remains clear that the HIV epidemic on one side of the border remains important to at-risk communities on the other side.</p>
