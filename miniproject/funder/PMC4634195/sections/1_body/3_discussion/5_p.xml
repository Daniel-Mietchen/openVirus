<p>As expected the majority of our putative transmission clusters were predominantly males who were MSM, since the majority of participants were from HIV research programs focused on the MSM population of San Diego. However, in transmission clusters comprised predominantly of heterosexuals, there was a predominance of females. This lack of males in putatively inferred transmission clusters has been demonstrated previously (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Hue et al., 2014</xref>). Although injection drug use could lead to femaleâ€“female transmission, unidentified infected male contacts of our sampled FSW are likely to be involved in these transmission clusters. Identification of these men will require different recruitment methods than those currently being used and underscores the importance of identifying and testing partners of high-risk individuals.
