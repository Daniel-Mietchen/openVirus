<p>This cross-border molecular epidemiologic study has several limitations, the most important of which is sampling bias. Different methodologies were used to collect data across the different studies ranging from respondent driven sampling (Detection of HIV in Latinos, El Cuete, SD PIRC, and STAHR (

 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2014</xref>)), time location sampling (El Cuete and STAHR-II), partner identification (Amigos, SD PIRC), and convenience sampling (Hombre Seguro, Amigos, Proyecto Parejas, Mujer Segura and Mujer MÃ¡s Segura, STAHR and STAHR-II). Variations in the depth of sampling across the region and collection of risk factor data also likely contributed to the study's overall sampling bias. A more comprehensive sample of the infected population in the border region would likely have resulted in more putatively identified transmission links, a higher rate of overall clustering, and a improved understanding of viral migration across the border. Despite this limitation, this study was large and demonstrated linkage of transmission networks across different risk groups and geographically separate populations in the border region. Sampling across risk groups in the Tijuana border region also highlighted the role of such unique geographic areas in bridging transmissions across risk groups, and suggests the need for future research that is attentive to how social, sexual, and drug use networks interact with the built environment. Finally, this analysis highlights the potential usefulness of continuous molecular epidemiologic monitoring of HIV transmission networks, specifically by: 1) providing information about which sexual and PWID networks contribute disproportionately to new infections, and 2) identifying which important socio-demographic or risk groups might be missed in current identification strategies, resulting in improved targeting of prevention efforts.
