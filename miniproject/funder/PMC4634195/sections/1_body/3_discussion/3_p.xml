<p>Given the estimated size of the HIV infected populations of San Diego (~ 12,000) (

 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Brouwer et al., 2006</xref>), our bi-national dataset of 1106 unique viral sequences represented approximately 7% of infected individuals in the border region, and up to 12% of newly diagnosed infections in San Diego County (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">County of San Diego HaHSA, 2012</xref>). Although our analysis focused on the 843 sequence with associated demographic data collected from ten separate studies, each of which employed a different recruitment approach and was focused on a specific population (geographically and/or by risk factor), we still were able to obtain and include data across risk groups and geography. Although only 7.2% of our sequences were obtained from individuals residing in Tijuana, we identified 14 putative transmission clusters involving individuals from Tijuana and five clusters involving individuals reporting residence on both sides of the border. These cross-border clusters had higher proportions of females and heterosexuals than the rest of the transmission clusters, with &gt; 50% of members participating in transactional sex. This observation highlights the importance of the sex trade in HIV transmission across the region's border. Interestingly, two of the four cross border clusters included PWID from Tijuana and clients of female sex workers (FSW) from San Diego. Given that the focus of sampling in Tijuana was in high-risk FSW and PWID, this finding underscores the importance red light districts as a “melting pot” for risk groups, resulting in the bridging of different types of transmission networks.
