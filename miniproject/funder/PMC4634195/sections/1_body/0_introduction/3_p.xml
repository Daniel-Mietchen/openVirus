<p>HIV is another important infectious disease with high potential for transmission along the San Diego–Tijuana border. The large migrant population and the border have fostered a thriving market for quasi-legal prostitution, which is permitted by Mexican authorities in a “tolerance” zone (aka 
 <italic>Zona Roja</italic>), which is walking distance (&lt; 200 m) from the border with the US (
