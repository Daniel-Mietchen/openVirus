<p>Of all clustering individuals, 21.5% contained at least one member with a drug resistance mutation in their 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence, similar to the prevalence of drug resistance among the entire cohort (22.1%). All clustering remained even when codons associated with drug resistance mutations were stripped from the sequences. The presence of any drug resistance mutation was more common in members of San Diego only clusters (p = 0.007). A third of clusters included at least one individual with drug resistant virus. Twenty-five clusters (18.1%) had two or more individuals sharing one or more drug resistance mutations, accounting for 78.0% of the clustering individuals with resistance. The most common drug resistance mutation was K103N, which was represented in 11.5% of entire cohort and 10.9% of clustering individuals, and is similar to the prevalence of K103N seen in newly infected individuals in San Diego (
