<p>Using phylogeographic methods, we then inferred the time of most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the cross border clusters. First, we created time-scale phylogenetic trees using sub-samples of our sequences using the BEAST software package (
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Drummond &amp; Rambaut, 2007</xref>) (
 <xref rid="ec0015" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The mean estimated TMRCA of these clusters is reported in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, along with the structure of that particular cluster. Next, we used our time-scaled phylogenetic tree to reconstruct HIV migration patterns over time. Although limited by sampling, our results were consistent with historical observations that suggested earlier in the epidemic (1990s), most HIV infections in Tijuana were imported from San Diego (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Valdespino-Gomez et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, our data suggest that there have been more viral migrations from Tijuana to San Diego more recently (2000s), but considerable overlap in the movement of these epidemics remains (
