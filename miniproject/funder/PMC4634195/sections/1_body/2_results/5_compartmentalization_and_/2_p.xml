<p>Similar to our previous reports (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2010</xref>), we found significant compartmentalization between the sampled HIV epidemics in San Diego and Tijuana (Fst 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nevertheless, of the 14 clusters that included individuals from Tijuana, five of these clusters included individuals who lived in San Diego. These international transmission clusters represent HIV transmission crossing the San Diego-Tijuana border. The four cross-border clusters with available demographic information had a significantly higher proportion of females (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), heterosexuals (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), and PWID (p = 0.009), as compared to clusters containing individuals only from either San Diego or Tijuana (Supplementary Table 6); differences were not seen with transactional sex or syphilis infection. Interestingly, in three of these four clusters, the members that were San Diego residents were enrolled in Tijuana.
