<p>Overall, 138 HIV putative transmission clusters were identified (ranging in size from 2 to 23 individuals), including 52 clusters that included three or more individuals (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). When we evaluated the socio-demographic characteristics of the 120 clusters that had those data available for more than one individual, we found five clusters composed predominantly of females, including two clusters in which only females were identified. Predominantly female clusters were mostly comprised of individuals living in Mexico. Concerning reported risk, nine clusters contained predominantly PWID, and these were significantly more likely to include bisexual males (

Of the 120 clusters with sexual risk data on at least two individuals, 12 (10%) were predominantly comprised of heterosexuals, including six clusters in which the only reported risk factor was heterosexual risk. Interestingly, five heterosexual predominant clusters were comprised mainly of females, including one large cluster (n = 7) where 86% individuals were female. Of the remaining 108 clusters, 77 (71%) were predominately composed of MSM. The larger clusters did not differ from the smaller clusters in terms of sex, sexual orientation risk, transactional sex, or country of residence, but trended towards having fewer individuals with syphilis (p = 0.078) and fewer PWID (
