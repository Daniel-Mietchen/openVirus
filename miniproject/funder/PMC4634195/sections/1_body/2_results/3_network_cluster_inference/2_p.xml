<p>Putative transmission connections were inferred for 38.2% (423/1106) of the sequences sampled (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The likelihood that an individual clustered with at least one other individual did not differ by ethnicity, residence, or sex in our study cohort. Bisexuals were less likely to cluster than heterosexuals or MSM (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.043), and individuals identifying as white (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) were more likely to cluster than other races. Age was also significantly associated with clustering: the mean age of clustered individuals (32.8 years) was 3.5 years younger than non-clustered individuals (36.3 years) (p &lt; 0.001) (
