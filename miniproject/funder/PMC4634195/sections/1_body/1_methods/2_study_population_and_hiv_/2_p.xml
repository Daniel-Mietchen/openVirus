<p>The study population consisted of HIV-1 infected individuals drawn from ten studies located in the San Diego–Tijuana border region (n = 845) (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Supplementary Tables 1 &amp; 2). Subjects from the San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium (SD PIRC) were diagnosed and had sampling during acute or early infection, as previously described (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Le et al., 2013</xref>). Subjects from all other studies were sampled at an unknown point during their infection. Partial HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences for all samples were obtained directly from the primary study or were obtained by sequencing of the HIV-1 (
 <italic>prot</italic>/
 <italic>rt</italic>) from RNA or DNA extracted from banked blood samples (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Howlett et al., 2013</xref>). Only individuals who had a sequence available were included in the study. For individuals with sequences from multiple time points, only the sequence obtained from the earliest time point was included. When available, demographic, geographic and clinical data were collected from each study database of the participating program. This information was also used to screen genetically-linked individuals from different studies to ensure that the same person was not sampled twice.
