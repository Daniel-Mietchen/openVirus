<p>To better understand the role of the San Diego–Tijuana border on HIV transmission networks, we evaluated the characteristics of the putative transmission clusters including individuals on both sides of the border. We also evaluated the relatedness of the epidemics in San Diego and Tijuana using estimates of population structure (

We next applied phylogeographic analysis to evaluate the spatiotemporal dynamics of HIV migration between San Diego and Tijuana by analyzing sampled sequences in conjunction with background subtype B sequences obtained from the HIV Sequence Database at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (
