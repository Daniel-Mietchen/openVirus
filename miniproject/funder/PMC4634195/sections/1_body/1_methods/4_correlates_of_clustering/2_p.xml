<p>A standardized data extraction form was used to map variables from each participating study to a common set of variables used in this study. Extracted data was incorporated into a unified database of socio-demographic, clinical, geographic, and viral sequence data from all participating studies. The database was then hand-curated to ensure variables were translated and mapped appropriately and consistently. Given the variety of studies comprising the dataset and the differing goals associated with each of the participating studies, significant variation in the amount and type of data collected occurred between studies. Demographic information and clinical data collected included age, sex, self-reported race/ethnicity, and HIV risk factor(s) for all subjects. Additional data, including clinical information (e.g. CD4 T cell count, viral load, estimated date of infection [EDI], sexually transmitted infections [STI]), behavioral information (e.g. type and frequency of injection drug use, type and frequency of sexual activity), and geographic information varied in availability by study (

An individual was denoted to have heterosexual risk behavior, if he or she only reported sex only with the opposite gender. An individual was denoted to have bisexual risk behavior if he reported sex with both males and females; all bisexuals in this study were male.
