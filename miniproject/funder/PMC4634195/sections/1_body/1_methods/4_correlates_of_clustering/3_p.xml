<p>To identify possible correlates of clustering, the socio-demographic characteristics of infected individuals whose viral sequences clustered were compared to non-clustering individuals. We also evaluated these factors in relation to cluster size, comparing large clusters (&gt;Â 3 members) to small clusters. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were evaluated using
