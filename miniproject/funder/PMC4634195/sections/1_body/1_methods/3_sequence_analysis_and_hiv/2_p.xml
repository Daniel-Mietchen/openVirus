<p>All sequences that were not duplicated, contaminated or hypermutated by APOBEC were included in a single database, leaving 843 eligible sequences (
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Rose &amp; Korber, 2000</xref>). An additional 263 sequences obtained from unique chronically infected individuals in San Diego but without associated socio-demographic data were included in the analysis to enhance detection of putative transmission clusters. All sequences were subtyped using SCUEAL (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2009</xref>). Sequences were analyzed for genetic relatedness using a pairwise distance comparison using the Tamura-Nei 93 evolutionary model to correct for substitution biases and the unequal base composition found in HIV (
