<p>Putative transmission clusters were inferred by establishing linkage when two sequences had a Tamura-Nei 93 genetic distance (D) ≤ 1.5% separating them. This threshold is standard in the field, and was selected based on previous work from our group showing that within a mono-infected person, 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences typically do not diverge more than 1% from baseline over a decade (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hightower et al., 2013</xref>). Putative transmission clusters included all connected nodes such that all nodes (individuals) within a cluster would have a D of &lt; 1.5% from at least one other node in the cluster, but not necessarily within 1.5% of all nodes within the cluster.
