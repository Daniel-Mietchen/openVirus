  <p>Time-scaled phylogenetic reconstruction. A time-scaled maximum clade credibility tree was inferred using the BEAST software package. The putative origin of each internal sequence (i.e. internal node) in the tree is inferred with the Fitch algorithm. A change in color between two branches connected by a node represents a migration event from one nation to another that occurred during the ancestral evolution of the branches of that node. Tips are inferred and locations of internal branches are labeled as SD (San Diego): Blue, TJ (Tijuana): Red. Time scale is indicated in years.</p>
