  <p>Posterior probability density for the timing of HIV migration between San Diego and Tijuana. Using our available sequences, this plot extrapolates viral migration from the 1980s through 2014, and suggests that viral migration from San Diego to Tijuana was more likely during the 1990s, while viral migration from Tijuana to San Diego was more likely most recently, albeit there is considerable overlap in both directions.</p>
