<p>Data will be captured on study-specific password-protected eCRF on tablets located in the Lassa isolation ward. The PI will be responsible for accuracy of the data. Participantsâ€™ data will only be linked to the unique identifier to ensure pseudonymity. The database will be made accessible only to dedicated staff from the institutions involved in the study. Biological samples and information will be stored for 10 years after the study results have been published. Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be given to officials from ethics committees, regulatory authorities and from the sponsor for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the electronic database are consistent with the original source data. The research data will not be kept in the medical records of the patients. This would breach with confidentiality of data. Only exception: if results of the study parameters (eg, biochemical analysis) may have implication for clinical care of research participants, a copy will be provided to the responsible physician and the test result will be made available for routine care and kept in the medical records. The study identifier of this copy will be erased manually</p>
