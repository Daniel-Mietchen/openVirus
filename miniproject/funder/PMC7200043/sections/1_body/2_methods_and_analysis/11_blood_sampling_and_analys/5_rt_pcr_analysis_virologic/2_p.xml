<p>Assays such as ELISA and/or immunofluorescence assays will be used to determine LASV-specific IgM and IgG, as well as further IgG subclassification, and to monitor the development of LASV-specific antibodies in blood. Viral growth, isolation of LASV in cell culture, virus sequencing and unbiased metagenomic sequencing will be used to study the longitudinal impact of drug treatment (ribavirin) on LASV genomes. Sequence analysis shall be done at both ISTH and BNITM.</p>
