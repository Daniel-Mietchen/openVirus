<p>In particular, we will analyse the changes in ribavirin concentration and haemoglobin levels, ALT/GPT and uric acid. These are prognostic markers for survival, for metabolism of ribavirin and for potential side effects and toxicity (eg, haemolysis). For that purpose, a PK/tolerance model will be developed in order to relate the effect of the drugs on changes in longitudinal biological parameters as described previously for ribavirin in patients with HCV.
