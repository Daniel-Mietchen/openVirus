<p>The PI is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained from each participant and obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures. The investigator shall explain to each study participant the nature of the study, its objective, the procedures involved, its risks and potential benefits and any discomfort it may generate.
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This investigator is independent from the standard of care treatment of research participants. The participant will sign on the informed consent sheet after having read and voluntarily agreed to it. Where the participant is unable to read, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion. After inclusion, the participant may elect to withdraw from the study when he/she so wishes. The same level of attention will be dispensed to that individual. The investigator shall obtain from the participant a signed (fingerprint and signature from a witness for participants unable to read and write), written consent. If informed consent is not obtained, the patient will not be enrolled. If during the course of the research project new information become available about the treatment/the disease that is being studied, the investigator will tell the participant about it and discuss with him/her whether he/she wants to continue in the research project. If the participant decides to withdraw, the investigator will make arrangements for the regular healthcare to continue. If the participants decide to continue in the research project, he/she will be asked to sign an updated consent form.
