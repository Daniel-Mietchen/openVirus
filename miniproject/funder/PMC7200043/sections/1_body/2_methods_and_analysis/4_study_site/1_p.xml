<p>The Lassa Unit of the ISTH in Edo State is one of the three operating LF case management centres with an adjacent laboratory that conducts PCR testing.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is a referral hospital serving 19 local governmental areas in an LF endemic zone and one of the few hospitals in West Africa that feature facilities for diagnosis, research and treatment of LF. The Institute of Lassa fever Research and Control at ISTH performs molecular LF diagnostics on a daily basis since 2008. An LF clinic for appropriate patient management was commissioned in 2010. Up to 2000 suspected patients are tested each year of which 100â€“200 test positive for LASV. Most of them are treated at the ISTH Lassa ward. BNITM and ISTH established a Training and Clinical Trial Center that features laboratory facilities for Good Clinical Laboratory Practice conform processing of samples from clinical studies, including real-time RT-PCR for virus load monitoring, serology and sequencing. These facilities shall be further upgraded and used for this study.
