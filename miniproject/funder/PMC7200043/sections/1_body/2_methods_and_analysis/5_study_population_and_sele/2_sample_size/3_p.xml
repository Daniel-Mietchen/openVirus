<p>To evaluate the potential link between PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) (viral kinetics) in the exploratory analysis, the model used in the SSE was extended by an assumed PD component (ribavirin stimulating a first-order decay of viral load). Daily sampling (where coinciding with the safety assessment, otherwise every other day as outlined in the study flow chart) of viral load will allow to detect even weak exposure response relations. For example, a ribavirin-induced decline in viral load with a viral elimination half-life of 480â€‰hours compared with no effect assuming high interpatient variability in PD response of 70% and a PD measurement error of 30% will be detectable at a power of 99% with adequate accuracy (absolute relative bias &lt;17.3 %) and imprecision (&lt;33.2%).</p>
