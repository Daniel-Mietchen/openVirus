<p>Recruitment of patients and inclusion in the study will be performed at the study centre during the consultation on day 0 by an investigator who is not involved in the standard of care treatment of the patients. Vulnerable patients such as pregnant women and minors will be excluded from the research because they should not be exposed to the additional burden of drawing more blood than necessary. Cognitively impaired patients will be excluded because they cannot make an informed consent about the study participation. Furthermore, children and pregnant women do not receive ribavirin intravenously but orally and are therefore not eligible for enrolment. Patients who fulfil selection criteria are eligible and will be proposed to participate. The patients will be informed in writing and orally about the study and they will have time to address possible questions to the investigator. They will have time to consider their participation in the study. Inclusion will follow the provision of voluntary written informed consent of the patient or the impartial witness in case of illiteracy.</p>
