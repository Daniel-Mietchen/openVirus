<p>Data derived from this observational study will serve as basis for further clinical studies studying the efficacy and safety of ribavirin and provide the possibility to compare the Irrua regimen with alternative treatment candidates such as favipiravir and possible combination regimen of favipiravir and ribavirin. This will serve as basis for further dose optimisation of ribavirin helping to further ameliorate the management of patients with LF in the endemic regions. This work is thus an important cornerstone for the development and implementation of a treatment standard and evidence-based treatment recommendations for LF.</p>
