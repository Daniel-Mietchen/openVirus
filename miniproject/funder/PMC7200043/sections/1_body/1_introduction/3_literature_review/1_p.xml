<p>The only drug with a proven therapeutic effect in humans with LF is the broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue ribavirin. Ribavirin reduces replication of LASV at concentrations between 10 and 50 µg/mL in cell culture, and shows efficacy in LASV-infected monkeys.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref> Initiation of treatment within 5 days after inoculation protected all monkeys, while initiation of treatment at day 7 conferred only partial protection. In treated animals, viraemia developed more slowly and peaked at lower titres than in untreated controls.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 17</xref> The mode of action of ribavirin against LASV is not clear. Recently, it has been shown with other RNA viruses that ribavirin can be incorporated into the RNA strand leading to lethal mutagenesis of progeny genomes.
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> It is assumed that, if the mutation rate is too high, the genetic information cannot be maintained and the virus population goes into extinction. This process is called lethal mutagenesis or error catastrophe.
