<p>One option to examine the vector competence is the separate analysis of the head and the salivary glands and the rest of the insect body. Virus detection in the salivary glands is a sign for a biological infection followed by virus dissemination, resulting in a potential virus transmission via saliva. Hence, virus detection in the salivary glands of an insect hints at true vector competence. On the other hand, detection of virus in the completely homogenized body of the insect may indicate just the ingestion of a viremic blood meal, which not necessarily leads to an infection of the insect.</p>
