<p>To evaluate vector competence in more detail, infection studies under laboratory conditions either with biting midges caught in the field or with laboratory-adapted colonies are a suitable method. Insects can be artificially infected by intrathoracic inoculation of virus directly into the hemolymph bypassing the intestinal (“gut”) barrier, or orally by feeding viremic blood. Subsequently, after an extrinsic incubation period, samples are collected from surviving individuals. The insects themselves could be examined as a whole or with head plus salivary glands and body separated as described above. Furthermore, saliva could be collected from individual insects and tested for infectious virus or viral genome. From the results, infection, dissemination and transmission rates are calculable [
