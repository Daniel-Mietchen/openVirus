<p>Vector competence refers to the physiological ability of arthropods to acquire and maintain microbial agents from a host, and later transmit them to the next susceptible host [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The mere virus detection in a midge does not necessarily indicate vector competence. A midge feeding on a viremic host can carry virus from the blood meal in its gut without being infected itself. However, it can subsequently serve as a so-called “mechanical vector” for virus transmission. To understand a disease and its epidemiology entirely, it is essential to distinguish biological (competent) from pure mechanical vectors.
