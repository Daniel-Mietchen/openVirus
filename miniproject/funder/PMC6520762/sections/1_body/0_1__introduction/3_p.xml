<p>Medically, one of the most highly important arthropod vectors is unquestionably mosquitoes. Nonetheless, further, sometimes neglected arthropods such as ticks or biting midges can also act as vectors of emerging disease agents [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, when a pathogen has been detected in a certain vector species, a thorough search for further putative vectors often remains undone. Furthermore, the mere demonstration of a pathogen in a blood-feeding arthropod is often mistaken as evidence for vector competence of that arthropod species without further experimental studies. Therefore, we want to summarize here knowledge about ceratopogonid-transmitted disease agents and their impact on human and animal health focusing on 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and the new viral order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, which contains the largest and most diverse families of RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this review, we illuminate the general impact of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges, an often-neglected insect vector, but primarily, we present evidence of their role in the transmission of selected orthobunyaviruses of public health or veterinary importance.
