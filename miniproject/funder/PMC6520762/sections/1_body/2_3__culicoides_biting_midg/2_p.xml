 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges are among the most abundant hematophagous insects worldwide, occurring from temperate areas to the tropics. Representing one of the smallest hematophagous flies, they measure only 1â€“3 mm [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Their mouthparts form a proboscis well adapted for cutting skin and sucking blood. Wings are well developed, and biting midges are commonly identified to complex or species level based on the wing maculation [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this method of identification is very time consuming and depends on the professional experience of the examiner. Alternative methods use genome amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic comparison of DNA marker regions [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a DNA microarray was developed to identify 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species of the obsoletus group [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been used to identify 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species based on peptide and protein signatures [
