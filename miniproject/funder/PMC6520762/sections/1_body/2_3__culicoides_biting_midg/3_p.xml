<p>The life cycle of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>, which passes through the egg stage, four larval stages, a pupa, and the imago, requires a certain amount of free water or moisture, and some species occur in both fresh water and estuarine environments. Breeding sites range from pools, streams, tree holes to saturated soil, animal dung and rotting vegetation [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Females depend on blood for the maturation of the eggs; they feed, depending on the species, on mammals and/or birds. Males do not feed on blood, and can survive on nectar alone. The development of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species takes a few weeks—or even months, when overwintering in a larval stage—and this process depends on the ambient temperatures, resulting in a seasonal activity pattern in temperate regions. In mild climatic zones, the insect numbers start to increase in late spring and early summer and usually peak in late summer or early autumn [
