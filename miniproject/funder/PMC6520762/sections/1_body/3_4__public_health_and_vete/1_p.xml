<p>Biting midge bites can cause painful lesions; in some cases, the saliva even induces acute allergic reactions such as the “common summer eczema (insect hypersensitivity)” in horses [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, their veterinary or public health importance predominantly results from their role in the transmission of pathogens, especially viruses, but also protozoans and filarial parasites [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] such as avian hamosporidians [
