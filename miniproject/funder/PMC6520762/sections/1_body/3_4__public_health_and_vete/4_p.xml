<p>Because of the needs of their agentsâ€™ vectors, 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne diseases are strongly linked to climate and weather. In temperate regions, the seasonal pattern of virus transmission coincides with warm, moist summer and autumn months. In tropical and subtropical regions, high vertebrate infection rates have been reported during wet summer and declining transmission rates in periods of lower rainfall [
