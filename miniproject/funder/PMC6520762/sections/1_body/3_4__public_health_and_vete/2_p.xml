<p>Surveillance on biting midges and biting midge-borne diseases is carried out in various countries of several continents. As an example, the distribution and potential spread of BTV is monitored by the collection of biting midges in virtually every affected European country, also to define e.g., a so-called “seasonally vector free” period. To sample the adult 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> population, light-suction traps placed at sentinel sites across outbreak areas are the most commonly used standardized trap system [

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> are available from Australia, comparing various types of light traps with different outcomes in biting midge catches [
