<p>The establishment of laboratory colonies poses great difficulties, especially because field-collected specimens fail to mate under laboratory conditions. So far, very few 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species have been successfully reared under laboratory conditions [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and, consequently, are available for studies on their vector competence. Most laboratory colonies represent 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic>, rendering these two species important models for studying arbovirus transmission by 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Due to difficulties in acquiring biting midges from the field for laboratory studies caused by the characteristics of the insects, the major part of data available on experimental infections pertain to 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic>.
