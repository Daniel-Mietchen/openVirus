<p>In general, orthobunyaviruses are spherical, about 100 nm in diameter and relatively simple in their composition as the tri-partite RNA genome encodes only four structural and two non-structural proteins. The small (S) genomic segment encodes for the nucleocapsid protein N and the non-structural protein NSs, while the medium (M) segment encodes for the glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which form spikes on the surface of the virus particle, and the non-structural protein NSm. The large (L) segment encodes for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase [
