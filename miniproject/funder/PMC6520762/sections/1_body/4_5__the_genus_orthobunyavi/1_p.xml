<p>Only recently, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) made some fundamental changes in the taxonomy of the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>, which had been established in 2017 to accommodate viruses with linear, segmented, single-stranded RNA genome [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In early 2019, the order was taxonomically revised by creating several new families, subfamilies, genera, and species. As of February 2019, the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> consists of 46 genera assigned to 12 distinct families [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. One of the genera belonging to the newly established family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic> is the genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, which contains more than 170 unanimous insect-transmitted viruses in 18 serogroups, of which the Simbu serogroup is not only one of the largest, but also the most important in terms of veterinary public health. For human health, the California encephalitis serogroup is very likely the most relevant one as it contains, e.g., La Crosse virus (LACV).
