<p>In the California encephalitis serogroup of the genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, several zoonotic agents distributed in North America, Europe, Africa, or Asia can be found. However, for none of them 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp. have been demonstrated to be vector-competent. Since they are transmitted by mosquitoes between their vertebrate hosts, which range from small mammals to ungulates and humans, they are among the viruses that are referred to as “mobovirus” (= mosquito-borne viruses) [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Some of the most relevant representatives of zoonotic orthobunyaviruses include LACV, Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), Keystone virus (KEYV) and Ťahyňa virus (TAHV).
