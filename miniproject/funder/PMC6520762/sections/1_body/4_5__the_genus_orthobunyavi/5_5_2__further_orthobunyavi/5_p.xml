<p>TAHV is endemic in Asia and throughout Africa and represents the first mobovirus pathogenic to humans found in Europe [
 <xref rid="B130-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. It may induce a febrile illness referred to as Valtice fever, which occurs mainly in children and is characterized by influenza-like symptoms. In rare cases, it may cause meningitis or atypical pneumonia [
 <xref rid="B159-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Vertebrate hosts other than humans are small mammals such as rabbits or hedgehogs [

 <xref rid="B161-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Arthropod vectors are most likely mosquitoes of the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>; however, experimental vector competence studies are again missing. Originally, TAHV was isolated from 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic> mosquitoes in the villages Ťahyňa and Križany, Czechoslovakia [
 <xref rid="B162-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Following its initial discovery, TAHV has been isolated from several mosquito species such as 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes cantans</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes caspius</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes sticticus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes diantaeus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes hexodontus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex pipien</italic>s and
