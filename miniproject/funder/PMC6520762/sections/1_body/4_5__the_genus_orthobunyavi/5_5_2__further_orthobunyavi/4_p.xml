<p>KEYV is distributed on the east coast of North America from Florida, where the virus was firstly discovered in 1964 from 
 <italic>Aedes atlanticus</italic> in Keystone [
 <xref rid="B151-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], up to Maryland in the north and Texas in the west. Vertebrate hosts seem to be mammals such as squirrels, raccoons, and white-tailed deer [

 <xref rid="B153-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>,
 <xref rid="B154-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], while the main insect vectors are mosquitoes such as 
 <italic>Aedes atlanticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B155-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>], various 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. (e.g., 
 <italic>vexans</italic>, 
 <italic>tiseriatus</italic>, 
 <italic>taeniorhynchus</italic>, 
 <italic>infirmatus</italic>, 
 <italic>canadensis</italic>), and some 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B156-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In humans, antibodies against KEYV have been repeatedly detected [
 <xref rid="B157-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>], and the virus itself was isolated from individuals showing clinical symptoms such as fever and rash [
