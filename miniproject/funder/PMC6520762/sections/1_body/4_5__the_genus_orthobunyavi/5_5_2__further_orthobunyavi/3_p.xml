<p>Similar to LACV, JCV has a wide geographical distribution throughout North America and causes a mild febrile illness or central nervous system infections inducing meningitis or meningoencephalitis in humans [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. However, in contrast to LACV, which is associated with clinical disease in children, JCV induces symptoms also in adults. White-tailed deer and other ungulates are considered the primary vertebrate hosts [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The first virus isolation succeeded from a pool of 
 <italic>Aedes abserratus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Since then, JCV has been found in varying but great numbers of different species of Culicidae (
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Culiseta</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic> spp.) and Tabanidae (
 <italic>Chrysops</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Hybomitra</italic> spp.) [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. In the US state of Connecticut, the predominant vector species seems to be 
 <italic>Aedes canadensis</italic>, while in northeastern New York and in Michigan, JCV is predominantly transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes provocans</italic> [

 <xref rid="B147-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes intrudens</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes abserratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes punctor</italic> seem to be important vectors in Massachusetts [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>], 
 <italic>Aedes stimulans</italic> in northern Indiana [
 <xref rid="B149-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], and 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> in North Dakota [
