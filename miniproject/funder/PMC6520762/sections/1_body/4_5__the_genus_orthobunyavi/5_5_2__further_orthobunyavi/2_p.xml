<p>LACV, the most pathogenic agent within the California encephalitis serogroup, is the causative agent of the so-called “rural encephalitis” in the Appalachian and midwestern regions of North America and the leading cause of pediatric arboviral encephalitis. Clinical symptoms of an LACV-infection include headache, fever, myalgia, and encephalitis, while in rare cases fatalities may occur (reviewed in [

Within the natural infection cycle between small mammals and mosquito vectors, humans are considered as dead-end hosts, meaning that the virus is not transmitted from humans to blood-feeding insects and that, consequently, the transmission chain ends in human beings [

 <xref rid="B135-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] this mosquito species, which is native to North America, is considered the main insect vector. Furthermore, LACV has been isolated from the invasive Asian tiger mosquito
