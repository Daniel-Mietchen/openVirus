<p>The glycoproteins Gn and Gc are integral transmembrane proteins which are important for viral attachment, membrane fusion and the induction of the hostâ€™s immune response [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The N-protein is essential for viral RNA transcription and replication, and it forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with the three viral RNA segments. These complexes are associated with the L-protein [

 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The NSs-protein is a major virulence factor in vertebrate hosts as it acts as an interferon antagonist and is responsible for the shut-off of protein synthesis in mammalian hosts cells [
