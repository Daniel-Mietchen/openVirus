<p>Unfortunately, for the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex, which consists of the species 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. chiopterus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. montanus</italic> and is considered to contain the major vectors of SBV in temperate European countries, laboratory colonies are not available. However, experimental laboratory infection studies were carried out with field-collected individuals of the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex and with 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, which, according to field data, is considered the main vector in the Mediterranean. Both, i.e., midges of the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex and 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, showed high infection rates and virus dissemination [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], confirming the assumptions of their vector competence, and field-collected 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> were able to replicate SBV to a potentially transmissible level [
