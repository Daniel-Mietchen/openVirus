<p>SBV emerged in late 2011 in the German/Dutch border region [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and is now endemic in most European countries [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. It predominantly infects ruminants, causing a mild, transient disease in adult animals, but it may induce severe fetal malformation when na√Øve dams are infected during a critical period of pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Based on its close relationship to AKAV, it was assumed that 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> act as vectors also for SBV and, indeed, SBV genome was subsequently detected in field-collected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges of various species repeatedly throughout Europe [
