<p>In temperate European countries, biting midges of the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> complex are considered the main vectors, while in Mediterranean countries 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. punctatus</italic> seem to significantly contribute to virus transmission. Viral genome was also detected in 
 <italic>C. dewulfi, C. pulicaris, C. newsteadi, C. lupicaris,</italic> and 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> by (real-time) RT-PCR [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. To underpin the findings in field-collected biting midges with experimental data, several vector competence studies were carried out. The Nearctic species 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic> was infected orally and intrathoracically. The detection of viral genome after an extrinsic incubation period in the saliva and the isolation of infectious virus from the head proved dissemination of SBV within the insect organism [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and demonstrated that 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic> is a suitable laboratory model for SBV. Furthermore, from these infected individuals, a range of Cq-values from decapitated heads (including salivary glands) was available to compare with those produced from heads of field-collected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>. The values provided for field-collected 
 <italic>C. obsoletus, C. scoticus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. chiopterus</italic> from the Netherlands were very similar to those obtained from the laboratory infections, indicating that these species act as true vectors [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. In contrast, multiple infection studies with laboratory colonies of 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> showed only low infection rates, although viral genome was detected in field-collected 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> [
