<p>To investigate the vector competence of midges for AKAV, some experimental infection studies were carried out with different 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species. It could be demonstrated that AKAV replicates in 
 <italic>C. variipennis</italic> after oral infection for at least 9 days, while in 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic>, AKAV replicated only after intrathoracic inoculation [
 <xref rid="B101-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The extensive replication of AKAV within 
 <italic>C. variipennis</italic> suggests that 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp. can act as fully competent vectors. However, although 
 <italic>C. variipennis</italic> serving as a suitable surrogate model, this laboratory-adapted species is not the natural vector of the virus, as it is native to North America while AKAV is endemic in Asia, Africa, and Australia.
