<p>For Australia, the assumed main vector is 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], since it was demonstrated that AKAV replicates in 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic> to high virus titers and reaches the salivary glands after 10 days of incubation [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Furthermore, the virus has been isolated from 
 <italic>C. wadai</italic> in Australia [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In Japan, 
 <italic>C. oxystoma</italic> is considered the major vector [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], although AKAV was also isolated from the mosquito species 
 <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which are most likely no competent vectors. In the Middle East, 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> is probably the main vector responsible for virus circulation. In Israel, AKAV was repeatedly detected in this vector species by RT-PCR, and in Oman, the isolation of AKAV was possible from this culicoid species [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Also, throughout Africa, 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> seems to be an important vector of AKAV. The virus was isolated multiple times from 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], and in South Africa AKAV was detected in a pool of mixed 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp. mainly consisting of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Another vector could be 
 <italic>C. milnei</italic>, as AKAV was isolated from this species in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In Kenia, AKAV was isolated from 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], but true vector competence has not been demonstrated yet.
