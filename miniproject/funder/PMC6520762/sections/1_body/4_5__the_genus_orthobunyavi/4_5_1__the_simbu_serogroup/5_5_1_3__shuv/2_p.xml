<p>In South Africa, SHUV was recovered twice from pools of 
 <italic>Culex theileri</italic> [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. However, the mosquito taxa 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> biotype 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> showed only very low susceptibility to SHUV following intrathoracic inoculation. Oral infection was not possible under experimental conditions [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, 
 <italic>C. nubeculosus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic> could be orally infected, with the virus disseminating well in both species [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], indicating that 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges are more likely the natural vectors than mosquitoes.
