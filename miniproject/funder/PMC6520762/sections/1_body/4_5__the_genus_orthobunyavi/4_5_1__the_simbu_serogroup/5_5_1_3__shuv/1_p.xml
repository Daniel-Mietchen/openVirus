<p>SHUV was firstly isolated in Nigeria from healthy cattle [

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges and mosquitoes in Africa [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. In 2014, SHUV was for the first time detected outside of Africa, and was isolated from malformed lambs in Israel [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. In addition to typical Simbu virus-related congenital defects in cattle and sheep, SHUV may occasionally induce severe neurological symptoms in horses or cattle [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. A general zoonotic potential cannot be ruled out, since SHUV was isolated from a febrile child in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], and specific antibodies were found in large animal veterinarians in South Africa [
