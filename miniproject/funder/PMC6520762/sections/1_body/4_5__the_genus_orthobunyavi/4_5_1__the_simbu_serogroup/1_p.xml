<p>When considering only viruses evidentially transmitted by 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges, the Simbu serogroup is presumably the most important group within the genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>. Furthermore, its members are of great veterinary importance, as a variety of simbuviruses induces severe congenital infections in pregnant animals. The serogroup currently consists of 32 viruses grouped into 19 virus species (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00376-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Simbuviruses are distributed worldwide (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00376-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and they persist in nature by alternately infecting mammalian hosts and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vectors. In endemic regions, Simbu serogroup viruses establish a pattern of cyclic circulation, with seasons of high virus appearance followed by periods of only sporadic detection [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], which is presumably related to the overall immunity in the host population and the abundance of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vectors.
