 <xref rid="B123-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. With this zoonotic potential, OROV protrudes from the other viruses in the Simbu serogroup. In South and Central America, OROV occurs in a sylvatic cycle between its insect vectors, some wild bird species and mammals such as rodents, sloths and non-human primates as amplifying hosts (
