<p>In the urban cycle, the biting midge species 
 <italic>C. paraensis</italic> and the mosquito 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> are believed to be the main vectors. Although the isolation rate from 
 <italic>C. paraensis</italic> during epidemics is low, its involvement as a vector is suggested based on transmission studies, where 
 <italic>C. paraensis</italic> transmitted OROV to hamsters five or more days after feeding on blood of viremic patients [
