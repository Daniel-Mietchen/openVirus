<p>Important representatives of the Simbu serogroup are AKAV and SBV, which predominantly infect ruminants. Infections of adults are either asymptomatic or mild, associated with fever, diarrhea, and decrease in milk yield for a few days. Infections of na√Øve dams during a critical phase of gestation, however, may be followed by abortion, premature birth, mummification, stillbirth or congenital deformations referred to as arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome [
