<p>There are several additional members of veterinary importance within the Simbu serogroup (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00376-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which might induce the typical congenital malformation when na√Øve pregnant dams are infected. Unfortunately, vector competence studies are missing for most of them. However, in general, certain biting midge species are suspected to be able to transmit several members of the serogroup. As an example, field-collected 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic>, the major vector for AKAV in Australia, were tested positive for further Australian simbuviruses such as Douglas virus (DOUV) or Peaton virus (PEAV) [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> is the main vector of SBV or AKAV, also PEAV was found in this species [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], confirming the concept of certain 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species transmitting several simbuviruses present in the respective region.
