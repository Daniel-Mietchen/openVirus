<p>Since treatment options are not available for 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne arbovirus infections, other possibilities are discussed to prevent clinical disease in vertebrate hosts and virus spread into unaffected regions. Trading and movement restrictions are put in place for livestock and their products (e.g., semen, embryos) to reduce the risk of virus introductions into new areas [

 <xref rid="B103-viruses-11-00376" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne diseases with teratogenic effects such as AKAV, SBV, or SHUV, livestock-management measures could be effective. The mating period of livestock could be adjusted to avoid that na√Øve females are in the critical phase of pregnancy during the season of the highest biting midge activity. Another possibility is to ensure that dams acquire immunity before they conceive for the first time, which could be achieved by exposing the youngstock to potentially infected vectors. However, this concept requires a high number of infected insect organisms every year and a very high transmission rate of the virus from the vector to the vertebrate host to ensure that every young animal is bitten and infected. Hence, a much more reliable method to acquire immunity is by vaccination [

 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne disease can play a major role in reducing virus circulation or even in eradicating the disease from a given region [
