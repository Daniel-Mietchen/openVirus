<p id="Par48">With the occurrence of HIV-1 epidemics in Yunnan, HIV-1 genotypes have become more diverse. Our study revealed two subtypes, nine CRFs and six discrete URFs circulating in recent infections, among which CRF08_BC, CRF07_BC, URFs, and CRF01_AE were still the predominant strains. The distribution of the four predominant genotypes in the population was associated with demographic characteristics. The geographic distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in recent infections was further analysed at the county level. The four predominant genotypes demonstrated a clustering tendency in some geographic areas, which was confirmed by the spatial scan statistics. Some spatial clusters were associated with a specific transmission route. TDR-associated mutations remained low in recent infections. Our findings provide valuable information to improve strategies to prevent new infections.</p>
