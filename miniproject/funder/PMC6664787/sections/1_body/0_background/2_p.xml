<p id="Par18">Initially, subtype B and subtype C emerged among IDUs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and CRF01_AE was found among female sex workers (FSWs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the 1990s, CRF07_BC and CRF08_BC formed through the recombination of subtype B and subtype C, which were circulating among IDUs in Yunnan and transmitted along drug trafficking routes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Through the populations with the dual risk factors of intravenous drug use and heterosexual contact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], CRF08_BC and CRF07_BC emerged in the heterosexually transmitted population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the late 2000s, CRF08_BC became the chief HIV-1 genotype among both heterosexuals and IDUs, and the composition of HIV-1 genotypes was nearly the same in these two populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The first HIV-positive man who had sex with men (MSM) in Yunnan was reported in 2004. The surveillance showed that CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were the main strains among MSM, accounting for more than 90% of cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B were also detected in MSM in Yunnan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which were first identified among MSM in southern China and northeastern China, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, the spatial distribution of HIV-1 genotypes dynamically changed. The main HIV-1 genotypes spread from the original areas to other areas of Yunnan. For example, CRF01_AE was transmitted from western to eastern Yunnan, and CRF08_BC and CRF07_BC were transmitted from southeast of Yunnan to other areas.
