<p id="Par17">Since HIV-1 was first identified among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in western Yunnan in 1989, HIV-1 epidemics have dramatically increased in Yunnan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Yunnan is considered the HIV-1 gateway in China. Originating in Yunnan, different HIV-1 genotypes have spread to other parts of China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Over the past nearly 30 years, unprotected sexual contact has replaced intravenous drug injection as the predominant route of HIV-1 transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. By the end of 2014, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Yunnan was 80,610 (including 50,426 people living with HIV and 30,184 AIDS patients), which was the highest among all provinces in China. Among all PLWHA in Yunnan, 68.9% received antiretroviral therapy, which was higher than the national average (63.2%). Among the annual newly reported cases, the proportion of cases attributed to intravenous drug use decreased from 28.6% in 2009 to 9.3% in 2014; the proportion of heterosexually infected cases increased from 62.5% in 2009 to 85.1% in 2014, while the proportion of homosexually infected cases increased from 1.4% in 2009 to 4.3% in 2014.
