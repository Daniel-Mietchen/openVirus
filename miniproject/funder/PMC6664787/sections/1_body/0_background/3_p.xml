<p id="Par19">The genetic diversity of HIV-1 is striking in Yunnan. In addition to the abovementioned subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), a multitude of URFs were also detected in Yunnan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the late 2000s, the proportion of URFs ranked second only to that of CRF08_BC in recent infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These URFs contributed to the formation of novel CRFs. In recent years, at least nine CRFs were identified in western Yunnan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These CRFs consist of components from subtype B, subtype C and CRF01_AE. A respective phylogenetic study showed that some of these CRFs originated in the early 1990s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].
