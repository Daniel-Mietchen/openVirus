<p id="Par43">The demographic characteristics associated with HIV-1 genotypes were further analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Because heterosexual contact was the major transmission route (81.1%), the absolute numbers of the main genotypes in this transmission route were the largest. However, the proportions of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC in homosexual contact were higher than those in heterosexual contact and intravenous drug injection, while the proportion of CRF08_BC in homosexual contact was lower than those in the other two transmission routes. These findings suggested that the homosexually transmitted population remained relatively unique from the other two populations. The proportion of CRF08_BC was higher in females. The reason for this finding could be that the predominant transmission route among the female cases was heterosexual contact (95.8%, 160/167), and in this transmission route, CRF08_BC was the predominant HIV-1 genotype. Furthermore, combined with gender and transmission routes, the subjects were divided into five subgroups. The proportion of CRF08_BC was the highest in the subgroup of female heterosexual contact and the lowest in the subgroup of male homosexual contact (Additional file

We also found that the proportion of URFs among males was higher than that among females, that the proportion of URFs among non-Chinese was higher than that among Chinese. Usually, URFs were identified in dually or multiply infected individuals. This finding suggested that males and non-Chinese tended to have more complex risk factors. To fully understand HIV-1 genetic characteristics among non-Chinese, the further study should be carried out in the border areas.
