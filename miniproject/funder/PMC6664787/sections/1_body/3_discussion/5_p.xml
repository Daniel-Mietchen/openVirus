<p id="Par44">For the first time, we described the geographic distribution of HIV-1 genotypes among recent infections at the county level, which was more elaborate than the previous study at the prefecture level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Among the four predominant genotypes, the coverage of CRF08_BC was greater than those of CRF07_BC, URFs and CRF01_AE. However, the other genotypes were only found in one to six counties. In some areas, the four predominant genotypes displayed a clustering tendency. To reveal the spatial clustering characteristics, spatial scanning analysis was performed. There were two statistically significant spatial clusters for CRF08_BC, among which the most likely cluster was located in southeast Yunnan Province and bordered with Vietnam. Strikingly, more than 90% of observed cases in these two spatial clusters were infected through heterosexual contact, which suggested that more efforts for the prevention of heterosexual contact transmission should be taken in these areas.
