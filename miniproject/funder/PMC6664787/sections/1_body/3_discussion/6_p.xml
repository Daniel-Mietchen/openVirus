<p id="Par45">Among the two statistically significant clusters for CRF01_AE, the most likely cluster in Dali Prefecture and the second secondary cluster in Kunming and Yuxi Prefecture were largely composed of the cases infected through homosexual contact. Among MSM identified as recent HIV infections in this study, the proportions of MSM identified in Kunming and Dali were 46.8% (24/59) and 16.9% (11/59), respectively, and ranked the top two (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S4). If the HIV incidence is assumed to be roughly the same among MSM, the population sizes of MSM in Kunming and Dali were the highest in Yunnan Province. Strikingly, the RR of the most likely cluster for CRF01_AE was the highest among all the detected spatial clusters. RR means how many times the estimated risk in cluster is as high as the estimated risk outside the cluster. The higher RR reflects the higher aggregation degree of the specific risk. Thus, this suggested that the risk of CRF01_AE infection displayed a high clustering tendency in this cluster.
