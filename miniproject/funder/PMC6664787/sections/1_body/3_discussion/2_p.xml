<p id="Par41">As described in the previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], CRF08_BC, CRF07_BC, URFs and CRF01_AE were the main HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Yunnan. However, compared with the surveillance carried out in 2009, the ranks of these four genotypes changed. The proportion of CRF08_BC among recent infections remained the highest and showed no significant difference from 2009 to 2015 (40.8% in 2009, 47.0% in 2014 and 45.3% in 2015; χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 1.605, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.450) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The proportion of CRF07_BC increased from fourth to second place and showed a statistically increasing trend for 2009–2015 (9.2% in 2009, 14.4% in 2014 and 18.3% in 2015; trend χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 8.557, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). The proportion of URFs declined from second to third place and showed a decreasing trend (27.7% in 2009, 18.2% in 2014 and 18.2% in 2015; χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 6.272, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.045). The proportion of CRF01_AE declined from third to fourth place and showed a decreasing trend that was not statistically significant (18.5% in 2009, 15.8% in 2014 and 11.4% in 2015; χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.437, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.064). The overall increase in CRF07_BC may be partly due to the increase in CRF07_BC among homosexual contact. Among MSM, the proportion of CRF07_BC increased from 17.2% in 2014 to 42.9% in 2015 (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 5.379, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.026).
