<p id="Par46">As mentioned above, Dehong Prefecture, one of the prefectures bordering Myanmar, was a hot spot of active HIV-1 genetic recombination. In this study, the most likely cluster for URFs was detected in the China-Myanmar border area, including four counties in Dehong Prefecture and one county in Baoshan Prefecture. In this URF cluster, 65.2% (15/23) of the observed cases were Burmese residing in Dehong and Baoshan, and the transmission risks of heterosexual contact (60.9%, 14/23) and intravenous drug use (39.1%, 9/23) coexist. Recent studies also suggested that Burmese living in Yunnan contributed to cross-border transmission of HIV-1 in the China-Myanmar border areas [

The secondary cluster for URFs was located in the nine counties in Honghe Prefecture and Wenshan Prefecture, which almost overlapped with the most likely cluster for CRF08_BC. In this URF cluster, 100% of the observed cases were infected through heterosexual contact, which further suggested the high transmission risk of heterosexual contact in this area. Overall, the spatial clustering analysis for recent infections could provide clues for potential transmission risk, based on which the targeted measures for AIDS control and prevention should be developed.
