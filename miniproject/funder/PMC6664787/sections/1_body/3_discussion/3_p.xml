<p id="Par42">In addition to the above four predominant genotypes, two subtypes and six CRFs were found in recent infections. The genetic diversity of HIV-1 constitutes a characteristic of the HIV-1 epidemic in Yunnan. HIV-1 recombination was active in the Yunnan-Myanmar border area, where URFs were highly prevalent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and more than ten CRFs were identified recently, including CRF57_BC, CRF62_BC, CRF64_BC, CRF65_cpx, CRF78_cpx, CRF82_cpx, CRF83_cpx, CRF86_BC, CRF87_cpx, CRF88_BC and CRF96_cpx [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this study, CRF64_BC, CRF83_cpx and CRF87_cpx were found in western Yunnan, which suggested that they were circulating locally. CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B were originally identified in MSM outside Yunnan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; CRF85_BC was originally identified in the neighbouring province, Sichuan Province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In this study, these three CRFs were found in eastern Yunnan, where the floating population was relatively larger.
