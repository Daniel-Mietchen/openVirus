<p id="Par35">Among the 439 samples successfully genotyped, more than ten HIV-1 genotypes were identified, including two subtypes, nine CRFs and six discrete URFs. CRF08_BC was the most common (45.3%, 199/439), followed by CRF07_BC (19.4%, 85/439), URFs (18.2%, 80/439), CRF01_AE (11.4%, 50/439), subtype C (2.1%, 9/439), CRF85_BC (1.1%, 5/439), CRF55_01B (0.9%, 4/439), subtype B (0.5%, 2/439), CRF64_BC (0.5%, 2/439), CRF59_01B (0.2%, 1/439), CRF83_cpx (0.2%, 1/439) and CRF87_cpx (0.2%, 1/439). Among the six discrete URFs, BC recombinants were the predominant recombinant form (66.3%, 53/80), followed by BC/CRF01_AE (10.0%, 8/80), CRF07_BC/CRF01_AE (8.8%, 7/80), B/CRF01_AE (6.3%, 5/80), C/CRF01_AE (5.0%, 4/80) and CRF07_BC/CRF08_BC (3.8%, 3/80).</p>
