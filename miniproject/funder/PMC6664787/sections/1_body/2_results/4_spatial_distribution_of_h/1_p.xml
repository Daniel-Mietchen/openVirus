<p id="Par37">The spatial distribution of HIV-1 genotypes in recent infections was analysed at the county level (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). CRF08_BC was the most widely distributed genotype, which was found in 54.3% (70/129) of the counties in Yunnan Province. However, more CRF08_BC cases were found in the six eastern prefectures (Zhaotong, Qujing, Kunming, Yuxi, Honghe and Wenshan). The other three main genotypes, CRF07_BC, URFs and CRF01_AE, were found in 38.0% (49/129), 34.1% (44/129) and 20.2% (26/129) of all counties, respectively. The distributions of subtype C, CRF85_BC, CRF55_01B, subtype B, CRF64_BC, CRF59_01B, CRF83_cpx and CRF87_cpx were limited.
