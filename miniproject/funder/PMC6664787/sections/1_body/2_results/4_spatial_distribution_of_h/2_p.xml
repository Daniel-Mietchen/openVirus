<p id="Par38">Spatial clusters were further analysed using spatial scan statistics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For CRF08_BC, two non-overlapping statistically significant clusters were detected. Among them, the most likely cluster (RR = 4.78) included 11 counties in Honghe Prefecture and Wenshan Prefecture, and the secondary clusters (RR = 4.24) included two counties in Zhaotong Prefecture. In these two spatial clusters, 95.2 and 90.0% of observed cases were infected through heterosexual contact (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For CRF07_BC, there was only one most likely cluster (RR = 3.68) detected in Kunming Prefecture (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For CRF01_AE, two non-overlapping statistically significant clusters were detected. Among them, the most likely cluster (RR = 17.41) was located in one county in Dali Prefecture, and the secondary cluster (RR = 5.36) included six counties in Kunming Prefecture and Yuxi Prefecture. In the most likely cluster and the secondary cluster, 80.0 and 63.6% of observed cases were infected through homosexual contact (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For URFs, two non-overlapping statistically significant clusters were detected. Among them, the most likely cluster (RR = 9.62) was located in the west, including six counties in Dehong Prefecture and Baoshan Prefecture, in which 60.9% of observed cases were infected through intravenous drug use; the secondary cluster (RR = 3.51) was located in the southeast and included nine counties in Honghe Prefecture and Wenshan Prefecture, in which 100.0% of observed cases were infected through heterosexual contact (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
