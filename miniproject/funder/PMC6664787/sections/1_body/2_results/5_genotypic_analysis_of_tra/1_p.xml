<p id="Par39">Among the 411 participants with 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences, ten (2.4%) were identified as harbouring SDRMs. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, 0.5% (2/411), 1.2% (5/411), and 0.7% (3/411) of the sequences harboured SDRMs to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the prevalence of SDRMs increased with age (trend χ
