 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, during the first half of 2015, 6,357 HIV/AIDS cases were newly diagnosed through the different screening methods in Yunnan Province. Based on information regarding disease progression and a BED-CEIA assay, 586 samples were identified as recent infections and were subjected to HIV-1 gene amplification. Finally, 444

 <italic>env</italic> sequences were obtained, which were further subjected to phylogenetic analyses (Additional file

 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S3). By combining the genotyping of at least two gene segments, 439 samples obtained explanative HIV-1 genotyping. The constituent of the 439 participants showed no significant differences with that of the total 586 recently infected individuals (Additional file
