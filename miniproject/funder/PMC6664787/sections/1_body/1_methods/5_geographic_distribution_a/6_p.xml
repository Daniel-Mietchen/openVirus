<p id="Par30">In this study, SaTScan 9.6 was used for the spatial scan statistics analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A Poisson-based model combined with circular scan windows was used. For the analysis of each HIV-1 genotype, three types of files (case file, population file and coordinates file) were submitted into SaTScan. The case file contained the numbers of cases with a given HIV-1 genotype in each county. The population file contained the number of populations in each county. The coordinates file contained the coordinates of each county. The most commonly used maximum spatial cluster size is 50% of the population at risk [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To choose the maximum spatial cluster size, a sensitivity analysis was performed with 10, 30 and 50% of the population at risk in the spatial window (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1). The significant clusters of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, CRF08_BC and URFs showed no difference when using these settings. Therefore, 10% of the population at risk was used as the maximum spatial cluster size. The spatial clusters were mapped using Quantum GIS [
