<p id="Par28">For each location, by varying the size, a window with the maximum likelihood will be found. The 
 <italic>p</italic>-value is obtained through Monte Carlo simulations, by comparing the rank of the maximum likelihood from the real data set with those from random simulated data sets. If this rank is R, then 
 <italic>p</italic> = R / (1+ n), where n is the number of random simulations. Among the regions with statistical significance, the regions with the maximum likelihood are defined as the most likely cluster (primary cluster), and the others with a smaller likelihood are defined as secondary clusters.
