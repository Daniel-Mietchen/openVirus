<p id="Par22">BED-capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA) (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Portland, OR, USA) was used to test for the recency of HIV-1 infection. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, plasma specimens were first tested individually. If the normalized OD (ODn) was &gt; 1.2, the specimen was classified as having a long-term infection. Specimens with ODn &lt; 1.2 were tested again in triplicate for confirmation. In confirmatory testing, specimens with ODn &lt; 0.8 were classified as recent infections. According to the evaluation carried out in China, the duration of a recent HIV infection determined by BED-CEIA was 168 days after seroconversion.</p>
