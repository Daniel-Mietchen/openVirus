<p id="Par24">The sequences were assembled using Sequencher 5.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). The assembled sequences were aligned with Bio-Edit 7.0 software and further manually edited. HIV-1 reference sequences were selected and downloaded from the HIV databases of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) (

 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes. Samples with only one gene segment were excluded. Finally, 260 samples had 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> segments, 108 had 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic> segments, 45 had 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> segments, and 26 had 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> segments. The above 439 samples were considered to have achieved reliable HIV-1 genotyping.
