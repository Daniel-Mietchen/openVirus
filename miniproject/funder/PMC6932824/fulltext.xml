Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) acts as an innate immune receptor and is also a death receptor in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of TLR7-mediated brain pathogenesis upon EV71 infection remain largely elusive. Here we reveal a novel mechanism by which EV71 infects astrocytes in the brain and induces neural pathogenesis <italic>via</italic> TLR7 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in C57BL/6 mice and in human astroglioma U251 cells. Upon EV71 infection, wild-type (WT) mice displayed more significant body weight loss, higher clinical scores, and lower survival rates as compared with TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. In the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, neurofilament integrity was disrupted, and inflammatory cell infiltration and neurodegeneration were induced in WT mice, whereas these were largely absent in TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similarly, IL-6 production, Caspase-3 cleavage, and cell apoptosis were significantly higher in EV71-infected WT mice as compared with TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Moreover, EV71 preferentially infected and induced IL-6 in astrocytes of mice brain. In U251 cells, EV71-induced IL-6 production and cell apoptosis were suppressed by shRNA-mediated knockdown of TLR7 (shTLR7). Moreover, in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, the blockade of IL-6 with anti-IL-6 antibody (IL-6-Ab) restored the body weight loss, attenuated clinical scores, improved survival rates, reduced the disruption of neurofilament integrity, decreased cell apoptotic induction, and lowered levels of Caspase-3 cleavage. Similarly, in EV71-infected U251 cells, IL-6-Ab blocked EV71-induced IL-6 production and cell apoptosis in response to viral infection. Collectively, it&#x02019;s exhibited TLR7 upregulation, IL-6 induction and astrocytic cell apoptosis in EV71-infected human brain. Taken together, we propose that EV71 infects astrocytes of the cerebral cortex in mice and human and triggers TLR7 signaling and IL-6 release, subsequently inducing neural pathogenesis in the brain.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis and fatal encephalitis in infants.

As a neurotropic virus, the emerging EV71-related outbreaks have been the subject of great public health concern and are responsible for increased neurovirulence and mortality in the Asian-Pacific region [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In HFMD epidemics in China from 2008 to 2012, more than 90% of deaths were associated with EV71 [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. EV71 is thought to cause serious neurological disease with distinct clinicoradiological syndromes in affected patients, resulting in higher paresis-related morbidity in the gray matter of the brainstem or spinal cord [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the exact pathogenesis of EV71 infections, especially in cases where they cause severe neurological symptoms, remains poorly understood.</p><p>Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is widely expressed in immune cells, intestinal cells, lung cells, and neural cells. As a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), TLR7 can recognize viral RNA, oligomeric RNA, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) from pathogenic sources to activate intracellular signaling pathways and release appropriate cytokines [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Emerging evidence suggests that beyond its function as an immune receptor in immune cells, TLR7 also serves as a death receptor in various forms of non-infectious central nervous system (CNS) injury, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, and morphine-mediated neurodegeneration [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In infectious contexts, TLR7 plays multiple roles relevant to neurological disorders and inflammatory responses in the CNS. When simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infects the brains of rhesus macaques, the secretion of microRNA21 activates the TLR7 pathway, leading to neurological disease [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection elicits an elevation of inflammatory cytokine expression through TLR7 signaling to cause neuroinflammation [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Meningitis caused by Toscana virus (TOSV) is associated with a strong TLR7-mediated antiviral response in the CNS [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon EV71 infection, TLR7 usually acts as an inflammatory response modulator in intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It remains unclear as to what role is played by TLR7 in the brain following EV71 infection, and the molecular mechanisms by which TLR7-mediates viral neural pathogenesis remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we conducted experimental intracranial infections with EV71 in neonatal mice, and found a non-significant viral load in the cerebral cortex of both wild-type (WT) and TLR7 knockout (TLR7<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Compared with EV71-infected WT mice, there was an obvious alleviation of neurological injury-related symptoms, histopathologic damage, and cell apoptosis, as well as lower brain IL-6 levels in EV71-infected TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further investigations revealed that intracranial IL-6 neutralization significantly relieved neurological injury-related symptoms and neural cell apoptosis in the brains of EV71-infected WT mice.

Given the neurotropic pathology associated with EV71, we speculated that TLR7 may regulate the immunological protection of CNS upon EV71 infection. Using intracranial infection model which is suitable for evaluating EV71 neurovirulence [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the neurotropic EV71 strain was intracranially injected in 3-day-old neonatal WT and TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Compared with WT mice, TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice were protected from EV71-induced weight loss, hind-limb paralysis, and lethality. Further histological analyses revealed a reduction in EV71-induced neurodegeneration in TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting TLR7 was essential for EV71 neurovirulence in mice. Unexpectedly, further findings revealed EV71 replication and tissue distribution were unaffected in the cerebral cortex of WT and TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This suggested that TLR7 failed to act as an antiviral immune receptor in these tissues, instead of serving as a death receptor in the context of murine brain neuropathogenesis upon EV71 infection. Thus, we uncovered an additional biological function of TLR7 in the context of EV71-induced neurological lesion-related symptoms in the brains of mice. TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are known to be important host factors involved in restricting EV71 infection in diverse infection models <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given TLR7 systemically modulates immune response, it should be emphasized that the different roles of TLR7 on EV71 infection might result from specifically viral distribution in mice organs in distinct EV71 infection models, such as oral and intraperitoneal routes [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, we found viral distribution in a high level in cerebral cortex of the intracranially EV71-infected mice, which is similar with the EV71-infected human brain. Thus, it is ideal to investigate the function of TLR7 in EV71-induced neuropathogenesis in the intracranial infection model.</p><p>In the CNS, the TLR7-mediated apoptosis pathway leads to cell death under either physiological (eg. neurodegeneration) or pathological (eg. neurotropic virus infection) conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To investigate the role of TLR7 in EV71-related neurological damage, we therefore detected multiple markers of apoptosis including activated Caspase-3, DNA damage, and apoptosis-associated gene expression in the cerebral cortex of WT and TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our observations revealed that the induction of apoptosis upon EV71-infection was significantly reduced in TLR7<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The coordinated neuroinflammatory response may be an important factor in neural injury [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In TLR7-mediated neural apoptosis upon EV71-infection, the level of IL-6 was predominantly induced in the cerebral cortex on days 3 and 5 after EV71 infection, and was also specifically modulated by TLR7. Subsequently, we assessed the role of IL-6 in TLR7-mediated neuropathogenesis upon EV71 infection. In an intracranial injection model, IL-6 blockade effectively protected EV71-infected mice from neurological lesion-related symptoms. Correspondingly, IL-6 blockade significantly reduced the induction of apoptosis in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, while IL-6 blockade mediated such protection is independent of the virus load.

Confocal microscopy revealed that viral dsRNA mainly colocalized with GFAP, rather than with NeuN or IBA-1, suggesting that EV71 preferentially infects and replicates in astrocytes of the murine cerebral cortex. Moreover, endogenously induced IL-6 protein mainly localized to astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of mice upon EV71 infection. In fact, EV71 antigen has primarily been detected in the neurons and astrocytes in CNS specimen from infected rhesus macaques and human patients [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our data provide novel insights into the fact that EV71 preferentially infects and induces IL-6 in the astrocytes of mice, providing a novel explanation for the observed viral neuropathogenesis.</p><p>Astrocytes (also known as astroglia) are a class of neural cells of ectodermal and neuroepithelial origin that maintain homeostasis and provide for the defense of the CNS [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Given that EV71 preferentially infected astrocytes, we further evaluated the role of TLR7 in the human astroglioma U251 cells upon EV71 infection. Using TLR7 silencing and IL-6 neutralization approaches, we confirmed that TLR7 knockdown and IL-6 blockade attenuated astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection. Astrocytes are tightly integrated into neural networks and act within the context of neural tissue <italic>in vivo</italic>, and therefore the neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are also induced by activated microglia or damaged neurons in neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this study, we propose that EV71 RNA triggers TLR7 signaling, subsequently promoting IL-6 expression primarily in astrocytes. The release of IL-6 protein by these EV71-infected cells mediate autocrine and paracrine signaling in proximal astrocytes, leading to astrocytic cell apoptosis. These dysfunctional astrocytes disrupt brain homeostasis, leading to the systematic development of neural inflammation and injury in brain, and even causing death in the case of some EV71 infections. However, the interplay of EV71-infected astrocytes with other neural cell types such as microglia or neurons involved in viral neural pathogenesis remains to be further studied. Altogether, these data reveal that astrocytes are responsible for EV71-induced neurodegeneration, a potential role of microglia in such pathology needs to clarify beyond this limited study.
