 <p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection causes aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis and fatal encephalitis in infants. Besides an immune receptor, toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) serves as a death receptor in central nervous system (CNS). However, the role of TLR7 in EV71-induced neural pathogenesis remains ambiguous. This study reveals a distinct mechanism by which EV71 induces neurodegeneration 
  <italic>via</italic> TLR7 and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Upon EV71 infection, TLR7
  <sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed less body weight loss, lower clinical score, and higher survival rate as compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Meanwhile, a severer histopathologic neurofilaments disruption, neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis were observed in brain of EV71-infected WT mice. IL-6 release, cell apoptosis, and Caspase-3 cleavage were attenuated by shRNA targeting TLR7 (shTLR7) in EV71-infected U251 cells. Moreover, anti-IL-6 antibody (IL-6-Ab) suppressed EV71-induced body weight loss, clinical score increase, and survival rate decrease as well as neurofilaments disruption and neurodegeneration in mice, and it also attenuated EV71-induced cell apoptosis and Caspase-3 cleavage in U251 cells. Itâ€™s retrospectively observed that TLR7 upregulation, IL-6 induction and astrocytic cell apoptosis in EV71-infected human brain. Therefore, TLR7 is required for neural pathogenesis by IL-6 induction upon EV71 infection.
