<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as innate immune receptors to recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecules in certain immune cell types. Various TLRs are also expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and in microglial cells, and they are conducive to the immunological responses of the CNS [

TLR7 is widely expressed in immune cells, intestinal cells, lung cells, and neural cells, wherein it is also able to detect and respond to specific viral RNAs, single-stranded oligoribonucleotides, siRNAs, and microRNAs, leading to intracellular signaling pathway activation and cytokine production [
