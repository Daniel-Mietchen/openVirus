<p>Viral infections of the CNS can manifest in various forms of inflammation to influence the CNS homeostasis, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [

Here we further expand current understanding of not only the mechanism underlying TLR7-mediated neural pathogenesis involved in IL-6 induction, but also the effects of IL-6 on the fate of astrocytes in the brain upon EV71 infection. Our findings may thus provide clues to aid the design of new strategies aimed at better containing and mitigating neurotropic virus- and astrocyte- dependent neural pathogenesis.
