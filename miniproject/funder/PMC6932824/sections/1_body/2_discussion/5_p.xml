<p>Astrocytes (also known as astroglia) are a class of neural cells of ectodermal and neuroepithelial origin that maintain homeostasis and provide for the defense of the CNS [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. They are emerging as pivotal regulators of inflammatory responses in the context of CNS injury [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Given that EV71 preferentially infected astrocytes, we further evaluated the role of TLR7 in the human astroglioma U251 cells upon EV71 infection. Using TLR7 silencing and IL-6 neutralization approaches, we confirmed that TLR7 knockdown and IL-6 blockade attenuated astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection. Astrocytes are tightly integrated into neural networks and act within the context of neural tissue 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and therefore the neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are also induced by activated microglia or damaged neurons in neurodegenerative diseases [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In this study, we propose that EV71 RNA triggers TLR7 signaling, subsequently promoting IL-6 expression primarily in astrocytes. The release of IL-6 protein by these EV71-infected cells mediate autocrine and paracrine signaling in proximal astrocytes, leading to astrocytic cell apoptosis. These dysfunctional astrocytes disrupt brain homeostasis, leading to the systematic development of neural inflammation and injury in brain, and even causing death in the case of some EV71 infections. However, the interplay of EV71-infected astrocytes with other neural cell types such as microglia or neurons involved in viral neural pathogenesis remains to be further studied. Altogether, these data reveal that astrocytes are responsible for EV71-induced neurodegeneration, a potential role of microglia in such pathology needs to clarify beyond this limited study. As such, new approaches, including human brain organoids, and 3D microfluidic platforms, have major advantages in providing a micro-physiological system more closely reflecting the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> brain environment [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], which are ideal to understand astrocytes-microglia or neurons crosstalk in EV71-associated CNS disorders.
