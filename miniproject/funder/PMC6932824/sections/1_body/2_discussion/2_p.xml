<p>We have previously shown that TLR7 orchestrates immune and inflammatory responses in macrophages during EV71 infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Given the neurotropic pathology associated with EV71, we speculated that TLR7 may regulate the immunological protection of CNS upon EV71 infection. Using intracranial infection model which is suitable for evaluating EV71 neurovirulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the neurotropic EV71 strain was intracranially injected in 3-day-old neonatal WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Compared with WT mice, TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice were protected from EV71-induced weight loss, hind-limb paralysis, and lethality. Further histological analyses revealed a reduction in EV71-induced neurodegeneration in TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting TLR7 was essential for EV71 neurovirulence in mice. Unexpectedly, further findings revealed EV71 replication and tissue distribution were unaffected in the cerebral cortex of WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. This suggested that TLR7 failed to act as an antiviral immune receptor in these tissues, instead of serving as a death receptor in the context of murine brain neuropathogenesis upon EV71 infection. Thus, we uncovered an additional biological function of TLR7 in the context of EV71-induced neurological lesion-related symptoms in the brains of mice. TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are known to be important host factors involved in restricting EV71 infection in diverse infection models

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given TLR7 systemically modulates immune response, it should be emphasized that the different roles of TLR7 on EV71 infection might result from specifically viral distribution in mice organs in distinct EV71 infection models, such as oral and intraperitoneal routes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, we found viral distribution in a high level in cerebral cortex of the intracranially EV71-infected mice, which is similar with the EV71-infected human brain. Thus, it is ideal to investigate the function of TLR7 in EV71-induced neuropathogenesis in the intracranial infection model.
