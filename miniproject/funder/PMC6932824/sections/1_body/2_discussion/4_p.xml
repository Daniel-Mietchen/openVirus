<p>Neuroinflammation has been described in various neural cells of the brain, including astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, which contribute to disease development and progression [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As TLR7 protein is expressed in the cortex and hippocampus and regulates neural development and brain function even under non-infectious conditions [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we evaluated the viral distribution of neural cells in cerebral cortex of mice. Confocal microscopy revealed that viral dsRNA mainly colocalized with GFAP, rather than with NeuN or IBA-1, suggesting that EV71 preferentially infects and replicates in astrocytes of the murine cerebral cortex. Moreover, endogenously induced IL-6 protein mainly localized to astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of mice upon EV71 infection. In fact, EV71 antigen has primarily been detected in the neurons and astrocytes in CNS specimen from infected rhesus macaques and human patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our data provide novel insights into the fact that EV71 preferentially infects and induces IL-6 in the astrocytes of mice, providing a novel explanation for the observed viral neuropathogenesis.
