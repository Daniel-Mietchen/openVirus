<p>It has been reported that the neuroinflammatory response is an important indicator of neural injury [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We next sought to assess the role of TLR7 in regulating expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (Cxcl-1) upon EV71 infection. Our results revealed that 
 <italic>IL-1β</italic> mRNA level was higher in the infected cerebral cortex of WT mice on 3 days post-infection as compared with infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Notably, 
 <italic>IL-6</italic> mRNA was induced in the cerebral cortex of infected WT mice on 3 and 5 day post-infection, whereas it only slightly induced in the cortex of infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, there were no differences in the levels of 
 <italic>TNF-α</italic> or 
 <italic>CXCL-1</italic> mRNA between EV71-infected WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> cerebral cortex samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Moreover, IHC staining using an antibody against endogenous IL-6 revealed that IL-6 protein production was induced in the cerebral cortex of infected WT mice, whereas it was only slightly induced in the cerebral cortex of infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 is induced by EV71 and plays a primary role in the neuropathogenesis in mice induced upon EV71 infection.
