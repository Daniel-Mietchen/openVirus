<p>Additionally, the role of TLR7 in regulating Caspase-3 cleavage was assessed. IHC staining revealed that cleaved-Caspase-3 (cl-Caspase-3) was barely detected in the cerebral cortex of both mock-infected WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, left); whereas upon EV71 infection, cl-Caspase-3 protein was induced and the level of cl-Caspase-3 was much higher in cerebral cortex of infected WT mice as compared with that in infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, right). Similarly, Western blotting further confirmed that cl-Caspase-3 was largely absent in cerebral cortex of both mock-infected WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas upon EV71 infection, cl-Caspase-3 protein was induced and the levels of cl-Caspase-3 were enhanced in infected WT mice relative to infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). These data suggest that TLR7 is required for cell apoptosis in the cerebral cortex of mice upon EV71 infection. Furthermore, TUNNEL staining indicated that cell apoptosis was largely absent in brain sections of mock-infected WT mice and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, left); however, upon EV71 infection, cell apoptosis was apparent in brain sections of both WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, with the level of apoptosis being higher in infected WT mouse brain sections relative to infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice brain sections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, right), further suggesting that TLR7 is involved in mediating apoptotic cell death in the brain upon EV71 infection.
