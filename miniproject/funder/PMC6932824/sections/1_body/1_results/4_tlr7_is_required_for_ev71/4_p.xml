<p>Given that in apoptosis-related pathways, specific sets of genes function as apoptotic initiators, apoptosis effectors, and anti-apoptotic factors in senescent or damaged cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], we next thought to establish the role of TLR7 in regulating the expression of 18 apoptosis-related genes in the brain tissues of WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with or without EV71 infection (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results revealed that the apoptotic initiators p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma), BCL-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim, also known as Bcl2L11), BH3 interacting domain death agonist (Bid), and BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (Bad) were up-regulated in EV71-infected WT mouse brain tissues, whereas the anti-apoptotic factors B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-XL), and BCL-2 like 2 (Bcl-W) were down-regulated in these same samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4G</xref>). We also found that the altered regulation of these genes was markedly attenuated in infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice brain tissues relative to those from WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). These results suggest that TLR7 facilitates the activation of apoptotic initiators and the repression of anti-apoptotic factors. Taken together, our results reveal that TLR7 is required for neural cell apoptosis in the murine brain upon EV71 infection.
