<p>Considering the neuropathogenesis induced by EV71 is generally associated with neural cell apoptosis, we further assessed the role of TLR7 in regulating neural cell apoptosis induced by EV71 infection. WT mice and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice were treated with PBS or infected with EV71 for 3 and 5 days, and then rates of cellular apoptosis and neuropathogenesis were assessed in cortex samples. Histopathological assessments revealed that typical inflammatory cell infiltration and neurodegeneration were evident in the cerebral cortex of infected WT mice, but were largely absent in the cerebral cortex of infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
