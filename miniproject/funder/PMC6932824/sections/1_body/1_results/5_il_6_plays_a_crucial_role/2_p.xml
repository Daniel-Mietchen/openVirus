<p>Due to some specific secreted proteins and peptides entering to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood circulation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the IL-6 protein level and EV71 viral load in CNS and peripheral tissues after IL-6 antibody neutralizing administration was assessed. As expected, IL-6 protein levels were significantly reduced by IL-6-Ab neutralization in the cerebral cortex (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4A Fig</xref>), cerebellum tissues (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4B Fig</xref>), as well as CSF (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4C Fig</xref>) of both mock-infected or EV71-infected mice. However, IL-6 protein level didnâ€™t change in peripheral blood (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) of both mock-infected or EV71-infected mice after IL-6-Ab neutralization. Moreover, there was no significant difference in virus titers in the cerebral cortex (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4E Fig</xref>), cerebellum tissues (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4F Fig</xref>), as well as CSF (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4G Fig</xref>) of IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab-treated EV71-infected mice. Notably, EV71 virus was not detected in the peripheral blood of EV71-infected mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s004">S4H Fig</xref>). The similar results were also observed in the tissues of cerebral cortex (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>) and cerebellum tissues (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s005">S5C and S5D Fig</xref>) of different groups of mice. In addition, there was a low level of IL-6 protein and EV71 load in spinal cord (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>), while their expressions were barely detected in skeletal muscle (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>) of EV71-infected mice. These results revealed that EV71-induced IL-6 induction could be reduced, whereas EV71 viral load was not affected after IL-6-Ab neutralization in mice brain, suggesting that IL-6 blockade mediated protection is independent of the virus load.
