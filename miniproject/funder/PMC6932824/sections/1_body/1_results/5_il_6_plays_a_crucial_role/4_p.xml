<p>Next, the effects of IL-6 on EV71-induced cell apoptosis were assessed. TUNNEL staining revealed that in mock-infected mice, cell apoptosis was barely detectable in the cerebral cortex of IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab treated mice (

However, upon EV71 infection, cell apoptosis occurred in the cerebral cortex of both IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab treated mice, while the level of cell apoptosis was higher in the cerebral cortex of IgG-treated mice as compared with IL-6-Ab treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, right), suggesting that IL-6 promotes EV71-induced cell apoptosis in the cerebral cortex. Parallel IHC staining revealed that cl-Caspase-3 levels were largely undetectable in brain sections of both IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g005">Fig 5H</xref>, left), whereas upon EV71 infection, cl-Caspase-3 was induced and the level of cl-Caspase-3 was higher in the brain sections of IgG-treated mice as compared with those in IL-6-Ab treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g005">Fig 5H</xref>, right). Consistent with these findings, Western blotting revealed a lack of cl-Caspase-3 in brain samples from mock-infected IgG- and IL-6-Ab treated mice, whereas upon EV71 infection, cl-Caspase-3 was induced in the brain sections of both IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab treated mice, and the levels of cl-Caspase-3 were higher in the brain sections of IgG-treated mice as compared with those in IL-6-Ab treated mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g005">Fig 5I</xref>). Thus, these data revealed that IL-6 plays a dominant role in TLR7-mediated neuropathogenesis upon EV71 infection
