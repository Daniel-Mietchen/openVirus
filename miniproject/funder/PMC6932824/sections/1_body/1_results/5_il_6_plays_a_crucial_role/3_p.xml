<p>Moreover, immunohistochemical staining for neurofilaments revealed that in mock-infected mice, the integrity of neurofilaments was intact in the cerebral cortex of both IgG-treated and IL-6-Ab-treated mice, whereas upon EV71 infection, the integrity of neurofilaments was disrupted and neurofilament levels were reduced with the progressive viral replication in the cerebral cortex of IgG-treated mice relative to those treated with IL-6-Ab (
