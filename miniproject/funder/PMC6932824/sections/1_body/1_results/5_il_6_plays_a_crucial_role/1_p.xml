<p>In immune cells, EV71 activates TLR7 signaling to induce the production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As TLR7 mediated IL-6 expression and cell apoptosis in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, we further assessed the role of IL-6 in TLR7-mediated neuropathogenesis upon EV71 infection. Neonatal WT mice were intracranially injected with EV71 and then treated with isotype IgG (IgG) or anti-IL-6 antibody (IL-6-Ab) (
