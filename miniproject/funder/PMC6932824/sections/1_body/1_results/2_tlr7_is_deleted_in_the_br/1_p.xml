<p>Our previous work has identified that TLR7 orchestrates the inflammatory and innate immune responses upon EV71 infection in macrophages [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This study further sought to determine whether TLR7 plays a role in EV71-infected neuropathogenesis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> utilizing a TLR7 knock-out (TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup>) mouse model. Initially, the genetic characteristics of the 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> gene in brain tissues were determined. By assessing the 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), we systematically determined that 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> DNA sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> mRNA expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), and TLR7 protein production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) were present in the brain tissues of WT mice, whereas they were not detected in the brains of TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Similarly, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining indicated that TLR7 protein was present in the cerebral cortex of WT mice, whereas it was not produced in the cerebral cortex of TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Thus, these results confirm that the 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> gene was successfully deleted in the brain tissues of homozygous TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Of note, there were no visible differences in behavior and growth between WT neonatal mice and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> neonatal mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g002">Fig 2F</xref>).
