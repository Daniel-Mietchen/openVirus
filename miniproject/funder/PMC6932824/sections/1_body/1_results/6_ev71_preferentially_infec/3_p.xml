<p>EV71 preferentially infects and induces IL-6 production in astrocytes. Thus, we would like to figure out how TLR7 mediated astrocytic cell apoptosis with IL-6 production. The neonatal mice were intracranially injected with TLR7 agonist R837. Immunofluorescence staining results revealed that IL-6 production (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g006">Fig 6F</xref>) were induced in GFAP positive cells in cerebral cortex of mice after R837 administration for 1 day. While these inductions were observed continuously in cerebral cortex of mice from 3 to 5 days upon R837 administration (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Altogether, these results confirmed that EV71 preferentially infects and induces IL-6 production through TLR7 in brain astrocytes in mice.
