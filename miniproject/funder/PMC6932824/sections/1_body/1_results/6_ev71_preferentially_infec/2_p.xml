<p>As EV71 antigen has been detected in neurons and astrocytes in CNS tissues of infected rhesus macaques and human patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we further assessed where EV71 replicates in cerebral cortex of mice. Confocal microscopy analyses indicated that the viral dsRNA mainly localized with GFAP, rather than with NeuN or IBA-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), suggesting that EV71 preferentially replicates in astrocytes of the murine cerebral cortex. In addition, the localization and expression of endogenous IL-6 protein in the cerebral cortex upon EV71 infection were examined. In the absence of infection, endogenous IL-6 protein was barely detected in the cerebral cortex of WT or TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas upon EV71 infection IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex of WT mice relative to TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, EV71-induced IL-6 mainly localized in GFAP positive cells (
