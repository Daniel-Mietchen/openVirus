<p>As TLR7 is expressed in the cortex and hippocampus, it regulates neural development and brain function even in the absence of infectious or pathogenic molecules [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We first evaluated the distribution of neural cells in the cerebral cortex or hippocampal areas of WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice based on neural markers. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that there were no significant differences in numbers and distributions of astrocytes (GFAP-positive), neurons (NeuN-positive), or microglia (IBA-1 positive) between cerebral cortexes or hippocampal areas of WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Notably, confocal microscopy analyses revealed that TLR7 localized with GFAP, NeuN, and IBA-1 in the cerebral cortex of WT mice, and TLR7 was not detected in cerebral cortex of TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), suggesting that TLR7 is expressed in astrocytes, neurons, and microglia in the murine cerebral cortex.
