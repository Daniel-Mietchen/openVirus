<p>EV71 is neurotropic that has been demonstrated in human and primate pathological specimens, and the viral distribution is distinct and stereotyped [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To extrapolate the role of TLR7 in EV71-induced neuropathogenesis to human infections, we performed the histological analysis in six human brain specimens. The pathological changes were characterized as inflammatory cell infiltration and neurodegeneration in both cerebral cortex (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12A Fig</xref>) of EV71-infected death cases. We also observed that the EV71 antigen VP1 was expressed in the cerebral cortex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) and cerebellum (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12B Fig</xref>) of EV71-infected human brain tissues. The similar observations were found that EV71 dsRNA was distributed in EV71-infected human brain regions, including the cerebral cortex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) and cerebellum (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12C Fig</xref>). In the parallel histological analysis, TLR7 expression appeared at a higher level in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected human brain tissues than uninfected ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). The similar phenomenon was observed in the cerebellum of EV71-infected human brain specimens (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12D Fig</xref>). Further histological analysis revealed the IL-6 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g009">Fig 9E</xref>), as well as cl-Caspase-3 level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g009">Fig 9F</xref>) in GFAP positive cells were obviously upregulated in EV71-infected human cerebral cortex. In addition, these up-regulations of the IL-6 expression (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12E Fig</xref>), and cl-Caspase-3 level (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s012">S12F Fig</xref>) in GFAP positive cells were displayed in EV71-infected human cerebellum. However, we noticed that the up-regulations of the IL-6 and cl-Caspase-3 expression in the cerebellum were less than that in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected human brain tissues, which is consistent with those found in EV71-infected mice brain. Altogether, these data demonstrated that TLR7 upregulation, IL-6 induction and astrocytic cell apoptosis occurred in human brain upon EV71 infection.
