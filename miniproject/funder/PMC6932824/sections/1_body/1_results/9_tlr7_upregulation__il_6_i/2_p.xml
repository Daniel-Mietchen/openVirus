<p>Taken together, we propose that the neurotropic EV71 preferentially infects and replicates in astrocytes of the murine and human cerebral cortex. EV71 RNA is recognized by TLR7 to trigger the signaling events and to promote IL-6 production and release, which results in the induction of cell apoptosis and in the development of neuroinflammation and brain injury (
