<p>Next, the role of TLR7 in regulating EV71 replication in the murine brains was verified. Notably, there was no significant difference in EV71 load in the brain tissues of WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). Additional IHC staining with an antibody against EV71 dsRNA demonstrated that EV71 dsRNA was present with no significant difference in the cerebral cortex of both WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). These results suggest that TLR7 does not play an antiviral role in the brain upon EV71 infection.
