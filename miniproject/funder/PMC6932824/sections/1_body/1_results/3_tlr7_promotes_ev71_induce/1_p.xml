<p>The effects of TLR7 on EV71 infection-induced neuropathogenesis were then evaluated in WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Three-day-old neonatal mice were intracranially injected with or without EV71, in accordance with a previously established intracranial infection model for assessing EV71 neurovirulence [

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, infected WT mice exhibited significantly greater loss of body weight (
