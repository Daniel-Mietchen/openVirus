<p>To further explore the role of TLR7 in neuropathogenesis induced upon EV71 infection, we analyzed the expression status of neurofilament protein. These 10-nm intermediate filaments of neurons provide structure and mechanoresistance in the brain, and disruption of neurofilament organization and expression is a characteristic of certain neurological disorders [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, we examined the effect of TLR7 on neurofilament organization and expression upon EV71 infection via immunohistochemical analysis of the cerebral cortex on Day 3 and 5 after EV71 infection in WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with neurofilament staining. Fluorescence microscopy showed that in PBS-treated mice, neurofilament integrity was intact in the cortexes of both WT and TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas upon EV71 infection, the integrity of neurofilaments was disrupted and the levels of neurofilaments were reduced with the progressive viral infection in the cortex of EV71-infected WT mice relative to TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (
