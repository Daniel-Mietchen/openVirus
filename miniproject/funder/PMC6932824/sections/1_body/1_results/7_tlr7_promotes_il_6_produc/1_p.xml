<p>Given that EV71 preferentially infects mice astrocytes and induces neuropathogenesis 
 <italic>via</italic> TLR7, we thus further assessed the role of TLR7 in promoting cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection in human astroglioma U251 cells. Our results confirmed that GFAP (an astrocyte marker) was highly expressed in the cytoplasm of U251 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Firstly, the dynamic EV71 replication in U251 cells was estimated. We found the levels of viral RNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s009">S9A Fig</xref>) and proteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s009">S9B Fig</xref>) were continuously increased ranged from 0 to 48 h, while slightly reduced at 60 h post-infection in U251 cells. The role of TLR7 in regulating cell apoptosis in U251 cells upon EV71 infection was then evaluated using shRNAs specifically targeting TLR7 (shTLR7) or shGFP (as a negative control). qPCR assays revealed that 
 <italic>TLR7</italic> mRNA expressed in mock-infected cells or induced in EV71-infected cells was significantly attenuated by shTLR7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, left), indicating that shTLR7 is highly efficient at achieving knockdown in cells. The results also indicated that EV71 
 <italic>VP1</italic> RNA was not affected by shTLR7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7B</xref>, right), suggesting that TLR7 doesn’t influence EV71 replication in U251 cells. Notably, 
 <italic>IL-1β</italic> mRNA was barely detected in U251 cells upon EV71 infection, whereas 
 <italic>IL-6</italic> and 
 <italic>TNF-α</italic> mRNA was highly expressed and significantly induced by EV71 in these cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), while the inductions of 
 <italic>IL-6</italic> and 
 <italic>IL-8</italic> mRNA were significantly down-regulated by shTLR7, whereas 
 <italic>TNF-α</italic> mRNA was not affected by shTLR7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). In addition, ELISA assays further demonstrated that IL-1β protein level was not detectable in U251 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, left), whereas there was abundant IL-6 production and prominently induced by EV71 in these cells, and this induction was decreased by shTLR7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, right). In parallel, IL-8 protein level was mildly elevated by EV71, but this production was not affected by shTLR7 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that IL-8 slightly secreted from astrocytes upon viral infection independent on TLR7, although IL-8 protein can consistently release from astrocytes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Collectively, these results suggest that TLR7 facilitates IL-6 expression and production upon EV71 infection in U251 cells.
