<p>Furthermore, the TLR7-mediated astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection was explored. The qPCR analyses revealed that upon EV71 infection, the mRNA levels of apoptotic initiators including 
 <italic>Puma</italic>, 
 <italic>Bad</italic>, 
 <italic>Noxa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bax</italic>, were induced in shGFP-transfected cells, whereas this upregulation was attenuated in shTLR7-transfected cells (

Moreover, immunoblotting for cleaved-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cleaved-Caspase-3 revealed that upon EV71 infection, PARP cleavage and Caspase-3 cleavage were induced in shGFP-transfected cells, whereas these cleavage events were reduced in shTLR7-transfected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that TLR7 facilitates astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection. Taken together, our results thus reveal that TLR7 promotes IL-6 production to facilitate astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection.
