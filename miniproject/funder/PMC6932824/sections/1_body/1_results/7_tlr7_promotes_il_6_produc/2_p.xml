<p>Next, the role of TLR7 in mediating EV71-induced neurotoxicity was assessed. Upon EV71 infection, cell viability was reduced in the presence of shGFP, whereas this reduction was reversed in the presence of shTLR7 (

In addition, upon EV71 infection, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was induced in the presence of shGFP, whereas such induction was significantly attenuated in the presence of shTLR7 (

 <sup>-/-</sup> mice cerebral cortex (

Then, siRNA silencing of TLR8 was applied in human U251 cells, followed by stimulated with R837 (TLR7 but not TLR8 agonist) as a positive control and EV71, revealing no effect on TLR7 expression after TLR8 silencing (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s010">S10C Fig</xref>). However, these changes were not affected by knockdown of TLR8. These results further indicated EV71-induced neurotoxicity in human U251 cells might rely on TLR7 but not TLR8. In contrast, upon VTX-2337 (TLR8 but not TLR7 agonist) stimulation, cell apoptosis was strongly induced (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s010">S10D Fig</xref>). In parallel, cell viability was reduced while LDH release was induced (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s010">S10E Fig</xref>). Therefore, the data reveal that EV71 activates TLR7 signaling and IL-6 production independent of TLR8 in astrocytes.
