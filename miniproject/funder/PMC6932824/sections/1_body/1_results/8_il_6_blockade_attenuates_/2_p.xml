<p>As TLR7 promotes IL-6 production and cell apoptosis induction by EV71 infection in U251 cells, we further explored the role of IL-6 in TLR7-mediated cell apoptosis induced by EV71. U251 cells were infected with EV71 and then treated with isotype IgG (IgG) or anti-IL-6 antibody (IL-6-Ab) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). ELISA results revealed that IL-6 protein levels were sharply reduced by IL-6-Ab treatment in cell supernatants of both mock-infected or EV71-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), demonstrating that the IL-6-Ab blockade is efficient. Upon EV71 infection, cell viability was attenuated in the presence of IgG, whereas this reduction was reversed by IL-6-Ab (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). In addition, LDH release was increased in the presence of IgG, whereas this increase was reduced by IL-6-Ab (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Moreover, upon EV71 infection, the mRNA levels of the apoptotic initiators 
 <italic>Puma</italic>, 
 <italic>Bad</italic>, 
 <italic>NoxA</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bax</italic> were enhanced in IgG-treated cells, whereas these enhancements were reduced in IL-6-Ab-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Notably, upon EV71 infection, PARP cleavage and Caspase-3 cleavage were increased in IgG-treated cells, whereas these cleavage events occurred less frequently in IL-6-Ab-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that IL-6 is involved in promoting TLR7-mediated cell death in U251 cells upon EV71 infection.
