<p>The neuropathogenesis induced by neurotropic viruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is generally associated with neural cell apoptosis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We further assessed the neural cell apoptosis induced by EV71 infection. On day 1 post-infection, the Caspase-3 cleavage (cl-Caspase-3) (activated apoptosis), and EV71 dsRNA were obviously detected in the cerebral cortex tissues of EV71-infected mice, but not in mock-infected, EV71-heated-infected, or EV71-UV-infected mice (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>) post-infection, but cl-Caspase 3 became slightly higher from 3 days (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>) post-infection. However, compared with the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, we found a lower level of cl-Caspase-3 and dsRNA in the cerebellum of EV71-infected mice on day 1 post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008142.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>) and similar observations were obtained on day 3 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) and day 5 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008142.s002">S2C and S2D Fig</xref>) post-infection. Thus, these results reveal that EV71 robustly replicates and induces cell apoptosis in the cerebral cortex of EV71-infected mice, but exhibits relatively low levels of viral replication and cell apoptosis in the cerebellum of EV71-infected mice in the intracranial injection model.
