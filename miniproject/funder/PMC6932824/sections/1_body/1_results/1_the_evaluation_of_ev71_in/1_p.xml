<p>Numerous animal models have been developed to study the pathogenesis upon EV71 infection, and the intracranial infection in suckling mice is established as an appropriate animal model to better understand EV71-associated neuropathogenesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To assess whether EV71 infection in mice brain caused neuropathogenesis, 3-day-old suckling WT mice were intracranially injected with PBS, UV-inactivated EV71 (EV71-UV), Heated-inactivated EV71 (EV71-Heated), and EV71. We found that EV71 robustly replicated on day 1 post-infection, and then declined from day 3 to 5 post-infection in the cerebral cortex tissues of EV71-infected mice, but not in mock-infected, UV-, or Heated-inactivated EV71-infected mice (
