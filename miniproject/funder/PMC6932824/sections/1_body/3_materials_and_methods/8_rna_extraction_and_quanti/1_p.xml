<p>RNA was extracted from homogenized mouse brain tissues or cultured cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed using the Roche LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and SYBR RT-PCR kits (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data represent absolute mRNA copy numbers normalized to GAPDH used as a reference gene. Relative fold expression values were determined by using the 
 <sup>ΔΔ</sup>Ct method. Primer sequences are listed in
