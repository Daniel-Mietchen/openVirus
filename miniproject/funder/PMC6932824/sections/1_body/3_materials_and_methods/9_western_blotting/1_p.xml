<p>Radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease inhibitors was used in order to lyse and extract protein from murine brain homogenates and cultured cells. Supernatant protein concentrations were then determined using a BCA assay kit, and protein lysates (100 Î¼g) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose (NC) membranes (Amersham, Piscataway, NY, USA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, the NC membranes were incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Blots were then analyzed using a Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujifilm LAS-4000; GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The relative target protein expression to internal control is quantified using Image J software.</p>
