<p>The shTLR7 and shGFP plasmids expressing a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting TLR7 or Green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control were generated by inserting the appropriate DNA fragments into the pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo vector (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA), respectively, as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The specific DNA fragments were synthesized by Tsingke Biological Technology (Beijing, China). The siRNA specific to the negative control (NC) and human TLR8 were synthesized by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China) and used at the concentration of 50 nM. siRNA-NC targeted the sequence 5’-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3’, siRNA-TLR8 targeted the sequence 5’-GATGGTGGTGCTTCAATTA-3’.
