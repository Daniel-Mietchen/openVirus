<p>Tissue samples were mounted on slides from paraffin blocks (5-μm sections), deparaffinized three times in xylene for 5 min, and hydrated in a methanol gradient (100%, 95%, 70%, and 50%). 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 10 mM citrate buffer (pH6) was used for antigen retrieval. Nonspecific peroxidase activity was blocked for 30 min with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The slides were then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C and then washed with PBS for 10 min. The biotinylated secondary antibody was initially applied for 30 min, after which an avidin biotin complex kit (Dako/Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for an additional 30 min. 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride hydrate (DAB) with 5% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was used for detection. Slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) to stain nuclei. Immunohistochemistry was conducted at each site using specific antibodies, and samples were visualized by microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
