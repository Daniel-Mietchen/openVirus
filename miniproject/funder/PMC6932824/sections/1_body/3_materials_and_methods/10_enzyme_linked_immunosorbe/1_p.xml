<p>U251 cells (1×10
 <sup>6</sup> per well) were seeded in 6-well culture plates with 10% FBS, and were transfected with shGFP or shTLR7 plasmids. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with EV71 at a MOI = 0.5 for 2 h, and were then washed with PBS to remove the unbound virus. Then, cells were cultured in 2 ml of FBS-free DMEM for an additional 12 h. Finally, the cell supernatants were harvested after centrifugation at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min for ELISAs. Supernatant cytokine levels were assessed using human IL-1β immunoassay (BD Biosciences, CA, USA), human IL-6 immunoassay kits (R&amp;D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and human IL-8 ELISA kit (4A Biotech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s provided instructions.
