<p>Cells (1×10
 <sup>5</sup> per well) were seeded in 24-well plates after treatment. A cell viability assay was then performed using the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8, Dojindo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell injury was determined by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in FBS-free culture medium at 30 min after restoration using an LDH detection kit (Dojindo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, medium was harvested from a 24-well plate and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. This cell-free supernatant was then incubated with the provided reaction mixture, and LDH activity was determined based on absorbance at 450 nm.
