<p>The neurotropic Enterovirus 71 (EV71) strain (Xiangyang-Hubei-09) was originated from the brain tissue of a one-year-old dead EV71-infected infant in Xiangyang city, Hubei province in China, and isolated previously in our laboratory (GenBank accession no. JN230523.1). The virus stock was propagated in RD cells, and virus titration and inoculation with EV71 were performed as described previously [
