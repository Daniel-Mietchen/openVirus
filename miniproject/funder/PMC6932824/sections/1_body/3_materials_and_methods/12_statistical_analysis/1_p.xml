<p>All experiments were reproducible, and each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results. Statistical significance for comparison of two means was assessed via unpaired Student’s 
 <italic>t-</italic>test. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and significant differences in survival were calculated via the log-rank test. Data are means ± the standard deviation (SD), and statistical significance was evaluated using the following 
 <italic>P</italic> values: 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05 (*), 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.01 (**) or 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.001 (***).
