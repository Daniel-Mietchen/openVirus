<p>C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center. The TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice were originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). The mice were housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions in individually ventilated cages. Three-day-old suckling mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS containing 1×10
 <sup>9</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml of EV71 with a 50-μl gastight microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). Following EV71 infection, mouse weights and clinical scores were recorded every day until one-week post-treatment. The clinical scores were defined as follows: 0, healthy; 1, ruffled hair and hunched back; 2, limb weakness; 3, paralysis in one limb; 4, paralysis in both limbs; and 5, death.
