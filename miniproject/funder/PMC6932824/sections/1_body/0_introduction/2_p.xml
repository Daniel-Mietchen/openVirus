<p>Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is widely expressed in immune cells, intestinal cells, lung cells, and neural cells. As a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR), TLR7 can recognize viral RNA, oligomeric RNA, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) from pathogenic sources to activate intracellular signaling pathways and release appropriate cytokines [

Emerging evidence suggests that beyond its function as an immune receptor in immune cells, TLR7 also serves as a death receptor in various forms of non-infectious central nervous system (CNS) injury, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and morphine-mediated neurodegeneration [
