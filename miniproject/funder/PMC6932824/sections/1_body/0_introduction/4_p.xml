<p>In this study, we conducted experimental intracranial infections with EV71 in neonatal mice, and found a non-significant viral load in the cerebral cortex of both wild-type (WT) and TLR7 knockout (TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Compared with EV71-infected WT mice, there was an obvious alleviation of neurological injury-related symptoms, histopathologic damage, and cell apoptosis, as well as lower brain IL-6 levels in EV71-infected TLR7
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further investigations revealed that intracranial IL-6 neutralization significantly relieved neurological injury-related symptoms and neural cell apoptosis in the brains of EV71-infected WT mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that EV71 preferentially infected and induced IL-6 production in murine brain astrocytes, and we further verified that TLR7 silencing and IL-6 blockade attenuated EV71-infected cell apoptosis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, we retrospectively found TLR7 upregulation, IL-6 induction and astrocytic cell apoptosis in EV71-infected human brain. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism underlying TLR7-mediated neural pathogenesis involved in IL-6 induction in astrocytes of the brain upon EV71 infection.
