<p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is an RNA virus that causes hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), commonly causing mild symptom in infants, but in some cases also leading to severe diseases such as aseptic meningitis (AM), brain stem encephalitis (BSE), acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and even fatal encephalitis in neonates [
