<p>In infectious contexts, TLR7 plays multiple roles relevant to neurological disorders and inflammatory responses in the CNS. When simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infects the brains of rhesus macaques, the secretion of microRNA21 activates the TLR7 pathway, leading to neurological disease [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008142.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It remains unclear as to what role is played by TLR7 in the brain following EV71 infection, and the molecular mechanisms by which TLR7-mediates viral neural pathogenesis remain unclear.
