  <title>The neuropathogenesis assessment in intracranially EV71-infected mice.</title>
  <p>There-day-old WT mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS, EV71-UV, EV71- Heated or EV71 per mouse (each group, n = 10–12) and sacrificed on day 1, 3 or 5 post-infection, respectively. (
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) EV71 virus in cerebral cortex (A) or cerebellum (B) tissues homogenate was subjected to plaque formation assay. The EV71 titers in tissues of mice (per gram) were quantified. PFU, plaque formation unit. Data are shown as mean ± SD. ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) The cerebral cortex sections of mice on day 1 post-infection from different groups were fixed and subjected to immunostaining with cl-Caspase-3 (Red), dsRNA (Green), and DAPI (Blue) (C). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. The relative expression of cl-Caspase-3 and dsRNA was quantified using Image J software (D). Data are shown as mean ± SD. (
   <bold>E</bold> and 
   <bold>F</bold>) The cerebellum sections of mice on day 1 post-infection from different groups were immunostained with cl-Caspase-3 (Red), dsRNA (Green), and DAPI (Blue) (E). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. The relative expression of cl-Caspase-3 and dsRNA was quantified using Image J software (F). Data are shown as mean ± SD.
