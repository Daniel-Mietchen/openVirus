  <title>Histopathological characteristics in brain tissues from EV71-infected human.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining of cerebral cortex sections from human brain tissues (uninfected and EV71-infected; each group, n = 3). The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) Cerebral cortex sections from EV71-infected or uninfected human were subjected to IHC staining with anti-EV71 VP1 antibody (B), anti-dsRNA antibody (C) or anti-TLR7 antibody (D). The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. The relative expression of indicated was shown as a positive index and quantified with Image J software. (
   <bold>E</bold> and 
   <bold>F</bold>) Human brain tissue sections were fixed and stained with GFAP (Green) and IL-6 (Red) (E) or cl-Caspase-3 (Red) (F). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. The relative expression of IL-6 or cl-Caspase-3 in GFAP positive (GFAP
   <sup>+</sup>) cells was calculated with Image J software. Data are shown as mean ± SD. *,
