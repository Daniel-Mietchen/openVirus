  <title>Immunofluorescence analysis in cerebral cortex of intracranially EV71-infected mice.</title>
  <p>There-day-old WT mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS, EV71-UV, EV71- Heated or EV71 per mouse (each group, n = 10–12) and sacrificed on day 1, 3 or 5 post-infection, respectively. (
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) The EV71 virus RNA copies in cerebral cortex (A) or cerebellum (B) were determined by absolute quantitative PCR. Data are shown as mean ± SD. ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) The cerebral cortex sections of mice on day 3 post-infection from different groups were fixed and subjected to immunostaining with cl-Caspase-3 (Red), dsRNA (Green), and DAPI (Blue) (C). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. The relative expression of cl-Caspase-3 and dsRNA was quantified using Image J software (D). Data are shown as mean ± SD. (
   <bold>E</bold> and 
   <bold>F</bold>) The cerebral cortex sections of mice on day 5 post-infection from different groups were immunostained with cl-Caspase-3 (Red), dsRNA (Green), and DAPI (Blue) (E). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. The relative expression of cl-Caspase-3 and dsRNA was quantified using Image J software (F). Data are shown as mean ± SD.
