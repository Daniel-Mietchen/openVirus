  <title>A proposed mechanism underlying the regulation brain pathogenesis upon EV71 infection.</title>
  <p>The neurotropic EV71 preferentially infects and replicates in astrocytes of mice and human brain cerebral cortex. EV71 ssRNA is then recognized by TLR7 to trigger the signaling events, which in turn dominantly promote IL-6 protein production in astrocytes. The release of IL-6 protein in EV71-infected cells affects astrocyte self and neighboring astrocytes, resulting in the induction of cell apoptosis. The dysfunctional astrocytes disrupt brain homeostasis, which systematically develops neural inflammation and injury in brain.</p>
