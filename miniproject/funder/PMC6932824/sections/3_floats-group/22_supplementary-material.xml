  <title>The neurotoxicity effect in U251 cells after R837 treatment.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) U251 cells were treated with different concentrations of R837 (0.5, 1, 5 or 10 μM) for 24 h. Cell viability (A) and LDH release (B) of treated cells were examined using CCK8 and LDH assay. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) U251 cells were treated with R837 (10 μM) or EV71 (MOI = 0.5) for 24 h. The supernatants of treated cells were collected and IL-6 protein level was measured by ELISA (C). The protein was extracted and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies (D). (
   <bold>E</bold> and 
   <bold>F</bold>) U251 cells were seeded on 20-mm cover slips and treated with different concentrations of human IL-6 protein (20, 100, 500 pg/ml) or Etoposide (150 μM) for 24 h, and then probed with cl-Caspase-3 (Green) and DAPI (Blue) (E). Cells were observed using fluorescence confocal microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. The relative cl-Caspase-3 expression was calculated (F). Graphs show mean ± SD. *,
