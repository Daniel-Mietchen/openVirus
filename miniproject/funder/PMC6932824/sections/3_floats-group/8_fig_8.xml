  <title>IL-6 blockade attenuates astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection in U251 cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The schematic of IL-6 antibody neutralization upon EV71 infection. 2×10
   <sup>6</sup> U251 cells were blocked with neutralized mouse anti-human IL-6 antibody (0.5 μg/ml) or mouse isotype IgG (0.5 μg/ml) at 2 h post EV71 infection (MOI = 0.5). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The supernatants of treated cells were collected and IL-6 protein level was measured by ELISA. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) Cell viability (C) and LDH release (D) of treated cells for 12, 24 or 48 h were examined using CCK8 and LDH assay, respectively. Data are shown as mean ± SD and correspond to a representative experiment out of three performed. ns, non-significant; *,

   <bold>E</bold>) The RNA was extracted from the transfected cells at 12 or 24 h post EV71 infection. The levels of apoptosis-associated genes mRNAs were measured by qPCR. Data are shown as fold changes of RNA expression compared to mock samples. (
   <bold>F</bold>) The protein was extracted from the transfected cells at 24 h post EV71 infection and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies. Relative PARP protein expression to internal control is quantified using Image J software.
