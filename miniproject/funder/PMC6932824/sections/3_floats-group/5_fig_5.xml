  <title>IL-6 plays a crucial role in TLR7-mediated neural pathogenesis upon EV71 infection.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The schedule of IgG isotype and anti-IL-6 antibodies blockade treatment after EV71 incubation in 3-day-old WT mice brain. Neonatal WT mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS or EV71 per mouse (each group, n = 8), and separately intracranially treated with IgG isotype or anti-IL-6 antibody (8 μg/per mouse) twice at Day 0 and 1 (black arrows). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The presentative images of mice on day 5 in indicated groups. (
   <bold>C</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>) The weight (C), clinical score (D), and Kaplan-Meier survival curve (E) were recorded from 1 to 7 days post-infection. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001. (
   <bold>F</bold> and 
   <bold>G</bold>) The brain sections of mice on day 5 in different groups were subjected to immunostained with DAPI (Blue), Neurofilament (Red) and EV71 VP1 (Green) (F) or TUNNEL (Green) (G). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>H</bold>) The mice brain sections from day 5 in different groups were subjected to IHC staining with cl-Caspase-3 antibody (Brown). The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. (
   <bold>I</bold>) The proteins were extracted from individual mice brain tissues on day 5 in different groups and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies. Relative Caspase-3 or cl-Caspase-3 protein expression to internal control is quantified using Image J software.
