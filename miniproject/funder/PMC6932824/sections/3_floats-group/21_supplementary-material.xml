  <title>EV71-activated TLR7 signaling is independent of TLR8 expression.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) WT or TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice cerebral cortex sections were stained with TLR8 (Red), GFAP (Green), and DAPI (Blue). The presentative images were captured using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold> and 
   <bold>C</bold>) U251 cells (2×10
   <sup>6</sup>) were transfected with siRNA (50 nM) target to TLR8 (siRNA-TLR8) or its control (siRNA-NC) for 24 h, and then treated with EV71 (MOI = 0.5) or R837 (10 μM) for another 24 h, respectively. The cell lysates were harvested for Western blotting to examine the expression level of TLR8, TLR7, and GAPDH (B). Cell viability and LDH release of treated cells were examined using CCK8 and LDH assay, respectively (C). (
   <bold>D</bold> and 
   <bold>E</bold>) U251 cells were treated with different concentrations of VXT-2337 (TLR8 agonist) (0, 1, 5 or 10 μM) for 24 h. The protein was extracted and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies (D). Cell viability and LDH release of treated cells were examined using CCK8 and LDH assay (E).
