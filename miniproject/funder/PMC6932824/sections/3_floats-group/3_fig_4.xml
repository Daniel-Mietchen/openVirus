  <title>TLR7 is required for EV71-induced neural cell apoptosis in the brain.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The mice cerebral cortex sections from WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice mock-infected or EV71-infected for 3 or 5 days were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining. The typical inflammatory cells infiltration or neurodegeneration were indicated by yellow arrows. The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice were sacrificed on 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection (each group, n = 3). The RNA was extracted from the brain tissues and the levels of 
   <italic>IL-1β</italic>, 
   <italic>IL-6</italic>, 
   <italic>TNF-α</italic>, and 
   <italic>CXCL-1</italic> mRNAs were measured by qPCR. Data are shown as mean ± SD. **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; ns, non-significant. (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) The WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice brain sections on 3 and 5 days post-infection were subjected to IHC staining with anti-IL-6 antibody (Brown) (C) and anti-cleaved-Caspase-3 (cl-Caspase-3) antibody (Brown) (D). The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. (
   <bold>E</bold>) The proteins were extracted from individual mice brain tissues and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies. Relative Caspase-3 or cl-Caspase-3 protein expression to internal control is quantified using Image J software. (
   <bold>F</bold>) The brain sections from mice on day 3 post EV71 incubation were subjected to immunostained with TUNNEL (Green) and DAPI (Blue). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>G</bold>) The RNA was extracted from the brain tissues on day 3 and 5 post EV71 incubation. The levels of apoptosis-associated genes mRNAs were measured by qPCR. Data are shown as fold changes of RNA expression compared to mock samples (PBS WT group).
