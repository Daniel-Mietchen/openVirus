  <title>The neuropathogenic effect in mice after R837 intracranial injection.</title>
  <p>There-day-old WT mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS or 10 μl PBS containing 50 μg R837 per mouse, and then sacrificed on Day 1, 3 or 5 post-R837 administration. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of the brain’s cortex from day 3 or 5 post-R837 administration was probed with IL-6 (Red), GFAP (Green) and stained with DAPI (Blue). The presentative images were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The mice cerebral cortex sections were subjected to cl-Caspase-3 (Red), GFAP (Green) and DAPI (Blue) staining. The presentative images were captured using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The IL-6 protein level in CSF from mice was detected by ELISA. Graphs show mean ± SD. *,
