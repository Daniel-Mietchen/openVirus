  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The map of genomic locus of 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> gene in wild-type (WT) and TLR7 deficiency (TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup>). In the generation of 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> gene knockout mice, the 
   <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter with a stop code was introduced under the gene's promoter in the replace of Exon 3 of 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> gene. A segment of exon 3 was replaced by a 
   <italic>LacZ</italic> gene and 
   <italic>LoxP</italic>-flanked neomycin resistance cassette. The targeting vector was introduced to embryonic stem (ES) cells. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>) The 3-day-old mice of WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> homozygotes (each group, n = 3) were sacrificed and the mice brain tissue were collected. The genome DNAs were extracted from individual mice brain tissue and then 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> gene deletion in genome was identified by PCR with specific primers as followed (B). WT Forward (WT Fw): 5’-AGGGTATGCCGCCAAATCTAAAG-3’; WT Reverse (WT Rev): 5’-ACCTTTGTGTGCTCCTGGAC-3’ and Mutant (TLR7 deletion) (Mut Rev): 5’-TCATTCTCAGTATTGTTTTGCC-3’. The lengths of DNA products are 183 bp, 183 bp and 454 bp, 454 bp for Mutant, Heterozygote, and WT, respectively. The mRNAs were extracted from individual mice brain tissues and then the 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> mRNA level was measured by qPCR with specific primers. The relative 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> expression value was determined by the ratio of TLR7/GAPDH (C). The proteins were extracted from individual mice brain tissues and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies (D). The cerebral cortex sections of mice brain were fixed and subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with TLR7 antibody. The positive TLR7 staining (Brown) was indicated by arrows in yellow (E). The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. (
