  <title>The dynamic replication of EV71 in U251 cells.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) U251 cells (2×10
   <sup>6</sup>) were seeded on a 6-well plate, then mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 0.5) for different periods. The total RNA was extracted from cells and EV71 RNA level was determined by qPCR. The 
   <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA is used as an internal control (A). The total protein was extracted from cells. EV71 VP1 and 3C expression were detected by Western blotting analysis (B). (
   <bold>C</bold>) U251 cells (2×10
   <sup>6</sup>) were transfected with 2 μg plasmid transcribing siRNA specific to TLR7 (shTLR7) or its control (shGFP) and then mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 0.5) for 12 or 24 h. IL-8 secretion in supernatants of the cell cultures was analyzed by ELISA. Graphs show mean ± SD. ns, non-significant.
