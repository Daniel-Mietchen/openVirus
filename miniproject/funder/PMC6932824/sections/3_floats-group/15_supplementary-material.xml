  <title>IL-6 protein production and EV71 load in different tissues of IL-6 Ab-treated mice.</title>
  <p>Neonatal WT mice were intracranially injected with 10 μl PBS or EV71 per mouse, and separately intracranially treated with IgG isotype or anti-IL-6 antibody. The different sections of mice on day 1 in different groups were subjected to IL-6 protein and EV71 load detection. (
