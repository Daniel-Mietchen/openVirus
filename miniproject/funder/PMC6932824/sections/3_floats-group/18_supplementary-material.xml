  <title>IL-6 expression and location in cerebral cortex of EV71-infected WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice.
  </title>
  <p>Neonatal WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice were intracranially injected with PBS or EV71. After 3 days EV71 incubation, brain sections from mice were subjected to immunostaining. (
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) The cerebral cortex sections were immunostained with DAPI (Blue), IBA-1 (Green) and IL-6 (Red). Bar = 20 μm. Cells were observed using fluorescence confocal microscopy (A) and the IL-6 expression in IBA-1-positive (IBA-1
   <sup>+</sup>) cells was calculated (B). (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>D</bold>) The cerebral cortex sections were immunostained with DAPI (Blue), NeuN (Green) and IL-6 (Red). Bar = 20 μm. Cells were observed using fluorescence confocal microscopy (C) and the IL-6 expression in NeuN-positive (NeuN
   <sup>+</sup>) cells was calculated (D). Graphs show mean ± SD. ns, non-significant; *,
