  <title>Distribution of EV71 in cerebral cortex and cerebellum of WT and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice.

  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold> and 
   <bold>B</bold>) WT mice and TLR7
   <sup>-/-</sup> mice mock-infected or EV71-infected were sacrificed on 2, 3, 5, and 7 days post-infection (each group, n = 3–5). The mice cerebral cortex sections (A) and cerebellum sections (B) were fixed and subjected to IHC staining with EV71 VP1 antibody (Brown), respectively. The presentative images were acquired using light microscopy. Bar = 100 μm. EV71 VP1 relative expression was shown as VP1 positive index and quantified with Image J software. Data are shown as mean ± SD. ns, non-significant.
