  <title>Immunofluorescence analysis of IL-6 and EV71 VP1 expression in spinal cord and skeletal muscle of IL-6 Ab-treated mice.</title>
  <p>Neonatal WT mice were intracranially injected with PBS or EV71 per mouse, and separately intracranially treated with IgG isotype or anti-IL-6 antibody. The spinal cord and skeletal muscle sections of mice on day 1 in different groups were immunostained with IL-6 (Red), EV71 VP1 (Green), and DAPI (Blue). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The presentative images of spinal cord sections were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The relative expression of IL-6 and EV71 VP1 in spinal cord was quantified using Image J software. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The presentative images of skeletal muscle sections were acquired using fluorescence microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The relative expression of IL-6 and EV71 VP1 in skeletal muscle was quantified using Image J software. Data are shown as mean ± SD. ns, non-significant; *,
