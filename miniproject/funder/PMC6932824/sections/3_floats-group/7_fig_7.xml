  <title>TLR7 promotes IL-6 production and astrocytic cell apoptosis upon EV71 infection.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) U251 cells were seeded on 20-mm cover slips and probed with mouse anti-GFAP or isotype IgG antibodies (Green) and DAPI (Blue). The cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Bar = 20 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>G</bold>) U251 cells (2×10
   <sup>6</sup>) were transfected with 2 μg plasmid transcribing siRNA specific to 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> (shTLR7) or its control (shGFP) and then mock-infected or infected with EV71 (MOI = 0.5) for 12 or 24 h, respectively. The total mRNA of treated cells was extracted. 
   <italic>TLR7</italic> mRNA and EV71 
   <italic>VP1</italic> RNA (B) as well as cytokines mRNA levels (C) were determined by qPCR. The supernatants of treated cells were collected and IL-1β and IL-6 protein levels were measured by ELISA (D). Cell viability and LDH release of treated cells for 12, 24 or 48 h were examined using CCK8 and LDH assay, respectively (E). Data are shown as mean ± SD and correspond to a representative experiment out of three performed. ns, non-significant; *, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01. The RNA was extracted from the transfected cells at 12 or 24 h post EV71 infection. The levels of apoptosis-associated genes mRNAs were measured by qPCR (F). Data are shown as fold changes of RNA expression compared to mock samples. The protein was extracted from the transfected cells at 24 h post EV71 infection and then detected by Western blotting with targeted antibodies (G). Relative PARP protein expression to internal control is quantified using Image J software.
