Evidence on community-based interventions through the lens of the targets has not yet been synthesized, reflecting a knowledge gap. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to shed light on successful community-based interventions that have been effective in contributing, directly or indirectly, towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets: knowledge of HIV status, linkage to care/on treatment, and viral suppression. Linkage to care was also included in this review due to the limitations of studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the period 2007&#x02013;2018. Eleven databases were searched to identify community-based interventions designed to improve knowledge of HIV status (in particular HIV testing), linkage to care/on treatment, and/or viral suppression. Eligible studies were classified by intervention, population, country income level, outcomes and success. Success was defined as interventions demonstrating statistical significance between intervention and control group or that reached any target by proportion; 90% testing, 81% linked to care/on treatment and 73% viral suppression.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Of 82 eligible studies, 51.2% (42/82) reported on HIV testing (first 90), 20.7% (17/82) on linkage to care/ on treatment (second 90), and 45.1% (37/82) on viral suppression (third 90). In all, 67.1% (55/82) of studies reported success; 21 studies on the first 90, 9 towards linkage to care/on treatment, and 25 towards the third. By strategies, 36.6% deployed community workers/peers, 22% used combined test and treat strategies, 12.2% used educational methods, 8.5% used mobile testing, 7.3% used campaigns and 13.4% used technology. For HIV testing/linkage, combined test/treat interventions were often used, for viral suppression, educational interventions and technologies were commonly deployed. Our pooled analysis suggested that deployment of community health care workers/peer workers significantly improved viral suppression (pooled OR: 1.40 95% CI 1.06&#x02013;1.86). Of the studies published after 2014, 50.0% reported metrics aligned with UNAIDS targets.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Data on linkage to care/on treatment (second target) remained weak, because many studies reported successes on the first and third targets. Stratification by targets and country income levels is informative and guides adaptation of successful interventions in comparable settings. Consistent reporting of clear metrics aligned with UNAIDS targets will aid in synergy of study data with programmatic data that will help reportage. Exploration of innovative interventions, for engagement and linkage and deployment of community/ peer workers is strongly encouraged.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Qu&#x000e9;bec - Sant&#x000e9;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research-Scholar Senior</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4672-0500</contrib-id><name><surname>Pant Pai</surname><given-names>Nitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operating grant HPP-137872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4672-0500</contrib-id><name><surname>Pant Pai</surname><given-names>Nitika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors acknowledge the support of the following agencies: the Fonds de recherche du Qu&#x000e9;bec &#x02013; Sant&#x000e9; Research-Scholar Senior Award (NPP), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Operating grants 137872 and PJT 153149 (NPP) and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (TP).

As of June 2017, about 37 million were living with HIV, with about 20.9 million [18.4 million&#x02013;21.7 million] accessing antiretroviral therapy [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the African region is disproportionately affected by HIV with an estimated prevalence among adults of 4.2% (3.7&#x02013;4.8) [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In response to the growing problem, in 2014 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) set an ambitious target known as the 90-90-90, that indicated that by 2020, 1) 90% of all HIV positive people will be diagnosed, 2) 90% of all those diagnosed will be on treatment and 3) 90% of those linked to care will be virally suppressed. According to the UNAIDS Global AIDS Monitoring Guidelines, HIV testing is ideally measured by determining the number of people who have been diagnosed with HIV divided by the total number of people living with HIV; linkage to care is measure by dividing the number of people who are on ART by the number of people who have HIV; viral suppression is measured by the number of people achieving viral suppression divided by the number of people with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These UNAIDS targets translate proportionally to 90% of all at risk to be tested/screened, 81% of those found positive must be on treatment and finally, 73% on treatment to be virally suppressed to stop the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In order to achieve the goals by 2020, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets call for countries to focus on HIV screening/diagnosis, and treatment/viral suppression simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>According to the 2017 Global AIDS Update, many countries are making significant progress towards the 90-90-90 targets; some countries have reached all three targets, and many are close to reaching them [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Progress varies due to differences in local epidemics and capacity of health systems, despite WHO&#x02019;s recommendation of ART initiation for all persons living with HIV [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A syntheses of gaps in the knowledge of HIV status, guides enrolment of the undiagnosed in care [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Evidence has shown there are no clear-cut methods of improving HIV testing, linkage to treatment and viral suppression. Furthermore, differing populations, country income levels, and social settings add layers of complexity when it comes to implementing interventions and determining whether they will be successful in these settings.</p><p>Countries such as Botswana and Australia, both with very different economic backgrounds have each shown that it is possible to reach some of the targets by way of concerted efforts, when resources are less readily available [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Closing the gap requires prioritizing HIV testing and rolling out initiatives in community settings [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Community-based interventions have become increasingly popular, with reported decreases in HIV-related mortality, virologic failure, and other adverse health outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Decentralization of services and task-shifting to community workers in low and middle-income countries is not only cost effective, but also achieves the same results as facility based-services [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, a systematic review on HIV testing in Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated that community-based testing had higher uptake compared to facility-based testing [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Community-based interventions are now being recognised as key to achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets through their ability to overcome structural and societal barriers in access to health care [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Although evidence on community-based initiatives has been synthesized prior to the announcement of the 90-90-90 targets, an updated, comprehensive review of community initiatives and outcomes, aligned to the UNAIDS targets was not available, precipitating a gap in understanding progress towards the targets [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, a need for a high quality review through the lens of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets that could serve as an evidence base for policy makers and stakeholders playing a key role in achieving global targets was felt. With no limitation on population and with the intention of understanding various successful interventions in high, middle and low-income countries such that they could be recommended to other countries of similar income levels, we decided to undertake this review.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to shed light on successful community-based interventions that have been effective in contributing towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, stratifying by intervention type and country income level. We also set out to determine if reporting of outcomes and/or metrics before and after the 2014 announcement of the UNAIDS targets were consistent and in line with the care continuum. With 2020 around the corner, it is vital that concise information regarding successful interventions be accessible to researchers, stakeholders and policymakers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines were followed in reporting this review (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0219826.s001">S1 Checklist</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Protocol registration</title><p>This review is unregistered.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data source</title><p>We searched eight databases for the period 2007&#x02013;2018; MEDLINE via PubMed, OVID, BIOSIS, LILACS, CINAHL, Cochrane DARE, Embase and Global Index Medicus, and three conferences (Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, International AIDS Conference and African Society for Laboratory Medicine).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Search</title><p>The search strategy for PubMed was ("hiv"[MeSH Terms] OR "hiv"[All Fields]) OR ("acquired immunodeficiency syndrome"[MeSH Terms] OR ("acquired"[All Fields] AND "immunodeficiency"[All Fields] AND "syndrome"[All Fields]) OR "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome"[All Fields] OR "aids"[All Fields]) AND (UNAIDS[All Fields] AND/OR 90-90-90[All Fields] AND (&#x0201c;youth AND/OR &#x0201c;adults&#x0201d;) AND &#x0201c;viral load&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>All experimental trials and observational studies were included.

Viral suppression was defined as having viral levels &#x0003c;1000 copies/mL, or as defined by the individual studies themselves; in some cases ART adherence was a reported outcome, this was used as a precursor to viral suppression, the rationale being that sustained ART adherence will result in viral suppression.</p><p>Targets were reported by metrics that varied across studies, were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Metrics varied from number of HIV tests conducted, attendance rate, linkage to care, ART adherence, pill count, viral load, CD4 count and self reported outcomes. Acceptability was defined as the willingness of participants to use community-based interventions. Feasibility was defined as the convenience of implementing such interventions. The lack of consistent reporting of outcomes and/or study design precluded pooling of measures for the majority of studies and therefore pooling was only performed where possible.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Risk of bias across studies</title><p>Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tools and the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale, for clinical trials and observational studies respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Study selection</title><p>Over 5000 studies were identified through the search, out of which 82 studies met our eligibility criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219826.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0219826.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0219826.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) Flow Diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0219826.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Study characteristics</title><p>By WHO geographical location, 25.6% (21/82) of the studies were conducted in the Americas, 3.6% (3/82) in Europe, 3.6% (3/82) in the Western Pacific region, 6.1% (5/82) in the South East Asia region and 68.3% (56/82) in the African region.

A greater number of initiatives focused on the first target, compared to targets 2 and 3 (increasing linkages to care or attaining viral suppression). According to the UNAIDS report, a greater focus on linkages was needed, and this seen in our review [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In particular, among the successful interventions, the use of community health workers (peers, lay workers, directly observed therapy, etc) was commonly deployed (25/55, 45.5%) showing positive effects across the three targets, especially in lower middle and low-income countries.</p><p>Community-based interventions demonstrated success when their implementations were tailored to country or community context. For example, in a country or community where multiple concurrent partners were common, the couples voluntary HIV counselling and testing was not an ideal way to increase test uptake [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Integrated or combined test/treat strategies were the next most common interventions used with positive results (13/55, 23.6%). HIV campaigns were common for testing and treatment, mobile interventions were commonly used for HIV testing and educational programs and digital strategies (technology interventions) deployed for viral suppression. Data from low and middle-income countries, with high HIV burden, dominated the data.</p><p>For the first 90, across all income levels, decentralized testing initiatives like mobile testing and home-based HIV testing and counselling services were able to reach vulnerable populations that may not have presented themselves to healthcare facilities for testing. Testing initiatives by members of a community (such as community health workers, lay workers, link workers, etc) and those familiar to the patients resulted in a much higher uptake of testing; this was especially true in middle and lower income countries [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similarly, mobile testing in a non-clinical setting also proved to yield far greater numbers of individuals being tested than in a clinical setting [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Of nine studies, three did not show a positive effect with linkages to care; 2 studies reached targets for HIV testing, yet linkage to care/initiation of ART lagged, even with community HIV care providers [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Combined test and treat interventions with creative integration services into antenatal care, for example, were successful in reaching the second target. Of note, none of the mobile testing interventions yielded success towards the second 90 [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], indicating that while mobile testing initiatives can largely increase testing uptake among hard-to-reach populations, linkages need to be designed, keeping the needs of the populations in mind. Communication of results is facilitated by these interventions, and that can improve their success rates.</p><p>Despite the WHO&#x02019;s recommendation on the implementation of ART for all HIV-infected people regardless of CD4 count, many lower income countries face limitations (i.e, financial, infrastructural and consistent availability of ARTs), that impedes success towards the second 90 [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. While the feasibility of providing CD4 counts onsite is heavily dependent on the economic context, having both CD4 count testing and ART initiation services available at the same time and location is effective in helping reach the second 90 target [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In particular, same day HIV testing and ART initiation has shown to improve retention in care and subsequent virologic suppression [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the third 90, nuanced evidence in support of the integration of linkage to care services with micro-clinics and informal social networks which are normally used for the management and prevention of chronic disease, can increase linkages and subsequent viral suppression [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Task shifting to home visits has improved adherence but findings need to be further confirmed in larger, well designed studies. Task-shifting is appropriate in reducing the burden at hospitals or clinics and can reach larger populations [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0219826.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, the spacing of home visits may have influenced patients&#x02019; adherence; more frequent visits may potentially close this gap.

Three studies (37.5%) using digital technology did not show positive outcomes. Nonetheless, the use of technology to improve ART adherence and viral suppression is a good alternative to the use of community health workers where patients may feel their autonomy is violated.</p><p>Text message-based programs in low and middle-income populations with high rates of mobile phone usage may improve test uptake, treatment adherence rates, and increase viral suppression, but frequency of text messages heavily influences adherence levels [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Furthermore, these messages have the potential to consider the psychosocial aspect of ART intake and potentially builds a relationship between patient and provider [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] if text messages are tailored. Similarly, educational interventions have also been successful in improving treatment adherence, but are more so a valuable component when integrated with other interventions.</p><p>In summary, using the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets as a framework creates momentum in our populations to reach the goals, furthermore, if studies reported according to the targets, using the metrics most commonly used, direct comparisons of intervention effectiveness can be made.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Strengths</title><p>This systematic review provides condensed information regarding interventions successful towards each of the 90-90-90 targets within income levels and by UNAIDS targets. Strategies must be multifaceted and designed to recognize the social context of the population in question.

Our study stands out in that we have not limited the outcomes nor excluded populations.</p><p>As with all systematic reviews, our study has limitations. Although an exhaustive literature search was carried out, by also including hand searched articles, our search strategy may have missed some articles and interventions. Furthermore, majority of the studies were observational and at high risk of various bias such as confounding and selection bias, thus decreasing our confidence in reported intervention effects. Additionally, due to the limited number of studies included in the meta-analysis, the potential risk of publication bias could not be assessed. A fewer number of studies results in a lower power of the tests to distinguish chance from real symmetry [<xref rid="pone.0219826.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Despite this, publication bias is a likely risk in this situation. Future systematic reviews and meta-analyses regarding community-based interventions and its effect on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets should consider assessing publication bias. Another limitation is that studies included in this review have shown variation in metrics used to measure all three targets. Some studies measured the first 90 by reporting only the number of people that tested or reporting first time testers, or an increase in HIV testing, but did not report a denominator, thus proving difficult to determine if an intervention is effective. Metrics to measure linkage to care also varied across studies; it was unclear whether metrics involved ART initiation or simply healthcare provider appointments to seek further care among others. Studies reporting on the third 90 used metrics such as viral loads or CD4 counts. Approximately 50.0% of the studies reporting on testing, linkage to care or viral suppression reported using metrics aligned to the targets. Additionally, some studies lacked a comparator group and among others, there was little consistency across populations, outcome metrics and interventions limiting the assessment of pooled effectiveness of interventions to its fullest extent. Furthermore, future reviews can focus on investigating, in more detail, successful interventions within specific regions that may be effective at any point within the cascade of care. This may allow for more pooling of studies to determine intervention effects.</p><p>Despite these limitations, this review draws strength from including over 80 studies, representing different interventions, populations and regions, that focused on various aspects of the UNAIDS targets, and also focused on other interventions that can help meet those targets directly or indirectly.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Use of community health care/peer workers is strongly recommended. Exploration of innovative interventions for linkage to care and to engage first time testers is encouraged. Besides, reporting of studies aligned with UNAIDS targets is recommended. Stratification by targets and country income levels is informative, and guides adaptation of successful interventions in comparable socio-economic settings. Consistent reporting of clear metrics aligned to UNAIDS targets is vital to informing policy initiatives. Finally, with 2020 fast approaching, resources need to be targeted to achieve the ambitious UNAIDS targets.
