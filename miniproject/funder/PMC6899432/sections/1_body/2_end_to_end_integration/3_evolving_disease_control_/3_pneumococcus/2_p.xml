<p id="p0160">Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been introduced in 134 countries, averting an estimated 250,000 pneumococcal deaths globally from 2000 to 2015 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Limited serotype replacement has been observed: non-vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has increased after PCV introduction, but increases are small compared to the impact against vaccine-type disease. Overall, PCV gives a sustained net decline in IPD 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. GVIRF participants described two future directions in pneumococcal vaccination. The first optimizes the number of doses and their schedule to improve sustainability without sacrificing impact. Current data suggest that a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose may provide better herd protection than the WHO-recommended three-dose primary series, and that a single primary immunization followed by a booster dose may be sufficient to maintain herd immunity. Additional studies are underway to evaluate alternative dosing regimens

 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. The second targets new vaccines that expand protection and prevent serotype replacement. Candidates in development include higher valency PCVs that address additional serotypes and protein or whole-cell vaccines that could have broad efficacy against all serotypes
