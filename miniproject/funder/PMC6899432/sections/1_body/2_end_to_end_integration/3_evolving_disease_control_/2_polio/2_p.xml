<p id="p0145">Three decades after the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate polio, the disease remains endemic in just three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Vaccines have been the mainstay of polio eradication, but the current vaccines have limitations as well as benefits. Oral poliovirus vaccines (OPV) contain live-attenuated viruses derived from the three types of wild poliovirus (WPV). These vaccines give individual protection against paralytic polio and block transmission of the virus. Rarely, the attenuated vaccine strains can give rise to circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV), which resemble WPV in transmissibility and virulence. Of the three vaccine strains, the type 2 vaccine strain is the leading cause of cVDPV. In contrast, inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) confer individual protection against all three types of poliovirus but do not block poliovirus transmission. As a result, in countries with a high risk of polio importation or transmission, OPV remains the primary tool for polio eradication
