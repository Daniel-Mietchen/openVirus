<p id="p0150">These properties of OPV and IPV add complexity to polio eradication, as illustrated by the “OPV switch.” In 2015, type 2 WPV was declared eradicated, creating an opportunity to halt use of the type 2 OPV strain. Accordingly, from April 17 to May 1, 2016, 155 countries representing approximately 130 million annual births switched from using trivalent OPV (tOPV) to a bivalent OPV without the type 2 vaccine. To reduce the risk of type 2 cVDPV emerging just as population immunity began to decline, the switch was made in synchrony in minimal time and included the destruction of tOPV stocks. In addition, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced into the routine immunization schedules to limit the risks of an immunity gap to type 2 poliovirus

Many of these strains arose before the switch, but some are likely to have originated from monovalent type 2 OPV used to contain outbreaks and others may have arisen from inadvertent use of tOPV.
