<p id="p0175">In the event of a pandemic there are multiple challenges to an effective response, including the significant delay between the start of the pandemic and the first availability of vaccine, and limited global vaccine manufacturing capacity. To address delays in vaccine availability, universal influenza vaccines are in development as described above. To address the capacity shortage and ensure national and regional supplies, several developing countries have been partnering with WHO to build domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity; six have achieved approval or conducted clinical trials of pandemic influenza vaccines. Notably, Thailand is now developing and manufacturing influenza vaccines and is building an influenza vaccine-manufacturing facility that will have a capacity to produce 60 million doses of an adjuvanted monovalent pandemic vaccine each year
