<p id="p0165">Rotavirus vaccines are in use in about half of all countries. There are now seven licensed rotavirus vaccines, of which four have received WHO pre-qualification. Their efficacy among children under five years of age is inversely related to the under-five mortality rate: these vaccines reduced rotavirus acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations and emergency department visits by 71% in countries with low child mortality and by 46% in countries with high child mortality. Significant reductions in hospitalizations have also been observed for non-vaccinated children in some settings, providing evidence for herd protection

GVIRF participants emphasized the importance of understanding how the gut environment influences responses to rotavirus vaccines, to improve vaccine performance. Non-replicating injectable vaccines, which may have better performance in all settings, are in development as an alternative approach to improving efficacy in countries with high child mortality
