<p id="p0185">GVIRF participants observed that, given limited resources, competing priorities, and alternative interventions for treatment or prevention, value propositions for new vaccines are an increasingly important decision tool. Full Public Health Value Propositions (FPHVPs) are intended to facilitate evidence-based decisions on vaccine investments. They help funders, manufacturers, and countries set priorities by describing the role of a new vaccine in the context of an overall disease-control strategy, providing an end-to-end review of evidence, and presenting a comprehensive analysis of the value of a vaccine. FPHVPs go beyond the customary perspective of direct individual health benefits and attempt to capture the full economic and societal benefits of vaccination. To prevent a lag between licensure and uptake, they identify evidence gaps that must be addressed, such as operational research needs for products with complex delivery requirements
