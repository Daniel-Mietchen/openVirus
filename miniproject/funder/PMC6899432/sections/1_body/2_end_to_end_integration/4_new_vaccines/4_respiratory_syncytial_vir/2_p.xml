<p id="p0190">As presented at GVIRF, the RSV research and development pipeline is robust. Three approaches are being pursued for protection of neonates and infants: maternal immunization during pregnancy; infant immunization shortly after birth; and passive immunization with mAbs. Interim efficacy results for the most advanced maternal vaccine candidate were reported after the GVIRF conference (39% against medically significant RSV lower respiratory tract infection (97.5% confidence interval: âˆ’1% to 64%)) 
 <xref rid="bib306" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. Infant immunization strategies are in earlier phase studies. Improved mAbs for passive immunization are under development as described above. As these products approach licensure, policy considerations such as the minimum acceptable efficacy, the effects of seasonality, the impact of concurrent conditions such as HIV infection on effectiveness of maternal immunization, and the delivery capacity of health systems must be addressed.
