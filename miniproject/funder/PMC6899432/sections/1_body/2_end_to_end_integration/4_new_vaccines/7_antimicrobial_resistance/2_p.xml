Ongoing activities aligned with the U.S. National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria are expanding funding opportunities for vaccines targeting antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and highlighting the value of vaccines in addressing AMR. As presented at GVIRF, new vaccines targeting
