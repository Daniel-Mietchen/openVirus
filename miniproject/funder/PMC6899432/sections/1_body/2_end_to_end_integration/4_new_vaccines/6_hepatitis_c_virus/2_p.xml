<p id="p0200">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence is 71 million infections globally, causing significant mortality from liver disease and cancer. Current hepatitis C control strategies focus on improving injection safety, diagnosis, and access to treatment. The leading HCV vaccine approach uses a heterologous prime-boost strategy to elicit cell-mediated effector immune responses. This candidate is being evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with data expected in 2018 (NCT01436357). While vaccines have the potential to transform hepatitis control, given the availability of effective treatments a strong value proposition for an HCV vaccine must still be established
