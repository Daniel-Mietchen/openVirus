<p id="p0115">Capacity for vaccine evaluation is crucial, particularly in public health emergencies. Regulatory decision-making in low- and middle-income countries is being strengthened through regulatory training exercises, joint evaluations, and initiatives such as the Developing Countries Vaccine Regulators Network and the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. Challenges remain, especially when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. The EMA and U.S. FDA have implemented alternative regulatory pathways to facilitate the evaluation, licensure, and use of new vaccines, including those for emerging infectious diseases. Other national regulatory authorities (NRAs) have similar, but not necessarily equivalent, programs. To streamline regulatory processes, the International Council for Harmonisation and WHO are engaged in regulatory harmonization and convergence to align requirements, technical guidance, and procedures. GVIRF participants emphasized the importance of reliance mechanisms, whereby high-capacity NRAs provide assistance to NRAs in other countries. WHO is developing guidance for countries on implementing these mechanisms.</p>
