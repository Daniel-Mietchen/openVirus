India’s vaccinology effort has helped to transform its biotechnology research landscape: ten years ago, Indian vaccine companies were struggling with the basics. Today, vaccine manufacturers have developed and launched new combination vaccines and new vaccines against diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, meningitis A, rotavirus, influenza, typhoid, and cholera, and are managing robust product development pipelines. India’s vaccine sector now aspires to contribute significantly to scientific knowledge, to drive innovation, and to increase impact through science and biotechnology.</p>
