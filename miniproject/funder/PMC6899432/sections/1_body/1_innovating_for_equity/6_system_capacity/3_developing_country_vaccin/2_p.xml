<p id="p0120">Developing-country vaccine manufacturers (DCVMs) are now supplying vaccines for ~84% of the worldâ€™s birth cohort annually, and 64 of the 147 WHO-prequalified vaccines are manufactured by DCVMs. Yet the low- and lower-middle-income countries they serve together account for only 12% of global vaccine revenues 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Meanwhile, DCVMs are under intense pressure to supply quality product at the lowest possible price. For example, UNICEF is now procuring DTP-HepB-Hib vaccine at less than $0.80 per dose, a price that may be unsustainable for some manufacturers
