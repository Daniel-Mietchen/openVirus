<p id="p0095">Indiaâ€™s Mission Indradhanush (MI) was launched in 2014 to improve immunization coverage in children and pregnant women. It ultimately reached 528 districts across 35 states and union territories, strengthening immunization through a multi-dimensional approach that combined capacity building, detailed planning, measurement and accountability, and use of information technology to find and reach the unreached. With political support at the highest levels, MI helped increase the proportion of fully immunized infants in India from 65% in 2014 to 78% in 2017. Its successor, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, is aiming to fully immunize 90% of Indian infants in 2018
