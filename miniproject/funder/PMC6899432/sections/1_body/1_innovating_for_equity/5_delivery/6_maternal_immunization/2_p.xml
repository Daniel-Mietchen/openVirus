<p id="p0110">Immunization in pregnancy is a well-established approach to preventing disease in mothers and infants. WHO recommends influenza and tetanus vaccines in pregnancy; additional vaccines are recommended in specific situations, such as disease outbreaks. Vaccines are also in development for maternal immunization to protect infants from RSV and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Programs immunizing pregnant women against tetanus have shown that multiple delivery approaches may be needed to reach the most vulnerable populations, and that issues of service quality and vaccine hesitancy must be addressed. GVIRF participants commented that operational research will be needed to efficiently deliver new maternal immunization vaccines and that introducing new vaccines for pregnant women will create opportunities to strengthen antenatal care. Any introduction must be supported by robust monitoring for poor pregnancy outcomes and adverse events following immunization, whether related or unrelated to the vaccine. The risk of a false attribution of poor outcomes to new products must be addressed, including by proactively educating communities about the frequency of poor pregnancy outcomes in the absence of vaccination.</p>
