<p id="p0075">For impact in low-income countries, mAbs must be affordable and available in sufficient supply. Antibody engineering is being used to improve potency, pharmacokinetics, and productivity to meet challenging target product profiles. Computational analysis is identifying mAbs predicted to have improved thermostability and other characteristics that support development. Alternative hosts and novel expression systems are reducing production costs. GVIRF participants commented that robust regulatory guidance and a WHO prequalification pathway will be essential to facilitate licensure, use, and impact of mAbs.</p>
