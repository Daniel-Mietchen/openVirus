<p id="p0070">Equine and human antibodies have been used for over a century to provide passive immunity; now monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) offer the potential for safer and more effective passive immunization. GVIRF presenters described progress in developing mAbs for prophylaxis and treatment of multiple diseases. For rabies, the first prophylactic mAb (Serum Institute of India, Rabishield), has been approved in India. To facilitate broader licensure and use of rabies mAbs, the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) is clarifying regulatory considerations, and WHO is evaluating policy recommendations. For HIV, the Antibody Mediated Prevention studies are testing a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 mAb, VRC01 (e.g. NCT02411539). These studies are expected to provide results in the 2020 timeframe. For respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a prophylactic mAb that requires monthly administration (AstraZeneca, palivizumab) has been on the market for over a decade. A Phase 2B study of an extended half-life RSV prefusion F-protein mAb in healthy preterm infants is nearing completion with results expected in 2018 (NCT02878330). If successful, this product would be more affordable than the existing mAb and require only a single administration. For influenza, broadly protective mAbs have applications in the treatment of severe influenza, prevention of infection when vaccination is not feasible (such as early during a pandemic), and for vaccine antigen discovery. The influenza mAb pipeline includes candidates with confirmed effects on virus shedding when administered post-challenge in CHIMs
