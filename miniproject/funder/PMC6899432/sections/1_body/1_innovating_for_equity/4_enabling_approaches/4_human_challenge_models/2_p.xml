<p id="p0065">Controlled human infection models (CHIMs) can accelerate vaccine development for diseases in which the infectious agent and its clinical course are appropriately understood, and where the CHIMs are safe and give consistent rates of infection. As described at GVIRF, CHIMs have been used to study pathogenesis, assess correlates of protection, and provide efficacy data for cholera and typhoid vaccine licensure, and down-select among enterotoxogenic

Development of CHIMs for some diseases has been challenging due to complexity in infectious agents and host-pathogen interactions, variable infection rates, and complex disease profiles. Participants called for: greater standardization of CHIMs; guidelines for CHIM studies used to support licensure; focus on end-user populations, for example through CHIM sites in endemic areas; and application of advanced immunology in CHIMs to identify correlates of protection.
