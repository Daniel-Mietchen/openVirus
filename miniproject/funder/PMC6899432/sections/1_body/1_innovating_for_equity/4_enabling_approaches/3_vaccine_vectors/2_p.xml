<p id="p0060">Among the many available vaccine vectors in development, two were highlighted at the conference: cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vectors and Plasmid Launched Live-Attenuated Vaccines (PLLAV). CMV-based vector vaccines elicit and maintain high frequency “effector memory” T-cell responses in mucosal sites, lymphoid tissues, and parenchymal organs of nonhuman primates. Because they efficiently re-infect and persist despite robust anti-CMV immunity, CMV-based vectors can be used repeatedly to induce responses against successive antigens

They can function as a live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine, as demonstrated by proof-of-concept studies in small animals and non-human primates. This approach has the potential to serve as a platform technology for other targets, including pathogens of epidemic potential such as Lassa fever virus.
