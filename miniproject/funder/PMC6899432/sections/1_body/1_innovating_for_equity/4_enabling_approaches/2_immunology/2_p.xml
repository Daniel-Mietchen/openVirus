 <italic>in vitro</italic> technologies for human immunology research and vaccine evaluation described at GVIRF include mass cytometry (CyTOF), which allows simultaneous analysis of 30–50 markers at single-cell resolution; single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing combined with Grouping of Lymphocyte Interactions by Paratope Hotspots (GLIPH), to identify convergence groups of TCRs and discover ligands or antigens for future vaccine design

 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>; and the MIMIC® system, which uses human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to simulate innate and adaptive immune responses in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model of the human immune system intended to provide clinically relevant information much earlier in the development process. MIMIC is now being used to identify malaria peptides with strong CD4+ T-cell response profiles for consideration in a novel malaria vaccine 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is expected that these and other immunological tools will contribute to a better understanding of protective immunity and to accelerated development and approval of new vaccines.
