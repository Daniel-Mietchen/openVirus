<p id="p0080">In response to the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, the WHO 
 <italic>R&amp;D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics</italic> was launched in May 2016 to accelerate research and development for vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics for epidemic prevention and response. As of 2018, the diseases prioritized under the 
 <italic>Blueprint</italic> are Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever, Zika, and “Disease X”, which refers to an emerging pathogen yet to be identified that may cause epidemic human disease in the future. Under the 
 <italic>Blueprint</italic>, roadmaps and target product profiles are being developed; current versions of these documents are available on the WHO website 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Norms and standards tailored to the epidemic context are being formulated, including approaches to regulatory pathways and ethical issues, clinical trial design, data and sample sharing, and capacity building. These roadmaps and guidelines should reduce the time between the start of an outbreak and the testing of candidate interventions.
