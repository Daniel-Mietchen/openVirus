<p id="p0035">Two pivotal HIV vaccine efficacy trials are underway and expected to provide efficacy signals around 2020. First, in a follow-on from the RV144 clinical trial in Thailand that demonstrated safety and modest efficacy for an HIV preventive vaccine

About half of the target population of 5400 adults have been enrolled in South Africa as of February 2018. Second, the HVTN705 trial, which is using an Ad26 vector prime with an Ad26+ gp140 env protein boost, is aiming for global cross-clade protection (NCT03060629). This study will enroll 2600 women in six African countries. Based on recent recommendations in high-risk populations, all participants are offered the state-of-the-art HIV risk reduction method, pre-exposure prophylaxis

HIV immunization strategies will pose delivery challenges because they will target high-risk adult populations that are not routinely vaccinated and require complex vaccination regimens: GVIRF participants noted that implementation research will be crucial to efficiently protecting these populations.
