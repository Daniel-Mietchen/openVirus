<p id="p0050">Cross-protective, “universal” influenza vaccines would transform both seasonal influenza prevention and pandemic response, as annual revaccination would no longer be necessary and doses could be stockpiled for rapid deployment in the event of a pandemic. Multiple candidates targeting conserved regions of the hemagglutinin protein are in clinical development 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. To facilitate development of a universal influenza vaccine, NIAID has established a definition for universal influenza vaccines, described a strategic plan and a research agenda for vaccine development, and is providing technical assistance for influenza vaccine research 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Under this definition, a universal influenza vaccine would be at least 75% efficacious against symptomatic influenza infection, protect against both group I and II influenza A viruses for at least one year, and be suitable for all age groups.
