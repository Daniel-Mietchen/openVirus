<p id="p0045">Having received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, (GSK, MosquiRixÂ®) will be deployed in pilot studies in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi beginning in 2019. These studies are assessing the operational feasibility, safety, and impact of RTS,S and will yield results in 2022, informing WHO recommendations for use and funding decisions 
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. While RTS,S is predicted to have substantial health impact 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, GVIRF participants observed that there remains a need for malaria vaccines with high and durable efficacy that are effective against both 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, that can interrupt transmission, and that are suitable for use in older children and adults (including pregnant women). Many of these gaps are being addressed through a diverse pipeline that includes monoclonal antibodies as well as vaccines that target parasites in pre-erythrocytic stages, asexual blood stage, and sexual stages
