High efficacy HIV, TB, and malaria vaccines remain difficult targets: participants called for a greater diversity of ideas and more innovative pipelines.

Even as new vaccines are developed and launched, nearly 20 million children still lack access to vaccines that have been available for many years. Innovation is urgently needed to improve access to vaccines and primary health care even as packages of interventions continue to expand. GVIRF participants highlighted two factors as crucial to meeting this need: a focus on equity and sustainability throughout the immunization ecosystem, and an enabling political environment that prioritizes health and immunization.</p>
