<p id="p0215">Every two years, GVIRF takes stock of global research in vaccines and immunization. The 2018 GVIRF highlighted the power of vaccines to improve health and enable progress, and showcased the energy and creativity of immunization stakeholders worldwide. Polio is nearing eradication, demonstrating the power of a well-coordinated global effort. Pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines have proven their value in preventing pneumonia and diarrhea, the two leading causes of child mortality, and the focus is now on improving efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Countries such as India and Thailand are making strides in their capacity to develop, manufacture and regulate vaccines; this progress was reflected by the strong participation by regional stakeholders. For the first time at GVIRF, the discussion of advances in vaccine delivery focused on health systems innovations rather than delivery devices, reflecting the end-to-end perspective needed to achieve the full potential of immunization.</p>
