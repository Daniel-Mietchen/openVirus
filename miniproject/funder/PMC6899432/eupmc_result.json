    "Every two years, the Global Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum takes stock of global research in vaccines and immunization. As in prior years, the 2018 meeting addressed vaccine discovery, development, decision-making, and deployment. This time, however, it also featured two overarching themes: \"Innovating for Equity\" and \"End-to-End Integration.\" Significant advances have been made in the last two years, but participants noted that some important goals of the Global Vaccine Action Plan are not being met and called urgently for innovation in improving access to vaccines. Two factors were highlighted as crucial to improving coverage: a focus on equity and sustainability throughout the immunization ecosystem, and an enabling political environment that prioritizes health and immunization."
