  <title>siRNA knockdown of mRNA and protein expression of targeted genes in A549 cells and the impact on influenza A/WSN/1933 (WSN) replication.</title>
  <p>(a) Knockdown efficiency of mRNA in A549 cells. Bars represent mean (+ SEM) knockdown relative to non-targeting siRNA 24 hours post transfection. (b) and (c) Knockdown efficiency of protein in A549 cells. Lysates from siRNA- and mock-transfected A549 cells were quantified using the BCA protein assay, then 10 μg (COPA, predicted size of 140 kDa) or 5 μg (RPS14, predicted size of 17 kDa) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as 2 biological replicates. The protein band intensities of COPA and RPS14 (green) were normalized to the levels of GAPDH (red). (d) Inhibition of viral replication when genes were targeted singly, or in combination. For each bar, the targeted genes are shown (X) below. The Allstars negative control (N) and siNP positive control (P) are shown. Results are displayed as normalized to viral growth in cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA. (* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01). A549 cells were transfected with siRNA 24 hours after plating. Cells were infected with WSN virus (MOI = 0.12) 24 hours following siRNA transfection and incubated for 48 hours prior to evaluating viral titer by plaque assay.</p>
