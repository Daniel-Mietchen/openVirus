  <title>Cytotoxicity of siRNA treatment in NHBE cells.</title>
  <p>Cell viability of NHBE cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours post siRNA transfection. Values are normalized to mean OD of cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA at each corresponding time interval after transfection. Relative values below 0.7 are considered toxic; all other values are considered viable, with those shaded in dark grey having the greatest cell viability (&gt;0.9) and those in light grey being near the cutoff for cell viability (0.7 to 0.79).</p>
