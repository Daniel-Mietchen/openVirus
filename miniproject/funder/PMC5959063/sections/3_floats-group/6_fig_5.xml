  <title>Inhibition of diverse influenza A virus in siRNA treated NHBE cells.</title>
  <p>The siRNA treatments listed on the left column were evaluated against each of twelve influenza strains noted across the top. Each combination was tested in triplicate and normalized to Allstars nontargeting siRNA. Relative mean viral growth is reported; 1.00 denotes no change relative to non-targeting siRNA, 0.50 denotes a 50% decrease in viral growth, and 0.00 denotes complete inhibition of viral growth.</p>
