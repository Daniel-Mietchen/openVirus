  <title>The activity of targeted host cell gene proteins in the influenza virus replication cycle.</title>
  <p>A schematic diagram showing the replication cycle of influenza virus and host genes required for influenza at different stages of the life cycle. The host genes targeted in this study are shown in black and the related part of the life cycle is shown in red. Five combinations were tested in addition to single knockdowns; the genes within each combo are denoted by symbols: combo1 (circle), combo2 (triangle), combo3 (square), combo4 (star), combo5 (diamond).</p>
