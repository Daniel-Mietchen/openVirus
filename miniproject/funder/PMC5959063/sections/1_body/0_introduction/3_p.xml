<p>Due to these limitations, novel prevention and treatment strategies are needed. In recent years, a large body of literature has been published examining the interactions of the influenza virus with cellular host factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several of these studies used RNA interference (RNAi) to detect host factors that influenza virus is dependent upon for successful completion of its replication cycle. These studies have produced somewhat divergent results, and most host genes identified as critical to influenza replication in one publication were not recognized as important in others [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Among the six, large-scale genome-wide RNAi screens, only three genes were consistently found in as many as four screens and only nine other genes were common to three screens [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These variations are thought to be due to different methodologies used and the occasional lack of specificity manifested by the identification of false positive hits [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Despite these inconsistencies, these RNAi-based technologies hold promise for identifying host-directed antiviral therapeutic targets. Small molecule influenza inhibitors including verdinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear transport compound, have already been identified based on the results of such RNAi studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. One important limitation of these drug development studies is the small spectrum of influenza strains and subtypes evaluated. Furthermore, there is a great potential for the emergence of novel strains, for which no vaccine has been produced and no information available regarding their susceptibility to antivirals.
