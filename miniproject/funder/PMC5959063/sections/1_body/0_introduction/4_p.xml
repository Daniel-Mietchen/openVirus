<p>The simultaneous inhibition of multiple host factors that interact with IAVs during their replication cycle may be one method of overcoming these limitations. The use of siRNA oligos as therapeutic agents has been met with challenges; however, delivery technologies are continuously improving and several candidate delivery vehicles for respiratory use have been identified [

In the experiments described here, we selected a small group of genes from the pool of hits previously identified as essential for influenza replication and evaluated them individually and in combinations in human respiratory epithelial cell lines as candidates for the prevention and mitigation of influenza infection. We evaluated the efficacy of our RNAi-based approach against a variety of human and non-human influenza strains and, due to toxicity concerns associated with suppressing host genes, we also examined the effect of RNAi treatment on host cell viability. We identified several individual and combinations of host-directed RNAi that were effective against a broad spectrum of influenza strains, meriting further investigation of combinatorial host-directed RNAi as a potential universal preventative or ameliorative therapy for influenza infection.
