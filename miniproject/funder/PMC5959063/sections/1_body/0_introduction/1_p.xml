<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are members of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family possessing negative-stranded segmented RNA genomes [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Wild birds are the natural reservoirs of IAVs, where they establish mainly asymptomatic infections. By virtue of their segmented genome and error prone RNA polymerase, IAVs are continuously evolving and frequent host switching is one of their prominent features. IAV makes species jumps from wild to domestic birds and various mammalian species, including humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to these annual epidemics, pandemic viruses emerging from host switch events have already caused tremendous losses that could be worse with the emergence of new viruses in the future [
