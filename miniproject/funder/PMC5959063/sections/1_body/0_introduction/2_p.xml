<p>Current prevention strategies for seasonal influenza involve the use of vaccines produced either in chicken eggs or tissue culture, but the time required for their production delays any large-scale prevention effort in the event of a pandemic [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A universal vaccine, providing effective and lasting immunity against all subtypes and strains of IAV, is not yet available despite promising strategies and experimental data in animal models [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Current treatment options for influenza virus infections include two classes of antivirals, the M2-inhibitors (e.g. amantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g. oseltamivir). There is widespread resistance to the M2-inhibitors, and while the neuraminidase inhibitors are currently effective against most influenza strains circulating in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the potential for emergence of resistance exists and has already been demonstrated [
