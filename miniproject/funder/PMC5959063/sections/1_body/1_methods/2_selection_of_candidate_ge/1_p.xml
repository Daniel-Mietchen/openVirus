<p>Genes identified in published genome-wide siRNA screens as indispensable for influenza virus replication [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were considered for this study if they met the following criteria: genes identified as hits in three independent publications, or as inhibitors of two strains of influenza in one publication (Karlas and colleagues, 2010) and one other independent study. Using this approach, out of the 1449 genes previously identified as hits [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], only 33 genes met our criteria (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197246.t001">Table 1</xref>). Subsequent to the design and completion of host gene selection and experiments, additional genome-wide screens [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and a meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have been published; however, our selection of host gene candidates was based on available data at the time of study design.
