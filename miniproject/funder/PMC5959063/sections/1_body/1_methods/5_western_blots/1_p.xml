<p>siRNA- or mock-transfected A549 cells were washed twice with PBS, then lysed on ice using RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher). The total protein content of cell lysates was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For COPA, 10 μg of total proteins, and for RPS14, 5 μg of total proteins, were mixed with 4X Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 2-mercaptoethanol, heated at 95°C for 3 min, then loaded onto a 10% precast polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and subjected to SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine buffer (COPA) or run on a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gel (Bio-Rad)(RPS14). Separated proteins were transferred under wet conditions to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), which were blocked for 1 h in SuperBlock buffer (ThermoFisher)(COPA) or using a semi-dry transfer method (Trans-Bot Turbo Transfer System, Bio-Rad) and blocked in Odyssey TBS Blocking Buffer (LICOR)(RPS14). Primary staining was done overnight at 4 °C using the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-COPA antibody (Sigma #HPA028024 at 1:500 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-RPS14 antibody (Abcam #ab66778 at 1:2000 dilution) and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (ThermoFisher # AM4300 at 1:2000 dilution). Membranes were then washed 3X in PBS-Tween (TBS-Tween for RPS14) and subjected to secondary staining using the following antibodies: IRDye ® 800CW Donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (LI-COR # 925–32213 at 1:5000 dilution) and IRDye ® 680RD donkey polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (LI-COR # 925–68072 at 1:5000 dilution). Stained membranes were then washed 3X in PBS-Tween (TBS-Tween for RPS14) and 1X in PBS (TBS for RPS14) and imaged using the Odyssey® CLx Imaging System (LI-COR). Quantitation of protein band intensity was conducted using the Image Studio Software (LI-COR).</p>
