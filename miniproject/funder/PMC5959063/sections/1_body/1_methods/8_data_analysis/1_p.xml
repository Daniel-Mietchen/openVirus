<p>For each strain of influenza used, titers were measured by plaque assay and normalized by dividing the titer of experimental siRNA-transfected cell supernatants by the mean titer of non-targeting Allstars control siRNA-transfected supernatants for the corresponding plate. Significant differences in the relative titer from experimental siRNA-transfected and control wells were assessed using a two-tailed independent t-test. All calculations were performed using the Graph-Pad Prism software (version 5.04).</p>
