<p>The A549 human lung carcinoma cell line (CCL-185, ATCC), Madin–Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK, CCL-34, ATCC), and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (CRL-3216, ATCC) were grown in DMEM media (Hyclone) supplemented with (4 mM L-glutamine, 4 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum (seradigm) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE, CC-2541, Lonza) were grown in Clonetics BEBM basal medium (CC-3171, Lonza) supplemented with BPE, hydrocortisone, hEGF, epinephrine, transferrin, insulin, retinoic acid, triiodothyronine, GA-1000 (CC-4175, Lonza). The influenza virus strains A/WSN/1933(H1N1), A/NewJersey/8/1976(H1N1), A/Netherlands/2629/2009(pH1N1), A/HongKong/8/68(H3N2), A/Nanchang/933/1995(H3N2), A/Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), A/Wisconsin/15/2009(H3N2), A/NWS/34(HA)xA/RI/5/57(NA)(H1N2) (BEI resources,

The strains A/mallard/interior Alaska/6MP0758/2006(H10N8), A/mallard/Interior Alaska/10BM05347R0/2010(H7N3), and A/mallard/Interior Alaska/10BM02980R0/2010(H9N2) were grown in the allantoic cavities of 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK monolayers as previously described [
