<p>Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were washed twice with OptiMEM and infected with influenza at the specified MOIs in 50μl infection buffer (OptiMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 60 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed again with OptiMEM and incubated for 48 hours (in case of the WSN virus) or 24 hours (for all other strains) at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 4 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics (A549) or BEGM with supplements (NHBE). For all strains other than WSN, 0.25μg/ml TPCK trypsin was added to the incubation medium. After the indicated incubation periods, supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C. Three independent wells were infected with each influenza strain evaluated for each siRNA or combination of siRNAs. Three independent wells for each siRNA transfected with Allstars non-targeting siRNA as the negative control, Allstars cell death siRNA, and siNP were included in every plate. To account for any variability across assays, each experimental condition was normalized against the Allstars non-targeting siRNA within the same plate. Values are reported as mean viral growth relative to the non-targeting control (a value of 1.00 denotes no treatment effect, while a value of 0.00 denotes complete inhibition).</p>
