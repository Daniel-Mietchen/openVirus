<p>The WST-1 assay (Roche) was used to evaluate host cell viability after siRNA transfection. Twelve μl of the WST-1 reagent were added to each well containing transfected cells at specified times after siRNA transfection and incubated for 90 minutes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm and at the reference wavelength 690 nm using the SpectraMax M3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. Non-targeting siRNA Allstars and cell-death siRNA Allstars (Qiagen) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cell viability was tested in three biological replicates for each siRNA or combination of siRNAs at each time point. The cutoff for viability was chosen as three standard deviations less than the mean optical density of cells transfected with non-targeting Allstars siRNA at each time point [
