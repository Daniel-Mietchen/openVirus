<p>To evaluate the broad-spectrum inhibitory effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on a diverse group of influenza A virus subtypes, treated NHBE cells were infected at a MOI of 1.0 with a panel of influenza viruses. It is thought that pandemic influenza could arise from the wide variety of subtypes to which human hosts are generally na√Øve (non-H1 or H3). However, recent events with pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009 have shown that even subtypes to which humans are exposed may emerge with passage through a variety of intermediate mammalian hosts. Therefore, while not intended to encompass all possible sources of infection or potential subtypes, we chose a small group of influenza A viruses representing human seasonal strains, a recent mammalian H3 isolate of concern, as well as a small group of diverse subtypes that have recently caused spillover infection to humans from the avian natural reservoir. In addition to the H1N1 isolate WSN, we evaluated seven additional representative human H3N2 and H1N1 strains isolated over a 50-year period, an H3N8 isolated from harbor seals in 2011, and three diverse strains (H7N3, H9N2, H10N8) isolated from mallard ducks (

In general, the RNAi combinations demonstrated the greatest magnitude of efficacy in suppressing viral replication against the entire group of influenza strains tested. However, combo 5 was relatively inefficient, and the single target siNXF1 was a strong inhibitor on its own.
