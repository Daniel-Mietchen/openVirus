<p>To better approximate 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, including a more applicable approximation of the toxic effect of host-directed combinatorial RNAi, knockdowns were subsequently evaluated in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) (

Based on the promising viral inhibition results obtained with A549 cells, we sought to explore the antiviral efficacy of additional target gene combinatorial knockdowns in NHBE cells. Most targets achieved a robust knockdown (&gt;90%), though the nucleo-cytoplasmic targets NUP98 and NXF1 were less efficient than the other targets. The comparable knockdown levels attained for each individual component within a combination treatment are shown for one representative combination (
