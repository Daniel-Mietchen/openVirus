<p>As seen with A549 cells, most of the single targets resulted in significant reduction of WSN infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197246.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). There were, however, differences between the two cell types tested; for example, RPS14 knockdown strongly inhibited viral infection in NHBE but not A549 cells, and knockdown of NUP98 was inefficient in NHBE cells despite inhibiting virus in A549 cells. As with A549 cells, the PGD knockdown showed no effect on viral replication in NHBE cells, but was evaluated in combination with other genes to determine whether the knockdown of PGD produces a synergistic effect in this context. Notably, significant evidence of WSN inhibition was once again demonstrated for all five combinations tested.
