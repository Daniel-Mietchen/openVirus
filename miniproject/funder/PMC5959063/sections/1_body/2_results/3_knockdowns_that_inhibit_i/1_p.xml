<p>NHBE cells transfected with single or combinatorial siRNA were evaluated for viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197246.g004">Fig 4</xref>). After 24 hours, all cells maintained viability above the level considered toxic (70%), although RPS14 was just above the cutoff. By 48 hours, siRPS14 treated cells dropped to 50% viability, and after 72 hours, siNXF1 treated cells had poor viability, as did cells treated with combos 2 and 4. Absorbance (A450-A690) for each replicate at each time interval following transfection is presented in
