<p>The influenza strain A/WSN/33 (WSN) replicates rapidly in both transformed and primary human lung epithelial cells, and the genes targeted with siRNA in this study have individually been found to be essential for replication of the WSN strain in previously published experimental studies using RNAi [

The PGD knockdown showed no effect on viral replication and was not evaluated further in combinations. Viral inhibition was evaluated in five combinations of four siRNAs, targeting different parts of the viral replication pathway (shown in the table beneath
