<p>Seven representative genes among the 33 identified targets were selected as putative candidates for single and combinatorial RNAi experiments (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197246.t001">Table 1</xref>, bold). The selected candidates interact with influenza at multiple stages of the viral life cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197246.g001">Fig 1</xref>). siCOPA and siARCN1 impact endosomal transport, possibly interfering with endosomal transport of the internalized virion as well as protein trafficking of newly synthesized viral proteins [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. siATP6AP1 inhibits viral fusion by impacting acidification of the endosome [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. siNUP98 may impact nuclear import of viral RNA, and both siNUP98 and siNXF1 impact nuclear export of viral mRNA [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. siRPS14 may interfere specifically with viral translation [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Although the PRPF8 gene, which is involved in the splicing machinery, was reported by three independent publications as important for influenza virus replication, it was not included in our study due to the likely cytotoxic effect of its knockdown as demonstrated in prior studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The PGD knockdown showed no effect on viral replication in A549 cells. siPGD has been identified as required for viral replication by three independent studies and is known to impact microtubule and cytoskeletal rearrangements, though the precise mechanism of action for inhibiting influenza replication is unknown.
