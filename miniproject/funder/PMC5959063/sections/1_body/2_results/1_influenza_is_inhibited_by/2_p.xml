<p>The selected gene targets were validated in an established 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model system for influenza infection using A549 respiratory cells and influenza virus strain WSN (H1N1). The A549 immortal human lung adenocarcinoma line has been frequently used in host-directed RNAi screens due to the relative ease of culture and maintenance of these cells compared to primary lung cells, and because human influenza viruses replicate efficiently in these cells [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197246.g002">Fig 2A</xref>); attempted knockdown of NXF1 resulted in a high degree of cytotoxicity and was not evaluated further in this cell line. When multiple genes were targeted in combination, the level of knockdown attained was comparable or slightly less robust than that attained during single targeting. The weakest knockdown level observed was with ARCN1 targeted as part of a combination (67% knockdown) as opposed to singly targeted (90% knockdown). To confirm gene knockdown at the protein level, 2 representative targets (COPA and RPS14) were selected for further assessment using western blotting. After normalization to the housekeeping GAPDH protein, quantitation of band intensities revealed knockdown levels of approximately 40–60% for COPA (
