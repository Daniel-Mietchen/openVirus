<p>The results of host-directed RNAi experiments presented here demonstrated that combinatorial RNAi generally performs better than single gene targets in terms of both strength and breadth of influenza inhibition. This conclusion has important implications for influenza biology and ramifications for the design and development of siRNA as a pharmaceutical agent.</p>
