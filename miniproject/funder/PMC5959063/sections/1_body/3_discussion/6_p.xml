<p>In addition to refining the optimal targets that maximize antiviral strength and breadth

 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models for study before such an approach can be pursued as a universal treatment for virus infections. These include methods of delivery as well as a more detailed assessment of off-target effects and toxicity. However, given the exquisite adaptability of influenza, and RNA viruses in general, such efforts to develop alternative therapeutic approaches are warranted. The work presented here strengthens the argument that a multifaceted treatment approach has broader efficacy than a narrowly focused one, and begins to demonstrate that it may be possible to target host gene expression to broadly inhibit diverse viral pathogens without harming the host.
