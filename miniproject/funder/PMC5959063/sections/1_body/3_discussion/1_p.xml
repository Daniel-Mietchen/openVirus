<p>Influenza is an incredibly diverse virus that can rapidly evolve or reassort its genome content, and as frequently seen in the recent past, there is a continual potential for newly emerging zoonotic strains [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. While RNAi of a single gene (e.g. ATP6AP1, COPA, or ARCN1) inhibited replication of many strains of influenza tested here, there were several endemic strains that were not inhibited, and inhibition of diverse strains (e.g. H7N3, H9N2) was particularly weak in the absence of combinatorial RNAi. The most important advantage of combinatorial RNAi is in the potential coverage against viral escape mutants. Given the high rate of viral evolution, therapies that rely on a single step in the viral life cycle are highly vulnerable to the development of resistance; a fate well described in the early developments of antiretroviral monotherapies against HIV. These same limitations likely apply to the use of small molecule inhibitors directed against host proteins; therefore, despite promising results in experimental studies using a limited number of strains [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a therapeutic strategy based on inhibition of a single host factor may only be efficacious against a narrow array of influenza strains and be prone to resistance. It is also important to note that while any therapeutic modality that is based on inhibition of multiple host factors poses the potential for toxicity in the host, toxicity is not inevitable. As seen with combinations 1 and 3 in the NHBE cell viability experiments, it is possible to combine siRNAs against multiple host genes in a manner that inhibits virus but does not adversely impact cell survival. Nonetheless, it will also be important to develop better means of assessing potential detrimental off-target effects of the siRNAs used, particularly when considering therapeutic use. It is equally important to note that while some combinations may effectively inhibit viral replication with little impact on cell viability early on, toxicity may still be an issue at later time points, a profile seen with combinations 2 and 4. Therefore, based on a relatively low cytotoxicity and high efficacy, resulting in a greater than 85% reduction in relative titer across all IAV strains evaluated, combination 3 should be considered to have the greatest potential among all of the single genes and combinations of genes used in this study for antiviral therapeutic development. However, other efficacious single gene and combinatorial RNAi should not be excluded from further evaluation based on
