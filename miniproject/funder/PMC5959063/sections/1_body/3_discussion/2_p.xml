<p>The experiments in this study involved a limited number of host gene products. The efficiency of siRNA-targeted knockdown of these genes was assessed previously, both at the RNA [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Based on the initial findings described here, a comprehensive assessment of potential targets and their combination is justified. The combinations included in this study ranged from three to five targets, and included only a subset of potential targets identified for each part of the viral life cycle. For example, while nuclear export appears to be an important step to target, siNXF1 suffered from cytotoxicity and suboptimal knockdown efficiency, therefore KPNB1 could be evaluated as an alternative, targeting a similar part of the life cycle. In contrast, some genes that were initially identified as potentially important targets, may not be ideally suited for inhibiting diverse influenza strains. In some instances, results of the WST-1 assay revealed cytotoxicity of individual siRNAs when used singly compared to the same siRNAs when used in combination. For example, the single use of siRNA against RPS14 and NXF1 resulted in lower cell viability relative to combo 3, which includes the same siRNA concentrations. The reason for this is not known, but may suggest a potential biological interaction between the individual gene products that warrants additional study.
