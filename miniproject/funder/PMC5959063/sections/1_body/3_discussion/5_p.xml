<p>While the current study focused on the potential use of RNAi targets against diverse influenza strains, the strategies reported here have the potential for an even broader application. The same genes that were the focus of this study on IAV have also been identified as essential host factors for the replication pathways of a number of other taxonomically distant viral pathogens. These viruses include HIV-1, Hepatitis C virus, Human Parainfluenza virus type 3, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Rotavirus, Vesicular stomatitis virus, prototype alphavirus Sindbis virus, Vaccinia virus, and West Nile virus [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The siRNA combination COPA/ARCN1/NUP98/ATP6AP1/RPS14 (COMBO 1), for example, contains siRNA for genes that are essential for the viral life cycle of each of the aforementioned viruses and studies following up our work should evaluate the effectiveness of this approach against multiple pathogens as a logical next step that would also help confirm the physiological function of these targets in the influenza life cycle. Furthermore, additional analyses, published since the conclusion of our work, have suggested additional targets that may be interacting with influenza and other viral pathogens. An example of this is URB4 [
