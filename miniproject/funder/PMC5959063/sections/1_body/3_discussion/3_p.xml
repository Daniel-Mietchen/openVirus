<p>Despite previous findings that the gene PGD is essential for influenza replication [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], knockdown of PGD did not result in any suppression of influenza WSN replication in our hands in A549 or NHBE cells. Discordant findings are common in investigations of the activities of large numbers of host genes and their effect on virus replication. Proposed reasons include differences in cell lines, viral strains, siRNA sequences, criteria to determine whether a given target is considered validated, or other difference in experimental conditions. Hao et al (2008) identified PGD as a target associated with altered influenza replication using a genetically modified influenza virus in Drosophila cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; and Shapira et al (2009) validated PGD using the PR8 strain in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0197246.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, it is unclear why PGD siRNA did not perform as expected in our assays.
