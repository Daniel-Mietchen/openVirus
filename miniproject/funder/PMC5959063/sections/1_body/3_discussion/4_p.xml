<p>An additional advantage of a combinatorial RNAi approach is the potential to reduce toxicity of a given target by reducing the concentration applied. Theoretically, if numerous targets in the combination are having a small effect, the importance of any one in the combination could be reduced. Alternatively, the higher concentration may be necessary to maintain breadth of activity against influenza strains. In this study, we held siRNA concentrations steady across single and combinatorial groups to avoid confounding the analysis. We therefore did not assess the impact of siRNA concentration in this study, but a more comprehensive assessment should include titration of RNAi concentrations in evaluating the potential clinical use of combinatorial RNAi.</p>
