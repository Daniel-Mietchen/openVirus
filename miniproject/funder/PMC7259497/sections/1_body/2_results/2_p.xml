<p>In terms of model fitting, the posterior for transmission heterogeneity 
 <italic>h</italic> was both within the broad support of the prior and more precise than the prior after being informed by the data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Too much flexibility in 
 <italic>θ</italic> caused the model to explain most cases in terms of detectability, rather than the epidemiological processes. In these cases, 
 <italic>θ</italic> tended to settle on posterior values that were too large compared to expert opinion for rabies and known limits of passive surveillance. Specifically, we found that wider priors for 
 <italic>θ</italic> (e.g. mean = 0.10, variance = 0.01), went to biologically implausible areas of parameter space (around 30-40% of cases observed) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0220592.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The more flexible model also resulted in larger unrealistic values of 
 <italic>h</italic> and poor model convergence that we believe is due to the biological processes not being captured effectively. We addressed this pragmatically by incorporating expert opinion into our prior for detectability (mean = 0.05, variance = 0.00025).
