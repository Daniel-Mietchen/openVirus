<p>Across all regions the number of reported annual fox rabies cases ranged from 959 to 2375 pre-vaccination, with 2277 cases in 1990, the first year of vaccination. A swift decline in rabies followed, with 1643, 321, 28, 4 cases detected in the subsequent years. Fitting the model to the fox rabies case data generated estimates of local transmission and spatial coupling between regions. The model captured key aspects of fox demography including the birth pulse, fluctuations in fecundity with environmental noise, and in surveillance, yielding a close fit to the case data in all 5 regions (

Using our fitted parameter values in Eqs

The model accommodated uncertainty in the biological and observation processes, allowing inference of missing time series of infected, susceptible, and vaccinated individuals by latent process methods.
