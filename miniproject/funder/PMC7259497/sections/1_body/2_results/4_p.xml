<p>The multi-year peaks in observed cases are largely explained by the annual birth rate and variation in both the observation rate and environmental noise (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The environmental noise term influences the size of the susceptible population by increasing or decreasing the size of the birth pulse. In the model this results in more infected individuals, while a larger observation rate means that although more cases were detected, fewer cases occurred overall.
