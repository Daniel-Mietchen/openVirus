<p>From the plot of the probability integral transform calculated from the MCMC samples of the model fit, we can see that the model does not capture the largest peaks in observed cases and misses some of the observed cases between the birth pulses, when the population is at its lowest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In the model, mortality is constant across the population, however, foxes experience a higher rate of mortality in the first months of life. Therefore, sharper population declines might be expected to follow the birth pulse due to this high juvenile mortality. Generally the fluctuations in observed cases were more variable compared to the model expectations. This could be because the model only allows for annual variability in the probability of detection and environmental variability rather than monthly variation. This was a deliberate modelling choice, as we found that too much flexibility in the detection probability or environmental noise (i.e. allowing these variables to vary by month or have a wider prior) resulted in overfitting and came at the expense of convergence of the other parameters, in particular transmission heterogeneity. Even though the fitted model expects a more gradual and smoothed number of cases than the observed data and the credible intervals are misleadingly narrow, the expectation is not far off from the observed cases and the model successfully captures the effect of vaccination.
