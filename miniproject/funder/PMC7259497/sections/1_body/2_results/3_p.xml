<p>The posterior for

 </sub> (the rate at which infected foxes leave their focal region) supported our hypothesis of connectivity between regions by moving away from 0. The posterior distribution of the environmental noise term 
 <italic>τ</italic> shifts to the left of the prior, which suggests that the population fluctuates slightly more than specified by the prior. Although the fluctuations estimated from the model were larger than previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], they rarely exceeded 10% with the largest reaching 15%. This could be due to more extreme environmental changes during this period compared to when Lindström’s study was conducted.
