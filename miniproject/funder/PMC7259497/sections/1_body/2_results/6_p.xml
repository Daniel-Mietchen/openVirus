<p>Under the fixed vaccination rate (mean = 0.30, variance = 0.005), herd immunity peaked at between 60-75% of the population vaccinated in each region (

Swift reductions in herd immunity occurred due to the entry of juvenile foxes into the population three months after the birth pulse (July), reducing the percentage of vaccinated individuals in the population by more than half. Between the annual entry of juvenile foxes, levels of herd immunity were maintained as vaccinated and susceptible individuals experience the same rate of natural mortality and rabies only claims a small proportion of the susceptible population (
