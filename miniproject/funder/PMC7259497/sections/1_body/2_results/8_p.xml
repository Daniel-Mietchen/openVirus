<p>From the model projections, the most dominant features were oscillations due to the entry of juvenile foxes after the birth pulse (

In the first prediction, when the model is only provided with the first data point in the time series, all of the cases fall within the credible intervals and the majority of data points are within the middle 50% of the credible intervals, which suggests that the model prediction is too broad (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The modelâ€™s prediction improves when provided with the first 20 data points in the time series and is good at projecting the long-term behaviour and decline of rabies. However the prediction misses the tail end of the cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Although the credible intervals around the model predictions reduced when more data was provided, the model was unable to capture the multi-year oscillations in cases, which in the model fit were explained by annual fluctuations in environmental noise and variation in the annual observation rate (
