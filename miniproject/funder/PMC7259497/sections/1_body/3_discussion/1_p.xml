<p>Approaches to understand interactions between spatial and demographic processes are likely to reveal key insights into disease dynamics in wildlife populations. Here, we present a method to capture local transmission processes and spatial coupling between regions from partially observed data on wildlife diseases. Using a hierarchical Bayesian State-space metapopulation approach we were able to recreate observed dynamics, and infer missing time series by latent process methods. Specifically we find that (i) spatial coupling and local transmission can be estimated from aggregated data using a metapopulation modelling approach and a heterogeneous mixing term that captures the low incidence dynamics of rabies at a regional level; (ii) incursions of rabid foxes from other regions that account for less than 1% of cases are sufficient to trigger rabies re-emergence; and (iii) herd immunity achieved through bi-annual vaccination campaigns is short-lived due to fox population turnover. Together these findings have important practical implications for the design of control measures.</p>
