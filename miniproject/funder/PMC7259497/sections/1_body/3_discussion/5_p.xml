<p>Herd immunity in foxes is dynamic as a result of demographic processes, declining by more than half following entry of juvenile foxes into the population following the birth pulse. Influxes of new susceptible individuals may result in isolated infections becoming rapidly reconnected with susceptible hosts and transmission maintained in the absence of adequate immunity [
