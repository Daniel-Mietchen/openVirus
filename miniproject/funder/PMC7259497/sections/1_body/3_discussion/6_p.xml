<p>While our model generally captured rabies dynamics, it struggled to capture monthly variation in cases and long-term multi-year dynamics. The strongest mechanistic feature of our model driving these fluctuations was the entry of juvenile foxes into the population after the birth pulse. This is evident from both model projections with 1 or 20 data points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220592.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). Although the credible intervals around the model predictions reduced when more data was provided (20 data points compared to 1 data point), the model did not capture multi-year oscillations in cases, which were explained by the annual environmental and observation noise parameters. It is probable that changes in resource availability and variation in detection explains some of the variation, but, we did not have any data to inform these parameters aside from expert opinion. We speculate that nuances in the dynamics may be obscured due to the aggregation of data. The behaviour of the observation parameter 
 <italic>Î¸</italic> over time suggests either marked changes in case detection or other mechanisms not being captured that the model is apportioning to the observation rate. In analysing the data at a finer spatial scale we observe multiple foci of cases within a region. However, because the data are aggregated these local dynamics are not evident. Nonetheless, the model expectation is not far off from the observed cases and the model successfully captures the effect of vaccination. Therefore, although the model fit is overconfident, overall it does a good job of capturing the disease dynamics.
