<p>Partially observed disease data is common in the study of wildlife disease. Using a Bayesian state-space model we were able to accommodate uncertainty in the biological and observation processes and infer missing time series by latent process methods. By combining a metapopulation model representing space as a network of subpopulations with different rates of coupling, and a transmission process that approximates the scaling of individual interactions to regional dynamics, we provide a framework to estimate the rate of incursions and to model local dynamics. The heterogeneous mixing term involved a decay function that allowed for a reduction in transmission as the number of infected individuals increased. Our approximation was able to capture the low incidence of fox rabies and prevented unrealistically large epidemics. Earlier studies have accounted for heterogenous mixing in childhood diseases [
