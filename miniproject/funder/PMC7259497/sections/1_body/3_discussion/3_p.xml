<p>We report an 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimate for rabies in red foxes, but this was sensitive to the susceptible fox population size, which is not known for this area and is expected to fluctuate seasonally. Since our model operates in discrete time (in monthly intervals), we also implicitly assume a generation interval of one month for fox rabies. While this assumption is reasonable, it may still introduce bias to our 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimate. Fitting to more localized outbreaks rather than to region-scale dynamics might also generate more accurate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates. Nonetheless our estimate of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> was comparable to those from the literature, including 1.26 from an outbreak in Italy [
