<p>Incursions can play a crucial role in sustaining disease circulation, however many models do not explicitly consider between-region transmission. We estimated that incursions comprise less than 1% of overall cases, reflecting the predominantly local nature of rabies transmission and the large size of the federal states. Although long-distance translocations of infected wildlife are known to occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], fox rabies transmission is thought to mainly result from movement of rabid and latently infected foxes. Even a small number of incursions from neighbouring regions through such movement can enable disease resurgence in a rabies-free region and are an important consideration in the design of vaccination strategies [
