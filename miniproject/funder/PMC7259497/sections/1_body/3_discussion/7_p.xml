<p>Our modelling framework addressed the general challenge of modeling heterogeneities in transmission but still had limitations. Heterogeneous contact structure between subpopulations within metapopulations can critically influence disease dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We scaled connectivity between regions as a function of area and shared border length, assuming animals closer to a border have a greater chance of transmitting rabies to foxes in neighbouring regions. Analytical progress in scaling within and between subpopulation mixing [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] may also be applicable to fox rabies. Capturing the most localised transmission with our term for heterogeneous mixing was computationally intensive and required us to constrain parameters within practical limits. In future work, we hope to explore the computational issues of our model and evaluate the suitability of methods to approximate the computationally expensive likelihood function [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Recent empirical studies of hosts with GPS collars and/or proximity sensors suggest an important role for contact heterogeneities in rabies dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. But inference from studies of healthy animals may be limited, given the behavioural changes associated with rabies infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Models have potential to bridge this gap [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. We advocate testing these approaches to identify which can fully capture spatially resolved patterns of rabies spread and persistence and be applied expediently.
