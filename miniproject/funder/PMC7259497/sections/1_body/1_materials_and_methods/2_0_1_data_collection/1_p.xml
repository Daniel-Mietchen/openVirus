<p>We compiled records of laboratory-confirmed rabies cases in foxes from regular reports by the national veterinary authorities and summarized for each federal state (hereafter referred to as region) on a monthly basis. Specimens of suspect rabid foxes were submitted primarily by veterinarians and hunters. From 1993, cross-sectional sampling of foxes was also conducted, whereby a proportion of foxes hunted were tested for rabies providing a measure of rabies prevalence in the population. The timing of ORV campaigns in each region was also compiled. The Rabies Bulletin Europe (RBE) is a database consisting of national rabies surveillance data managed by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Germany [
