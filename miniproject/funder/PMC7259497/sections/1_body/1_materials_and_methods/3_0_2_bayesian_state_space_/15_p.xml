<p>In [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], transmission rates are modelled using the product 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>q</italic>
 </sup>
 <italic>G</italic>(
 <italic>I</italic>), where 
 <italic>S</italic> is the number of susceptible individuals and 
 <italic>q</italic> creates nonlinearity in the mixing rates as the number of susceptibles increases, in order to represent heterogeneities (e.g. due to spatially localised transmission).
