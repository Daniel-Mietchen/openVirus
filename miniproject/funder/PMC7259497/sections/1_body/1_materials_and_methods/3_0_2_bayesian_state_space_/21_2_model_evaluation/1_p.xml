<p>To assess the model fit we used a probability integral transform, testing whether the observed rabies cases can reasonably be assumed to be arising from the chosen model. This was done by comparing the observed number of rabies cases to the posterior distribution of the expected number of infected cases estimated from the MCMC samples, calculating the percentile where the data point fell within the cumulative distribution function [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Because the credible intervals are calculated from the posterior of the expected values and not the posterior of the prediction, which also includes an error term, the credible intervals are more conservative and reflect only the uncertainty around the regression and not the prediction. As a result, they are narrower than the credible intervals of the prediction because they do not include this error.
