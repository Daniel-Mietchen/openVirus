<p>To assess the model fit through time we plotted the computed monthly probability integral transform values through time. To explore the full range of potential rabies epidemic scenarios within the parameter space, we simulated from the fitted model providing the same initial conditions including the size of the region, connectivity between regions, carrying capacity, initial number of susceptible and infected individuals, and rates of vaccination. We also assessed the model predictions when the model was provided with the first data point and the first 20 data points in the time series in each region using the probability integral transform to assess the prediction.</p>
