<p>A demographic process was used to model the numbers of susceptible and vaccinated foxes in each region at monthly time steps. The starting susceptible population and carrying capacity for each region were extracted from the literature, based on the average density of foxes per km
 <sup>2</sup> and multiplying this density by the area of the region [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Births were modelled as occurring in April of each year with newborn foxes entering the susceptible population in July coinciding with when they venture further from their den. All susceptible and vaccinated foxes older than one year of age were considered reproductively active. This means that surviving newborns from the past year give birth the following April. We assume that infected individuals transmit rabies and die within the same month, such that infectious animals in the current month 
 <italic>t</italic>, transmit infection to new animals that subsequently develop rabies the following month 
 <italic>t</italic> + 1. No exposed class was considered because the latent period of rabies infection lasts an average of three weeks and thus all new infections at month 
 <italic>t</italic> become symptomatic by month 
 <italic>t</italic> + 1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Data on the timing of vaccination campaigns in each region were incorporated explicitly.
