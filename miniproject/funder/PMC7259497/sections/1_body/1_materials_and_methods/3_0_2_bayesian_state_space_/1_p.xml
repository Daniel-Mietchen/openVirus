<p>A discrete time stochastic metapopulation model with three states: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Vaccinated (V), was developed to model the numbers of foxes and rabies cases in different regions through time. The Bayesian approach allowed us to complement the rabies case data with prior information on some parameters from historical studies on fox demography.</p>
