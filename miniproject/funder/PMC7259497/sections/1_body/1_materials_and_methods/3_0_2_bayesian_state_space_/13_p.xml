<p>The biological rationale behind 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0220592.e018">Eq (12)</xref> is that in larger areas, susceptible individuals are expected to be less accessible to infected individuals due to the greater distance to reach them. The addition of infected individuals in the denominator allows us to account for saturation effects that occur at high incidence, when infected individuals might contact fewer susceptibles due to disease-induced mortality or because local contacts might already be latently infected. Local susceptible depletion thereby reduces the transmission rate of each infected individual as incidence increases.
