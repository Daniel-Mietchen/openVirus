<p>We were primarily interested in estimating four main parameters: the heterogeneity parameter for transmission 
 <italic>h</italic>, the probability of an infected fox leaving an area 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub>, the observation rate 
 <italic>θ</italic>, and the precision 
 <italic>τ</italic> of the environmental noise (
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Both the observation rate (observational noise) and environmental noise varied annually. Therefore, in addition to reporting the estimates of the parameter, we also tracked the values that the annual observational noise and environmental noise terms took for the year. The model was highly sensitive as there are multiple ways to explain an increase in new infections such as a larger population, or a smaller population and a higher transmission rate, or a higher rate of detection. For this reason, we thought very carefully about the priors we chose from a biological perspective. The heterogeneity parameter 
 <italic>h</italic> for transmission was given a gamma prior with mean 4 and variance 9. We experimented with the sensitivity of the model to the parameter 
 <italic>θ</italic>, for quantifying case detection. We chose a prior for 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> (the rate at which infected foxes leave their focal region) where the posterior, informed by data, would have to move away from 0, ‘no movement’, to support connectivity between regions. Because infected foxes have a limited dispersal range [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we expected the value of 
 <italic>ρ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> to be small. To limit the search to a biologically plausible range of values for the leaving rate, we used a Beta prior with mean 0.004 and variance 0.000005 that declined with distance from 0. The precision of the environmental noise term 
 <italic>τ</italic> was given a gamma prior with mean 1000 and variance 5000, based on fluctuations in fox reproductive effort reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This allowed the litter size (or birth pulse) to vary between 0.9 and 1.1 of the mean litter size each year.
