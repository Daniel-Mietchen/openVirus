<p>All models were fitted using the software JAGS [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which uses Gibbs sampling to generate posterior distributions of the parameters given the likelihood, prior distributions and the data itself. We ran the models for 3,000,000 iterations, with a burn-in of 30,000 and a thin interval of 300, giving 10,000 samples. We inspected the model for convergence and effective sample size. To account for the fact that fox-mediated rabies had been circulating in Germany since the late 1940s, we started the model 10 years (120 time steps) prior to when the time series began to allow the system to settle at an endemic equilibrium. Fitting of the model required considerable computational time and a compromise in what parameters were estimated in order for the model to converge. This was resolved pragmatically by fixing some parameters that were not central to the research questions or for which good quality information was available (
