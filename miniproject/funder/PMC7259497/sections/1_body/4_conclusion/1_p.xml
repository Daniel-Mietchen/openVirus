<p>Disease dynamics play out across space, irrespective of borders. Modelling approaches to understand interactions between spatial and demographic processes can reveal key insights into disease dynamics and are crucial to the planning of regional vaccination strategies. Several studies have been central for guiding control of fox rabies in Europe. A simple deterministic, compartmental model based on fox population biology compared the dynamics of rabies under culling versus vaccination [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Our study adds to the considerable body of work that has been central for guiding the control of fox rabies in Europe [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is the first to estimate key epidemiological parameters, including spatial coupling and local transmission, using a model fit to data. Our findings have implications for strategies aiming to achieve and maintain rabies freedom and the modeling approach can be used to further explore vaccination strategies to inform ongoing vaccination in Eastern Europe [
