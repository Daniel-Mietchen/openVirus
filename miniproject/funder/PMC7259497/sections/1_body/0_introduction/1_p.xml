<p>Disease dynamics are underpinned by the interplay between population connectivity and the localized nature of transmission [

Many infectious diseases are transmitted primarily through local interactions, but control strategies and surveillance are implemented at coarser administrative scales. As a result, only aggregate data is available on the occurrence of infections, which makes it difficult to disentangle the extent to which disease dynamics are driven by local transmission versus spatial coupling between subpopulations. Approaches that quantify these processes have potential to guide the efficient use of resources for disease control.
