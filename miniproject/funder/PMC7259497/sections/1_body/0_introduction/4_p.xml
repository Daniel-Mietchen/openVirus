<p>Rabies has been eliminated from fox populations throughout much of Europe by vaccinating foxes using oral baits containing vaccine. In just over three decades, vaccine baits have been distributed across 2.36 million km

Models that capture local transmission dynamics of fox rabies and regional connectivity therefore have immediate application to the situation in Europe and elsewhere. Here, we examine fox rabies dynamics in response to oral vaccination using a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model fit to incidence data from Eastern Germany from 1982-2013. We use a metapopulation approach to model transmission by representing space as a network of subpopulations and estimating the movement of infected individuals (or coupling) between them. We account for heterogeneous mixing using a transmission process that approximates the scaling of individual interactions to the regional level. This study presents a first step towards disentangling local transmission and spatial coupling between subpopulations from aggregated and incomplete data on wildlife rabies.
