<p>Epidemiological data are inherently complex due to variability arising from infectious disease dynamics, including stochastic spatial transmission processes and observation limits to case detection. The study of wildlife disease is particularly complex for several reasons. Surveillance only detects a (usually small) proportion of circulating infections and oftentimes the incidence of disease in wildlife populations can only be inferred through indirect measures (veterinary records, hunting reports), with variable levels of detection [
 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Under limited surveillance failed invasions or low level persistence may be missed entirely. Wildlife populations are often not monitored closely and therefore knowledge of their size and spatial distribution are typically limited and imprecise [
