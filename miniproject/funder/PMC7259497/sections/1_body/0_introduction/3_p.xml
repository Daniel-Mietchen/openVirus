<p>Traditional epidemiological models that assume homogenous mixing i.e. individuals interacting randomly and uniformly with all others in the population, have yielded important insights, such as thresholds for disease invasion and control [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. But these models have not accounted for heterogeneous mixing, which is critical for directly transmitted diseases in wildlife populations. Individual-based models explicitly model interactions within discrete spatial or social neighbourhoods [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but require detailed data that is rarely available for wildlife populations. Approximations have been developed to capture interactions between infected and susceptible individuals at the local level [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], for example, ‘heterogeneity’ parameters [

 <xref rid="pone.0220592.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These approaches have been effective for human diseases such as cholera [
