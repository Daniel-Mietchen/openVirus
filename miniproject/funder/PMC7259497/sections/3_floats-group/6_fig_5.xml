  <title>Model fit and projections with the first data point and first 20 data points of the time series with accompanying probability integral transform plots.</title>
  <p>The left panels show A. the model fit, B. the model projection with the first data point of the time series, and C. the model projection with first 20 data points of the time series. The right panels show the corresponding probability integral transform, i.e. where the observed case falls in the cumulative distribution function, over time for the three cases A-C. The dark blue line represents the observed rabies cases and the light and dark shaded blue regions represent the 95% and 50% Credible Intervals (CI) estimated from the MCMC samples, respectively. The colours in the probability integral transform plot indicate whether the observed cases falls inside (red) the 95% CI, outside (turquoise) the 95% CI but within the 100% CI, or outlier (green) when the case falls outside the CI entirely.</p>
