<p>Despite having a reputation as expensive white elephants, our review highlights that specimen repositories can play an invaluable role in the development, optimization, and validation of diagnostic assays. The CEPHIA repository demonstrates how a targeted approach can identify and capture a wealth of specimens and associated information that already exists, and 
 <italic>gain</italic> value by being drawn together for a different purpose. Developing the archive required overcoming a number of significant challenges, and despite its demonstrated value given the financial investment, lack of consistent funding threatens the existence of the CEPHIA repository and the collaborative team that supports its use. To successfully develop and sustain a consolidated repository model, we must think in new ways about our scientific work as part of a collective whole. To this end, through this review we have identified critical features of a high-value repository, leading to the following proposals:
