<p>Yet despite these advancements, new challenges for diagnosis of HIV infection abound. HIV vaccine studies, increasing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) usage and PrEP breakthrough infections

 </sup>, and very early initiation of HIV treatment have improved HIV prevention and care considerably, but require further evaluation of the impact on key viral and immunological markers of HIV, upon which existing diagnostic assays rely

 </sup>. Vaccine trial participants frequently have anti-HIV positive assay results, known as vaccine-induced seropositivity (VISP), despite being HIV-negative

 </sup>, and very early use of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) (including with PrEP) can have the opposite effect, leading to non-reactive antibody or ambiguous assay result combinations 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
 </sup>. This likely occurs as a result of inhibited antibody production due to lack of sustained antigenic stimulation during a time when viral load is typically spiking

  <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 </sup>. Rapid reduction in viral load before antibody production is fully underway can lead to lower antibody titers and less time for antibodies to mature; assays may then detect antibodies later than expected, or not at all

 </sup>. These types of new, increasingly important challenges contribute to potentially inaccurate diagnoses at the individual level and misinterpretations of data on the global stage, including inaccurate national or regional prevalence and incidence estimates, and measurement error against the WHO care cascade indicators and UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. To reduce data misinterpretation, we require creative approaches to ongoing evaluation and enhancements of diagnostic assays and algorithms, necessitating access to suitable specimens for assay development and evaluation.
