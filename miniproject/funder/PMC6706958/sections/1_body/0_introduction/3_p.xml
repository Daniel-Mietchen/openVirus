<p>Specimen repositories previously built by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and others have supported many diagnostic developments to date. However, specimens in those repositories have often had limited distribution and no mechanism for regular replenishment, leading to a resistance of many major funders to allocate money toward sustaining those repositories or investing in additional specimen repository projects. Well-maintained repositories with substantial specimen distribution and replenishment will allow multiple current questions to be answered, and will enable us to anticipate and proactively address future challenges to the diagnosis, monitoring, and evaluation of HIV infection.</p>
