<p>The Consortium for the Evaluation and Performance of HIV Incidence Assays (CEPHIA) was formed in 2011 with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; it was created in specific response to a need for cultivated specimens identified during an international Incidence Assay Critical Path Working Group, convened to review challenges and propose solutions to assay development for use in a surveillance and research context

 </sup>. CEPHIA was created to support the development of existing and new HIV incidence assays, improve data analysis and interpretation of incidence assay results, and bring consensus to the field. CEPHIA is strengthened by its wide membership (see

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Importantly, the consortium was charged with setting standards and conducting independent evaluations of existing and new incidence assays, in order to remove real or perceived assay developer bias and allow direct, objective comparison of HIV incidence assays. To do this, one of CEPHIAâ€™s primary aims was to establish a repository of samples suited for these purposes.
