<p>All specimens must have high-quality clinical background data on the patients, to ensure their utility for diagnostic, pathogenesis, cure, and co-morbidity studies. This will require multiple collaborations to facilitate specimen collection and replenishment; this is no small task considering the legal, ethical, and logistical implications of sharing large-volume specimens across the globe, for reasons other than their original intention. An effective repository should have thousands of samples shared annually, requiring extensive data management to track shipments, specimen usage, panel outputs, and high-level specimen turnover and replacement. A repository system with the capacity to independently evaluate assays that have performed well on blinded panels run in developersâ€™ laboratories (as CEPHIA has) also requires collaboration with advanced statisticians who can perform high-quality data analysis and routinely share information; our experience has shown that simply disseminating evaluation results is not sufficient, and hands-on technical assistance strategies are required in order to support clinicians and researchers in understanding what the results really mean.</p>
