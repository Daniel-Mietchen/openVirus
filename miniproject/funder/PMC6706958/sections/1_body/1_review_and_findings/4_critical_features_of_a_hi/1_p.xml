<p>We identified the following as critical features of a high-value repository: 1) extensively-characterized HIV-positive samples, including serial specimens from people with acute infection, seroconverters, and treated subjects, enabling diagnostic, pathogenesis, cure, and co-morbidity studies, 2) high-quality clinical background data, 3) multiple collaborations facilitating ongoing specimen collection and replenishment, and 4) sustained records of high-level utilization and specimen turnover, with thousands of samples shared annually.
