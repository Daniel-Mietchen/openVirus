<p>While there are numerous benefits to the field, maintenance of a repository like CEPHIA is costly, and funding to support administrative and operational (i.e. non-research) tasks has been difficult to sustain. Specimens sitting in a freezer waiting to be distributed through a panel are often seen as a drain on resources; yet they can also be seen as a potential supply of invaluable (and sometimes irreplaceable) material, such as in the case of specimens from ART-na√Øve individuals with longstanding infections, increasingly difficult to come by worldwide.</p>
