<p>The initial CEPHIA repository was built not by collecting new specimens, but by incorporating historical specimens that otherwise would have been discarded due to lack of storage and maintenance resources. Bringing together smaller, more narrowly-defined repositories added value to specimens that may otherwise have been underutilized or even destroyed, and thus demonstrates the utility of a consolidated repository. However, CEPHIA faced many challenges in the development of its initial repository, as discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="other" rid="B1">Box 1</xref>. Other groups attempting to build new consolidated repositories will likely face these challenges, making it necessary to determine the return on investment (ROI) required to justify funding for any new repository.
