<p>It is difficult to quantify the value gained from identifying poorly performing assays so they can be removed or limited in the market; improving the understanding, confidence and application of well-performing assays; developing new research concepts and opportunities by adding value to previous studies; or supporting external quality assessment (EQA) programs. Repository value, however, can be measured in several ways, including scientific value (measured through grants awarded, papers published, patents filed, diagnostic improvements made and new assays developed, public health application of methods, and subsequent reduction in infections), regulatory acceptance (through use of the repository to allow FDA, CE, and WHO approval of assays), financial gains (through payments from manufacturers, value of grants awarded, royalties, reduction in ancillary health costs through reduction in burden of disease), and also from a reduction in resources spent on techniques that have been shown to be ineffective. To date, our estimates of expense and funders’ investments into the original plasma-only CEPHIA Repository (also known as “CEPHIA 1”, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OPP1017716) have had a strong value per dollar invested; when taking into account the value of projects made possible directly or indirectly by CEPHIA 1, we estimate 
 <bold>each dollar invested yielded approximately $6.59 in scientific advancement</bold> (see
