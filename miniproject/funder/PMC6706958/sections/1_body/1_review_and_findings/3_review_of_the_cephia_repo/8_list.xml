   <bold>Standardization of HIV incidence assays, and rejection of tests that don’t work.</bold> CEPHIA was primarily initiated to conduct independent evaluations of assays in the global market that were theoretically able to detect recency of HIV infection. These evaluations were completed on 11 assays, with formal evaluations (also known as “blue books”) available at the following location:

In addition to these detailed evaluations there were a number of papers published by CEPHIA on the performance and appropriate use of available assays

   </sup>. These evaluations and related publications have allowed major international donors to confidently use appropriate incidence assays in major surveillance activities and impact assessments, such as the Population HIV Impact Assessments (PHIAs) currently being conducted in 14 PEPFAR-supported countries

   <bold>Innovative research to advance the field.</bold> There have been 21 separate large-scale research projects funded by NIH, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others, using CEPHIA specimens as a foundation for investigation of assays in various HIV incidence and diagnostic applications. Eleven scientific articles

   <bold>Influence on guidance and standards set by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS.</bold> Through participation on the WHO/UNAIDS Technical Working Group on HIV Incidence Measurement and Data Use, CEPHIA has had direct and ongoing influence over the information discussed at Technical Working Group meetings and subsequently shared through various guidance documents and technical updates, available at 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/surveillance/en/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.who.int/hiv/pub/surveillance/en/</ext-link>; as one example, this influence led to a 2015 Technical Update recommending that incidence assays always be used in conjunction with viral load to appropriately calculate incidence at the population level

   <bold>Research informed by CEPHIA analyses and lessons learned.</bold> In addition to specific publications, many areas of research and development have been largely informed by CEPHIA’s work, including HIV cure research, antibody profiling, and infection dating. As one concrete example, to support analyses within CEPHIA it was critical to standardize estimated times since infection for each specimen timepoint. This was originally done using the conventionally-understood Fiebig staging method 
   <sup>
    <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>
   </sup>. However, this was quickly found to be limiting as many specimens came from people who entered the source cohort after reaching Fiebig stage V, when antibodies had matured and the acute infection period had passed, yielding little-to-no information about infection timing. To address this limitation, CEPHIA developed a new method of infection dating now gaining traction 
   <sup>
    <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
    <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
   </sup>; the major benefit of the EDDI method is that it allows for a point estimate and associated credibility interval for date of first detectable infection of any person who has at least one positive and one prior negative HIV test of any kind. With the EDDI method, the tests do not have to be run on the same day and do not have to be run during the acute phase of infection in order to generate an estimated date on which a viral load assay with a 1 copy/mL limit of detection would have a 50% chance of detecting the infection (date of first “detectable infection”). The EDDI method is flexible and a major advance over the Fiebig method given the latter’s increasing limitations in this new era of HIV assays.
