<p>For this paper, we review the foundation and describe the evolving development of the CEPHIA repository from late 2011 through March 2019, as a potential exemplar of a model for consolidated repository development. We calculate the estimated value of the first stage of the CEPHIA investment (CEPHIA-1, January 2011 through December 2013) by reviewing funding award documentation during that period, and summing the value of all research and programmatic uses of CEPHIA-1 samples between January 2012 and March 2019, then dividing by the total sum of the expenses related to establishment of the CEPHIA-1 repository, as well as maintenance and utilization of the repository during the initial project period. We identify critical features of a high-value repository, for consideration in future efforts to develop such a resource, and identify new types of specimens that could be included in a consolidated repository.</p>
