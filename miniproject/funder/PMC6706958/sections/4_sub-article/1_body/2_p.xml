<p> At CEPHIAâ€™s inception, acquisition of specimens collected from other studies was anticipated as a shortcut, quicker and less expensive than a purposefully designed prospective specimen collection from an observational cohort. However, the best sources for CEPHIA specimens were other cohorts (e.g., Zvitambo, CHAVI) (Gonese

 </sup>) with limited specimen volumes for which there are other competing research interests. The CEPHIA panel suffers from several shortcomings in that many specimen sets are based on estimated (not observed) dates of infection, and the panel constituents do not allow direct comparison of assay-based incidence results to observed incidence. Finally, the CEPHIA panel will also not help address the pressing new challenges for diagnosis in persons taking PrEP, PEP, or early ART, and will not allow for examination of new molecular methods or POC specimen types, for which better specimen sources are available (i.e., SEARCH studies, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00796146 and NCT00796263, underway since 2008) (Ananworanich
