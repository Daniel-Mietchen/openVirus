<p> Finally, the authorsâ€™ estimates of the repository appear to neglect the fixed costs associated with development, maintenance, and monitoring of a repository (Baird and Gunter, 2016

  <xref rid="rep-ref-27584-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup>), and I am reluctant to equate grants received (including, I expect, some by these authors) as ROI. If ROI justified incidence assays, industry would underwrite the specimen repositories.
