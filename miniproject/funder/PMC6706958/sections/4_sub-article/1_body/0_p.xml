<p>This open letter describes the CEPHIA repository and its role in development of evaluation of HIV incidence assays, and proposes it serve as a “potential exemplar for consolidated repository development.” The authors note (Review and Findings) that “CEPHIA was created to support the development of existing and new HIV incidence assays, improve data analysis and interpretation of incidence assay results, and bring consensus to the field,” and note (Discussion) that “lack of consistent funding threatens the existence of the CEPHIA repository and the collaborative team that supports its use.” I have significant reservations about this letter from my eminent colleagues, and I provide extensive comment because of my respect for the hard work these colleagues have done.</p>
