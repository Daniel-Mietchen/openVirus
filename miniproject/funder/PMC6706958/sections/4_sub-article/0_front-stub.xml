   <p>
    <bold>Competing interests: </bold>Full disclosure: I was employed at CDC until 2014, at one time responsible for the identification, acquisition, and tracking of specimens for evaluating incidence assays, and for the application and use of some assays as part of the US HIV Surveillance System’s incidence estimates. I was also part of the international Incidence Assay Critical Paths Working Group in 2011, during which CEPHIA was conceived (reference 1). I confirm that this hasn’t affected my ability to write an objective review of the article.
