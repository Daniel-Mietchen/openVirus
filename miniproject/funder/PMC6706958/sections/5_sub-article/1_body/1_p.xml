   <p>The authors indicate 31,000 plasma specimens, but in the Review of the CEPHIA Repository section, they state 3,383 individuals with 13,856 different time points. The repository number and type of specimens are a little unclear, and perhaps the number and characteristics of the population of samples could be further clarified in one section.</p>

   <p>The authors state “…other body fluids…”. This is not described in subsequent sections and should be further explained.</p>

   <p>The abstract mentions “support biomarker discovery”. This should be further explained in a subsequent section.</p>

   <p>For the cost of the repository, the expenses could include more detail. For example, the database management is $315,000: what exactly does this involve? Also, specimen maintenance is $396,091: what does this entail? Are these costs per year?</p>
