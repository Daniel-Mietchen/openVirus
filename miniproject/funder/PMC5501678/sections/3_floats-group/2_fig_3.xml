  <p>Mosquitoes were orally infected with the virus and analyzed after 14 days. (A) Infection and dissemination rates for DENV. (B) DENV genome copies per infected tissue in abdomen and thorax. (C) Infection and dissemination rates for CHIKV. (D) CHIKV genome copies per infected tissue in abdomen and thorax. (A and C) Each point represents an independent repeat of 25 mosquitoes. Bars show mean Â± s.e.m. T-test significant differences between mosquito species are shown. (B and D). Table below indicates the results from a two-ANOVA testing the impact of species and tissues on viral genome copies per infected tissues.</p>
