 <p>Dengue and chikungunya are mosquito-borne diseases and re-emerging as a global burden of the 21
  <sup>st</sup> century. Because of the absence of cure and limitations of the current vaccine, vector control remains the sole efficient intervention to mitigate epidemics. The highly-populated city of Singapore represents an example of successful vector control, where the primary vector 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> has practically disappeared from households. However, there as well, dengue and chikungunya are re-emerging. In this study, we surveyed peridomestic sites for mosquito vectors and identified 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
  <italic>Aedes malayensis</italic> throughout Singapore and in open-air areas frequented by people. We further showed that both mosquito species are highly susceptible to dengue and chikungunya viruses and detected infectious virus particles in mosquito saliva, indicating their transmission capacity. Our study provides evidence that 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>malayensis</italic> possess all the traits necessary to contribute to virus transmission in cities and suggest that peridomestic areas be included in vector management programme.
