 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is known to be susceptible to DENV and CHIKV infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and in some instances, was found to be more competent than

 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], as this was the case in our study. Our results demonstrated a higher DENV infection rate for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> than for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Of note, the relatively low infection rates for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were comparable to previous experiments [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The global chikungunya outbreak initiated in 2004 was caused by enhanced transmission efficiency by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> following a mutation in the E1 protein of the virus [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], although cross genetic interactions between mosquito and virus strains can affect transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Despite the mutation absence from our local isolate, infection and dissemination rates in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were not significantly different to the ones in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, indicating 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> from Singapore is likely capable of transmitting both CHIKV strains, similarly to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Both CHIKV strains are now globally distributed and could be introduced to Singapore [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], thereby increasing the risk of transmission by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Moreover, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> has been shown to prefer to bite humans even in the presence of other vertebrates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> was incriminated as the primary vector in epidemics of dengue and chikungunya in central Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and Mediterranean Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Interestingly, an epidemiological study in a Japanese city showed that more than 80% of dengue patients during an epidemic visited a city park where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is present [
