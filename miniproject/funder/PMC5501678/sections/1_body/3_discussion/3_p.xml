<p>A combination of biological features determines the vector status of mosquito species, two of which are especially important [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The first is their susceptibility to infection, enabling replication of the virus to high titers throughout the mosquito body and particularly in the salivary glands, thus facilitating transmission during subsequent blood feeding [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Importantly, vector competence can be affected by intra-species mosquito diversity and virus origin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We therefore conducted a vector competence study with sympatric mosquitoes and viruses. A second important characteristic responsible for the vector status is the proclivity to bite humans, which depends on its anthropophily and presence in human populated areas, such as open-air parks where we identified the two sylvatic species for which we characterized vector competence.
