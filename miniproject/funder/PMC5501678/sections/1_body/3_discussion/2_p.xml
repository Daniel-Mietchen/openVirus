<p>Confronted with a global rise in the incidence of dengue and chikungunya cases in cities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], public health authorities need to question the dogma of current vector control approaches that focus on domestic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations. Changes in world demography and epidemiology has altered the vector control framework [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Increase in population density and in global transportation augmented mosquito-human interactions and arbovirus introduction frequency. Interestingly, fine-scale correlation between a reduced 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> house index and lower dengue burden has seldom been observed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Instead, risk of infection is independent of distance from home and determined by human movement into arboviral foci of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. High risk transmission areas often have narrow spatial-temporal windows [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], likely because mosquitoes are short-lived (less than 3 weeks) and rarely disperse further than 100m [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Identification of sites, for example schools, temples or open-air places [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and pro-active interventions will enhance the efficacy of vector control. In this transmission context, our findings indicate that peridomestic areas may present a risk for infection.
