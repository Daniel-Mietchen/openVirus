<p>To identify sylvatic vectors, we sampled for container-inhabiting 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the forested urban parks of Singapore, located in population-dense areas, primarily comprised of high-rise apartments. From the oviposition traps set in 12 forested areas and collected from 2013 to 2015, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> comprised almost the entire collection from the oviposition traps set in 12 forested areas with only two 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were identified (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005667.s002">S1 Table</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes malayensis</italic> was the only species detected at three sites, while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was the only container-inhabiting species detected in three other sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Both species were detected in six sites, and more 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> eggs were collected in four of these sites (
