 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], East Coast Park. Over the two month period, 8,581 eggs were collected, from which 25.84% were reared to adults, resulting in 1,502

 <italic>malayensis</italic> in the forested area of transect A, while there was no difference for transect B (linear regression; transect A: df = 1, 86; p = 0.037; transect B: df = 1, 105; p = 0.066). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> distribution was different as mosquitoes were more abundant in the forested area of transect B, but no difference was witnessed between open and forested areas in transect A (transect A: df = 1, 72; p = 0.203; transect B: df = 1, 88; p &lt; 0.001). Together, these results demonstrate that

 <italic>albopictus</italic> and
