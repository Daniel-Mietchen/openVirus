While one saliva extract did not lead to infection, the four other extracts contained enough infectious particles to infect at least 40% of the saliva-inoculated mosquitoes. All CHIKV-infected saliva contained enough virus to infect mosquitoes (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005667.s006">S5B Table</xref>). Two saliva extracts showed high infectivity as they led to CHIKV infection in all the five saliva-inoculated mosquitoes. Inoculation of the other saliva extracts infected between 40 and 80% of the mosquitoes.
