<p>To determine the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic>, we orally infected the two species with sympatric isolates of DENV serotype 2 and CHIKV. Orally challenged 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were used as controls. At 14 days post-infection, mosquitoes were separated in two halves corresponding to the abdomen and head/thorax, and the virus was quantified in each section. Detection of virus in the thorax was indicative of dissemination from the midgut to the salivary glands, which are present in the thoracic compartment and represent the source organ for transmission via saliva during biting. DENV infection rates were the highest in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic>, reaching 100% in two of the three biological repeats, while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> infection rate was significantly lower than both species with an average of 44% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Total viral genome copies from both body parts was lower in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> than in the two other species (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005667.s005">S4A Table</xref>). Dissemination rates in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> reached 100% in two repeats and was significantly higher than in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and higher than in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Viral genome copies per tissue was significantly higher in thoraxes of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> than for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).CHIKV infection rates were significantly higher in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> than in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and higher than in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, although average infection was above 75% for all three species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). While not significant, average dissemination rate and total viral genome copies in both abdomen and thorax parts were also higher for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> than for the two other species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005667.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>;
