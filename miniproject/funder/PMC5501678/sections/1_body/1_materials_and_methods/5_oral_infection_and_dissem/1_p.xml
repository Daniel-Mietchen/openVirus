 <italic>malayensis</italic> females were sugar-deprived for 24 h and subsequently offered a blood meal containing a 40% volume of washed erythrocytes from SPF pig’s blood (PWG Genetics), 5% of 100 mM ATP (Thermo Scientific), 5% human serum (Sigma) and 50% volume of a DENV ST or CHIKV EAS virus in RPMI (Gibco). The final concentration of virus in the blood mix was 1x10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml and was validated by plaque assay [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Mosquitoes were exposed to the artificial blood meal for one hour using a Hemotek membrane feeder system (Discovery Workshops) with a porcine intestine membrane. Fully engorged females were selected and provided access to a 10% sugar solution in an incubation chamber with conditions similar for insect rearing. At fourteen days after the blood meal, 25 mosquitoes were dissected into head/thorax and abdomen halves; this resulted in two halves for each mosquito. Each tissue portion was triturated in 500 μl of maintenance medium as described above and the virus load quantified by RT-qPCR. Three oral infection replicates were performed for each virus-mosquito species combination.
