<p>We conducted three-way mixed-effect ANCOVA to test the impact of transect site, distance along the transect from the forest edge, and collection date (random variable) on the number of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic>. Where appropriate, we employed linear regression to study the impact of distance for each individual transect. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the effect of mosquito species on infection and dissemination rates. We estimated the influence of mosquito species and tissue (abdomen or thorax) on viral genome copy by conducting a two-way ANOVA with tissue nested into species. Tissue was nested into species to estimate variation between tissues within the same species. Viral genome copies were log-transformed to fit a normal distribution. Post-hoc analysis were conducted using Tukey's test. All tests were calculated using Systat 13.0 software (SYSTAT).
