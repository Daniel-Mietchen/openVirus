<p>Between 2013 and 2015, oviposition traps filled with distilled water containing a crushed wafer of fish food (TetraMin fish flakes) and a piece of seed germination paper (Anchor Paper) were placed at 12 forested sites throughout Singapore (West Coast Park, Clementi Woods Park, Mount Faber Park, Bukit Batok Town Park, East Coast Park (x 3 sites), Sentosa, Pulau Semkau, Kent Ridge Park, Whampoa along the Kalong River, and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve). Oviposition papers were replaced every 3–4 days. Upon collection, oviposition papers were treated with a 10-fold commercial bleach dilution to surface sterilize them and prevent microbial growth and introduction of field parasites into laboratory colonies. Egg papers were exposed for 10 minutes to this solution before rinsing and drying and kept between 2–4 weeks before hatching. Eggs were hatched in deoxygenated water, larvae were fed a mix of fish food (TetraMin fish flakes) and liver powder (MP Biomedicals), and adults were provided a 10% sucrose solution. The insectary was held at 28°C with 50% humidity on a 12:12h dark:light cycle. Adult mosquitoes were killed by freezing and identified using taxonomic keys to distinguish
