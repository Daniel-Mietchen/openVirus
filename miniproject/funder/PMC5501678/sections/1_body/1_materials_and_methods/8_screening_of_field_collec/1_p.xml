<p>Mosquitoes were collected weekly from June-August, 2013 in Sembawang using CDC traps (Bioquip), BG Sentinel Traps (Biogents), and Mosquito Magnet Mosquito trapper (Mosquito Magnet) that were baited with dry ice. Samples were held at 4°C before being brought to Duke-NUS for identification on a chill table. Mosquitoes were pooled by species and collection week.

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>malayensis</italic> pools were homogenized in 500 μl of maintenance medium as described above. RNA was extracted with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), cDNA was generated with Superscript II according to manufacturer’s instructions and screened for flaviviruses with previously described primers (FU1 and cFD3) and protocol [
