<p>Triturated mosquitoes or tissues were centrifuged and 400 μl of supernatant was used to extract viral RNA (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Qiagen). DENV or CHIKV genome copies were quantified using a one-step RT-qPCR with iTaq Universal probe kit (BioRad) and primers and probes targeting the envelope (DENV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and nsP1 (CHIKV) genes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The 25 μl reaction mix contained 1 μM of forward and reverse primer, 0.125 μM of probe and 4 μl of RNA extract. Thermal profile started at 50°C for 10 min, 95°C for 1 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec and 60°C for 15 sec.
