 <italic>malayensis</italic> were each inserted into a 10 μl pipette tip containing 6 μl of a 1:1 solution of 15% sucrose and heat-inactivated FCS. The mosquitoes were allowed to expectorate for 30 minutes, after which they were triturated as in the oral infection experiment and quantified for the virus load by RT-qPCR. 0.2 μl of the saliva-containing solution was inoculated intrathoracically into five uninfected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> female mosquitoes aged 3–5 days old using NanoJect II injector (Drummond). Seven days after saliva inoculation, each mosquito was triturated in 500μl of maintenance medium as described above and their virus load was quantified using RT-qPCR.
