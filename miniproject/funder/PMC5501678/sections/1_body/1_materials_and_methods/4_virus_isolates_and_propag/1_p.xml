<p>We used the clinical isolates dengue ST (passage 6) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and Chikungunya EAS DMERI09/08 (passage 3) viruses, collected from the Singapore General Hospital in 1997 and National University Hospital, Singapore in 2008, respectively (already existing collection). A portion of the E1 gene from CHIKV EAS was amplified and sequenced to validate the absence of the A226V amino acid substitution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All viruses were propagated in Vero cells (ATCC) and titrated by plaque assay in BHK cells (ATCC) as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
