<p>While lowered herd immunity resulting from 30 years of low dengue incidence increased the force of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], there remains an apparent paradox between the very low 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> house index and the resurgence of dengue and chikungunya in Singapore. To resolve this paradox, we hypothesize that foci of infection exist in peridomestic areas. Several epidemiological observations indicate that non-domestic infections are frequent in Singapore: (i) symptomatic cases are more prevalent in adults than in young children [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], (iii) women, who are more likely to stay home caring for children, have a lower incidence of infection than men [
