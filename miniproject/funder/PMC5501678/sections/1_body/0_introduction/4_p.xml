<p>The structure of Singapore is a matrix of highly populated areas with parks and bosquets, resulting in a vegetation cover of 44% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and possess all social and environmental characteristics identified in foci of infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005667.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], i.e. routine attendance, artificial or natural containers, open spaces for daily activities, and the lack of air-conditioning. To determine the potential risk of infection in these sites, we combine country-wide entomological surveys and vector competence studies to determine the distribution and prevalence of competent vectors.
