<p id="Par30">Cell samples were centrifuged at 3000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were assessed using a commercial MMP9 ELISA kit (Abcam, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In microplates, standards (50 µL), samples (10 µL sample liquid and 40 µL diluent), and blanks were added into predefined wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the plates were washed twice with wash buffer, 100 µL of horseradish peroxidase (HPR)-labeled conjugates was added prior to sealing the plates for incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Following five stringent washes, substrates A (50 µL) and B (50 µL) were added into each well for incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. Eventually, a stop solution (50 µL) was added into each well, and the absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm within 15 min using a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher, USA). MMP9 levels in these samples were located within the linear range of the standard curves.
