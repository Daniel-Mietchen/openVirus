<p id="Par28">For the miR-1303 analysis, miRNA was enriched by a miRcute miRNA Isolation Kit (TIANGEN, China). Subsequently, 2 μg of RNA was first polyadenylated with polyA polymerase and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with a poly(T) adapter primer under the following reaction conditions: 60 min at 37 °C, 5 min at 85 °C, and maintenance at 4 °C. Finally, PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TAKARA, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols, on an ABI7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 40 s, and dissociation at 95 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 95 °C for 30 s. The qRT-PCR results were calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and U6 snRNA, which was provided with the kit and served as an internal control. The primers used in this study are listed in Table S

 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method.
