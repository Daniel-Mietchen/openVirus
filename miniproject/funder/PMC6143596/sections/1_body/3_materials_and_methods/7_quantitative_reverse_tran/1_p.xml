<p id="Par27">For viral load examination, total RNA was extracted from all samples using the standard TRIzol reagent (TIANGEN, China) protocol. The regions of standards generated from EV71-VP1 and CA16-VP1 RNA were amplified by the PrimeSTAR
 <sup>®</sup> HS reagent (TAKARA, Japan) with the primers shown in Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The target 624-bp region (EV71-VP1) and 682-bp region (CA16-VP1) were cloned into the pGM-T vector (TIANGEN, China) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. A single recombinant clone containing the insert under the T7 promoter was selected, and the insert was transcribed in vitro using the TranscriptAid T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The in vitro-transcribed RNA was purified using the GeneJET RNA Purification kit (Thermo Scientific, USA) and quantified spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, USA). The qRT-PCR process was performed using a One Step PrimeScript™ RT-PCR Kit (TAKARA, Japan). To generate a standard curve for cycle thresholds (Cts) versus virus copy number, the purified RNA was serially diluted to known concentrations in the range of 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/μL and assayed concurrently with the test samples. The PCR amplification cycle was set at 42 °C for 5 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 °C for 10 s for initial denaturation and 40 cycles of 5-s denaturation at 95 °C and 34-s annealing at 60 °C. The reactions were run on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA).
