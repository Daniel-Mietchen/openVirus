<p id="Par24">HUVECs were grown to confluent monolayers on clear polyester Transwell filters (0.4 mm pore size, 12 mm diameter; Corning, USA). After completely treating with EV71 and CA16, we assessed the integrity and uniformity of the HUVEC monolayers with an In Vitro Vascular Permeability Assay Kit (Millipore, USA). Briefly, the medium was carefully removed from the Transwell insert, and 150 μL of FITC-dextran was added to the top chamber for incubation at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. At the end of the incubation period, the FITC-dextran content of the lower chamber was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Rad, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm.</p>
