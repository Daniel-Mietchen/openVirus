<p id="Par25">Cell apoptosis evaluation was performed by flow cytometry. The harvested cells were washed with PBS and resuspended at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL in 1 × Annexin V binding buffer followed by thorough mixing. After double staining with 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μL of propidium iodide per sample for 15 min at 25 °C in the dark using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime, China), the cells were analyzed using a FACScan
 <sup>®</sup> flow cytometer equipped with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions, to detect early and late apoptosis of cells.
