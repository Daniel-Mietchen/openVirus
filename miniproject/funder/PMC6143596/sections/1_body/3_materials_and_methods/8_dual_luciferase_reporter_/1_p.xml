<p id="Par29">The miR-1303 normal and mutated seed sequences in the 3′-untranslated (UTR) of the MMP9 gene were chemically synthesized in vitro (Sangon Biotech, China), and the Xho I and Not I restriction sites were added to both ends. The two DNA fragments were cloned into the psiCHECK-2 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega, USA) to generate a wild-type (WT) MMP9-3′UTR plasmid and a mutant MMP9-3′UTR plasmid. For the dual-luciferase reporter assay, 293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with different combinations of miR-1303 mimics, miR-1303 inhibitor, negative control (NC) plasmid, NC inhibitor, WT MMP9-3′UTR plasmid, and mutant MMP9-3′UTR plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Promega, USA), strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h of incubation, the cells from each group were lysed, and the fluorescence intensity was measured with a GloMax 20/20 luminometer (Promega, USA) using Renilla luciferase as the internal reference.</p>
