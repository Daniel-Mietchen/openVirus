<p id="Par32">HUVECs were seeded onto poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips (Solarbio, China). At the indicated time, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies in blocking solution against EV71/CA16-VP1 (1:1000 dilution; Millipore, USA), Nectin1 (1:100 dilution), Claudin4 (1:200 dilution), VE-cadherin (1:500 dilution), and ZO-1 (1:200 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Next, the cells were washed with PBS three times and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilution; Abcam, USA) or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution; Millipore, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:4000 dilution; Beyotime, China). Following three washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted on slides with an antifade reagent (Solarbio, China). Finally, images of the cells were captured with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica, Germany) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software.</p>
