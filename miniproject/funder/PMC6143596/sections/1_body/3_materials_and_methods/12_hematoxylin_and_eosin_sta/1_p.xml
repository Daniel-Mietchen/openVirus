<p id="Par33">After sacrifice, a rhesus monkey was necropsied to obtain lung and brain tissues. All the tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin at pH 7.4, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned with a microtome into 5-μm-thick sections. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene, dehydrated with graded ethanol, and washed three times with PBS (5 min per wash). Subsequently, the sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining to evaluate the damage to the lung and brain tissues. Finally, the slides were passed through stepwise dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol (70–100%), 5 min for each step, followed by 5~10 min in xylene. The sections were observed and photographed under a light microscope (Leica, Germany).</p>
