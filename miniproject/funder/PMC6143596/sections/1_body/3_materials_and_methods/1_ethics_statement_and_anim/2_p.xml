<p id="Par18">The rhesus monkeys were reared separately in a large cage (BSL-2 conditions) with sufficient fresh air and natural light, which allowed visual, olfactory, and auditory interactions with other monkeys. Each room had a temperature control valve guaranteed to maintain the room temperature at ~25 °C, and food, water, and fruit were readily available. Appropriate treats and vitamins were provided. The animals were given access to environmental enrichment (such as approved toys) to promote their psychological wellbeing. All animals were fully under the care of veterinarians at IMBCAMS.</p>
