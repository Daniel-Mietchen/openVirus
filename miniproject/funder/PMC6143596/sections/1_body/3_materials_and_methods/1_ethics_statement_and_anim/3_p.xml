<p id="Par19">A CA16-infected rhesus monkey model was generated by nasal spray using 5 lgCCID
 <sub>50</sub>/100 µL EGFP-CA16, while two rhesus monkeys were given MMP9 (150 ng/100 μL) or TIMP-1 (150 ng/100 μL) (an MMP9 inhibitor) recombinant proteins through intravenous injection every 2 days. One rhesus monkey injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) served as a control. After 6 days, all rhesus monkeys were euthanized using ketamine as the anesthetic (10 mg/kg of body weight), and samples were collected for viral load examination, morphological analysis, and junctional protein evaluation.
