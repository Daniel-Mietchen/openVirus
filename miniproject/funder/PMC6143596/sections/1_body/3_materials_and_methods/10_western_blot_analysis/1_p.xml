<p id="Par31">Cultured cells and tissue specimens were homogenized with radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a mixture of protease inhibitors for 20 min on ice. Further, the lysates were centrifuged to remove the cellular debris, and protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford protein assay (Thermo Fisher, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were subjected to 8–10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis based on their molecular weight and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). After blocking with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 solution for 2 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies against MMP9 (1:1000 dilution), Claudin4 (1:1500 dilution), Claudin5 (1:1500 dilution), VE-Cadherin (1:1200 dilution), ZO-1 (1:2000 dilution), and GAPDH (1:500 dilution; as a loading control) at 4 °C overnight. Antibodies specific to the above proteins were obtained from Abcam, USA. Subsequently, the blot was thoroughly washed with TBST three times for 15 min each and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:12,000 dilution; Abmart, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Beyotime, China) following the manufacturer’s manual and then detected with a ChemiDoc™ Imaging System (Bio-Rad, USA). Finally, the gray values of the protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software.</p>
