<p id="Par20">Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, USA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Corning, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Strains EV71 (subgenotype C4, GenBank: EU812515.1) or CA16-G20 (subgenotype B, GenBank: JN590244.1) were respectively isolated from an epidemic in Fuyang, China in 2008 and from an HFMD patient in Guangxi, China in 2010 and were used throughout the study. The HUVECs were cultivated in 6-well plates to 80% confluence and then infected with EV71 or CA16 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The infected cells were collected at 0, 72, and 96 h post infection (hpi). Cells infected with EV71 and CA16 at 0 hpi were used as controls.
