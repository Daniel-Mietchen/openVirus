<p id="Par23">A plaque assay was used to quantify infectious viruses recovered from HUVECs at the abovementioned timepoints. Briefly, the harvested cells were disrupted by three freeze-thaw cycles, and serial dilutions of all samples were inoculated into confluent Vero cells on 6-well plates. After 3 h of incubation to allow virus attachment, the wells were gently washed with PBS, covered with 2 mL of minimum essential medium containing 1% agarose, and inverted into a 37 °C CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 48 h. Next, the cells were fixed with 2 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, China) at 15 °C to 25 °C for 30 min, and the 1% agarose was removed. The monolayer of cells was stained with a crystal violet staining solution for 15 min and washed with ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. Finally, visible plaques were counted by the naked eye, and the plaque-forming units (pfu/mL) were calculated with the virus titer formula, in which the virus titer equals the number of plaques × (1 mL) × dilution factor.
