 </sup>. Thus, we speculated that the CNS injuries induced by CA16 infection are derived from direct penetration of the BBB by CA16 and that the molecular mechanism of BBB penetration by CA16 is related to the deregulation of junctional complexes via MMP9. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the upstream regulatory factors of MMP9 using miRNA high-throughput sequencing technology.
