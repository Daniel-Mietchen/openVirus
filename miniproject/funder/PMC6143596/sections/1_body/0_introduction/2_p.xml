<p id="Par3">Similar to poliovirus, CA16 is a highly neurotropic virus

 </sup>. Two likely routes by which CA16 enter the CNS have been considered: the virus either is transmitted to the CNS from the blood across the bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) or enters the CNS through peripheral nerves via retrograde axonal transport

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. Several studies have revealed that the BBB, which is primarily composed of brain endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, perivascular macrophages, and a basal membrane, acts in concert with the immune system to restrict the entry of pathogens into the CNS. Meanwhile, many pathogens manage to cross the BBB via modifying a host of BBB functions, altering BBB integrity, and disrupting BBB permeability, which ultimately allows the establishment of infection within the CNS
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>. For example, West Nile virus enters the brain by enhancing the BBB permeability with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) release. MMP9 is a member of the zinc-dependent and calcium-dependent endopeptidase family that is capable of degrading most extracellular matrix components
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, in the CNS, MMP9 can degrade components of the basal lamina and junctional complexes, leading to the disruption of BBB integrity and induction of the neuroinflammatory response in many neurological diseases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, alterations in BBB permeability were consistent with the increased expression of MMP9 in stroke and traumatic brain injury; further, it was found that disruption of BBB integrity in the setting of elevated MMP9 expression was closely associated with changes in junction assembly and function
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Junctional complexes in the BBB primarily include tight junctions (TJs), adhesion junctions (AJs), and gap junctions, which contribute differently to BBB dysfunction by directly regulating BBB permeability, altering transcellular exchange, affecting the expression pattern of certain transporters, and modifying endothelial metabolic processes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, destruction of these junctional complexes indirectly mirrors the breakdown of BBB integrity.
