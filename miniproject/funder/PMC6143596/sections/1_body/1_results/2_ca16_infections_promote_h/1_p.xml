<p id="Par6">To determine the effects of CA16 infection on the integrity of HUVECs, we performed a HUVEC endocytosis assay using FITC-dextran. The results revealed that FITC-dextran leakage was significantly upregulated in CA16-treated HUVECs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), indicating that CA16 infections might enhance cell permeability. Coincidently, CA16 infection induced increased permeability of the BBB that was accompanied by upregulated MMP9 expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Subsequently, an apoptosis assay was used to evaluate whether the alterations in HUVEC permeability were attributed to apoptosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). There were no significant differences in HUVEC apoptosis induced by CA16 infections, implying that apoptosis might not be responsible for HUVEC permeability during CA16 infection. Similar results were observed in EV71-infected HUVECs.
