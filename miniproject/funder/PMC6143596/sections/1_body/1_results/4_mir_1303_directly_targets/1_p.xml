<p id="Par8">qRT-PCR was applied to detect miR-1303 and MMP9 expression levels in HUVECs following EV71 and CA16 infections. The level of miR-1303 was markedly decreased, which was consistent with our miRNA sequence results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), whereas the level of MMP9 was remarkably increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Subsequently, based on the inverse correlation between miR-1303 and MMP9 expression, we further explored the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9 by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results revealed that the luciferase activity was notably decreased in the WT-MMP9 vector transfected with miR-1303 mimics compared with that in the other four groups, while the luciferase activity was not markedly changed in the mutant-MMP9 vector transfected with the five plasmids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We further assessed the influence of miR-1303 on the expression of MMP9 by detecting the mRNA and protein levels after transfecting miR-1303 mimics and found that forced miR-1303 expression resulted in a sharp decline of MMP9 mRNA and protein levels in 293T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Hence, these data demonstrated that miR-1303 might directly target MMP9.
