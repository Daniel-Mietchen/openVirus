<p id="Par9">Since junctional proteins play a major role in the regulation of BBB permeability, and their disruption is a hallmark of CNS abnormalities, we determined whether miR-1303 might regulate the expression of junctional proteins in HUVECs through MMP9. Based on the above results, which showed that MMP9 expression was upregulated in HUVECs following CA16 and EV71 infections, we prepared plasmids for MMP9 depletion (si-MMP9) and found that the protein knockdown efficiency of si-MMP9 was approximately 50% compared to the Mock and si-control in HUVECs (Fig S

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, cells in the mock, si-control, and si-MMP9 groups showed the normal “chicken wire” appearance of the Claudin4 structure. Compared with that in CA16-infected and EV71-infected cells, which displayed an obscure localization of Claudin4 at the cell–cell contact sites, Claudin4 staining was markedly enhanced in the si-MMP9-CA16 and si-MMP9-EV71 groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Subsequently, IF staining was performed for other junctional proteins, such as Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1. The location of these proteins presented an alteration similar to that of Claudin4 in each group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b–d</xref>). Therefore, these observations indicated that CA16 and EV71 infections could interfere with junctional protein assembly in HUVECs, which might be intimately linked to breakdown of the BBB because of the upregulation of MMP9. However, knockdown of MMP9 could maintain the locations of junctional proteins in CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs. Furthermore, western blot results also confirmed that CA16 and EV71 infections in HUVECs could upregulate MMP9 protein levels and downregulate the previously mentioned junctional protein levels, whereas these results were reversed when CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs were transfected with a si-MMP9 plasmid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Finally, according to the target relationship of miR-1303 and MMP9, we further detected the influences of miR-1303 at the locations of junctional proteins in CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs. After transfection with a miR-1303 overexpression plasmid, Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1 proteins were not destroyed in EV71-infected and CA16-infected HUVECs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Collectively, these results implied that miR-1303 might target MMP9 to inhibit junctional protein degradation, which might protect the BBB from damage.
