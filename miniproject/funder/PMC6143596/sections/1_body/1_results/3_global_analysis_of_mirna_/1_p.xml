<p id="Par7">Because CA16 and EV71 both caused remarkable changes in HUVEC permeability, we hypothesized that CA16 and EV71 infections might induce similar alterations. Thus, in this study, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs, which showed the same expression pattern in the trend analysis (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Subsequently, the 34 miRNAs expressed at the same trend were used to predict potential targets via TargetScan and the miRDB algorithm. As shown in Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>, the 658 overlapping targets identified by both programs were considered key targets of these miRNAs for the following GO and pathway analysis. Moreover, the GO results revealed that these target genes were categorized as follows: twelve as a biological process (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4A</xref>), eight as a molecular function (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4B</xref>), and eight as a cellular component (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4C</xref>). Then, the pathway results revealed 79 pathways (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To further narrow down the key targets, we identified intersections of related genes in the GO and pathway analyses, and 71 targets were identified, as shown in Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>. Consequently, a miRNA–gene network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and miRNA–GO network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) were built based on interactions between miRNAs and genes or miRNAs and GOs. Furthermore, these genes were used for a hierarchical GO category and coexpression network analysis. The results uncovered that signaling process, signal transmission, intracellular signal transduction, small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, regulation of exocyst localization, regulation of exocyst assembly, cell–cell adhesion, regulation of keratinocyte migration, and positive regulation of keratinocyte migration were significantly different (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Moreover, coexpression results revealed that junctional complexes, such as PCDHA11, PCDH1, and PCDHA7, were coexpressed. Therefore, these findings suggested that the deregulated miRNA-associated target genes might be involved in cell junctions. In addition, junctional complexes of the coexpression network contained MMP9 molecules (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which is an important factor that allows some neurotropic viruses to cross the BBB. However, our results also revealed that CA16 and EV71 infections might enhance BBB permeability. Therefore, we focused our attention on MMP9. To seek the major miRNA regulator of MMP9, we focused on the miRNA-target network and found that the only miRNA that interacted with MMP9 was miR-1303. Hence, we speculated that the abnormal expression of miR-1303 induced by CA16 and EV71 infections might enhance the increased BBB permeability via regulating MMP9 expression.
