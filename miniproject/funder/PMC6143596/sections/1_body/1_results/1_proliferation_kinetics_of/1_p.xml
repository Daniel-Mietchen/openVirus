<p id="Par5">To assess whether CA16 can infect and proliferate in HUVECs, the cell line was inoculated with each virus and analyzed for proliferation kinetics; EV71 experiments were performed in the same manner as the control. The level of EV71 and CA16 viral load showed a constant rise over time (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). Moreover, the production of infectious virus particles gradually increased over time with EV71 and CA16 infections (Fig S1B), suggesting that HUVECs are highly susceptible to EV71 and CA16.
