<p id="Par10">In a CA16-infected rhesus monkey model, levels of junctional proteins, including Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1, were significantly reduced in EGFP-CA16-infected monkeys compared with control monkeys. Although Claudin4 did not present a notable reduction, it exhibited a decrease trend in EGFP-CA16-infected monkeys compared to control monkeys. In addition, these protein levels were further reduced in EGFP-CA16 + MMP9-infected monkeys compared with EGFP-CA16-infected monkeys. However, the expression of these proteins was notably compensated in EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1-infected monkeys relative to EGFP-CA16 + MMP9-infected monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Therefore, these data suggested that MMP9 plays a key role in degrading junctional proteins in HUVECs. The viral infection rates of brain tissues and viral genomic copies in EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 monkeys were the highest, followed by those in EGFP-CA16 monkeys, and they were the lowest in EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref> and S8). This result indicated that MMP9 accelerates CA16 entry into the brain. Ultimately, the morphological examination showed no obvious pathological changes in the thalamus or lungs of control monkeys, whereas different pathological responses to EGFP-CA16 infection and EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 and EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 treatments were found in the thalamus and lungs. As presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>, mild hemorrhagic injuries were observed in the thalamus tissues of the EGFP-CA16 monkeys; serious hemorrhagic injuries were discovered in the thalamus tissues of the EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 monkeys, but these morphological changes were drastically improved in the EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 monkeys. Additionally, the alveolar wall in the EGFP-CA16 monkeys and EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 monkeys was visibly thicker than that in the control monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Nevertheless, the alveolar wall in the EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 monkeys was not apparently thickened (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that MMP9 may exacerbate CNS lesions and lung damage.
