 </sup>. In this study, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs in HUVECs after CA16 infection, focusing our attention on the similarly expressed miRNAs (Fig S

 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Overall, 658 intersection targets were used to further analyze the GO and pathways. The results of this analysis revealed that there were many intercellular adhesion-related GOs and pathways, such as biological adhesion, cell junction, and cadherin signaling pathways (Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Subsequently, the overlaying targets involved in both GOs and pathways were applied to construct miRNA-regulatory networks and gene coexpression networks. The results showed that MMP9 was only targeted by miR-1303, which was also implicated in the regulation of biological adhesion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a–c</xref>). In addition, there was an interaction between MMP9 and PVLR1 in a coexpression network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). PVRL1, also known as nectin1, was first identified as an afadin-binding protein and serves as a cell adhesion molecule at AJs

 </sup>. However, the formation of TJs in BMECs generally requires the existence of AJs. Thus, according to the above clues, we hypothesized whether the increased BBB permeability during EV71 and CA16 infections was attributed to the downregulation of miR-1303, which might negatively regulate the secretion of MMP9 and eventually lead to alterations in the junctional complexes between HUVECs.
