<p id="Par16">Our results are the first to demonstrate that CA16 infections in HUVECs can decrease the expression of miR-1303, which relieves the inhibitory role in MMP9 release and thus promotes MMP9 expression. Therefore, increased MMP9 expression enhanced the BBB permeability by directly degrading junctional complexes, which allowed the virus to enter the CNS and ultimately led to CNS lesions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We will further consider verifying this conclusion in humanized mice or genetically modified rhesus monkeys. These results might illustrate the potential molecular mechanism of BBB permeability during CA16 infections. This study not only provides a target for the clinical treatment of CA16 infections but also offers an early warning molecule for severe HFMD patients.
