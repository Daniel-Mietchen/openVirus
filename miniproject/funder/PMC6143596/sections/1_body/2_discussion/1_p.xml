<p id="Par11">Epidemics of CA16 infections have caused many fatalities from serious CNS complications in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997 and have become a serious public health problem in these areas

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the mechanism of CNS damage induced by CA16 remains obscure. MMPs are broad, nonspecific extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes that comprise collagenases (MMP1, 8, and 13), gelatinases (MMP2 and 9), stromelysins (MMP3, 10, and 11), and matrilysins (MMP7 and MMP26). Previous studies have shown that the increased MMP2 and MMP9 concentration in cerebrospinal fluid degrades junctional complex proteins between brain capillary endothelial cells, which further causes the disruption of BBB functions and ultimately promotes the formation of CNS-related diseases, such as ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma

 </sup>. The BBB is nonfenestrated to large molecules or xenobiotics, thus providing protection against invasion of the CNS by macromolecules and microorganisms
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. The integrity of the BBB is a result of a tightly sealed monolayer of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), with TJs and AJs forming the seal between cells at junctional complexes

 </sup>. Furthermore, many viruses (e.g., mouse adenovirus type 1) can trigger changes in BBB permeability by direct disruption of the TJ complex in endothelial cells

 </sup>. Additionally, evidence is emerging that MMP9 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BBB breakdown through regulating the complex intercellular junctional structure in BMECs
 <sup>

 </sup>. For example, the HIV-1-specific protein Tat enhances the production of MMP9, which can decrease TJ protein expression and finally result in an increase of BBB permeability

 </sup> recently speculated that miR-3473a is involved in destruction of the BBB by targeting MMP9 during EV71 infections based on miRNA expression profiles, but this speculation lacks further experimental support. In our study, it was first found that CA16 could increase the permeability of HUVECs in an in vitro BBB model. Previous research has shown that Japanese encephalitis virus is a neurotropic flavivirus that can compromise the structural and functional integrity of the BBB, likely via enhancing the viral load in BMECs, and has the potential to subvert host cell apoptosis to optimize the course of the viral infection through deactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This suggests that apoptosis induced by the virus and occurring in BMECs might promote breakdown of the BBB

 </sup>. Nevertheless, the BBB opening in this study was not related to cell apoptosis induced by CA16 infections (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, HUVECs are an important constituent of the BBB in an in vitro model

 </sup>. Therefore, to further characterize the mechanism by which CA16 modulates the upregulation of BBB permeability, we performed a miRNA profile analysis with high-throughput sequencing technology in CA16-infected HUVECs.
