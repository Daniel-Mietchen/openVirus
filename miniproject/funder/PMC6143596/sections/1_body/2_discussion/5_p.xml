<p id="Par15">To further confirm whether the degradation of junctional complexes could facilitate entry of CA16 into the CNS by breaking the BBB, which eventually leads to CNS damage, we conducted in vivo animal experiments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The viral infection rate in EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 monkeys was higher than that in EGFP-CA16 monkeys and further higher than that in EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> and Fig S
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Thus, these results confirmed that the brain tissues might have been susceptible to CA16 infection mainly because of the effects of MMP9 on BBB permeability, which eventually caused more severe CNS damage. Moreover, morphological examination revealed that the neuropathological lesions were the most marked in brain tissues of EGFP-CA16 + MMP9 monkeys, with obvious hemorrhagic injuries. Nevertheless, the above pathological changes were mild in the EGFP-CA16 monkeys and were not apparent in the EGFP-CA16 + TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>).
