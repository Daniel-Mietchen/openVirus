<p id="Par13">To address this hypothesis, it was necessary to confirm the expression levels of miR-1303 and MMP9 in an in vitro model of the BBB. miR-1303 and MMP9 expression was detected by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot. It was observed that miR-1303 expression was reduced, whereas MMP9 expression was elevated in HUVECs following CA16 infections, which was consistent with the high-throughput sequencing data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay directly indicated that MMP9 was the target gene of miR-1303 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Additionally, the downregulated expression of MMP9 at the mRNA and protein levels further demonstrated the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9 by overexpression of miR-1303 in 293T cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). To date, the investigations between miR-1303 and disease have mainly focused on cancers. For example, Zhang et al.

 </sup> verified that miR-1303 facilitates the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer through targeting claudin-18. However, the role of miR-1303 in CNS-related diseases has not been reported; therefore, based on the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9, we aimed to further investigate the effects of miR-1303 on changes in BBB permeability in HUVECs following CA16 infections.
