<p id="Par14">Junctional complexes between BMECs, such as TJs and AJs, play a crucial role in the regulation of BBB permeability

 </sup>. TJs are the luminal-most cellular junction and are composed of claudins, occludin, and zona occludens, which seal the paracellular route between BMECs, creating a high transendothelial cell electrical resistance barrier that impedes ions and small charged molecules from crossing the BBB. However, AJs are positioned abluminal to TJs and consist of VE-cadherin dimers that mediate cell–cell membrane adhesion and bind to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins in BMECs

 </sup>. For instance, rabies virus infection promotes the release of a large number of inflammatory cytokines, which further reduces the expression of TJ proteins in the vascular endothelial cells of the BBB and ultimately results in increased BBB permeability
 <sup>

 </sup>. Thus, maintaining the intact structure and function of TJ-associated and AJ-associated proteins is essential for BBB integrity. In our study, the expression levels of TJ-associated proteins Claudin4, Claudin5, and ZO-1, as well as the AJ-associated protein VE-cadherin, were significantly reduced in HUVECs after infection with CA16 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, the expression levels of these proteins were not remarkably affected in CA16-infected HUVECs that were pretransfected with a si-MMP9 plasmid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Claudin4, Claudin5, and ZO-1 are often considered sensitive indicators of normal and disturbed functional states of the BBB, while VE-cadherin, a member of a transmembrane Ca

 </sup>. Therefore, our results suggested that CA16 infections result in BBB dysfunction likely through modulating the expression of TJ-associated and AJ-associated proteins, which might be intimately related to MMP9. MMP9 is normally only present at low levels in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid but is markedly upregulated in many infectious diseases of the CNS

 </sup>. Subsequently, based on the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9, we continued to investigate the effects of miR-1303 on the above junctional proteins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. The results revealed that the expression levels of Claudin4, Claudin5, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin were not notably reduced in CA16-infected HUVECs pretransfected with a miR-1303 plasmid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Hence, this result indicated that the downregulation of miR-1303 induced by CA16 infections in HUVECs reduced the expression levels of Claudin4, Claudin5, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin by accelerating the release of MMP9, which might explain why the BBB permeability increased during EV71 and CA16 infections.
