  <title>Predicted networks between the coincident trend expressed miRNAs and their putative target genes, their putative target gene-associated GOs, Hierarchical tree graphs of GO terms and co-expression network.</title>
  <p> All miRNAs are depicted as a blue colored node among the networks. The larger the area of the nodes, the bigger the number of connections between a miRNA and other nodes in the network.
   <bold>a</bold> Predicted network between the same expressed miRNAs and their putative target genes. Putative targets are presented wathet blue rounded rectangles. The width of the line represents the free energy between the miRNAs and their putative target genes. 
   <bold>b</bold> Predicted network between the same expressed miRNAs and their putative target gene-associated GOs. Red rectangle nodes denote GOs. Edges show the inhibitory effects of miRNAs on GOs. 
   <bold>c</bold> In total, 71 genes were used to generate the GO tree. Edges represent “parent–child” relationships of GO terms. The sizes of the yellow rounded rectangles are proportional to the number of GO terms annotated to each node. 
   <bold>d</bold> Co-expression network were constructed by the top ten significantly putative targets. Green nodes are target genes and pink nodes are co-expression genes. Genes with bigger size are more centralized in the network and have a stronger capacity of modulating adjacent genes. Different color lines mean the different interactions between these genes
