  <title>Junctional proteins expression including Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1 were degraded by CA16 infection and knockout MMP9 rescued this degradation.</title>

   <bold>a</bold> Protein expression of junctional proteins in HUVECs with different treatments normalized against GAPDH. 
   <bold>b</bold> Densitometry of WBs of three independent experiments performed with lysates at 72 and 96 hpi. The signal intensity was normalized to GAPDH levels from the same blots. The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM for three subjects, *
