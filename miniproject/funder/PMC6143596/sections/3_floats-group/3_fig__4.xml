  <p>Confocal imaging showed that the junctional protein including 
   <bold>a</bold> Claudin4, 
   <bold>b</bold> Claudin5, 
   <bold>c</bold> VE-Cadherin, and 
   <bold>d</bold> ZO-1 were degraded by CA16 infection and knockout MMP9 rescued these degradation. The si-control and si-MMP9 plasmids contain a GFP tag (green color). EV71/CA16-VP1, junctional proteins and the cell nucleus are indicated by red, purple and mazarine, respectively
