  <title>MMP9 promotes the degradation of junctional protein and CA16 entry into the CNS, which leading to CNS lesion in CA16-infected rhesus monkeys.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Junctional protein expression in thalamus of different treated rhesus monkeys. 
   <bold>b</bold> Statistical analysis of the quantitative value of intensity about the blots. The ratios indicated the intensity of the bands compare to the GAPDH. 
   <bold>c</bold> The efficacy of CA16 infections in thalamus of different treated rhesus monkeys. CA16-VP1 and the cell nucleus are indicated by green and mazarine, respectively. 
   <bold>d</bold> Statistical analysis of viral infection rates. The ratios indicated the infected cells compared to the total cells from ten different visual fields. 
   <bold>e</bold> Histopathological changes in the thalamus and lungs of different treated rhesus monkeys. The green arrow points to a place where pathological changes are obvious
