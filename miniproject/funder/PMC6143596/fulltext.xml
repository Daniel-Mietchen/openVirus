CA16 infection can also progress to central nervous system (CNS) complications; however, the underlying mechanism by which CA16 penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and then causes CNS damage remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of CA16 neurotropic tropism by establishing an in vitro BBB model with CA16 infection and an in vivo CA16 rhesus monkey infant infection model. The results showed that CA16 infection induced increased permeability of the BBB accompanied by upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression. Subsequently, high-throughput miRNA sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis revealed that miR-1303 may regulate BBB permeability by targeting MMP9. Next, we used dual-luciferase, qRT-PCR, and western blot assays to provide evidence of MMP9 targeting by miR-1303. Further experiments revealed that CA16 infection promoted the degradation of junctional complexes (Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1), likely by downregulating miR-1303 and upregulating MMP9. Finally, EGFP-CA16 infection could enter the CNS by facilitating the degradation of junctional complexes, eventually causing neuroinflammation and injury to the CNS, which was confirmed using the in vivo rhesus monkey model. Our results indicate that CA16 might penetrate the BBB and then enter the CNS by downregulating miR-1303, which disrupts junctional complexes by directly regulating MMP9 and ultimately causing pathological CNS changes. These results provide new therapeutic targets in HFMD patients following CA16 infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005150</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-I2M-1-014</award-id><award-id>2017-I2M-2-006</award-id><award-id>2017310039</award-id><award-id>2016-I2M-1-019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hongzhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100007471</institution-id><institution>Applied Basic Research Foundation of Yunnan Province (Yunnan Province Applied and Basic Research Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016HC009)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hongzhe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science Foundation of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31700153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004572</institution-id><institution>National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China (Ministry of Health of China)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017 Yunnan Medical Reserve Talents (H-2017034)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16), which belongs to the human enterovirus A species of the Picornaviridae family, is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is a common infectious disease mostly seen in children under 5 years old<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In most instances, HFMD is a benign, self-limiting disease that is often characterized by fever, pharyngitis, and vesicular eruptions on the hands and feet, as well as in the mouth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, in some epidemic outbreaks, severe progressive HFMD with fatalities has been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The occurrence of high mortality is usually concomitant with central nervous system (CNS) complications, such as acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, and pulmonary edema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Currently, three companies in mainland China, namely, Beijing Vigoo Biological Co., Ltd. (Vigoo), Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd. (Sinovac), and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) have successfully developed inactivated EV71 vaccines. All three vaccines have been reported to have high safety and efficacy for preventing EV71 infections, but they have no cross-protective effects on other enterovirus infections, including CA16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Previous studies have indicated that most CA16 infections present only mild symptoms. However, accumulating evidence in recent years has demonstrated that CA16 might actually be more virulent in children and has induced severe cases of CNS complications and fatal outcomes, which were similar to those of EV71 infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, some severe and fatal HFMD cases with CA6 and CA10 infections have shown a clear increasing trend in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that it is important to explore the underlying molecular basis of HFMD pathogenesis and progression induced by CA16 infections, which might provide novel approaches for the development of vaccines that cover multiple species of enterovirus.</p><p id="Par3">Similar to poliovirus, CA16 is a highly neurotropic virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Two likely routes by which CA16 enter the CNS have been considered: the virus either is transmitted to the CNS from the blood across the blood&#x02013;brain barrier (BBB) or enters the CNS through peripheral nerves via retrograde axonal transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Several studies have revealed that the BBB, which is primarily composed of brain endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, perivascular macrophages, and a basal membrane, acts in concert with the immune system to restrict the entry of pathogens into the CNS. Meanwhile, many pathogens manage to cross the BBB via modifying a host of BBB functions, altering BBB integrity, and disrupting BBB permeability, which ultimately allows the establishment of infection within the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, West Nile virus enters the brain by enhancing the BBB permeability with matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) release. MMP9 is a member of the zinc-dependent and calcium-dependent endopeptidase family that is capable of degrading most extracellular matrix components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, in the CNS, MMP9 can degrade components of the basal lamina and junctional complexes, leading to the disruption of BBB integrity and induction of the neuroinflammatory response in many neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. For instance, alterations in BBB permeability were consistent with the increased expression of MMP9 in stroke and traumatic brain injury; further, it was found that disruption of BBB integrity in the setting of elevated MMP9 expression was closely associated with changes in junction assembly and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Junctional complexes in the BBB primarily include tight junctions (TJs), adhesion junctions (AJs), and gap junctions, which contribute differently to BBB dysfunction by directly regulating BBB permeability, altering transcellular exchange, affecting the expression pattern of certain transporters, and modifying endothelial metabolic processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Hence, destruction of these junctional complexes indirectly mirrors the breakdown of BBB integrity.</p><p id="Par4">Our previous study analyzed transcriptome changes in a CA16-infected rhesus monkey model and found that the expression of MMP9 was significantly increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, we speculated that the CNS injuries induced by CA16 infection are derived from direct penetration of the BBB by CA16 and that the molecular mechanism of BBB penetration by CA16 is related to the deregulation of junctional complexes via MMP9. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the upstream regulatory factors of MMP9 using miRNA high-throughput sequencing technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Proliferation kinetics of CA16 in HUVECs</title><p id="Par5">To assess whether CA16 can infect and proliferate in HUVECs, the cell line was inoculated with each virus and analyzed for proliferation kinetics; EV71 experiments were performed in the same manner as the control. The level of EV71 and CA16 viral load showed a constant rise over time (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">1A</xref>). Moreover, the production of infectious virus particles gradually increased over time with EV71 and CA16 infections (Fig S1B), suggesting that HUVECs are highly susceptible to EV71 and CA16.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>CA16 infections promote HUVEC permeability</title><p id="Par6">To determine the effects of CA16 infection on the integrity of HUVECs, we performed a HUVEC endocytosis assay using FITC-dextran. The results revealed that FITC-dextran leakage was significantly upregulated in CA16-treated HUVECs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), indicating that CA16 infections might enhance cell permeability. Coincidently, CA16 infection induced increased permeability of the BBB that was accompanied by upregulated MMP9 expression (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Subsequently, an apoptosis assay was used to evaluate whether the alterations in HUVEC permeability were attributed to apoptosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). There were no significant differences in HUVEC apoptosis induced by CA16 infections, implying that apoptosis might not be responsible for HUVEC permeability during CA16 infection. Similar results were observed in EV71-infected HUVECs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>CA16 infections increased permeability of monolayer HUVECs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Permeability of monolayer HUVECs was detected by a paracellular FITC-dextran flux assay.

Thus, in this study, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs, which showed the same expression pattern in the trend analysis (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Subsequently, the 34 miRNAs expressed at the same trend were used to predict potential targets via TargetScan and the miRDB algorithm. As shown in Fig S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>, the 658 overlapping targets identified by both programs were considered key targets of these miRNAs for the following GO and pathway analysis. Moreover, the GO results revealed that these target genes were categorized as follows: twelve as a biological process (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4A</xref>), eight as a molecular function (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4B</xref>), and eight as a cellular component (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4C</xref>). Then, the pathway results revealed 79 pathways (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">5</xref>). To further narrow down the key targets, we identified intersections of related genes in the GO and pathway analyses, and 71 targets were identified, as shown in Fig S<xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>. Consequently, a miRNA&#x02013;gene network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and miRNA&#x02013;GO network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) were built based on interactions between miRNAs and genes or miRNAs and GOs. Furthermore, these genes were used for a hierarchical GO category and coexpression network analysis. The results uncovered that signaling process, signal transmission, intracellular signal transduction, small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, regulation of exocyst localization, regulation of exocyst assembly, cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, regulation of keratinocyte migration, and positive regulation of keratinocyte migration were significantly different (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Moreover, coexpression results revealed that junctional complexes, such as PCDHA11, PCDH1, and PCDHA7, were coexpressed. Therefore, these findings suggested that the deregulated miRNA-associated target genes might be involved in cell junctions. In addition, junctional complexes of the coexpression network contained MMP9 molecules (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which is an important factor that allows some neurotropic viruses to cross the BBB. However, our results also revealed that CA16 and EV71 infections might enhance BBB permeability. Therefore, we focused our attention on MMP9. To seek the major miRNA regulator of MMP9, we focused on the miRNA-target network and found that the only miRNA that interacted with MMP9 was miR-1303. Hence, we speculated that the abnormal expression of miR-1303 induced by CA16 and EV71 infections might enhance the increased BBB permeability via regulating MMP9 expression.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Predicted networks between the coincident trend expressed miRNAs and their putative target genes, their putative target gene-associated GOs, Hierarchical tree graphs of GO terms and co-expression network.</title><p> All miRNAs are depicted as a blue colored node among the networks.

The level of miR-1303 was markedly decreased, which was consistent with our miRNA sequence results (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), whereas the level of MMP9 was remarkably increased (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Subsequently, based on the inverse correlation between miR-1303 and MMP9 expression, we further explored the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9 by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The results revealed that the luciferase activity was notably decreased in the WT-MMP9 vector transfected with miR-1303 mimics compared with that in the other four groups, while the luciferase activity was not markedly changed in the mutant-MMP9 vector transfected with the five plasmids (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). We further assessed the influence of miR-1303 on the expression of MMP9 by detecting the mRNA and protein levels after transfecting miR-1303 mimics and found that forced miR-1303 expression resulted in a sharp decline of MMP9 mRNA and protein levels in 293T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Based on the above results, which showed that MMP9 expression was upregulated in HUVECs following CA16 and EV71 infections, we prepared plasmids for MMP9 depletion (si-MMP9) and found that the protein knockdown efficiency of si-MMP9 was approximately 50% compared to the Mock and si-control in HUVECs (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">7</xref>). As illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, cells in the mock, si-control, and si-MMP9 groups showed the normal &#x0201c;chicken wire&#x0201d; appearance of the Claudin4 structure. Compared with that in CA16-infected and EV71-infected cells, which displayed an obscure localization of Claudin4 at the cell&#x02013;cell contact sites, Claudin4 staining was markedly enhanced in the si-MMP9-CA16 and si-MMP9-EV71 groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Subsequently, IF staining was performed for other junctional proteins, such as Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1. The location of these proteins presented an alteration similar to that of Claudin4 in each group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b&#x02013;d</xref>). Therefore, these observations indicated that CA16 and EV71 infections could interfere with junctional protein assembly in HUVECs, which might be intimately linked to breakdown of the BBB because of the upregulation of MMP9. However, knockdown of MMP9 could maintain the locations of junctional proteins in CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs. Furthermore, western blot results also confirmed that CA16 and EV71 infections in HUVECs could upregulate MMP9 protein levels and downregulate the previously mentioned junctional protein levels, whereas these results were reversed when CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs were transfected with a si-MMP9 plasmid (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Finally, according to the target relationship of miR-1303 and MMP9, we further detected the influences of miR-1303 at the locations of junctional proteins in CA16-infected and EV71-infected HUVECs. After transfection with a miR-1303 overexpression plasmid, Claudin4, Claudin5, VE-Cadherin, and ZO-1 proteins were not destroyed in EV71-infected and CA16-infected HUVECs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Collectively, these results implied that miR-1303 might target MMP9 to inhibit junctional protein degradation, which might protect the BBB from damage.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Confocal imaging showed that the junctional protein including <bold>a</bold> Claudin4, <bold>b</bold> Claudin5, <bold>c</bold> VE-Cadherin, and <bold>d</bold> ZO-1 were degraded by CA16 infection and knockout MMP9 rescued these degradation.

Although Claudin4 did not present a notable reduction, it exhibited a decrease trend in EGFP-CA16-infected monkeys compared to control monkeys. In addition, these protein levels were further reduced in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9-infected monkeys compared with EGFP-CA16-infected monkeys. However, the expression of these proteins was notably compensated in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1-infected monkeys relative to EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9-infected monkeys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). Therefore, these data suggested that MMP9 plays a key role in degrading junctional proteins in HUVECs. The viral infection rates of brain tissues and viral genomic copies in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 monkeys were the highest, followed by those in EGFP-CA16 monkeys, and they were the lowest in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref> and S8). This result indicated that MMP9 accelerates CA16 entry into the brain. Ultimately, the morphological examination showed no obvious pathological changes in the thalamus or lungs of control monkeys, whereas different pathological responses to EGFP-CA16 infection and EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 and EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 treatments were found in the thalamus and lungs. As presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>, mild hemorrhagic injuries were observed in the thalamus tissues of the EGFP-CA16 monkeys; serious hemorrhagic injuries were discovered in the thalamus tissues of the EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 monkeys, but these morphological changes were drastically improved in the EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 monkeys. Additionally, the alveolar wall in the EGFP-CA16 monkeys and EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 monkeys was visibly thicker than that in the control monkeys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Nevertheless, the alveolar wall in the EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 monkeys was not apparently thickened (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate that MMP9 may exacerbate CNS lesions and lung damage.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><title>MMP9 promotes the degradation of junctional protein and CA16 entry into the CNS, which leading to CNS lesion in CA16-infected rhesus monkeys.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Junctional protein expression in thalamus of different treated rhesus monkeys. <bold>b</bold> Statistical analysis of the quantitative value of intensity about the blots.

Nevertheless, the mechanism of CNS damage induced by CA16 remains obscure. MMPs are broad, nonspecific extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes that comprise collagenases (MMP1, 8, and 13), gelatinases (MMP2 and 9), stromelysins (MMP3, 10, and 11), and matrilysins (MMP7 and MMP26). Previous studies have shown that the increased MMP2 and MMP9 concentration in cerebrospinal fluid degrades junctional complex proteins between brain capillary endothelial cells, which further causes the disruption of BBB functions and ultimately promotes the formation of CNS-related diseases, such as ischemic stroke, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The BBB is nonfenestrated to large molecules or xenobiotics, thus providing protection against invasion of the CNS by macromolecules and microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The integrity of the BBB is a result of a tightly sealed monolayer of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), with TJs and AJs forming the seal between cells at junctional complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, many viruses (e.g., mouse adenovirus type 1) can trigger changes in BBB permeability by direct disruption of the TJ complex in endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, evidence is emerging that MMP9 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of BBB breakdown through regulating the complex intercellular junctional structure in BMECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For example, the HIV-1-specific protein Tat enhances the production of MMP9, which can decrease TJ protein expression and finally result in an increase of BBB permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> recently speculated that miR-3473a is involved in destruction of the BBB by targeting MMP9 during EV71 infections based on miRNA expression profiles, but this speculation lacks further experimental support. In our study, it was first found that CA16 could increase the permeability of HUVECs in an in vitro BBB model. Previous research has shown that Japanese encephalitis virus is a neurotropic flavivirus that can compromise the structural and functional integrity of the BBB, likely via enhancing the viral load in BMECs, and has the potential to subvert host cell apoptosis to optimize the course of the viral infection through deactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This suggests that apoptosis induced by the virus and occurring in BMECs might promote breakdown of the BBB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the BBB opening in this study was not related to cell apoptosis induced by CA16 infections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Furthermore, HUVECs are an important constituent of the BBB in an in vitro model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, to further characterize the mechanism by which CA16 modulates the upregulation of BBB permeability, we performed a miRNA profile analysis with high-throughput sequencing technology in CA16-infected HUVECs.</p><p id="Par12">miRNAs are known to play a role in the replication and propagation of viruses, including cellular antiviral responses and/or the promotion of viral infections through complex regulatory pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this study, we screened the differentially expressed miRNAs in HUVECs after CA16 infection, focusing our attention on the similarly expressed miRNAs (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Meanwhile, the potential targets of these miRNAs were predicted by TargetScan and miRDB (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Overall, 658 intersection targets were used to further analyze the GO and pathways. The results of this analysis revealed that there were many intercellular adhesion-related GOs and pathways, such as biological adhesion, cell junction, and cadherin signaling pathways (Fig S<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Subsequently, the overlaying targets involved in both GOs and pathways were applied to construct miRNA-regulatory networks and gene coexpression networks. The results showed that MMP9 was only targeted by miR-1303, which was also implicated in the regulation of biological adhesion (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>). In addition, there was an interaction between MMP9 and PVLR1 in a coexpression network (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). PVRL1, also known as nectin1, was first identified as an afadin-binding protein and serves as a cell adhesion molecule at AJs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the formation of TJs in BMECs generally requires the existence of AJs. Thus, according to the above clues, we hypothesized whether the increased BBB permeability during EV71 and CA16 infections was attributed to the downregulation of miR-1303, which might negatively regulate the secretion of MMP9 and eventually lead to alterations in the junctional complexes between HUVECs.</p><p id="Par13">To address this hypothesis, it was necessary to confirm the expression levels of miR-1303 and MMP9 in an in vitro model of the BBB. miR-1303 and MMP9 expression was detected by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and western blot. It was observed that miR-1303 expression was reduced, whereas MMP9 expression was elevated in HUVECs following CA16 infections, which was consistent with the high-throughput sequencing data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). Moreover, the dual-luciferase reporter assay directly indicated that MMP9 was the target gene of miR-1303 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Additionally, the downregulated expression of MMP9 at the mRNA and protein levels further demonstrated the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9 by overexpression of miR-1303 in 293T cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). To date, the investigations between miR-1303 and disease have mainly focused on cancers. For example, Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> verified that miR-1303 facilitates the proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer through targeting claudin-18. However, the role of miR-1303 in CNS-related diseases has not been reported; therefore, based on the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9, we aimed to further investigate the effects of miR-1303 on changes in BBB permeability in HUVECs following CA16 infections.</p><p id="Par14">Junctional complexes between BMECs, such as TJs and AJs, play a crucial role in the regulation of BBB permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. TJs are the luminal-most cellular junction and are composed of claudins, occludin, and zona occludens, which seal the paracellular route between BMECs, creating a high transendothelial cell electrical resistance barrier that impedes ions and small charged molecules from crossing the BBB. However, AJs are positioned abluminal to TJs and consist of VE-cadherin dimers that mediate cell&#x02013;cell membrane adhesion and bind to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins in BMECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For instance, rabies virus infection promotes the release of a large number of inflammatory cytokines, which further reduces the expression of TJ proteins in the vascular endothelial cells of the BBB and ultimately results in increased BBB permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, maintaining the intact structure and function of TJ-associated and AJ-associated proteins is essential for BBB integrity. In our study, the expression levels of TJ-associated proteins Claudin4, Claudin5, and ZO-1, as well as the AJ-associated protein VE-cadherin, were significantly reduced in HUVECs after infection with CA16 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Moreover, the expression levels of these proteins were not remarkably affected in CA16-infected HUVECs that were pretransfected with a si-MMP9 plasmid (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Claudin4, Claudin5, and ZO-1 are often considered sensitive indicators of normal and disturbed functional states of the BBB, while VE-cadherin, a member of a transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent adhesion molecule family, regulates vascular permeability in the BBB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, our results suggested that CA16 infections result in BBB dysfunction likely through modulating the expression of TJ-associated and AJ-associated proteins, which might be intimately related to MMP9. MMP9 is normally only present at low levels in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid but is markedly upregulated in many infectious diseases of the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Subsequently, based on the target interaction between miR-1303 and MMP9, we continued to investigate the effects of miR-1303 on the above junctional proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The results revealed that the expression levels of Claudin4, Claudin5, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin were not notably reduced in CA16-infected HUVECs pretransfected with a miR-1303 plasmid (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Hence, this result indicated that the downregulation of miR-1303 induced by CA16 infections in HUVECs reduced the expression levels of Claudin4, Claudin5, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin by accelerating the release of MMP9, which might explain why the BBB permeability increased during EV71 and CA16 infections.</p><p id="Par15">To further confirm whether the degradation of junctional complexes could facilitate entry of CA16 into the CNS by breaking the BBB, which eventually leads to CNS damage, we conducted in vivo animal experiments (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). The viral infection rate in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 monkeys was higher than that in EGFP-CA16 monkeys and further higher than that in EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref> and Fig S<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Thus, these results confirmed that the brain tissues might have been susceptible to CA16 infection mainly because of the effects of MMP9 on BBB permeability, which eventually caused more severe CNS damage. Moreover, morphological examination revealed that the neuropathological lesions were the most marked in brain tissues of EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;MMP9 monkeys, with obvious hemorrhagic injuries. Nevertheless, the above pathological changes were mild in the EGFP-CA16 monkeys and were not apparent in the EGFP-CA16&#x02009;+&#x02009;TIMP-1 monkeys (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Our results are the first to demonstrate that CA16 infections in HUVECs can decrease the expression of miR-1303, which relieves the inhibitory role in MMP9 release and thus promotes MMP9 expression. Therefore, increased MMP9 expression enhanced the BBB permeability by directly degrading junctional complexes, which allowed the virus to enter the CNS and ultimately led to CNS lesions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). We will further consider verifying this conclusion in humanized mice or genetically modified rhesus monkeys. These results might illustrate the potential molecular mechanism of BBB permeability during CA16 infections.

The PCR amplification cycle was set at 42&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 5&#x02009;min for reverse transcription, followed by 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s for initial denaturation and 40 cycles of 5-s denaturation at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and 34-s annealing at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The reactions were run on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA).</p><p id="Par28">For the miR-1303 analysis, miRNA was enriched by a miRcute miRNA Isolation Kit (TIANGEN, China). Subsequently, 2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of RNA was first polyadenylated with polyA polymerase and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with a poly(T) adapter primer under the following reaction conditions: 60&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, 5&#x02009;min at 85&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and maintenance at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Finally, PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TAKARA, Japan) in accordance with the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols, on an ABI7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The amplification conditions were as follows: 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s, 40 cycles of 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;s, and 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 40&#x02009;s, and dissociation at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 60&#x02009;s, 55&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s, and 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x02009;s. The qRT-PCR results were calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method and U6 snRNA, which was provided with the kit and served as an internal control.
