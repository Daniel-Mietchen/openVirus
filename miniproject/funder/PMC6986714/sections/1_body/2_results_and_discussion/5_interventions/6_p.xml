 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g006">Fig 6</xref> presents the results for this last intervention. The curves in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> show a similar pattern, as observed in the other two previous actions. The number of cases shows a decay after the intervention starts for different intensities of 
 <italic>ϵ</italic>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g006">Fig 6B</xref> the total number of cases curves present results closer to the birth control intervention than the fogging action. For 
 <italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.25, the total number of cases decreased to 82.7% of the initial value, meanwhile, for 
 <italic>ϵ</italic> = 0.5 this number drops to 64.1%.
