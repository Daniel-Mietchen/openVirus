 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the distribution of the number of cases and the cumulative number of cases as a function time for different intensities of the mosquito birth rate reduction. Similar behavior as the fogging intervention is observed here. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, the number of cases reaches the peak of infected people sooner and then starts a decay in the number of cases per week. The total number of case drops to 85.3% when

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222900.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. Although the behavior is similar to the fogging action, the response of decreasing the mosquito birth rate to the total number of cases is less efficient during the outbreak. It is worthwhile to mention that this kind of action, different from the fogging, can be inherited and passed to the following years and avoid new outbreaks to occurs in the future.
