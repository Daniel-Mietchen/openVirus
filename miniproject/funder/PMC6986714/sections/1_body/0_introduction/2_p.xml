<p>Here we apply a compartmental mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of Chikungunya outbreaks in the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The model consists of ordinary differential equations that describe the transmission and the transition of the diseases in humans and vectors [

 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The modelâ€™s parameters were extracted from the literature or obtained from the best fit from the data of Rio de Janeiro surveillance report for the years of 2016, 2018 and 2019 [

 </sub> for Chikungunya outbreaks in those years. We also simulate a scenario predicting if the Mayaro virus could be a potential epidemic disease in Rio de Janeiro. Modifications in the standard model equations were implemented to introduce different possible interventions in order to decrease the number of infected people [
 <xref rid="pone.0222900.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Those simulated interventions include actions such as killing adult mosquitoes by fogging, decreasing mosquitoes birth rate by removing places where the vector lays eggs, e.g., removing standing water and, decreasing the contact between an infected human with mosquitoes by stimulating repellent usage. A scenario containing all interventions was also performed for different intensities of those actions.
