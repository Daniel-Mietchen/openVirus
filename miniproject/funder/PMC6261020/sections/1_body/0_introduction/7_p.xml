<p>Research has indicated that HFRS has a characteristic seasonal or cyclic time series-based occurrence [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our previous work, a Seasonal Difference—Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (SD-GTWR) model was developed as an extension of the GTWR model that sought to use seasonal difference to get stabilized data [
 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Seasonal difference was used to deal with a non-stationary time series with seasonal distribution characteristics. Following on from this research, we constructed a Seasonal Difference—Space-Time Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SD-STARIMA) model that is based on STARIMA. Time serials analysis and autocorrelation analysis were conducted to ensure the feasibility of using a seasonal difference approach. The STARIMA model is a prerequisite for advanced seasonal difference modeling and analysis. In our previous research, we found that from 1980 to 2000 [

 <xref rid="pone.0207518.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] the HFRS cases in Hubei Province displayed a bimodal seasonal distribution pattern rather than a linear distribution. Seasonal difference calculations for HFRS incidence in Hubei using SD-STARIMA offer the prospect of improving the accuracy of previous space-time series models. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a new SD-STARIMA model that is able to bring seasonal difference calculations to bear in a way that will eliminate the non-stationary temporality problem found in HFRS data. Estimation results from the SD-STARIMA model show it to be more accurate than other models such as ARIMA and STARIMA. This confirms its potential to contribute to the prevention and control of HFRS.
