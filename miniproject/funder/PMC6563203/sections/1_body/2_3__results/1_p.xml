<p>The preliminary examination of the simulation script tested the effect of the relative order of string elements. It established that varying the positions of the “0” and “1” elements of the seed and target strings was without effect on the numbers of simulation cycles. The mean numbers of evolutionary cycles needed to increase the fitness index from a given level to the various higher fitness levels are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00418-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The simulation revealed that the relationship between the simulated genetic and mutational distances is non-linear, and can be consistent with different rates of nucleotide substitution observed at different depths of branches in phylogenetic trees. As expected because of the random calculation steps integral to the simulation script, considerable variation in the extent of mutation distances (computational cycles) occurred, as reflected in the substantial standard errors. Despite these large standard errors for numbers, the mutation distance increased as the genetic distance increased from 1 to 5. Also, as expected, the mutation distance increased with the genetic distances. Not unexpectedly, using targets with more than six negative alleles (genetic distance = 6) resulted in the highest number of computational cycles to reach a string consisting of all positive alleles. Considering transitioning from a distance of two viral substitutions to eight, such a change was accompanied by close to 6000 cycles of mutation, replication, and selection. Approximately 3000 cycles underlie a genetic distance leap of three substitutions (from two to five).
