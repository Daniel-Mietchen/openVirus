<p>The addition of further strain modules will result in a supermodule, depicting the possible evolutionary paths within a viral species. At a still larger scale, the species supermodules may connect to create genus super-supermodules. The process is extensible to larger and larger scales. Thus, the structure of the connectivity diagrams is independent of scale.</p>
