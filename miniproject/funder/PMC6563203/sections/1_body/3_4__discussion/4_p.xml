<p>These frequencies, for many collections of taxa, exhibit a series of peaks and valleys. Each peak has a Poisson-like distribution, as expected from the network theory. The peaks are interpreted as substitution distances for a particular taxonomic level (within strain, within species, within genus, within family, etc.). In this way, pairs can be assigned as members of the same strain of a species, or as different strains of the same species, or as different species of the same genus, and so on, depending on the peak order. Such a plot is predicted by the network theory, where each peak corresponds to a module of related sequences with other modules of the same divergence.</p>
