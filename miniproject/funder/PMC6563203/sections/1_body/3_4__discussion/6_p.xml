<p>There will be fewer nodes at the periphery of a module. Connections from strain A outlier nodes to similar nodes of strain B may exist. These connections provide an evolutionary path between strains A and B. Such connections likely will require further mutational changes (node connections). Over time, the taxa will wander their landscape networks. Occasionally, one will wander to the vicinity of a node shared with another module, representing another taxon or potential taxonâ€”a boundary.</p>
