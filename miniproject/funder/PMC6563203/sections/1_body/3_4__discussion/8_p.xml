<p>The simple computational strategy developed here to address the explanation of the TDR can also be modified to model events, other than replication, mutation, and selection, that affect evolution. Such events can include new hosts, environmental changes, host defenses, and agricultural practice. Introducing into models modified 12mer strings that are defined to signal path closure, or new options for a particular host environment, could reveal new pathways of evolution.</p>
