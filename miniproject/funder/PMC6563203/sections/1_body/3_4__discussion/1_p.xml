<p>Viral populations are often thought of as quasispecies. They are networks consisting of viral genome segments as edges, connected by nodes at the edge ends. These are capable of mutational changes. In the present context, the mutation of a node residue to one that no longer interacts with a partner closes the edge to substitution. Conversely, a change in another network node can open an interaction with another network module (
