<p>The concept of a network of functional loci connected by mutational paths, as playing a significant role in the evolution of viruses in host environments, may help to imagine viral sequence space as a random network in which each node represents a viable viral genome sequence. Each node is directly connected to all of the other nodes by a bidirectional edge, so that it can reach by a single nucleotide mutation (

In the computational simulation, the recorded substitutions that do not contribute to the genetic distance may correspond to the networks of changes that open or close the gates connecting the submodules of the population.
