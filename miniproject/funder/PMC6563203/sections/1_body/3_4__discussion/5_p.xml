<p>Recall that nodes are defined as viable genome sequences, genomes whose fitness is greater than some arbitrary value. “Viable” or “fit” are used here to characterize a genome molecule that, when placed in a given environment, will generate multiple copies of itself (

Groupings of nodes interconnected by a high density of edges, called modules, can be imagined as describing a strain of a virus. A module for strain A of a virus will be distinct from a module formed by strain B sequences, with few, if any, edges joining the two modules.
