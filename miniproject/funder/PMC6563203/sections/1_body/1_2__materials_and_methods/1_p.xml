<p>To test the hypothesis, we defined the phylogenetic distance as the number of loci (sequence positions) that differ between the two sequences and evolutionary distances, as the number of modeled mutations used to transition between the two sequences, given the mutation, replication, and selection processes. We devised a simple program (Mevolve.c4d; 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00418">Supplementary Material</xref>) to generate evolutionary distances using a network similar to the neutral network of Manrubia and Cuesta [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], except that we focused on non-neutral mutations. Genomes were represented as strings of an arbitrary length of 12, representing variable positions in the sequence. Each position in the string is diallelic [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], having just two states, “0” and “1”, that can mutate from one to the other. A “1” in a position contributes a positive effect on the fitness of the virus in a particular environment, the latter assumed to be held constant. The program incorporates mutation, replication, and selection in cycles. Inputs are a “seed” string and a target string. The initial homogeneous seed population of size ten is subjected to the mutation of a single digit per string—the position of the mutation being chosen randomly.
