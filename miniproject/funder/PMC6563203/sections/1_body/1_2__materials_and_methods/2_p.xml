<p>After this mutation step, the population is allowed to expand to 100 members by replication. The number of offspring produced by each string is determined by the fitness of the string (determined by the number of “1” in the chain, the string’s fitness index). To implement the selection, the population size is then lowered to the original ten by a bottleneck, in which ten random selections of pairs are compared by fitness index values, keeping the more fit for the next round of 10 strings. The process of mutation, replication, and selection is repeated for as many rounds as desired (a variable set by the user). The calculation is continued for as many times as needed to produce the target string of one of the ten selected population members. When the target string is obtained, the routine reports the number of repetitions (cycles) used. The routine was executed in Chipmunk Basic [
