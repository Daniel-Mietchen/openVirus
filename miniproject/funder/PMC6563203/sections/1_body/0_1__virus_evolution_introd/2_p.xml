<p>Dating the emergence of viral lineages is important for understanding the epidemiology of viral outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dating has been complicated by the observation that the rates of substitution of nucleotide and/or amino acid residues in viral genes or gene products, respectively, are dependent on the time scales of the events being dated [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A variety of approaches to dating phylogenetic trees, covering different time periods, have been taken. In one approach, the rates of nucleotide substitution in viral genomes have been determined in prospective experiments. In these, hosts are inoculated with a genetically homogeneous viral genome, and hosts are then sampled at various times to determine how many nucleotides have changed [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]—a process whose usefulness is debated [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The typical substitution frequencies observed by such techniques are 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per residue per year.
