<p>Phylogenetic inference methods are based on comparisons of sequence differences among contemporaneous viral isolates. In heterochronous sampling, the sequences obtained from viruses isolated at different times [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] provide calibration points for phylogenetic comparisons. Specimens from more distant times [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] occasionally yield additional sequences that can be used to calibrate phylogenies [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similarly, paleo-sequences, or endogenous viral elements (EVEs) [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], can also be used in the calibration of trees. The fact that phylogenetic trees, for numerous viral taxa, resemble, in topology and branch lengths, the trees constructed for their predominant hosts, argues for the co-divergence of nucleotide sequences of the host and virus during the evolution of host lineages [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and provides a further calibration approach.
