<p>Viruses are often thought of as agents that have evolved to threaten humans and other manifestations of life. This view is strengthened by the impression that many disease epidemics (of humans, other animals, and plants) are of viral instigation. Nevertheless, the relationships between viruses and their hosts cover the full range, from mutualists or symbionts to commensals to pathogens [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As life forms have evolved, so too have the viruses associated with them. These observations generate the hypothesis that many viruses have co-diverged with their hosts during evolution. Here, we discuss ways to reconcile conflicting claims of high mutation rates in short-term evolution studies with low nucleotide substitution rates at longer time scales.
