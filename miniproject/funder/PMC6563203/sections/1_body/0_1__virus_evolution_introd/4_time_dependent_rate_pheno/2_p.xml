<p>A variety of factors that may produce TDRP have been suggested. These include, hypermutation, recombination, and variations in selective forces [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although each of these factors may contribute to the TDRP, a more fundamental cause should be considered. We sought to test computationally whether the basic phenomena of virus evolution (mutation, replication, and selection) can explain the relationships between the evolutionary and phylogenetic distances. Specifically, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the phylogenetic distances between the pairs of sequences are functions of the evolutionary path lengths between them.
