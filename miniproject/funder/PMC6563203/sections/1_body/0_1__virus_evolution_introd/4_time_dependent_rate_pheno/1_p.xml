<p>The integration of results from these diverse studies led to the recognition that the rates observed are dependent on the time scale being investigatedâ€”with short-term studies giving fast substitution rates, with orders of magnitude having lower rates for deep calibrations [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The current issue is how the number of evolutionary steps needed to evolve from an ancestor is related to the phylogenetic distance between the tip and ancestor. Power law and exponential relationships have been proposed and tested for the relationship of rates to time spans [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Artefacts and biases have been proposed as explanations for the discrepancies [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Various ways of correcting for time-dependent rate phenomena (TDRP) [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have been proposed, including different scales for different biological epochs [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], avoiding sequencing errors, correcting for tree imbalances [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and a better treatment of the influence of rate heterogeneity among sites. Accurate correction requires an understanding of the root causes of TDRP.
