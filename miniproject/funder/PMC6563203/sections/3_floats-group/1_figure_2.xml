 <caption>
  <p>Diagram of the network concept of the viral evolution, where solid nodes represent viable viral genome sequences, and edges represent single nucleotide changes that connect the nodes. Open nodes represent sequences that are conditionally viable, namely: (
   <bold>a</bold>) basic single module, perhaps a viral isolate; (
   <bold>b</bold>) three such modules near one another; and (
   <bold>c</bold>) modules of (
   <bold>b</bold>) now connected through the formation of a supermodule by joining at conditional nodes. The supermodule may be equivalent to a viral species; (
   <bold>d</bold>) a potentially higher-level module composed of supermodules, potentially forming a viral genus. The network should form a module with a high connectivity. A plot of the frequencies of the node connectivity values (measured as k, degree, which are determined by the number of edges attached to a node) should follow a Poisson-like distribution [
   <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00418" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There will be multiple paths connecting many pairs of nodes to each other, yet all of the nodes must be connected to the network by at least one edge.
