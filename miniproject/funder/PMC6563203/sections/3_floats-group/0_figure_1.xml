 <caption>
  <p>For hypothetical genomes containing 12 differentiating loci, the relation between the genetic distance (number of loci at which the members of a pair being analyzed differ) and mutational distance (number of mutational events needed to convert one member of the pair into the other) in a simulation of cycles of repeated random mutation, replication, and competition for 12 loci, allowing for only two alternative states, modeled as ”0” and “1”. Lines extending from the markers represent the standard error of five repetitions of each possible seed string in conversion to “111111111111”.</p>
