While most viruses appear to activate central energy metabolism, different viruses have been shown to rely on alternative mechanisms of metabolic activation. Whether related viruses exploit conserved mechanisms and induce similar metabolic changes is currently unclear. In this work we investigate how two alphaviruses, Semliki Forest virus and Ross River virus, reprogram host metabolism and define the molecular mechanisms responsible. We demonstrate that in both cases the presence of a YXXM motif in the viral protein nsP3 is necessary for binding to the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 and for activating AKT. This leads to an increase in glucose metabolism towards the synthesis of fatty acids, although additional mechanisms of metabolic activation appear to be involved in Ross River virus infection. Importantly, a Ross River virus mutant that fails to activate AKT has an attenuated phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting that viral activation of PI3K/AKT contributes to virulence and disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>In order to replicate to high titres, viruses need a sufficient supply of building blocks from the cell in the form of amino acids, nucleotides and lipids. To this end, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to reprogram and exploit host metabolism towards the synthesis of new biomass. Pharmacological inhibition of pathways involved in metabolic activation can represent an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we explore how members of the alphavirus group, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Ross River virus (RRV), modify host metabolism. We discover that both viruses activate cellular glycolysis by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. This activation is mediated by a YXXM motif in the viral protein nsP3, which binds to PI3K and initiates AKT signalling. In SFV, mutations in this motif prevent AKT activation, reduce virus-induced metabolic activity, and lower viral replication. In the human pathogen RRV the same mutation causes less severe disease <italic>in vivo</italic>. We therefore conclude that AKT activation during infection with these viruses is an important determinant of pathogenicity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0213-3259</contrib-id><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_A090_1006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1336-7744</contrib-id><name><surname>Griffin</surname><given-names>Julian L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>TH1896/1 and TH1896/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-9584</contrib-id><name><surname>Thaa</surname><given-names>Bastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>621-2014-4718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2257-7241</contrib-id><name><surname>McInerney</surname><given-names>Gerald M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>CAN2015-653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2257-7241</contrib-id><name><surname>McInerney</surname><given-names>Gerald M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1059167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3141-8410</contrib-id><name><surname>Mahalingham</surname><given-names>Suresh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1047252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3141-8410</contrib-id><name><surname>Mahalingham</surname><given-names>Suresh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>MMaz and MMar are supported by UK Medical Research Council programme funding to the MRC-UCL LMCB University Unit (MC_UU_12018/1).

The immune system itself, central for host defence from pathogens, is highly dependent on the metabolic activity of the organism for critical processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Importantly, many viral pathogens significantly alter host cell metabolism in order to fulfil their energy requirements, but their impact on metabolic balance has only recently begun to be investigated. The emerging picture suggests that viruses use a range of strategies to activate glycolysis [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and modulate glutamine metabolism [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However it is less clear how viral proteins drive metabolic changes and whether these mechanisms are conserved across related viruses. Understanding the effect of virus replication on cellular metabolism is therefore needed not only to define virus requirements, but also to understand the impact of viral replication on the energy status of an infected host, and its role in pathogenesis.</p><p>Alphaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single stranded RNA viruses, transmitted to humans and a variety of mammals by insects, often mosquitos. There is currently no available vaccine or treatment for most alphaviruses and this contributes to their rapid spread and to several recent epidemics [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Causing approximately 5000 cases each year, Ross River virus (RRV) is the most prominent human alphavirus in the South Pacific region, responsible for a debilitating musculoskeletal disease [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The link between infection and pathogenicity remains unclear. In contrast, Semliki Forest virus (SFV) generally does not cause disease in humans, but is neuropathogenic in mice and has often been used as a model system for the study of alphavirus biology [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this study, we apply nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyse the metabolic alterations that accompany cellular infection with SFV and RRV. In SFV infected cells we measured sustained activation of glycolysis and of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards higher synthesis of new metabolites, and demonstrated that this is dependent on virus-induced activation of PI3K/AKT via a YXXM motif in the viral non-structural protein (nsP) 3. To test whether the presence of this motif is sufficient to predict changes in host metabolism during alphavirus infection, we examined the metabolic profile of cells infected with RRV, an alphavirus carrying the same motif in nsP3, whose metabolic profile has never been characterised. Although infection with RRV also triggers additional mechanisms of metabolic activation, disruption of the YXXM motif causes lower viraemia and reduced pathogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus demonstrating the importance of AKT activation in viral pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>SFV infection of SH-SY5Y increases glucose metabolism</title><p>SFV has been used extensively as a model to study the cell biology of alphavirus infection.

Therefore we chose to study the metabolic alterations induced by SFV in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, a well-known model for neuronal function and differentiation [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], after 5 days differentiation with <italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>).

In SFV infected cells, Wortmannin induced a significant decrease in lactate levels in both media (by 40%, p = 0.027) and cells (by 73%, p = 0.003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002"><bold>Fig 2E</bold> and <bold>2F</bold></xref>, respectively), a decreased use of glucose (by 13%, p = 0.013) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>), and reduced fatty acids levels (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002">Fig 2G</xref></bold>). The dramatic decrease of glycolysis in infected cells treated with Wortmannin suggests that PI3K/AKT is indeed responsible for activating this pathway upon SFV infection, and for the increase in glycolytic products and fatty acid synthesis. Production of new infectious virions, inhibited by Wortmannin, could be rescued by 25% by providing ribose, a nucleotide precursor generated primarily through the PPP branch of glycolysis, and by 35% by palmitate, a precursor for the more complex lipids generated from glycolysis (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002">Fig 2D</xref></bold>).

However, the impact of a sustained metabolic activation on viral pathogenesis remains unclear. Primarily using SFV as a model alphavirus, we show changes in central metabolism that accompany viral infection, reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes, and, for the first time, explore their impact on viral pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> using the relevant human pathogen RRV.</p><p>Using a combination of <sup>1</sup>H- and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS, we show that SFV infection increases and redirects glucose metabolism into macromolecular synthesis, by activating both glycolysis and the PPP. This metabolic switch leads to higher synthesis of nucleotides and fatty acids, critical building blocks for the formation of new SFV virions. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of either of these pathways during virus replication results in reduced viral titres. As previously shown for cancer cells, and more recently for a number of viruses [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], increased glycolysis maximises the processing of glucose into macromolecules, and this provides a higher proliferative advantage than generation of ATP alone. Our work further emphasises the role of the PPP, which not only generates nucleotides for viral nucleic acid synthesis, but also contributes to lipid synthesis by providing NADPH. Interestingly, the kinetics of the metabolic shift observed in SFV infected cells mirrors the kinetics of viral replication, suggesting the importance of continued synthesis of metabolic intermediates during the production of new virions.</p><p>Mechanistically, we discovered that the metabolic changes induced by SFV infection are triggered through hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, we showed that a YXXM motif in SFV nsP3 is responsible for this activation through interaction with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Mutations in this motif in SFV nsP3 abolish hyperactivation of the pathway and lead to a metabolic profile consistent with increased consumption of metabolic intermediates, in the absence of a major increase in new metabolic synthesis. Moreover, fewer infectious particles are released upon infection with the SFV-YF mutant, suggesting that activation of glucose metabolism is important for maximal viral replication. In this study, AKT activation was seen in a variety of mammalian cells, including human SH-SY5Y, murine C2C12 and MEFs (upon transfection with Myr-Pal-nsP3), BHKs, and rat primary neurons, suggesting that this mechanism is not cell-specific and is conserved in different mammalian species. Whether the same is true in arthropod vectors and whether it represents an advantage for viral replication in the different species involved in virus transmission remains an interesting question. SINV, a related alphavirus that lacks the YXXM motif, has been shown to replicate largely independently of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in human cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], but to activate the pathway to some extent in arthropod cells [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We show that infection of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with SINV does not lead to detectable activation of AKT, increases cellular glycolysis to a much smaller extent than SFV and does not alter fatty acids levels. This suggests that these two viruses have evolved distinct mechanisms for regulating lipid synthesis in mammalian cells, but are both dependent on glycolysis and the PPP.</p><p>Sequence analysis of nsP3 of all alphaviruses shows that YXXM motifs are present in nsP3 of SFV, RRV and also Getah virus and Sagiyama virus, which are equine pathogens in Asia [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well as Middelburg virus, which mainly infects sheep, goats and horses in Africa [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found the YXXM motif to be highly conserved in nearly all the sequenced clinical isolates of the human pathogen RRV, despite its localisation within the hypervariable region of nsP3, in which sequence features are poorly conserved. Consistent with a critical role for AKT activation, mice infected with RRV-YF showed lower viraemia at the infection peak (2 days pi) and milder disease outcome compared with RRV-wt. Interestingly, failure to activate AKT <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuates viral replication even in the presence of an additional regulatory mechanism that appears to activate both glucose and glutamine metabolism. It is likely that while a compensatory mechanism is sufficient to maintain equal levels of viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, AKT activation is required for maximal production of new viral progeny <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely through increased fatty acids synthesis. It is possible that the trend of lower levels of viral replication is also responsible for a less sustained and aggressive immune activation, as indicated by lower levels of IFN-&#x003b2; in the lymph nodes and spleen (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>) and, as a consequence, milder disease progression after viral clearance (day 6 pi).</p><p>Intriguingly, while not conserved in all alphaviruses, activation of AKT via a YXXM motif has been reported for viruses in different families, including influenza virus [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and herpes simplex virus [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting that different viral pathogens have evolved to use the same cellular mechanism of PI3K activation. While a number of viruses have been shown to activate PI3K, this is the first study that demonstrates a link between virus-induced activation of PI3K, cellular energy metabolism, viral replication, and <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenesis, and explores the conservation of this mechanism of metabolic activation across different members of the alphavirus family.</p><p>As an association between high blood virus titres and the severity of arboviral infections has been demonstrated [<xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], inhibition of virus-induced pathways of metabolic regulation may be a viable antiviral strategy. If rapidly replicating viruses are hyper-dependent on generating new biomass, inhibition of the pathways responsible for metabolic activity might suffice to reduce viral titres to non-pathogenic levels without compromising the basal metabolic activity of the host. This scenario is particularly attractive because, by targeting common pathways of metabolic activation, a single drug or cocktail of drugs might be used to target a wide range of viral pathogens. Additionally, this study also reveals that even closely related viruses may develop different or redundant mechanisms of metabolic activation. Whether these differences arise from or are responsible for differences in virus replication or tropism, or what their impact is on the development of broad-spectrum antivirals remain compelling questions calling for a systematic study of the metabolic changes induced by different viruses and of the signalling pathways involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Griffith University (Gly/01/14/AEC).
