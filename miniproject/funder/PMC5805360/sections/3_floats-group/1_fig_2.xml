   <bold>A.</bold> Kinetics of activation of AKT and downstream targets in SH-SY5Y cells infected with SFV at MOI 5, in the presence or absence of 10 μM Wortmannin, administered at the same time as SFV infection. Synthesis of new virions from SFV-infected SH-SY5Y

   <bold>(C)</bold> after treatment with 10 μM Wortmannin, administered at the same time as SFV infection (MOI 3). After 16h, virions in the supernatant were quantified by plaque assay. 
   <bold>D.</bold> Synthesis of new virions from SFV-infected SH-SY5Y after treatment with Wortmannin alone, or together with 40 mM ribose or 400 μM BSA-conjugated palmitate, administered at the same time as SFV infection (MOI 3). After 16h, virions in the supernatant were quantified by plaque assay. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Concentrations (in mM) of

   <bold>F.</bold> lactate, glucose, glycerophosphocholine and AMP in the cells, in mock- or SFV-infected samples treated with Wortmannin or DMSO control (8 hpi). 
   <bold>G.</bold> Levels of selected cellular fatty acids in mock- or SFV-infected cells treated with Wortmannin or DMSO. Six samples per group were analysed. Data are presented as means ± SD. Statistics as in
