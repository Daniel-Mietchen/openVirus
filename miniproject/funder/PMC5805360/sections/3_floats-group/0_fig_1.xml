  <title>SFV infection activates glucose metabolism and increases fatty acid levels.</title>
  <p>Concentrations (mM) of 
   <bold>A.</bold> lactate and glucose in the media and 
   <bold>B.</bold> selected metabolites in the cells following infection with SFV. 
   <bold>C.</bold> Levels of selected cellular fatty acids measured by GC-MS. 
   <bold>D.</bold> Concentrations (mM) of lactate and glucose in the media of primary rat cortical neurons (MOI 5, 8 hpi). 
   <bold>E.</bold> Schematic showing the metabolic products of increased glucose consumption. Metabolites directly measured by NMR spectroscopy or GC-MS are in red. For the aqueous metabolites, each plot represents the concentration (mM) of the indicated resonance, as calculated from the volumes of HSQC spectra normalised to formate, added as an internal standard to samples. The concentration of palmitate was calculated from the intensity of the single isotopic mass normalised to the internal standard. Six samples per group were analysed. Data are presented as means ± SD. 
   <bold>F.</bold> Virion release at 16 hpi after treatment with inhibitors of glycolysis (2DG) or PPP (DHEA) or mock treated. Drugs were administered at 25 mM and 100 μM, respectively, at the same time as SFV infection. Data are presented as means ± SEM. T-tests (with Bonferroni corrections when the comparison involved more than two groups) were performed. * 0.05&gt; p &lt; 0.01; ** 0.01&gt; p &lt; 0.001; *** p &lt; 0.001.
