   <bold>A.</bold> Kinetics of AKT activation in SH-SY5Y cells infected with WT SFV and SFV-YF at MOI 5. Mock-infected sample was harvested at 8 h. Positive control as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g005">Fig 5</xref>. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Growth curves of WT SFV and SFV-YF in SH-SY5Y cells infected at MOI 0.1. At the indicated time-points, media was harvested and titrated by plaque assay. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Concentration (mM) of 
   <bold>C.</bold> glutamate and glutamine (MOI 5), 
   <bold>D.</bold> succinate (MOI 5), and 
   <bold>E.</bold> glutamine and glutamate (MOI 1) in SFV- (black bars) or SFV-YF- (gray bars) infected cells, and in control cells (white bars). Six samples per group were analysed. Data are presented as means ± SD. 
   <bold>F.</bold> HOS cells were infected with WT SFV or SFV-YF (MOI of 10 for 1 h) or mock infected and then supplemented with complete medium (no starvation) or EBSS (starvation) prior to lysis and western blot analysis for the indicated proteins. 
   <bold>G.</bold> HOS cells were infected with WT SFV at MOI 10 in the presence or absence of rapamycin, and virus titres at each time point were determined by plaque assay. 
   <bold>H.</bold> Cell viability upon treatment with 7 μM MK-2206. MTT assay was performed after 16 h treatment. Viability is relative to untreated cells. Statistics as in
