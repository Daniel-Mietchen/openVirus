  <title>The YXXM motif in SFV nsP3 mediates PI3K/AKT hyperactivation.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> AKT activation in BHK cells infected at MOI 10 as indicated and lysed at 8 hpi, together with densitometry of phosphorylated AKT (S473), normalised to total AKT signals and relative to mock-infected cells (mean of three independent experiments ± SEM). 
   <bold>B.</bold> Immunofluorescence showing activation of AKT (S473, green) in MEFs transfected for 24 h with the indicated DNA plasmids (red: FLAG-nsP3, blue: nuclei). Representative epifluorescence images are shown. Scale bar: 20 μm. Co-immunoprecipitations showing the interaction between EYFP-p85−α (
   <bold>C</bold> and 
   <bold>E</bold>) or EYFP-p85−β (
   <bold>D</bold>) in HEK293T cells transfected with the indicated constructs for 24 h. EYFP-tagged p85 constructs were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody. BAP: biotin acceptor peptide, Myr-Pal: myristoylation and palmitoylation. 
   <bold>F.</bold> Interaction of endogenous p85 and viral nsP3 in lysates of BHK cells infected at MOI 10 for 8 h, after immunoprecipitation with an anti-p85 antibody. Growth curves of SFV-wt and SFV-YF in BHK cells infected at MOI 0.1 (
   <bold>G</bold>) or 10 (
   <bold>H</bold>) for the indicated times. Virus titres at each time point were determined by plaque assay. Data show the mean ± SEM of three experiments.
