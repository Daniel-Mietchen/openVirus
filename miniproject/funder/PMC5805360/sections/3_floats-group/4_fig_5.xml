  <title>SINV does not activate AKT and displays a metabolic profile different from SFV.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Kinetics of AKT activation upon infection of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with SINV. The positive control (+ve) was obtained by 20 mins treatment with 200 μM hydrogen peroxide and 100 μM sodium orthovanadate. Intracellular levels of lactate (
   <bold>B</bold>), nucleotides (
   <bold>C</bold>), cholines (
   <bold>D</bold>), and fatty acids (
   <bold>E</bold>) in cells infected with SINV for 8h. Data are presented as means ± SD. Six samples per group were analysed. 
   <bold>F.</bold> Virion release at 16 hpi after treatment with inhibitors of glycolysis (2DG) or PPP (DHEA) or mock treated. Drugs were administered at 25 mM and 100 μM, respectively, at the same time as SINV infection. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Statistics as in
