  <p>In the first column the assigned metabolite for each signal is indicated, in the second the chemical shift, in the third the multiplicity. s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quadruplet, dd = doublet of doublets, m = multiplet, c = complex. In the last two column, the concentrations of each metabolites (mM) in Mock and SFV samples are shown. Metabolites listed in this table refer to the experiments illustrated in
