   <bold>A.</bold> Brightfield images showing the morphological difference between non-differentiated (left) vs differentiated SH-SY5Y, after 5 days treatment with 10 μM retinoic acid (right). Scale bar = 55 μm. 
   <bold>B</bold>. Immunofluorescence staining showing accumulation of the SFV envelope proteins E1-E2 (in red) at the indicated time-points, as a marker of virus infection and replication in differentiated SH-SY5Y. Infection of all cells becomes clear at 8h (MOI 5). Blue: nuclei. Scale bar = 10 μm. Concentrations (mM) at the indicated time points of lactate and glucose in the media (
   <bold>C</bold>), and lactate, glucose and glycerophosphocholine in cells (
   <bold>D</bold>) following infection with SFV at MOI 10 or mock infection. 
   <bold>E.</bold> Concentration (mM) of glycerophosphocholine in SFV-infected and control cells, after 8 hours in the presence of [U-
   <sup>13</sup>C]glucose, and concentrations (mM) of succinate and AMP in SFV-infected and control cells in parallel control experiments performed with unlabelled glucose. Six samples per group were analysed. Data are presented as means ± SD. 
   <bold>F.</bold> Cell viability upon treatment with 25 mM 2DG or 100 μM DHEA. MTT assay was performed after 16 h treatment. Viability is relative to untreated cells. Data are presented as means ± SEM. 
   <bold>G.</bold> Concentrations (mM) of lactate and glucose in the media (left hand panel) or lactate, glucose and AMP in the cells (middle and right hand panels) in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated for 16h with 25 mM 2DG or 100 μM DHEA. Data are presented as mean ± SD. 
   <bold>H.</bold> SH-SY5Y were infected with SFV-GFP at MOI 3 and at the same time treated with the indicated concentrations of 2DG (top) or DHEA (bottom). Cells were fixed 8h later and infected cells counted by microscopy. Data are expressed as percentages of inhibition relative to untreated controls. The red square highlights the concentration used in all other experiments.* 0.05&gt; p &lt; 0.01; ** 0.01&gt; p &lt; 0.001; *** p &lt; 0.001. Statistics as in
