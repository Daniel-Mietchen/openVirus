   <bold>A.</bold> Alignment of the C-terminal regions of SFV-nsP3 (GenBank accession number AKC01667) and RRV-nsP3 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13888.1). The YXXM motif is shown in green. 
   <bold>B.</bold> AKT activation in BHK cells infected with RRV-wt or RRV-YF at MOI 5 and lysed at 8 hpi. 
   <bold>C.</bold> Replication complexes localization in BHK cells infected with RRV-WT or RRV-YF T MOI 5 and fixed at 8 hpi. Red: dsRNA, blue, nuclei stained with DRAQ5. Representative micrographs, scale bar: 10 μm. 
   <bold>D.</bold> Growth curves of RRV-wt and RRV-YF in BHK cells infected at MOI 0.1 (left panel) or 5 (middle panel) and in differentiated C2C12 cells infected at MOI 5 (right panel) for the indicated times. Virus titres at each time point were determined by plaque assay. Data show the mean ± SEM of three replicates.
