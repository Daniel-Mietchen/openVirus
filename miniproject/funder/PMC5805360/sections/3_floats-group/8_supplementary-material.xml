   <bold>A. Left side panels:</bold> Kinetics of phospho-AKT (S473) activation (in red, left), or of neuronal beta III tubulin (in green) and nuclei (in blue) (right) in primary rat cortical neurons infected with SFV (MOI 5). Mock-infected samples were harvested at 8 hpi and the positive control (+ve) was obtained by 20 mins treatment with 200 μM hydrogen peroxide and 100 μM sodium orthovanadate. Scale bar = 15 μm. 
   <bold>Right side panels:</bold> Immunofluorescence staining showing accumulation of the SFV envelope proteins E1-E2 (in red) at different time-points, as a marker of virus infection and replication in rat primary cortical neurons. Infection of all cells becomes clear at 8h (MOI 5). Green: anti beta-III tubulin; Blue: nuclei. Representative pictures are shown. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Quantitative analysis of the experiment illustrated in A. The graph displays the area positive for P-AKT (S473) staining for each condition, normalised by the number of cells in the field. 
   <bold>C.</bold> Real time quantitative PCR analysis showing transcription of the indicated glycolytic genes at different times after SFV infection of differentiated SH-SY5Y. Data are shown as fold induction over mock-infected cells and represent mean values ± SEM of three replicates. 
   <bold>D.</bold> Cell viability upon treatment with indicated concentrations of Wortmannin or 50 μM LY294002. MTT assay was performed after 16 h treatment. Viability is relative to untreated cells. Data are presented as means ± SEM. 
   <bold>E.</bold> SH-SY5Y were infected with SFV-GFP at MOI 3 and at the same time treated with the indicated concentrations of Wortmannin. Cells were fixed 8h later and infected cells were counted by microscopy. Data are expressed as percentages of inhibition relative to untreated controls. The red square highlights the highest concentration used in other experiments. 
   <bold>F.</bold> Synthesis of new virions from SH-SY5Y infected with SFV at the same time or 2 h before treatment with 2 μM Wortmannin. 
   <bold>G</bold>. Synthesis of new virions from SFV-infected SH-SY5Y 
   <bold>(top)</bold> or rat primary cortical neurons 
   <bold>(bottom)</bold> after treatment with 50 μM of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, administered at the same time as SFV infection (MOI 3). After 16h, virions in the supernatant were quantified by plaque assay. Data are presented as means ± SEM. Statistics as in
