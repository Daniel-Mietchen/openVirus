 <p>In order to replicate to high titres, viruses need a sufficient supply of building blocks from the cell in the form of amino acids, nucleotides and lipids. To this end, viruses have evolved different mechanisms to reprogram and exploit host metabolism towards the synthesis of new biomass. Pharmacological inhibition of pathways involved in metabolic activation can represent an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we explore how members of the alphavirus group, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Ross River virus (RRV), modify host metabolism. We discover that both viruses activate cellular glycolysis by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway. This activation is mediated by a YXXM motif in the viral protein nsP3, which binds to PI3K and initiates AKT signalling. In SFV, mutations in this motif prevent AKT activation, reduce virus-induced metabolic activity, and lower viral replication. In the human pathogen RRV the same mutation causes less severe disease
