<p>SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC CRL-2266) were grown in 45% F-12 media and 45% DMEM with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS, PAA), 1X non-essential amino acids, 1X sodium pyruvate, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine, and 1X penicillin/streptomycin (p/s) (all from Gibco). For differentiation, 10 μM retinoic acid (Calbiochem) was added to the culture medium every 2–3 days for 6 days. C2C12 cells (ATCC CRL-1772) were grown in 10% DMEM GlutaMAX with 10% (v/v) FCS. For differentiation cells were plated on collagen coated dishes and cultured with DMEM GlutaMAX supplemented with 10% Horse Serum (Sigma) for 5 days. Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF, kind gift from Nancy Kedersha, Harvard Medical School) and HEK293 cells (ATCC) were grown in DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1X p/s. BHK-21 [C-13] (ATCC CCL-10) were grown in GMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 10% (v/v) tryptose phosphate broth (TPB, Gibco), and 1X p/s. Rat cortical neurons were isolated from P0 pups. Cortices were dissected in HBSS (Gibco) and trypsinized for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Neurobasal media (ThermoFisher Scientific) supplemented with B27 (Gibco), triturated, and plated on glass coverslips coated with 1mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma Aldrich). Neurons were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 3 days. For nutrient and growth factor depletion (starvation), cells were treated with Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS; Sigma). as previously described [
