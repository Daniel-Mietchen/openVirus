<p>Cells were washed with PBS prior to lysis in lysis buffer (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], pH 7.4, 110 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1% [vol/vol] Tween 20, 1% [vol/vol] Triton X-100, 0.5% [wt/vol] sodium deoxycholate, and 500 mM sodium chloride), supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche) on ice. After centrifugation (20,000×g for 10 min, 4°C), cell lysates were incubated with mouse-anti-GFP (Abcam, ab1218) or rabbit-anti-p85 (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog numbers 4257 and 4292, used at 1:1 ratio) antibodies for 20 min at room temperature by using a rotator, followed by incubation with protein G magnetic beads (GE Healthcare) at 4°C overnight. Immunoprecipitation samples were washed with lysis buffer, eluted with 4× reducing NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies), heated at 95°C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.</p>
