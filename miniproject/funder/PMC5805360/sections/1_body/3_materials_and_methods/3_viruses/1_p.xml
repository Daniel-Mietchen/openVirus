<p>SFV and SFV-GFP (gift of Dr Giuseppe Balistreri, University of Helsinki) were expanded and titrated on BHK-21 cells. The stock used for the metabolomic experiments was concentrated and purified by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. The SFV-Δ50 mutant was described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. SFV-wt, SFV-YA, and SFV-YF were rescued by transfection of BHK-21 cells with the infectious plasmid pCMV-SFV4 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and harvesting the cell culture supernatant upon appearance of cytopathic effect as described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The mutations described in the text were introduced using Gibson assembly technology (NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix, New England BioLabs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions) and verified by sequencing. SINV (kind gift of Penny Powell, University of East Anglia) was expanded and titrated in BHK-21 cells. Wild type virulent RRV (strain T48, here referred to as RRV-wt) was rescued from pRR64 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To generate RRV-YF, the codon for tyrosine 356 of RRV nsP3 was mutated to phenylalanine in pRR64 as above.
