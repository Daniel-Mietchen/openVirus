<p>C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Animal Resources Centre (Perth, Australia). Twenty-day old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the thorax below the right fore limb with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of RRV-wt or RRV-YF diluted in PBS to a volume of 50 μL. Mock-infected mice were inoculated with PBS only. Mice were weighed and scored for disease daily. RRV disease scores were assessed based on strength and hind-leg dysfunction using the scale described in the supplementary file. Mouse quadriceps were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by paraffin embedding. Samples were cut into 5 μm-thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were taken using a Nikon microscope.
