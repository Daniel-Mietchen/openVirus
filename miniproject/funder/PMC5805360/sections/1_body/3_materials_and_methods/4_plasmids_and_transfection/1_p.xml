<p>Construction of Myr-Pal-nsP3-wt-FLAG was described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To generate the Myr-Pal-nsP3-YF-FLAG, the nsP3-wt sequence was replaced with that of nsP3-YF, amplified from pCMV-SFV4-YF by PCR. Plasmid pEBB/PP-nsP3-wt, encoding SFV nsP3 with a biotin acceptor peptide [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was used as a control without Myr-Pal signal. For p85, the following expression plasmids were employed: pEYFP-p85-α and the mutant pEYFP-p85-α-RARA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (kind gift of Ji Luo [National Cancer Institute, USA]); EYFP indicates the enhanced yellow-fluorescent protein); pEYFP-C1-p85-β (Addgene plasmid # 1408) and empty vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, EGFP indicating the enhanced green-fluorescent protein). All plasmids were verified by sequencing (Eurofins). Cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
