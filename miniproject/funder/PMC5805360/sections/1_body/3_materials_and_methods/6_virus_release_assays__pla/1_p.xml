<p>Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were infected with SFV at MOI 3 in complete media with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors. Sixteen hours later, media was harvested and 500 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of media were used to infect monolayers of BHK-21 cells for 2 h at 37°C. Infectious media were then replaced by a semisolid carboxymethylcellulose overlay (Rectapur, low viscosity, VWR; 1.5% in MEM). 48 h later the overlay was removed, cells washed in PBS, and plaques revealed by crystal violet staining. 2DG, DHEA, and Wortmannin were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, LY294002 from Cell Signaling Technology, and MK-2206 from Selleckchem.</p>
