<p>Many cellular functions have evolved in close interdependence with cell metabolism and nutrient availability. The immune system itself, central for host defence from pathogens, is highly dependent on the metabolic activity of the organism for critical processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation [

Importantly, many viral pathogens significantly alter host cell metabolism in order to fulfil their energy requirements, but their impact on metabolic balance has only recently begun to be investigated. The emerging picture suggests that viruses use a range of strategies to activate glycolysis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However it is less clear how viral proteins drive metabolic changes and whether these mechanisms are conserved across related viruses. Understanding the effect of virus replication on cellular metabolism is therefore needed not only to define virus requirements, but also to understand the impact of viral replication on the energy status of an infected host, and its role in pathogenesis.
