<p>As an association between high blood virus titres and the severity of arboviral infections has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], inhibition of virus-induced pathways of metabolic regulation may be a viable antiviral strategy. If rapidly replicating viruses are hyper-dependent on generating new biomass, inhibition of the pathways responsible for metabolic activity might suffice to reduce viral titres to non-pathogenic levels without compromising the basal metabolic activity of the host. This scenario is particularly attractive because, by targeting common pathways of metabolic activation, a single drug or cocktail of drugs might be used to target a wide range of viral pathogens. Additionally, this study also reveals that even closely related viruses may develop different or redundant mechanisms of metabolic activation. Whether these differences arise from or are responsible for differences in virus replication or tropism, or what their impact is on the development of broad-spectrum antivirals remain compelling questions calling for a systematic study of the metabolic changes induced by different viruses and of the signalling pathways involved.
