<p>Intriguingly, while not conserved in all alphaviruses, activation of AKT via a YXXM motif has been reported for viruses in different families, including influenza virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and herpes simplex virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting that different viral pathogens have evolved to use the same cellular mechanism of PI3K activation. While a number of viruses have been shown to activate PI3K, this is the first study that demonstrates a link between virus-induced activation of PI3K, cellular energy metabolism, viral replication, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pathogenesis, and explores the conservation of this mechanism of metabolic activation across different members of the alphavirus family.
