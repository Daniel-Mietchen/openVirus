<p>The importance of cellular energy metabolism in determining the outcome of a viral infection is increasingly recognised. However, the impact of a sustained metabolic activation on viral pathogenesis remains unclear. Primarily using SFV as a model alphavirus, we show changes in central metabolism that accompany viral infection, reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for these changes, and, for the first time, explore their impact on viral pathogenesis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> using the relevant human pathogen RRV.
