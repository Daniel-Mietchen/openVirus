<p>Using a combination of 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy and GC-MS, we show that SFV infection increases and redirects glucose metabolism into macromolecular synthesis, by activating both glycolysis and the PPP. This metabolic switch leads to higher synthesis of nucleotides and fatty acids, critical building blocks for the formation of new SFV virions. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of either of these pathways during virus replication results in reduced viral titres. As previously shown for cancer cells, and more recently for a number of viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], increased glycolysis maximises the processing of glucose into macromolecules, and this provides a higher proliferative advantage than generation of ATP alone. Our work further emphasises the role of the PPP, which not only generates nucleotides for viral nucleic acid synthesis, but also contributes to lipid synthesis by providing NADPH. Interestingly, the kinetics of the metabolic shift observed in SFV infected cells mirrors the kinetics of viral replication, suggesting the importance of continued synthesis of metabolic intermediates during the production of new virions.
