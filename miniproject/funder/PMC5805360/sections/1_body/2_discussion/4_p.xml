<p>Sequence analysis of nsP3 of all alphaviruses shows that YXXM motifs are present in nsP3 of SFV, RRV and also Getah virus and Sagiyama virus, which are equine pathogens in Asia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as well as Middelburg virus, which mainly infects sheep, goats and horses in Africa [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found the YXXM motif to be highly conserved in nearly all the sequenced clinical isolates of the human pathogen RRV, despite its localisation within the hypervariable region of nsP3, in which sequence features are poorly conserved. Consistent with a critical role for AKT activation, mice infected with RRV-YF showed lower viraemia at the infection peak (2 days pi) and milder disease outcome compared with RRV-wt. Interestingly, failure to activate AKT 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuates viral replication even in the presence of an additional regulatory mechanism that appears to activate both glucose and glutamine metabolism. It is likely that while a compensatory mechanism is sufficient to maintain equal levels of viral replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, AKT activation is required for maximal production of new viral progeny 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely through increased fatty acids synthesis. It is possible that the trend of lower levels of viral replication is also responsible for a less sustained and aggressive immune activation, as indicated by lower levels of IFN-Î² in the lymph nodes and spleen (
