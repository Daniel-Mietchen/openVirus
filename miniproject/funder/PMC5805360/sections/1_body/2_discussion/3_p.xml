<p>Mechanistically, we discovered that the metabolic changes induced by SFV infection are triggered through hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, we showed that a YXXM motif in SFV nsP3 is responsible for this activation through interaction with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Mutations in this motif in SFV nsP3 abolish hyperactivation of the pathway and lead to a metabolic profile consistent with increased consumption of metabolic intermediates, in the absence of a major increase in new metabolic synthesis. Moreover, fewer infectious particles are released upon infection with the SFV-YF mutant, suggesting that activation of glucose metabolism is important for maximal viral replication. In this study, AKT activation was seen in a variety of mammalian cells, including human SH-SY5Y, murine C2C12 and MEFs (upon transfection with Myr-Pal-nsP3), BHKs, and rat primary neurons, suggesting that this mechanism is not cell-specific and is conserved in different mammalian species. Whether the same is true in arthropod vectors and whether it represents an advantage for viral replication in the different species involved in virus transmission remains an interesting question. SINV, a related alphavirus that lacks the YXXM motif, has been shown to replicate largely independently of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in human cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We show that infection of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with SINV does not lead to detectable activation of AKT, increases cellular glycolysis to a much smaller extent than SFV and does not alter fatty acids levels. This suggests that these two viruses have evolved distinct mechanisms for regulating lipid synthesis in mammalian cells, but are both dependent on glycolysis and the PPP.
