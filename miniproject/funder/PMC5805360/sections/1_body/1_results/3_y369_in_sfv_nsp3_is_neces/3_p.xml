<p>The effect of the Y369F mutation in nsP3 on viral replication was tested by measuring viral release over time after infection of BHK cells at low (0.1) and high (10) MOI, compared to wt SFV and SFV-Î”50 carrying a larger deletion in nsP3, also affecting PI3K activation (

 </bold>). Consistent with a role for PI3K/AKT activation on late stages of the virus life cycle, viral titres were similar at early times post-infection but differed at later time points, with wt SFV titres exceeding SFV-YF by approximately one (MOI 0.1;
