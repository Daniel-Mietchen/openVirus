<p>Activation of class IA PI3Ks is typically mediated through the interaction between the phosphorylated tyrosine in a YXXM motif and the arginines in the FLVRD/E motifs of the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that the SFV-nsP3 YXXM motif binds the SH2 domain of p85, and that either mutation at Y369 in nsP3 or mutations in the SH2 domains of p85 would abolish the interaction. Consistent with this scenario, Myr-Pal-nsP3-wt, but not Myr-Pal-nsP3-YF or biotin acceptor peptide (BAP)-tagged nsP3-wt without a membrane anchor, was pulled-down by EYFP tagged p85α (EYFP-p85-α) (
