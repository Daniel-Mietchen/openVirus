<p>We next tried to understand how SFV nsP3 activates PI3K by searching for the presence of eukaryotic linear interaction motifs in this protein. Using the database ELM (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elm.eu.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://elm.eu.org/</ext-link>), we identified the well-characterised PI3K activation motif YXXM in the amino acid stretch Y369-E370-P371-M372, situated in the C-terminal hypervariable domain (

 </bold>). To test whether this motif is relevant for PI3K/AKT activation, we generated viral mutants where Y369 was replaced with an alanine (SFV-YA) or with a phenylalanine (SFV-YF). In BHK cells, both viruses, although replicating in a similar manner as indicated by nsP3 levels, failed to activate AKT to the same extent as the wild type virus, confirming the importance of this motif in PI3K/AKT activation (

 </bold>). Consistent with low PI3K/AKT activation, the viral replication complexes (RC) of both mutant viruses were mainly localised at the cell periphery, while wt SFV showed efficient RC internalisation (

 </bold>), as previously reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Disruption of the YEPM sequence by leaving the tyrosine unchanged and mutating the three downstream residues to alanines (SFV-YAAA) also reduced AKT phosphorylation (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s003">S3C Fig</xref>
 </bold>), indicating that a complete YXXM motif is required for AKT activation. To minimise potential unrelated structural changes, SFV-YF was selected for further studies. Anchorage of nsP3 to the plasma membrane is required for PI3K/AKT activation, however membrane anchored Myr-Pal-tagged nsP3-YF failed to activate AKT, further confirming the relevance of the YXXM motif for activation of the pathway (
