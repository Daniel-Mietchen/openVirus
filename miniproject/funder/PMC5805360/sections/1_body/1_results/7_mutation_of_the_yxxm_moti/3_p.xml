<p>We next tested whether hyperactivation of the AKT pathway by RRV-wt but not RRV-YF resulted in differences in pathogenesis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a murine model of infection. C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu of RRV-wt or RRV-YF and monitored daily for disease signs. Limb weakness and loss of gripping ability, which in RRV-wt infected mice reached a disease score of 5.5 on day 10, were significantly milder in mice infected with RRV-YF, with disease scores not exceeding 4 (

 </bold>). Equally, although not significant, a trend suggesting lower viral titres at day 1 pi in the spleen, quadriceps and ankle, and at 6 and 10 days pi in quadriceps and ankle was observed (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g007">Fig 7E</xref>
 </bold>). Taken together, these results indicate that a mutation in the YXXM motif that reduces AKT hyperactivation results in attenuated infection compared to RRV-wt, and that AKT activation contributes to pathogenesis.
