<p>As with SFV, wild type RRV (RRV-wt) induced hyperactivation of AKT both in BHK cells (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s005">S5C Fig</xref>

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s005">S5D Fig</xref>,
 </bold> left and middle panels), no significant differences were observed between the two viruses, neither in a multi-step (MOI 0.1) nor a single-step growth curve (MOI 5). Similar results were obtained in C2C12 cells (MOI 5,

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s005">S5D Fig</xref>,
 </bold> right panel). To understand whether this lack of difference could be explained by a metabolic phenotype somewhat different from the one observed for SFV, we examined the metabolic profile of differentiated C2C12 infected with RRV-wt or RRV-YF. Metabolic analysis of RRV-wt infected cells showed activation of glycolysis with an 18% increase in lactate in the media (p = 0.0008), and higher levels of alanine in media and cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g006">
  <bold>Fig 6B</bold> and 
  <bold>6C</bold>
 </xref>, respectively). Interestingly, no significant decrease in glycolysis was measured in RRV-YF infected cells compared to RRV-wt, as we also found a 20% increase in lactate levels in the media (p = 0.00001, compared to mock) and higher concentrations of alanine in cells infected with RRV-YF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g006">
  <bold>Fig 6B</bold> and 
  <bold>6C</bold>
 </xref>). However, significantly higher levels of fatty acids were measured upon infection with RRV-wt than with RRV-YF (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g006">Fig 6D</xref>
 </bold>). The concomitant differences in glutamine and glutamate levels in cells infected with either virus (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g006">Fig 6C</xref>
 </bold>), which were not observed upon infection with SFV (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s004">S4C Fig</xref>
 </bold> and 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s004">S4E Fig</xref>
 </bold>), suggest the possibility that RRV may rely on an additional, AKT-independent mechanism of metabolic activation that stimulates both glucose and glutamine metabolism. Despite the differences between SFV and RRV, activation of AKT by either virus was linked to increased fatty acid synthesis.
