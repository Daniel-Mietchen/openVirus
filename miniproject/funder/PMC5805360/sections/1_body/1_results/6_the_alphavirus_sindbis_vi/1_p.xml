<p>Interestingly, Sindbis virus (SINV), an alphavirus lacking the YXXM motif in nsP3, failed to induce sustained AKT activation (

 </bold>) and only caused a ~30% increase in glycolytic activity (measured as lactate over glucose ratio (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g005">Fig 5B</xref>
 </bold>)), compared to the ~100% increase observed for SFV. Importantly, while we measured a decrease in nucleotide concentrations (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g005">Fig 5C</xref>
 </bold>), no decrease in choline and phosphocholine levels was observed upon SINV infection (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g005">Fig 5D</xref>
 </bold>) and no changes were measured in the concentrations of myristic, palmitic or stearic acids in infected cells (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g005">Fig 5E</xref>
 </bold>). Thus SINV, which does not rely on AKT hyperactivation during replication, may have evolved different mechanisms of metabolic activation and lipid use/synthesis. Inhibition of glycolysis (with 2DG) or of the PPP (with DHEA) caused similar degrees of inhibition of almost 1 log, suggesting that SINV relies on these two metabolic pathways (
