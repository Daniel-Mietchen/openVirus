<p>To understand the consequences of this increased glycolytic activity, we followed the fate of uniformly labelled 
 <sup>13</sup>C glucose ([U-
 <sup>13</sup>C]glucose) 8 h after SFV infection. In infected cells we observed increased concentrations of [4-
 <sup>13</sup>C]glutamate (p = 0.02), [3-
 <sup>13</sup>C]aspartate (p = 0.03), and labelled palmitate (
