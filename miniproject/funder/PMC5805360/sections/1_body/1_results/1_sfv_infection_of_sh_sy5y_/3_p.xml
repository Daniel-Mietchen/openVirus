<p>The glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), an inhibitor of glycolysis, has been shown to decrease SFV replication when added 16 h before infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; however to confirm the importance of glycolysis and the PPP during the course of viral replication only, we treated cells with 2DG or the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA, an inhibitor of the PPP) at the same time of infection with SFV. At 16 hpi, 2DG reduced production of new infectious virions by almost 2 logs, and DHEA by almost 1 log (

 </bold>). In both cases, AMP concentrations were significantly reduced (p = 0.001 for 2DG and for DHEA). In cells treated with 2DG (which replaces glucose in the first step of glycolysis), glucose was present at higher concentration in both media and cells, while a significant reduction in lactate production was observed. In cells treated with DHEA (which inhibits glucose entrance into the PPP), we observed an increased consumption of glucose in both media and cells and a simultaneous increase in lactate production, likely a compensatory effect triggered by the PPP inhibition. During infection, inhibition of the first step of glycolysis with 2DG, which is detrimental for both glycolysis and PPP, had a more dramatic effect on virus production (
