<p>SFV has been used extensively as a model to study the cell biology of alphavirus infection. Although SFV infects a variety of cells in tissue culture, neurons are key targets 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore we chose to study the metabolic alterations induced by SFV in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, a well-known model for neuronal function and differentiation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], after 5 days differentiation with 
 <italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid (

 </bold>). In contrast to rapidly dividing cells, these post-mitotic neurons better reflect the less metabolically active environment that SFV would encounter 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and therefore represent a good model to study how SFV infection might alter cell metabolism. Metabolic changes were profiled by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and GC-MS at 8 hours post infection (hpi). The complete list of assigned metabolites is shown in

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s008">S2 Table</xref>
 </bold> (GC-MS). SFV infection doubled lactate concentration in the media (p = 1.1*10
 <sup>−6</sup>) and increased it by 43% in the cells (p = 3.97*10
 <sup>−4</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g001">
  <bold>Fig 1A</bold> and 
  <bold>1B</bold>
 </xref>), while it decreased glucose concentration in the media (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g001">Fig 1A</xref>
 </bold>) by 10% (p = 1.93*10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and reduced choline, phosphocholine (PS), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP, an intermediate of nucleotide metabolism) levels in the cells (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g001">Fig 1B</xref>
 </bold>). It also markedly increased palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g001">Fig 1C</xref>
 </bold>). These data suggest increased glycolytic activity and fatty acid synthesis upon SFV infection. An increase by 40% in lactate accumulation (p = 3.98*10
 <sup>−4</sup>) was also observed in the media of infected primary rat cortical neurons

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g001">Fig 1D</xref>)
 </bold>, validating the SH-SY5Y model. The kinetics of this metabolic reorganisation mirrored the kinetics of viral protein expression 
 <bold>(
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s001">S1B Fig</xref>)
 </bold>, with a progressive accumulation of lactate with time and a simultaneous decrease of glucose in the media and glycerophosphocholine in the cells (
