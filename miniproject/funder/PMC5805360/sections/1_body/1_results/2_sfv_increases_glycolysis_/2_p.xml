<p>The PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin almost entirely abrogated infection-mediated phosphorylation of AKT and of downstream targets without substantially changing the expression of SFV E1-E2 proteins (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002">Fig 2A</xref>
 </bold>), indicating that reduced AKT activation is not due to reduced infection. No inhibition was detected upon Wortmannin treatment at 8 hpi (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006835.s002">S2E Fig</xref>
 </bold>), suggesting that viral entry, early RNA replication and protein synthesis are not affected. Conversely, Wortmannin decreased the release of progeny virus by ~60% compared with the untreated control (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006835.g002">Fig 2B</xref>
 </bold>), implying that activation of AKT signalling is more important for late stages of viral replication. Indeed, adding Wortmannin either at the same time or two hours after virus infection resulted in similar levels of viral decrease (
