<p>We next tested whether Wortmannin affected SFV-induced glycolysis. In mock-infected samples, Wortmannin caused a marginal reduction of cellular glycolytic activity and did not affect myristic, palmitic or stearic acid content. In SFV infected cells, Wortmannin induced a significant decrease in lactate levels in both media (by 40%, p = 0.027) and cells (by 73%, p = 0.003) (

 </bold>). The dramatic decrease of glycolysis in infected cells treated with Wortmannin suggests that PI3K/AKT is indeed responsible for activating this pathway upon SFV infection, and for the increase in glycolytic products and fatty acid synthesis. Production of new infectious virions, inhibited by Wortmannin, could be rescued by 25% by providing ribose, a nucleotide precursor generated primarily through the PPP branch of glycolysis, and by 35% by palmitate, a precursor for the more complex lipids generated from glycolysis (

 </bold>). This suggests that, although other factors are also likely to restrict SFV replication upon Wortmannin treatment, activation of glycolysis is important for the generation of extra metabolic building blocks, needed for maximal production of new virus.
