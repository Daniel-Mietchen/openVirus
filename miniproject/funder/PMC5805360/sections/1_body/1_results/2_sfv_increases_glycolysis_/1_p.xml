<p>The extensive and rapid increase in glycolysis upon SFV infection is reminiscent of the dramatic metabolic reprogramming typical of cancer cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting that SFV might activate a metabolic “master switch”, able to rapidly reprogram cellular metabolism. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway has been shown to be activated upon SFV infection in a very strong and sustained manner, here referred to as “hyperactivation”. This PI3K/AKT hyperactivation overrides inhibition by growth factor depletion and requires the viral protein nsP3 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006835.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, no link to metabolism was made in these previous studies. PI3K/AKT hyperactivation in SH-SY5Y cells upon SFV infection was analysed by western blot at various times post infection. Mirroring the kinetics of viral replication and increased glycolysis, we observed phosphorylation of AKT from 5 hpi in the SH-SY5Y cells, with even higher levels at 8 hpi

In agreement with a role for PI3K/AKT regulation of cell metabolism, we also observed phosphorylation of the downstream targets phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2), the Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160, which increases trafficking of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, and ATP citrate lyase (ACL), the enzyme responsible for cytosolic acetyl-coA synthesis from citrate. Phosphorylation of AKT was also observed in primary rat cortical neurons (

 </bold>). Consistent with the activation of AKT, a kinase that modulates glycolysis primarily by phosphorylating key glycolytic enzymes, we did not observe any increase in the mRNA levels of glycolytic genes (
