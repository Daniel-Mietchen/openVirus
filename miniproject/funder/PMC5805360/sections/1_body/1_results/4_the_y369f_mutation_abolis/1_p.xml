<p>To establish the role of nsP3 Y369 in reprogramming cell metabolism, we compared the metabolic profiles of SH-SY5Y upon mock infection or infection with either wt SFV or SFV-YF. The inability of SFV-YF to activate AKT and its downstream targets over the course of infection was confirmed in SH-SY5Y (

 </bold>). In addition, the production of new viral progeny was lower after infection with SFV-YF compared to wt virus (

 </bold>), suggesting activation of the glycolytic pathway in cells infected with the wt virus, but not the mutant. As observed previously, AMP was decreased in the wt SFV infected samples compared to mock controls, but a larger decrease was seen in the SFV-YF infected cells. UMP did not differ between samples infected with wt SFV and mock controls, but was significantly decreased in SFV-YF, suggesting the possibility that in samples infected with SFV-YF nucleotide usage exceeded new synthesis (

 </bold>) showed that the mutation only affected the activation of the glycolytic pathway.
