These results also suggest an important contribution of the TCA cycle: SFV-YF-infected cells contained significantly lower concentrations of glutamate (a source of 2-oxoglutarate) and succinate (

 </bold>), suggesting depletion of these TCA intermediates, presumably as citrate is consumed to feed fatty acid synthesis, as suggested by the labelling data (
