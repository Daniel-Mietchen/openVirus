<p>SFV-induced PI3K/AKT hyperactivation likely affects other downstream features in addition to cell metabolism. We assessed one such feature, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), involved in translational control, using phosphorylation of rpS6 as a readout. Indeed, mTOR was activated in SFV-wt infected cells even under nutrient and growth factor depletion, which was not the case in SFV-YF or mock infected cells

 </bold>. However, despite sustained activation of mTOR, treatment of cells with rapamycin to specifically inhibit the SFV-induced mTOR hyperactivation had no major effect on wt SFV growth kinetics (
