<p>At this point, two main problems need to be tackled. The first lies in the identification of the epitope region on an antigen, most often in the absence of detailed X-ray information on the relevant antigenâ€“antibody complex. In this context, sequence and structure-based computational methods have played an increasingly relevant role in recent years, facilitating the identification of molecules which are able to efficiently engage disease biomarkers. </p>
