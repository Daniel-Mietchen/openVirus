<p>A plausible way to overcome these obstacles would be to identify the regions of the antigen that are specifically recognized in the course of an immune response. Chemical and structural information on such regions, called epitopes, could then be used as template to develop mimics that bind specifically to the antigen-binding pocket of the desired disease-relevant antibody. Peptides and peptidomimetics represent the ideal chemical tools to realize small epitope mimics that recapitulate the essential determinants of immune-reactivity and Ab-recognition of the cognate full-length antigen.</p>
