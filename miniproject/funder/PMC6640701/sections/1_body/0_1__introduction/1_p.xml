<p>Peptides are extremely versatile molecules with a wide range of applications. Peptides are attractive for chemists and chemical biologists thanks to the rich diversity of chemical functionalities they can potentially display. Indeed, amino acid building-blocks recapitulate all of the main traits of organic chemistry reactivities through their side chain groups, which range from hydrophobic and aromatic, to hydrophilic, acid, basic, and charged. The synthetic accessibility of linear chains through solid-phase methods, combined to the possibility to further derivatize side chains, opens access to a wide spectrum of chemical diversity and reactivity for the products. </p>
