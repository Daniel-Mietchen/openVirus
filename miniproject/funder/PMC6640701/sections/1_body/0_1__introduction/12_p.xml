<p>The second concerns the optimization of the presentation of the synthetic immunoreactive molecule(s) on diagnostic devices to efficiently capture the desired Abs. Circulating antibodies produced against disease-specific antigens can in fact be detected by passing patient fluids (serum, plasma, etc.) over an immobilized bait and then measuring the amount of antibody retained with a labeled secondary antibody. Novel methods of oriented display, as well as the use of optimized surfaces for the attachment of the probes, can aptly provide a significant increase in the performances of novel diagnostic tools. </p>
