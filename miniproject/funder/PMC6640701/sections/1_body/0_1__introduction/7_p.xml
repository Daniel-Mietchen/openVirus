<p>In this context, it is now well appreciated that, in many disease conditions, antibody-mediated responses may precede the manifestation of actual symptoms, sometimes even for a long time. This holds true for bacterial and viral infections. If the immune system has responded to a threat with a B-cell response, it is reasonable to assume that circulating antibodies, elicited specifically against molecular targets on pathogenic factors, could aptly represent efficacious biomarkers of the disease. The capture and detection of such antibodies expectedly requires the availability of their respective antigens as probes. </p>
