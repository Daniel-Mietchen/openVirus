<p>In this framework, peptide microarrays are appealing tools as they allow the simultaneous screening of hundreds to thousands of different sequences (and potentially structures, if conformational control is introduced) immobilized in spatially ordered patterns of spots on solid supports [

 <xref rid="B2-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. After incubation with a biological sample, specific interactions that take place on the single spots are detected in a label-free mode by surface plasmon resonance or mass spectrometry or in a label-dependent manner through fluorescence, chemiluminescence or colorimetry.
