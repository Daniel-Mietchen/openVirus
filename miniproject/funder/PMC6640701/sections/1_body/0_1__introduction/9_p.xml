<p>The advent of reverse vaccinology has given a huge boost to the discovery of tools that are more manageable and amenable to use as molecular probes. Reverse vaccinology applies bioinformatic methods to mine pathogen genomes to identify protein antigens (Ag) that are typically expressed on the outer membrane surface, and are thus most prone to be recognized by molecules of the immune system [

 <xref rid="B11-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Typically, this is achieved by identifying specific sequence motifs, such as those encoding for outer membrane proteins. The predicted Ag is then expressed, produced, and used in subsequent experimental tests. Full-length proteins, however, may themselves be difficult to handle, suffer from stability problems and in some cases may be recognized by more than one single Ab, giving rise to potential misinterpretations in the diagnostic setting.
