<p>It comes as no surprise that the use of peptides and peptidomimetics in drug discovery in the development of peptide-based materials for medical devices, and even in vaccinology, has recently met with renewed enthusiasm. Indeed, peptides play key roles in a number of biochemical pathways in and outside cells, making the discovery of artificial sequences (or mimics) which are able to either interfere or synergize with the respective natural processes an attractive strategy towards the production of new materials: as an example, the advantages they can offer as drugs are specificity, potency, and low toxicity. However, practical hurdles such as their poor stability, short half-life, and the fact that they are targeted by proteases have somewhat limited the realization of their full potential in medicinal chemistry. </p>
