<p>Phage display represents another method to select linear and discontinuous epitopes. The latter can be selected using purified antibodies or preparations of polyclonal serum. In this approach, linear epitopes as well as structurally organized ones, constrained by disulphide bonds, can be displayed on very large phage libraries. Antibodies are subsequently used to pan the epitopes. The targets that get recognized can be sequenced to determine the sequences. </p>
