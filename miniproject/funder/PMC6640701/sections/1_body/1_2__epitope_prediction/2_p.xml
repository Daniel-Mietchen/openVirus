<p>However, it has become increasingly clear that a combination of factors spanning the sequence, structure, dynamics and location of specific protein regions determines the cross-talk between the antigen and the antibody. In principle, the identification of (surface-exposed or exported) antigen substructures that display peculiar sequence and dynamic properties is the basis for the design of peptidic interactors as probes for Ab detection. In this framework, epitope sequences tolerate mutations, suggesting that they are not involved in the stabilization of the antigen fold. These sites continuously evolve to escape recognition by the immune system of their host, without disrupting the global 3D fold required for the function of the protein they belong to, which would ultimately be detrimental for the survival of the pathogen. Furthermore, epitopes are in general flexible and support extensive conformational fluctuations which underlie the conformational selection mechanisms that underpin antibody binding. Finally, epitopes define large exposed patches on the protein surface. </p>
