<p>HDX-MS for epitope discovery is generally coupled to limited proteolysis approaches in epitope mapping problems: specifically, an antigen is digested by an array of proteases in the presence or absence of its antibody. The fragmentation patterns resulting from proteolysis are compared [

 <xref rid="B41-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The presence of the antibody bound to its epitope may protect the cleavage site at or near the epitope itself. This technique is generally fast, relatively inexpensive, and has been shown to be able to quickly identify regions of interaction in an antigen [
