<p>To put these considerations in a quantitative predictive model, we introduced MLCE (matrix of low coupling energies) [

 <xref rid="B23-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The prediction is based on the energy decomposition method [

 <xref rid="B26-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which allows the detection of residue–residue couplings that are important in the stabilization of a fold (see details in the next paragraph). The method provides a simplified view of residue–residue pair interactions, extracting the major contributions to the energetic stability of the native structure from the results of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For a protein of 
 <italic>N</italic> residues, the 
 <italic>N</italic> × 
 <italic>N</italic> matrix (
 <italic>M
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic>) of average nonbonded interactions between pairs of residues can be built by averaging over the structures visited during an MD trajectory. The resulting energy matrix is then simplified through eigenvalue decomposition. The analysis of the 
 <italic>N</italic> components of the eigenvector associated with the lowest eigenvalue was shown to identify residues that behave as maximally strong or maximally weak interaction centers. The principal eigenvector can be used to reconstruct a simplified version of the energy matrix, which recapitulates the residue pairs with maximal and minimal couplings with the native structure of the protein. The simplified map is next filtered with topological information to identify patches of local couplings characterized by energetic interactions of minimal intensities. Low-intensity couplings between distant residues in the structure are a trivial consequence of the distance-dependence of energy functions. However, low-energy couplings between residues that are proximal in the folded 3D structure of the protein identify those sites which are particularly frustrated (non-optimized), which can therefore be regarded as the preferential perspective points of interaction with binding partners. Moreover, such regions would tolerate mutations without dramatic consequences on the antigen three-dimensional structure [
