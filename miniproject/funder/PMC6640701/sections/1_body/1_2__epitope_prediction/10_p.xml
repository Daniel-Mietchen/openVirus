<p>The MLCE approach was subsequently applied to the problem of developing diagnostic probes for ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infections. We focused on ZIKV non-structural 1 (NS1). In this case, MLCE identified a putative antigenic region of NS1. In this case, the approach returned a region of the protein encompassing different secondary structure motifs. Once realized and combined for co-presentation to patient sera, several candidates were found to be effective in discriminating ZIKA-positive vs. healthy samples [
