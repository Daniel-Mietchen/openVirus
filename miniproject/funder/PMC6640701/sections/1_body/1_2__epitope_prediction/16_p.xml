<p>Sela-Culang and coworkers introduced a mixed computational experimental method to B-cell epitope identification [
 <xref rid="B38-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Using the sequence of an antibody, the authors proved it possible to identify discontinuous epitopes on the targeted antigen. The method uses residue-pairing preferences and additional interface information. Predictions are improved by combining them with data on cross-blocking experiments that identify groups of antibodies with overlapping epitopes.
