<p>The computer method SEPPA [
 <xref rid="B15-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] makes use the concept of ‘unit patch of residue triangle’ to define the spatial context of residues in a protein surface, with the hypothesis that epitope regions should have specific compactness profiles on the surface. SEPPA gave an average AUC value over 0.742 and produced a successful pick-up rate of 96.64% when tested on validated databases.
