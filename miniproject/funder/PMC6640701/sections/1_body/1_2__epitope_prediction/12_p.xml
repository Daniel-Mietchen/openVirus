<p>Fiorucci and Zacharias introduced the electrostatic desolvation penalty (EDP) method [
 <xref rid="B21-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This approach uses probe molecules to evaluate the tendency for a certain surface region to be engaged in binding by another protein: the central idea of the method is that surface regions with a small free energy penalty for desolvation correspond to potential sites of interaction. Specifically, they calculate the electrostatic free energy penalty or gain in placing a neutral low-dielectric probe at various protein surface positions, using the finite-difference Poisson equation. Very interestingly, upon benchmarking against a large set of known general protein–protein interactions, the correct binding site overlapped with one of the six regions of the lowest electrostatic desolvation penalty in more than 90% of cases. The specific applications to antigen–antibody complexes demonstrated that EDP could be aptly extended to the difficult case of epitope prediction. This method requires no initial training, as the epitope propensity of a sequence is evaluated based on its physico-chemical properties.
