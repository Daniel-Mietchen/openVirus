<p>The initial condition to start the design of small peptide-based mimics of the immunoreactive regions of antigens depends on the capability to correctly locate the privileged substructures that are preferentially engaged in antibody binding. In this context, computational approaches have played a constantly increasing role over recent years. Sequence-based methods and algorithms based on the combination of descriptors reporting on solvent exposure, hydrophobicity profiles, and geometrical properties have provided important results [
