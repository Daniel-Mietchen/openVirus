<p>Further popular strategies for epitope mapping consist of testing the binding of antibodies against multiple peptide sequences that are prepared with medium to high-throughput synthetic techniques. In some cases, overlapping sequences spanning the whole antigen sequence are tested for their antibody-binding capability; peptides found to bind are used to define an epitope. One potential drawback of this approach is that it may miss the recognition of discontinuous conformational epitopes. Based on these concepts, Kodadek and coworkers have shown impressive results in the identification and optimization of chemical tools to manipulate antibody recognition and capture pathogenic antibodies related to chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or autoimmune disorders with high selectivity. To this end, they exploited a high-throughput screening protocol that used a large library of bead-displayed oligopeptides, generated via split-and-pool synthesis. This approach first concentrated on removing ligands, as the antigen-binding sites of antibodies that are not disease-related are first removed from the pool. Next, to identify ligands to disease-related antigen-binding sites, the remainder of the library was incubated with a soluble version of a patient-derived CLL. For an antibody in the presence of a large excess of competitor proteins, the antibody-binding beads were identified by the binding of a secondary antibody linked to a fluorescent probe. These active binding compounds were thus isolated and characterized with mass spectrometry. With this approach the authors are able to identify and further develop sequences or peptidomimetics that bind in the low nanomolar range. These approaches and their subsequent application in therapy and diagnostics are described at length in Doran et al. [
