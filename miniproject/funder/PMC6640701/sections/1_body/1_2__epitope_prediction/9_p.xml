<p>In one particular case [
 <xref rid="B30-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], an apparent discrepancy was noticed between the computational prediction and experimental epitope characterization based on tryptic digestion followed by antibody capture. Indeed, polyclonal antibodies may be induced by several factors in vivo, including degradation of the antigen into smaller fragments, which may ultimately lead to the presentation of sequences that are not on the surface or are inaccessible in the crystal structure. Such epitopes would not be predictable by MLCE. To overcome this limitation, MLCE was combined with a domain decomposition approach; the latter is an extension of the eigenvalue energetic analysis of the folded state and views a large protein as a combination of independent folding units [
 <xref rid="B26-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this context, the method uses combinations of non-redundant eigenvectors and filters out only specific subsets of strong interactions that are shown to correspond to independent folding nuclei. Grouping different proximal folding nuclei based on a proximity criterion permits the definition of structural domains. The use of the domain decomposition approach permitted us to identify possible boundaries with the antigens, which computationally mimicked a partial proteolysis. The application of the MLCE prediction to the resulting isolated domains identified new potential epitope sequences that turned out to display a high reactivity when tested against sera of
