<p>Because it is based on a preliminary characterization of the structural ensemble of the antigen by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the method naturally takes into account information on the conformational transitions that underlie the adaptation to the respective antibody to form a complex. Overall, MLCE showed the unique ability to provide information on the epitope sequence, structure and flexibility. A pictorial scheme of the method is reported in
