<p>Click chemistry reactions in fact have exquisite chemoselectivity towards common functional groups that can be easily introduced into peptides providing a high-yielding and cost-effective immobilization strategy. Moreover, benign reaction conditions and fast reaction kinetics that commonly characterize this class of reactions address the need for fast immobilization well, which is particularly relevant to overcoming the intrinsically slow reactivity at the solutionâ€“solid support interface [
