<p>The structure-based prediction of potentially reactive sequences is a necessary first step in any project aimed at developing new molecules with interesting applications. Complementary to this, the presentation/display of designed sequences in the best spatial orientation for immunoreactivity with patientsâ€™ samples represents a fundamental step in the quest for devices with optimal performances. </p>
