<p>Our results highlighted the challenges of real-case serological assays, where the in vivo response to immunogenic epitopes derived from infections is associated to a complex antibody repertoire that targets several conformers of the same epitope. In this type of assays, the polyclonality of patientâ€™s response enhances non-specific interactions while the probe discrimination potential relies on a narrow border between signal detection and background noise. In this context, to gain optimal specificity and sensitivity, the whole dynamic distribution of peptide epitope conformers must be fully accessible to the range of antigen-directed elicited antibodies. To this end, any strategy targeted at enhancing the affinity of the immobilized probes for disease-specific antibodies, including space-oriented display of epitopes, fine control of probe density and multivalent presentations, is beneficial to the delivery of robust clinical tests [
