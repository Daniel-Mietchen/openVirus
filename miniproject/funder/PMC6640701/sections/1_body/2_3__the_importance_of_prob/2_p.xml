<p>Peptide microarrays are composed by a variable number of peptides either in situ synthesized step by step on a suitable flat support or printed after individual synthesis and purification. In situ methods, based on spot synthesis of peptides (SPOT), particle-based synthesis and photolytographic methods, generate high-density arrays of thousands of peptides, potentially providing a huge amount of information by the linear scanning of aminoacidic sequences. This approach, reviewed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B47-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], is especially useful when no or poor structure-based information is available; it is high-throughput and uses minimal amounts of reagents. On the other side, the purity and the quality of the synthesized probes cannot be assessed, and a consolidated expertise in data analysis is required to filter out and interpret the large amount of generated results. Moreover, this approach largely limits the amount of information related to the presence of discontinuous epitopes, i.e., immunoreactive regions generated by non-contiguous amino acid patches brought in close contact by the 3D-arrangement of the antigen structure, that represent most of the proteinsâ€™ actual epitopes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibodies-08-00023-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). However, short peptide sequences are rarely capable of assuming a 3D structure out of their native context and, in addition, a simple peptide surface physisorption or non-specific covalent binding are unfavorable immobilization methods due to the possible masking of key epitope residues. All together, these challenges can impair bioassay performance through ambiguous results and reduction in sensitivity. In this scenario, our workflow for the development of peptide microarrays is quite opposite, as it focusses on selected small epitope libraries, where their conformational dynamics and surface presentation are finely tuned.
