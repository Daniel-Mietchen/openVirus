<p>The conformational control of peptides is generally performed by stapling and cyclization techniques that are based on the formation of intramolecular covalent bonds or on the use of anchoring macrocyclic rigid scaffolds to thermodynamically favour a limited set of peptide conformations [

In our previous work, we critically assessed the role of epitope conformational stabilization in the development of immunoreactive probes using a triazole-mediated stapling strategy to stabilize the native Î±-helical fold of the Pal3 peptidic epitope from the

We compared the diagnostic performances of the linear epitope (Pal3), which showed no propensity to fold outside its native protein context, with those of its stapled analogue Pal3H, which in contrast retained a strong helical propensity. Interestingly, Pal3H proved more effective in discriminating between melioidosis patient subclasses, highlighting the role of conformational stabilization in favoring an optimal bioprobe presentation to the target antibodies.
