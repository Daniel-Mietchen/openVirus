<p>A fine-tuning of the probe density and orientation may be particularly useful to discriminate infections that present a high degree of antibody cross-reactivity, such as in the case of arboviruses. In this frame, the combined use of multiple peptides could provide superior discriminative capacity than a single probe by the generation of an immune-signature. In the case of Zika virus NS1 protein, we found that antigenic response is determined by discontinuous epitopes arising from spatial arrangements of non-contiguous linear peptide sequences. This could represent a severe limitation to the applicability of peptide microarrays in diagnostic tests. To address this limitation, starting from the computationally-guided identification of a surface antigenic NS1 region, we functionally mimicked the native antigen fold through the oriented and spatially controlled co-immobilization of proximal peptide sequences forming the putative antigenic region (
