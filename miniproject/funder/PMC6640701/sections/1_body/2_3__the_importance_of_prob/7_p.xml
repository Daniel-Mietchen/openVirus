<p>A number of click-type immobilization strategies were compared in the frame of the peptide-based sero-diagnostics of 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> infections in cystic fibrosis patients [
 <xref rid="B55-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this work, we showed that not only the random immobilization of peptides is not feasible for a reliable diagnosis in complex samples, but also that the probe binding and reproducibility of the assay are poorly consistent when this approach is used. In contrast, peptide orientation via chemoselective immobilization was successful in enhancing the statistical significance of the test, further improved when the peptides were spaced and better exposed on the chip surface by means of small polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers. Overall, all the click chemoselective reactions that we evaluated (thiol-maleimide and azide-alkyne) showed a comparable efficiency in terms of diagnostic performance. The binding efficiency to microarray surfaces was the highest when using azide-alkyne-cycloaddition (both in the Cu-catalyzed and Cu-free versions); on the other hand, the best spot morphology and fluorescence were obtained by using thiol-maleimide conjugation. This approach, however, is not general and is only applicable when cysteine residues are not present in the selected peptide sequences.
