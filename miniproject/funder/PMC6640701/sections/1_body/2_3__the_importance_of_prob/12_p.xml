<p>Overall, we obtained a stable and yet highly permeable semi-wet matrix to run ultrafast (&lt;10 min) fluorescence immunoassays under solution-like conditions. Importantly, the hydrogel matrix did not show nonspecific interactions even in the presence of complex biological samples such as sera. Further work is currently ongoing in our laboratories to consolidate and expand these results and to apply this strategy in highly challenging assays.</p>
