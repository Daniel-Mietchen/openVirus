<p>We have deeply investigated this aspect and developed new chemical strategies to gain optimal epitope display in our peptide-based bioassays. Our approach for surface modification is based on the use of polymeric coatings that rapidly self-adsorb on the analytical surface from a diluted water solution, forming an anti-fouling and hydrophilic layer bearing functional groups for the covalent immobilization of bio-probes [
