<p>As biomolecule 3D properties are so intimately linked to their analytical performances, a further and innovative step to preserve their native structure and function upon surface immobilization is to gently encapsulate them within hydrogel matrices under solution mimetic conditions. This strategy is associated with additional advantages including increased loading capacity, reduced nonspecific binding and an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the reported hydrogels for microarrays are based on polymeric and biopolymeric matrices. However, it is often not trivial to match analyte diffusion rates through the gel matrix with stable bioprobe entrapment. In addition, laborious strategies may be required for hydrogel chip fabrication due to the viscosity of common hydrogels. We tackled these limitations by developing a nanostructured self-assembling peptide hydrogel (YF-Q11) characterized by favorable properties for 3D microarrays [

These include both low viscosity, enabling its direct use during automated spotting, combined with good mechanical robustness and, most relevantly, unimpaired and tunable diffusion properties of different macromolecules (peptides, proteins, antibodies).
