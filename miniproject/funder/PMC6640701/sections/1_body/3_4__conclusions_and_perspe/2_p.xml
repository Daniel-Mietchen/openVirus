<p>In this context, the improvement in multiscale methods will permit us to simulate events such as the recognition of multiple receptors on host-cells, virus entry or bacterial invasion with a level of detail that can be directly translated into new design rules for the development of biomimetic systems [

Moreover, the dramatic expansion of computer learning methods and the ever-increasing computational power will facilitate the application of artificial intelligence approaches aimed at exploiting the wealth of data made available by genomics, proteomics, epidemiology programs (to name a few) into generating new methods for the design and engineering of peptide-based probes. Machine learning algorithms, for instance, could be used to reveal non-trivial patterns that exist between specific recognition sequences, their functions in their cognate proteins and biochemical processes, and their reverberations at the systems level. Approaches of this kind have already been applied in protein secondary structure prediction, drug discovery, and the deimmunization of immunoreactive sequences [
