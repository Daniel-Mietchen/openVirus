<p>The use of peptide-based materials for diagnostic purposes holds a great deal of potential for further development and applications. It is tempting to suggest that methods for the de novo prediction of interacting sequences can be used not only to mimic antigen–antibody interactions but complex (even multivalent) interactions in general [

 <xref rid="B59-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,

 <xref rid="B62-antibodies-08-00023" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The latter are an extremely challenging class of targets, due to the peculiar conformational and chemical characteristics of the interacting surfaces; the selection, design, and optimal display of mimics of the regions that underpin protein–protein molecular recognition can be aptly used to detect specific PPIs in normal vs. transformed cells. In this context, polyvalent interactions, connected to the presentation of multiple binding sequences, can collectively yield much richer information and stronger responses than their single-sequence counterparts, generating new opportunities for diagnosis as well as details on the basis for mechanisms which are apt to agonize or antagonize biological interactions.
