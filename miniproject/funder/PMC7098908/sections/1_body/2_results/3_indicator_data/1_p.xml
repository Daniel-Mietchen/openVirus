<p>Respondent reporting on the five leading causes of hospital admission and five leading causes of death among PLHIV are shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Respondents in five countries could not report on leading causes of hospital admission, and information for the sixth country, Sweden, reflected the respondent's estimates. In comments from two countries, respondents indicated that data for reporting on this indicator existed: Italy was said to have a national hospital admissions database from which HIV records could be extracted, and the Netherlands was said to have uncoded free text collected in HIV surveillance reports. Respondents in a larger number of countries were able to report data on leading causes of death.
