<p>Findings from our study indicate that although the existing gaps may be considerable, there are opportunities for health information systems in European countries to expand the scope of their HIV monitoring in order to support decision-making about how the long-term health-related needs of PLHIV can best be met. Scaling up this survey to involve a larger number of European countries would provide stronger evidence regarding how to build on monitoring activities and resources that are already in place. Studies of HIV monitoring capacity are also needed in other regions, including Africa and Asia, where low- and middle-income countries with widespread access to HIV treatment are beginning to face HIV care challenges that similarly call for integrated and people-centred health system responses (

The larger goals of reorienting monitoring systems to better address the chronic care dimensions of HIV should be to transform HIV care into a more holistic undertaking and to help guide the integration of health system responses to HIV and to other chronic diseases.
