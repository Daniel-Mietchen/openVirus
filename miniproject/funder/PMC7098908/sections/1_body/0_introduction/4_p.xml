<p>European countries are experiencing the changing HIV care paradigm ahead of many other countries, and European health systems have the opportunity to set an instructive example by adapting their HIV services to reflect a model of care that is suitable for long-term conditions. However, little is known about whether national HIV monitoring programmes in Europe have evolved in accordance with changing needs. Without the right information, health systems will be limited in their efforts to meet new HIV-related health challenges. This study assesses the ability of health systems in six European countries to report on indicators that can speak to the health and psychosocial needs of people who are living with HIV on a long-term basis.</p>
