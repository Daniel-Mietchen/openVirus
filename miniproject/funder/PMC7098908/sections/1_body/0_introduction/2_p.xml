<p>The highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens introduced in the late 1990s have transformed HIV into a manageable long-term condition in the sense that the life expectancy of people who initiate ART at an early stage of infection is close to that of the general population (

A 2018 review found that PLHIV are twice as likely as HIV-negative people to develop cardiovascular disease, and that the global burden of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease has increased three-fold from 1990 to 2015 (
