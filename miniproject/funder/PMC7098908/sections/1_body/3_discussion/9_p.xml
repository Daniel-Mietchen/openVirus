<p>The accuracy of the information reported by the survey respondents was not confirmed by other sources, and it may reflect errors or biases on the part of respondents. Biases among respondents also may have influenced some of the estimates and explanations provided in response to survey items that requested data. Country data for leading causes of hospitalisation and death among PLHIV and for discrimination within health systems were not collected using standardised methodologies and definitions. Hence, it is not possible to make meaningful cross-country comparisons. The survey item that asked for the percentage of PLHIV who report being denied health services did not elaborate criteria for what constitutes denial of health services, and thus the outcome measure could have been interpreted in multiple ways.</p>
