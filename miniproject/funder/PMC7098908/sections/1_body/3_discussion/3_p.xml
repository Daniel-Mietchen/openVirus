<p>In the interest of capturing as much information as possible, we sought to learn about the monitoring of each comorbidity included in our study in four domains spanning the diagnosis and treatment spectrum: whether PLHIV are offered screening/testing, whether they are screened/tested, whether they are diagnosed and whether they are treated. Three or more countries had the ability to report on all four domains for some comorbidities. While this is a welcome finding, the methodological decision to ask survey respondents to report in terms of the four domains is not meant to imply that health systems should be asked to monitor all four of them. Where health systems do not currently have robust reporting processes in place, a better use of resources would be to focus on collecting data at one stage of the diagnostic process for each comorbidity of interest, e.g., whether PLHIV are screened for cardiovascular disease and whether PLHIV who have been diagnosed with drug dependence receive treatment.</p>
