<p>The health-related quality of life of PLHIV has long been a matter of interest for researchers (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), practitioners and community stakeholders, but there is little published information about how this issue has been monitored by health systems. Furthermore, we are not aware of any expert guidance on the use of HRQoL indicators in national HIV monitoring. In 2018, the Dublin Declaration questionnaire (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) included an item about HRQoL for the first time, asking respondent countries to report on whether or not they included HRQoL in their HIV monitoring. Only five of 48 responding countries answered that they did so (personal communication, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to Jeffrey V. Lazarus, 5 June 2018). In light of this finding, it is notable that one of the six countries in our study currently carries out reporting on the HRQoL of PLHIV and two more countries said they were able to easily modify their current monitoring systems to carry out such reporting. It may be that there is widespread readiness to incorporate HRQoL into HIV monitoring in the European region, and this is perhaps an opportune time for stakeholders to identify best practices for health information systems to adopt in this regard.
