<p>This study in six European countries assessed aspects of health system monitoring that are considered relevant to the care of PLHIV on a long-term basis. Based on input from respondents who are regarded as top HIV monitoring experts in their countries, it found that a number of countries cannot report on indicators for many major comorbidities in PLHIV populations, including highly prevalent comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and depression. It also identified large monitoring gaps in relation to health-related quality of life, fertility desires, psychosocial services, and discrimination within health systems.</p>
