<p>This study has multiple limitations. The collection of data from only six of the 53 countries in the WHO European Region limits the representativeness of study findings, and a larger number of countries would need to be surveyed to acquire an evidence base for making recommendations about indicators that should be incorporated into national HIV monitoring throughout the region. The recruitment of survey respondents who are regarded as top HIV monitoring experts in their countries may have resulted in selection bias if this strategy led to a lack of representation of countries with HIV monitoring systems that are not sufficiently advanced for any one individual to be regarded as an expert in this area. In study countries where more than one person might be considered suitably knowledgeable about the issues of interest, our choice of experts might be biased by unknown variables. Since only one expert was asked to respond to the survey in each study country, findings directly reflect any gaps in the knowledge of these individuals regarding HIV monitoring in their countries.</p>
