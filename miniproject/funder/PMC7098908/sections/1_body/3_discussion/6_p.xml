<p>Given the high level of collaboration and coordination among many European countries in the response to HIV, the use of standardized “fourth 90” HIV care indicators across multiple countries would be beneficial to researchers, policy-makers, and other stakeholders. The optimal way for European countries to choose such indicators would be through a coordinated process that yields recommendations for a small number of new indicators to be used by national governments. In seeking consensus on indicators, stakeholders should consider how to minimise the reporting burden for countries and align data collection with current country-level monitoring activities, particularly in regard to comorbidity monitoring options. With such a large number of comorbidities contributing to the disease burden in PLHIV, the objective should not be to capture information about numerous comorbidities but rather to choose some comorbidities and other indicators as proxies for how health systems are managing comorbidity care in PLHIV overall. Such a process should take into account the possible need to harmonise definitions of some comorbidities such as alcohol dependence and sexual dysfunction.</p>
