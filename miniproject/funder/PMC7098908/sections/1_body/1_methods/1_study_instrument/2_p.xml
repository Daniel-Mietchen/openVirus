<p>We created a 56-item English-language survey to investigate the readiness of national health systems to report on the chosen health-related issues as part of their routine HIV monitoring (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary File</xref>). The survey was organised into seven thematic sections: HIV clinical management, comorbidities, health-related quality of life, psychosocial services, discrimination within health systems, preconception planning, and general issues. A number of survey items asked about specific indicators in these areas, instructing respondents to characterise national reporting on these issues by choosing one of four possible responses: (a) national HIV monitoring does include reporting on such an indicator; (b) national HIV monitoring systems collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator; (c) national HIV monitoring systems could be easily modified to collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator; or (d) national HIV monitoring systems could not be easily modified to collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator. In order to keep the survey short enough for respondents to be willing to complete all items, we largely restricted the content to questions such as these about reporting capacity rather than about the actual data being reported. However, some items requested data, e.g., respondents were asked to report leading causes of hospital admission and death among PLHIV and to report the percentage of PLHIV denied health services because of their HIV status.
