<p>We identified common health-related issues for people with controlled HIV using an iterative process of desk research and consultation with an expert panel. For the literature review, we used PubMed to identify relevant English-language publications, using the term “HIV” in combination with terms such as “comorbidity,” “Europe,” “epidemiology,” and “health-related quality of life.” We prioritised review articles and large longitudinal cohort studies published after 2010 but did not exclude other sources. We also examined relevant clinical guidelines such as those published by the European AIDS Clinical Society as well as key gray literature sources that were located through internet searches. The expert panel members who advised on the selection of relevant health-related issues to be addressed in the study included European researchers, clinicians, epidemiologists, policymakers, industry representatives, and civil society stakeholders including PLHIV.</p>
