<p>The study group's nine members, who include experts in monitoring, policy, and health system responses to HIV in Europe, were consulted regarding the selection of study countries. The objective was to construct a geographically diverse sample that also included countries with diverse health systems and different levels of robustness in their national HIV monitoring activities. Through this process, Estonia, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, and Turkey were selected as study countries. We then identified one expert to serve as the respondent in each country via purposive sampling, drawing on multiple co-authors' networks of contacts in the countries of interest to select this person. The objective was to choose the respondents with the most comprehensive knowledge of their countries' national HIV monitoring mechanisms and resources. There were no other eligibility criteria, and the experts identified included both individuals working directly for government agencies as well as individuals working closely with those agencies. These experts were encouraged to collaborate with other experts in their country to present a comprehensive response.</p>
