<p>The survey was administered from 20 April to 30 June 2018 using a Microsoft Word survey document. After data-cleaning, we compiled findings in Microsoft Excel and performed descriptive analyses. For reporting purposes, findings were organised into two domains: (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) ability to report on indicators of interest; and (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) data for selected indicators. In the first domain, a country was considered to be able to report on a specified indicator if the respondent reported that either: (a) national HIV monitoring does include reporting on such an indicator; (b) national HIV monitoring systems collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator; or (c) national HIV monitoring systems could be easily modified to collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator. We classified a country as not able to report if the respondent reported that national HIV monitoring systems were not currently able and could not be easily modified to collect data that would allow for reporting on such an indicator. Findings relating to comorbidities, health-related quality of life, psychosocial services, discrimination within health systems, and fertility desires are presented in terms of the two domains previously named: reporting ability and data for selected indicators.
