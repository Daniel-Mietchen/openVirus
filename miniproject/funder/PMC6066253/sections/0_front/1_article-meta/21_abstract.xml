  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is one of the major human disease vectors and, despite substantial control efforts, it is rapidly spreading worldwide and increasing its epidemiological role. Thus, innovative approaches to fight this mosquito are urgently needed. Among the available control strategies, the exploitation of the endosymbiotic bacterium 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> seems to be promising. In nature, the infection by 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is generally not detrimental, instead, it causes a series of modifications in host physiology promoting the spread of the infection in uninfected populations. Herein, we report on the artificial transinfection of specific 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> to replace its native 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection type. This manipulation aimed at exploiting the expected modifications in the reproductive biology and vector competence of the species to contribute to reduce its epidemiological role. Specifically, we found that the new double 
  <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection did not affect 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> fitness. The males belonging to the manipulated line, AR
  <italic>w</italic>P-M, induced full egg infertility in the wild-type females they mate with and showed increased male mating competitiveness. Remarkably, the AR
  <italic>w</italic>P-M females demonstrated significantly reduced competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses while both tested 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> lines showed a very low susceptibility for Zika virus. These findings may encourage the use of AR
  <italic>w</italic>P-M 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> as a highly efficient and safe biocide to suppress the wild-type populations.
