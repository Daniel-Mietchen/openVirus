<p>When analyzing mosquitoes infected with CHIKV, significant differences were detected between the two

 <italic>albopictus</italic> lines at each dpi (7, 14) and parameters examined (IR, DE, TE) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006626.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The AR
 <italic>w</italic>P line showed higher rates of infection, dissemination and transmission suggesting that AR
 <italic>w</italic>P was more susceptible to CHIKV than AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M (Fisher exact test: P &lt; 0.05). Previous results had shown that the vector competence for CHIKV was not significantly different comparing AR

 <italic>w</italic>Mel to AR
 <italic>w</italic>P led to a reduced vector competence for CHIKV also compared to the wild-types. In fact, about 5 and 0% of the infected AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M females were able to transmit the virus, respectively, at 14 and 21 dpi.
