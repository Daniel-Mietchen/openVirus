 <italic>albopictus</italic> embryos were microinjected in total and 12 eggs were viable after the treatment and gave first instar larvae. Among obtained larvae, 8 emerged as adults, 4 of which were found infected with 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Two infected females were used to establish transinfected isofemale lines and one out of them transmitted the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel infection to the progeny. All of the tested G
 <sub>1</sub> individuals were confirmed as positive for 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and vertical transmission accuracy always approached 100% over the following generations with few exceptions only among male progeny (98.89Â±1.01% in mean) (

 <italic>w</italic>P-M. The confirmation of the transinfected 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain was achieved by sequencing the 
 <italic>wsp</italic> gene [
