<p>Herein, we report on the transinfection of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in AR
 <italic>w</italic>P to combine the remarkable suitability to the mass rearing protocols and male mating competitiveness, shown by this 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> line over more than 100 generations, with a reduction in the vector competence, as expected by the introduction of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This research aims to obtain an innovative and safe tool to suppress and/or replace 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> wild-type populations based on considerations and conditions discussed below.
