 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a vertically transmitted endosymbiotic bacterium, quite common in arthropods and a few other invertebrate taxa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which mainly infects the germ line of both sexes and manipulates host reproduction promoting the spread of the infected individuals in uninfected populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Among the various 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-induced effects on host biology, Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) occurs at early stages of embryonic development and characterizes unfertile crosses between individuals with different 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection types [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Introducing artificially a CI-inducing strain of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in a vector species may provide a tool to produce functionally sterile males to be used to compromise the fertility of wild-type females not infected by the above 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain.
