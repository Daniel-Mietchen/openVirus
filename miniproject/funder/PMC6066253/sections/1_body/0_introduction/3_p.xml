<p>Besides insecticide spraying, various alternative mosquito control methods are being developed and experimented [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In particular, theoretical and experimental studies are showing that certain strategies targeting mosquito reproduction biology have the potential to significantly affect mosquito populations, leading to a diminished risk that they may support diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Basically, these methods rely on the release of functionally sterile males produced by three main techniques, namely, the irradiation of pupae by Î³- or x-rays [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the introduction of lethal factors through genetic modification [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and the manipulation of the insect microbiome by the transinfection of the symbiotic bacterium 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Rickettsiales) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A further control strategy once again involves 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and it is not based on the suppression of the vector population but instead on the gradual replacement of the wild-types with conspecifics displaying desired biological traits [
