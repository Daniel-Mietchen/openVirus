<p>Mosquito lines used in the experiments shared the same genetic background. S
 <sub>ANG</sub> is a wild-type strain of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> colonized by using ovitraps in Anguillara Sabazia (Rome) in 2006 and since then reared under laboratory conditions at ENEA-Casaccia Research-Center (Rome). AR
 <italic>w</italic>P is a CI-inducing line, established at ENEA in 2008 through the transinfection of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-cured S
 <sub>ANG</sub> individuals with 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and reared for about 100 generations under rearing settings described below. Both the lines described above were periodically outcrossed with wild-type individuals from the same area to preserve the genetic variability according to methods reported previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Specifically, virgin AR
 <italic>w</italic>P and S
 <sub>ANG</sub> females were crossed every five generations with the same number of two weeks old males obtained from Anguillara wild-caught females. AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M has been obtained through the transinfection of AR
 <italic>w</italic>P with 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> from 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>melanogaster</italic> as reported in a further paragraph.
