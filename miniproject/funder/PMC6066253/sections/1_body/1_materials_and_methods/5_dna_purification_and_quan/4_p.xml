<p>Amplification reaction was prepared using the FluoCycle II SYBR Master Mix (Euroclone, Milano, Italy) in 20 μl final volume. Each mosquito extract was analyzed in triplicate using 2 μl total DNA extract as a reaction template. PCR was performed on ABI Prism 7100 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) thermal cycler, optimizing the elongation temperature for each primer pair. Hence, the following amplification programs were applied: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C/52°C/62°C, for primer pair
