<p>The amplified sequences were then assembled in a single plasmid, according to the following procedure. 
 <italic>Actin</italic> gene fragment was transferred from pCR 2.1 into BamHI-NotI sites of pBluescript II SK (+) vector, resulting in pBS-act plasmid. Then, 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip-
 <italic>wsp</italic> fragment was cloned from pCR 2.1 into NotI-SacI sites of pBS-act, obtaining pBS-P-act plasmid. Finally, 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-
 <italic>wsp</italic> fragment was cloned from pCR 2.1 into KpnI-XhoI sites of pBS-P-act, resulting in pBS-M-P-act plasmid. All obtained constructs were sequenced to assess the correct assembling and the absence of unwanted sequence variations.
