<p>For qPCR quantitation the pBS-M-P-act plasmid was serially diluted to build a standard curve with all three loci present at an equimolar concentration. The same standard dilutions were used in each qPCR, in order to standardize the signal with the nuclear 
 <italic>actin</italic> reference. Quantitative PCR amplification was performed in triplicate for each mosquito extract and mean genome number of 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip-
 <italic>wsp</italic> and 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-
 <italic>wsp</italic> was obtained per nuclear 
 <italic>actin</italic> copy number.
