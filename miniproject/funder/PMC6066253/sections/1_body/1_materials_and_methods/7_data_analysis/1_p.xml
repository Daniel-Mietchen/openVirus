<p>Survival curves of the three different lines (AR
 <italic>w</italic>P, S
 <sub>ANG</sub>, and AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M) were compared using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. One-way repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni mean separation were used to compare fecundity and egg hatch data between lines. Percent data was transformed to arcsin square root of proportions before the analysis. Normality of the experimental data was determined by the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test. ANOVA was also used to compare the mean level of observed and expected CI in the male competitiveness trials.
