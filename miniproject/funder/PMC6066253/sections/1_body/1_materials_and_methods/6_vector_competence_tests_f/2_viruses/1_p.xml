<p>CHIKV (CHIKV 06.21; accession number AM258992) was isolated in 2005 from a newborn male from La Reunion presenting meningo-encephalitis symptoms [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. This strain belongs to the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage known to be better adapted to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> due to the E1-A226V mutation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and this genotype was involved in the 2007 outbreak in Emilia-Romagna Region (Italy) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We assumed that the widespread of this CHIKV strain was a valid argument to chose it over others as more suitable to be involved in severe epidemics. DENV (DENV-1 1806; accession number EU482591) was obtained in 2010 from an autochthonous case in Nice, France [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ZIKV (ZIKV PE243; accession number KX197192) was isolated from a patient in Recife (Brazil) in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Viral stocks were prepared after several passages of the isolate onto 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> C6/36 cells for CHIKV and DENV, and Vero cells for ZIKV.
