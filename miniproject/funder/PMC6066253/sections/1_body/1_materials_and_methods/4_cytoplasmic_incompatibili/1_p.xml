<p>Three different series of crossing experiments were set up to evaluate the CI pattern between AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M and S
 <sub>ANG</sub> and to measure the male mating competitiveness of the AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M males in comparison with the S
 <sub>ANG</sub> males in 100×50×50 cm cages. For this purpose, respectively, 2±1 and 3±1 days-old females and males were used: i) 20:20 S
 <sub>ANG</sub> males:females were allowed to mate in control crosses; ii) CI crosses consisted of populations of 20:20 AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M males:S
 <sub>ANG</sub> females; iii) populations of 20:20 S
 <sub>ANG</sub> males:AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M females were used to measure CI in the reciprocal cross; iv) competition crosses involved 20:20:20 AR
 <italic>w</italic>P males:S
 <sub>ANG</sub> males:S
 <sub>ANG</sub> females respectively. After 24 h, males were retrieved and females were provided with a blood meal. On the day of oviposition, females were isolated into plastic tubes furnished with wet paper for individualized egg laying. Produced eggs were counted and then allowed to hatch to measure CI. In the case of no hatching egg, females were checked for the presence of spermatozoa to ascertain the occurrence of a mating and virgins were excluded from the counts. CI crosses (ii and iii) were also repeated with males aged 10±1 and 17±1 days to investigate age-dependant changes in the incompatibility level. The degree of CI was computed using the corrected index of cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI
 <sub>corr</sub>) and the Fried competitiveness index, as described previously [
