<p>After 5 days of development, the eggs were hatched by using a nutrient broth medium [

 <sub>0</sub> females, isolated as pupae to assure virginity, were mated with AR
 <italic>w</italic>P males and then provided with a blood meal. After oviposition, the infection status of G
 <sub>0</sub> females and males was ascertained by PCR analysis using the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-
 <italic>wsp</italic> loci primers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the case of a positive result, the obtained amplicons were sequenced to confirm the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection type. The progeny produced by infected females were selected to establish a new transinfected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> line, AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M. To reduce the inbreeding effects, AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M females were outcrossed with AR
 <italic>w</italic>P males for five generations. During the AR
 <italic>w</italic>P line establishment, the first 6 generations were monitored for transmission efficiency of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. All the G
 <sub>1</sub> adults were PCR assayed for presence of 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and infected offspring were chosen to start a new generation. Starting from G
 <sub>2</sub>, the maternal inheritance rate was estimated by assaying 5 daughters and 5 sons for each of three isolated females (mothers), randomly chosen.
