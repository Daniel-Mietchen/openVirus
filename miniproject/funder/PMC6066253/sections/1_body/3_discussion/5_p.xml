<p>As expected, the introduction of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel in AR
 <italic>w</italic>P 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> had a profound impact on the vector competence of this line. 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbA and 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were proved to not interfere with the transmission of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Also, we demonstrated previously (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006626.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) that 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was not capable of blocking this virus. Instead, when introducing 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel in AR
 <italic>w</italic>P 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, a blockade of CHIKV was detected lowering the potential of this mosquito to transmit the virus. This phenotype was shared with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-cured 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> transfected with 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel [
