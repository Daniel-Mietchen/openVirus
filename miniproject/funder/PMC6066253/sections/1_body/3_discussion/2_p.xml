 <italic>albopictus</italic> fitness even in the case of coexistence with 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In addition, the CI trials demonstrated that AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M maintained the notable male mating competitiveness already reported for AR
 <italic>w</italic>P in large enclosures under field conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This advantage over the wild-types seemed to increase when moving from small cages to larger environments thus, we previously hypothesized that it could be due to AR
 <italic>w</italic>P male size [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, this idea should be confirmed by more specific tests with regard to both AR
 <italic>w</italic>P and AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M because changing environment could significantly affect the outcome of the trials. In any case, it is clear that releasing males with higher mating competitiveness compared to the wild-types may lead to induced infertility levels not reachable when using the same amount of irradiated males or males carrying dominant lethal mutations. This is because, using irradiation to obtain fully infertile 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> males means reducing their mating competitiveness and survivorship, while preserving these latter traits by lowering the irradiation doses leads to a residual fertility which was found to increase with age [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Similarly, RIDL 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> males showed reduced survivorship and mating competitiveness compared to the wild-types [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Furthermore, AR
 <italic>w</italic>P and, as confirmed herein, AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M can be easily outcrossed, thanks to the partial fertility between the old wild-type males and the females belonging to these

 <italic>w</italic>P/AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M to be adapted to local environmental conditions and to acquire useful mutations from the wild-types of the target areas such as the ones responsible for the insecticide-resistance [
