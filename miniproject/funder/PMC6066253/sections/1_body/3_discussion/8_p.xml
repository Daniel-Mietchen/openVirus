<p>Making available an 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> line which couples high male mating competitiveness and suitability to the mass rearing protocols to a reduced vectorial competence would diminish the concerns associated with the possible escape of females among the released males in IIT programs. However, a series of issues will certainly need to be addressed before moving with AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M to field testing. Further studies will have to evaluate AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M vector competence in comparison with local wild-type populations and also testing other DENV and CHIKV serotypes. Moreover, the long-term stability of the new 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection will be investigated because natural selection might gradually lead to reduced symbiont density and the loss of antiviral protection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In particular, the suitability of the line to the stressing mass production protocols will be studied together with its response to the environmental conditions of the open field. In fact, 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is known to be quite susceptible to heat stress as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> eggs and larvae maintained at temperatures higher than 30Â°C showed a dramatic reduction of the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titer [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Such temperatures are common at low latitudes as well as during the summer in the Mediterranean basin and they might lead to a reduced pathogen inhibition and to a progressive diminution or even loss of the infection.
