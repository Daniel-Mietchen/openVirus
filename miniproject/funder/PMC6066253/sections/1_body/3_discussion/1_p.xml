<p>The 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) may offer a highly efficient approach to suppress mosquito vector populations because it can combine high efficacy with sustainable costs and negligible side-effects [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this context, the introduction of different
