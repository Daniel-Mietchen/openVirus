<p>Mounting experimental evidence suggests that the low vector competence of wild-type 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> for DENV is correlated with the presence of the natural of 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbA and 
 <italic>w</italic>AlbB 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. While removing these strains canceled the inhibition exerted by 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on DENV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], we demonstrated that adding 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel to 
 <italic>w</italic>Pip imposed a higher reduction of DENV-1 transmission by AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> compared to AR
 <italic>w</italic>P. An even higher level of refractoriness to DENV transmission was previously obtained in a 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-only infected 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006626.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], possibly due to a higher 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> titer compared to AR
 <italic>w</italic>P-M. However, the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> density data reported in the latter article is only expressed as a ratio compared to the wild-types thus, a direct comparison with the results reported herein is not feasible.
