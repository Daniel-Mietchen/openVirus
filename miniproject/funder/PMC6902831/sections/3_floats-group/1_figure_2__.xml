  <title>Example of Adherence and Persistence Criteria Evaluation for a Patient Exposed to Continuous Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) Treatment</title>
  <p>All PPI dispensing events collected during the pre-epidemic and epidemic periods (segments A to B and B to D, respectively) were extracted from the database and analyzed (segment D to E represents the postepidemic period). Assuming that 4 PPI dispensing events have been observed for this patient during these periods, the PPI days’ supply (DS; DS1, DS2, DS3, and DS4; the blue areas) was estimated for each of these dispensing events. A 5-day grace period between 2 successive dispensing events (yellow areas) was allowed before the treatment was considered interrupted. Criterion 1 is the persistence criterion in which there was no PPI therapy discontinuation (ie, all yellow areas are ≤5 days). Criterion 2 is the adherence criterion in which the medication possession ratio (MPR) is greater than or equal to 1, where MPR = (DS1 + DS2 + DS3 + DS4) / the number of days observed. The number of days observed is the number of days between the first PPI dispensing event observed and the end of the epidemic period. Criterion 3 is the adherence criterion in which MPR is greater than or equal to 1, where MPR = (DS1 + DS2 + DS3) / the number of days between the first and the last refill observed.</p>
