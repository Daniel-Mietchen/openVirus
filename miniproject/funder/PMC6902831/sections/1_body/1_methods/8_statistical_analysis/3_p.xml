<p>Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for the overall study population and for the age groups 0 to 14 years, 15 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or older. To assess whether the association between continuous PPI therapy and the occurrence of AGE during winter epidemic periods varied according to age, formal tests for interaction between exposure status and age group were conducted, using the analysis of deviance. The number needed to harm was estimated as the inverse of the absolute risk increase.
