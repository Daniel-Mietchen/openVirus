<p>The study was performed using data collected during the 2015 to 2016 winter season, which was cut into 3 subperiods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="zoi190614f1">Figure 1</xref>): an epidemic period (ie, a 5-week period centered around the week with the highest AGE incidence), a pre-epidemic period (ie, the 100 days before the AGE epidemic period), and a postepidemic period (ie, the 100 days after the AGE epidemic period). These periods were defined on the basis of data collected by the Sentinelles network,

 </sup> a national surveillance network through which approximately 2% of French general practitioners voluntarily monitor several health indicators in primary care, including AGE. During the 2015 to 2016 winter season, the highest AGE incidence estimated from the Sentinelles data was observed in 2016 week 3, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization.

 </sup> Thus, the epidemic period lasted from 2016 week 1 to 2016 week 5 (ie, from January 4, 2016, to February 7, 2016); the pre-epidemic period lasted from September 26, 2015, to January 3, 2016; and the postepidemic period lasted from February 8, 2016, to May 17, 2016.
