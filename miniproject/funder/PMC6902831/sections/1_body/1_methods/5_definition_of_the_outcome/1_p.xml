<p>The outcome of interest was the occurrence of at least 1 AGE episode during the epidemic period. It was coded as a binary variable (≥ 1 AGE case vs none). The detection of AGE episodes from prescribed drug dispensing data was done by using an algorithm that identifies drug dispensing events corresponding to AGE treatments, taking into account patient characteristics, the delay between the prescription and drug dispensing event, and the type, number, and quantity of drugs dispensed.

 </sup> The types of drugs potentially prescribed to treat an AGE episode included oral rehydration salts, antiemetics, probiotic antidiarrheals, intestinal antipropulsives, intestinal absorbents, intestinal anti-infectious agents, and antispasmodic agents. Coprescriptions of these drugs and antibiotics, antineoplastic agents used in cancer therapy, gastric antacids, drugs used for inflammatory bowel diseases, or antiemetics in injectable form were considered to treat a disease other than AGE. This algorithm and the considered drug lists have been fully described and validated in a previous study
