 </sup>: a persistence criterion implying no PPI therapy discontinuation (ie, the delay between any 2 successive dispensing events did not exceed the days’ supply estimated for the first dispensing event plus a grace period of 5 days), an adherence criterion based on the medication possession ratio (estimated as the total PPI days’ supply dispensed divided by the number of days observed), and another adherence criterion based on the medication possession ratio (estimated as the total PPI days’ supply dispensed, excluding the last refill, divided by the number of days between the first and the last refill). The PPI days’ supply dispensed was estimated as the dispensed quantity divided by the daily dose recommended in the drug monograph for the main indication for an adult. Each adherence criterion was fulfilled if the corresponding medication possession ratio was greater than or equal to 1.
