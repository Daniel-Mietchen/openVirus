<p>The population eligible for the study included all patients with at least 1 drug dispensing event recorded during each of the pre- and postepidemic periods, documented year of birth and sex, and an identifiable regular panel pharmacy (ie, predominantly frequented by the patient during the study period) situated in continental France. These conditions were imposed to reduce the risk of including patients who died or migrated to a nonpanel pharmacy before or during the epidemic period.</p>
