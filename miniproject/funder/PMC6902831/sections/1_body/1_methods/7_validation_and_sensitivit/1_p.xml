<p>The study was replicated for the 2016 to 2017 AGE winter season to check the reproducibility of results. Three sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, to investigate the presence of a potential selection bias related to past PPI use, the analyses were performed using a restricted population among exposed and unexposed patients: recent PPI users (ie, no PPI dispensing events recorded in the database earlier than 180 days before the pre-epidemic period) and never PPI users (ie, with no PPI dispensing events ever recorded in the database), respectively. Second, the analyses were performed using a relaxed persistence criterion: the time lag between 2 subsequent PPI dispensing events should not exceed twice the days’ supply estimated for the first dispensing event plus a grace period of 5 days. This criterion accounts for the winter holidays, which may affect an individual’s drug refill habits. Third, an analysis evaluating the association between AGE and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, another acid-suppression medication less potent than PPI, was performed using the same methods.</p>
