<p>Continuous exposure to PPI therapy among individuals aged 45 years and older was associated with an increased risk of developing AGE during periods of highest circulation of enteric viruses. Despite the limitations related to exposure and outcome ascertainment and potential residual confounding, the results reported in this study support the hypothesis that continuous PPI use is associated with an increased risk of infections with enteric viruses and motivate the need for further studies to confirm this association and investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms.</p>
