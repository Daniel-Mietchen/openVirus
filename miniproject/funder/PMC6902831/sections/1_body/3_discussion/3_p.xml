<p>Most studies investigating the association between PPI exposure and infectious gastroenteritis have focused on adult populations, which are the most exposed to PPI. Less is known about this association in the youngest populations, for whom the highest AGE incidence is usually observed.

 </sup> The current study was performed in the overall population, including children and young adults. No association between continuous PPI use and AGE occurrence was observed in the main analysis for patients younger than 45 years. However, continuous PPI use is less common in these age groups. They represented less than 5% of the exposed population identified in the database. Thus, the results regarding these subgroups should be interpreted with caution.
