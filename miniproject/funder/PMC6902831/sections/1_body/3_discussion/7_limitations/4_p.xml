<p>Fifth, information on additional potential confounders or effect modifiers (eg, sociodemographic characteristics, food consumption, potentially contagious contacts, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption) were not available. Only the comorbidities whose treatment rely on disease-specific drug classes could be measured and accounted for. They were indeed more frequent in PPI users. These comorbidities could result in more-frequent contact with the health care system and, thus, a greater likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for AGE; patients who are not as ill may not seek medical care for viral gastroenteritis. Thus, the presence of comorbidities might be a confounder of the investigated association, on which the models were adjusted. Imbalances observed between exposed and unexposed patients for the measured confounders may also be present in other unmeasured confounding factors. However, the association estimated in this study was significant (particularly among elderly patients), and it remained relatively stable after adjustment for the measured confounders.</p>
