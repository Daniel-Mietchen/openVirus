<p>The study has several limitations, mainly related to PPI exposure and AGE status ascertainment. First, diagnoses were not available, and ascertainment of the AGE status relied solely on drug dispensing data. The drugs used to treat AGE are not disease specific, and treatment indication depends on patient characteristics. To overcome this limitation, AGE episodes were identified on the basis of a previously validated algorithm.

 </sup> In addition, to reduce the risk of misclassifying other chronic diseases as AGE episodes, patients for whom the algorithm detected more than 4 AGE episodes were excluded from the analysis.
