<p>Formal tests for interaction showed that the studied association varied with the patientâ€™s age. Patients aged 45 years and older receiving continuous PPI therapy had a significantly higher risk of developing AGE during periods of circulation of enteric viruses compared with those not using PPI therapy. No significant association was observed among younger patients. The pathogens causing viral enteric infections are different according to age groups: the norovirus is predominantly responsible for winter AGE in adult populations, but children are mostly infected with the rotavirus.
