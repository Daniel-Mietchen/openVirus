<p>Another strength of this study is the use of a strict definition of exposure, based on 3 restrictive adherence and persistence criteria. Because PPI treatment coverage was estimated according to the dose recommended in the drug monograph for the main indication for an adult, misclassification of exposure status may still occur, particularly among children, for whom dosage depends on age and weight. However, such misclassification of exposure, if any, would tend toward classifying actual continuous PPI users as occasional PPI users and excluding them from the study, rather than the opposite, which would bias toward the null.</p>
