<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association between continuous PPI use and the occurrence of AGE during winter epidemics of viral AGE in ambulatory care. The main strength of this study is the use of a nationwide database of pharmacies, capturing approximately 30% of the French population. Among the patients eligible for the study from this database, 28.5% had at least 1 PPI dispensing event, and 2.9% were receiving continuous PPI therapy. These figures are consistent with administrative data on PPI use in the whole French population.
