<p>Observational studies based on nationwide databases provide valuable estimates of the association between continuous PPI therapy and potential adverse events. More studies in different settings are needed to confirm the association reported here. Investigating the dose-response relationship and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the interaction between PPI use and the risk of contracting enteric viruses may help infer a causal association.</p>
