<p>At least 1 AGE episode was observed during the epidemic period for 3131 continuous PPI users (1.3%) compared with 4327 non–PPI users (0.7%). All RRs estimated from the primary analysis and PPI sensitivity analyses are reported in 
 <xref rid="zoi190614t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk of AGE was significantly higher among continuous PPI users compared with non–PPI users, all age groups considered (adjusted RR [aRR], 1.81; 95% CI, 1.72-1.90) and among age groups 45 to 64 years (aRR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.54-1.80), 65 to 74 years (aRR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.98-2.42), and 75 years and older (aRR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.82-2.15). No significant association was observed in age groups 0 to 14 years and 15 to 44 years. Those age groups represented less than 5% of the exposed population identified in the database. A significant interaction between exposure status and age was observed (
 <italic>P</italic> for interaction &lt; .01). The estimated number needed to harm was 153, all ages considered. The significantly increased risk of AGE associated with continuous PPI therapy was consistent across validation and sensitivity analyses, with aRRs ranging from 1.68 (95% CI, 1.44-1.94) to 1.89 (95% CI, 1.82-1.97) overall, from 1.63 (95% CI, 1.25-2.14) to 1.80 (95% CI, 1.69-1.92) among those aged 45 to 64 years, from 1.90 (95% CI, 1.73-2.09) to 2.24 (95% CI, 1.60-3.14) among those aged 65 to 74 years, and from 1.80 (95% CI, 1.67-1.94) to 1.99 (95% CI, 1.86-2.13) among those aged 75 years and older.
