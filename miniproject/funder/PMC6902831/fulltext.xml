Coprescriptions of these drugs and antibiotics, antineoplastic agents used in cancer therapy, gastric antacids, drugs used for inflammatory bowel diseases, or antiemetics in injectable form were considered to treat a disease other than AGE. This algorithm and the considered drug lists have been fully described and validated in a previous study<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> that showed a strong overall agreement between the weekly AGE incidence estimated from the LTD drug dispensing database and the weekly AGE incidence estimated using clinical data collected at the Sentinelles network during winter seasons (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.84). The agreement was strong in all age subgroups; the highest correlation was observed among adults aged 15 to 64 years (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.87) and the lowest among elderly patients (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.75).<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>Patients whose AGE status could not be determined were excluded from the study.

Three sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, to investigate the presence of a potential selection bias related to past PPI use, the analyses were performed using a restricted population among exposed and unexposed patients: recent PPI users (ie, no PPI dispensing events recorded in the database earlier than 180 days before the pre-epidemic period) and never PPI users (ie, with no PPI dispensing events ever recorded in the database), respectively. Second, the analyses were performed using a relaxed persistence criterion: the time lag between 2 subsequent PPI dispensing events should not exceed twice the days&#x02019; supply estimated for the first dispensing event plus a grace period of 5 days. This criterion accounts for the winter holidays, which may affect an individual&#x02019;s drug refill habits. Third, an analysis evaluating the association between AGE and histamine 2 receptor antagonists, another acid-suppression medication less potent than PPI, was performed using the same methods.</p></sec><sec id="H2-8-ZOI190614"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Non&#x02013;PPI users were frequency matched to the continuous PPI users by groups of exact year of birth, sex, and identifiable regular panel pharmacy, using random sampling with no replacement for a ratio of 3 non&#x02013;PPI users to 1 continuous PPI user. When 3:1 matches were not available, all available matches for the group were included.</p><p>To limit the risk of including patients with erroneous records, those with extreme values of the number of prescriptions or dispensing events were excluded from the analysis. Extreme values were defined as those over the third quartile plus thrice the interquartile range.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Log-binomial regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for the overall study population and for the age groups 0 to 14 years, 15 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or older. To assess whether the association between continuous PPI therapy and the occurrence of AGE during winter epidemic periods varied according to age, formal tests for interaction between exposure status and age group were conducted, using the analysis of deviance.

A significant overall association was found between the continuous use of histamine 2 receptor antagonists and AGE occurrence (aRR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.27-3.39). Samples sizes were too small for age subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec id="H1-4-ZOI190614"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study based on a large nationwide drug dispensing database, the exposure to continuous PPI therapy was associated with an increased risk of AGE occurring during periods of circulation of enteric viruses. Under the assumption of a causal association, 1 additional patient could have AGE during winter epidemic periods for 153 patients receiving continuous PPI therapy.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the association between continuous PPI use and the occurrence of AGE during winter epidemics of viral AGE in ambulatory care. The main strength of this study is the use of a nationwide database of pharmacies, capturing approximately 30% of the French population. Among the patients eligible for the study from this database, 28.5% had at least 1 PPI dispensing event, and 2.9% were receiving continuous PPI therapy. These figures are consistent with administrative data on PPI use in the whole French population.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>Most studies investigating the association between PPI exposure and infectious gastroenteritis have focused on adult populations, which are the most exposed to PPI. Less is known about this association in the youngest populations, for whom the highest AGE incidence is usually observed.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The current study was performed in the overall population, including children and young adults. No association between continuous PPI use and AGE occurrence was observed in the main analysis for patients younger than 45 years. However, continuous PPI use is less common in these age groups. They represented less than 5% of the exposed population identified in the database. Thus, the results regarding these subgroups should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Another strength of this study is the use of a strict definition of exposure, based on 3 restrictive adherence and persistence criteria. Because PPI treatment coverage was estimated according to the dose recommended in the drug monograph for the main indication for an adult, misclassification of exposure status may still occur, particularly among children, for whom dosage depends on age and weight. However, such misclassification of exposure, if any, would tend toward classifying actual continuous PPI users as occasional PPI users and excluding them from the study, rather than the opposite, which would bias toward the null.</p><sec id="H2-9-ZOI190614"><title>Interpretation of Results and Comparison With Previous Studies</title><p>Results reported in this study are in line with those reported in a Swedish study<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> investigating the association between PPI use and norovirus infection in hospitalized adults (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.07-2.81). Compared with the Swedish study, the current study was performed using community data and relied on a large sample, including young children.</p><p>Formal tests for interaction showed that the studied association varied with the patient&#x02019;s age. Patients aged 45 years and older receiving continuous PPI therapy had a significantly higher risk of developing AGE during periods of circulation of enteric viruses compared with those not using PPI therapy. No significant association was observed among younger patients. The pathogens causing viral enteric infections are different according to age groups: the norovirus is predominantly responsible for winter AGE in adult populations, but children are mostly infected with the rotavirus.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190614r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> This could contribute to the different results observed across age groups.</p><p>Although the pathophysiological association between PPI use and viral enteric infections is still unclear, it has been shown that PPI use induces changes in the gut microbiome and that microbiota changes can affect enteric virus pathogenesis, suggesting a possible biological association.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190614r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> A direct effect of gastric acid suppression on the risk of enteric viral infections seems plausible, because the same association was observed between histamine 2 receptor antagonists and AGE.</p></sec><sec id="H2-10-ZOI190614"><title>Research and Clinical Perspectives</title><p>Observational studies based on nationwide databases provide valuable estimates of the association between continuous PPI therapy and potential adverse events. More studies in different settings are needed to confirm the association reported here. Investigating the dose-response relationship and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the interaction between PPI use and the risk of contracting enteric viruses may help infer a causal association.</p><p>One-half of continuous PPI prescriptions are inappropriate.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Associations such as those reported in this study are yet another reason to reexamine unnecessary and non&#x02013;evidence-based indications for PPI therapy. As regions head into enteric viral infection season, this would be an opportune time to reassess the ongoing need for PPI therapy in patients, especially older adults, and potentially deprescribe.</p></sec><sec id="H2-11-ZOI190614"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has several limitations, mainly related to PPI exposure and AGE status ascertainment. First, diagnoses were not available, and ascertainment of the AGE status relied solely on drug dispensing data. The drugs used to treat AGE are not disease specific, and treatment indication depends on patient characteristics. To overcome this limitation, AGE episodes were identified on the basis of a previously validated algorithm.<sup><xref rid="zoi190614r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="zoi190614r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In addition, to reduce the risk of misclassifying other chronic diseases as AGE episodes, patients for whom the algorithm detected more than 4 AGE episodes were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Second, the actual PPI doses were unavailable, and a dose-response relationship could not be investigated. Third, there is a risk of incomplete follow-up, which may result in misclassification of outcome or exposure status. This may occur if patients alternate between panel and nonpanel pharmacies, if PPI or AGE drugs are purchased over the counter (which is possible in France), or if patients receive non&#x02013;ambulatory care prescriptions. However, to be included in the study, patients were required to have had at least 1 drug dispensing event in the pre-epidemic period and 1 in the postepidemic period and an identifiable regular panel pharmacy.</p><p>Fourth, the use of a strict exposure definition may have resulted in the exclusion of a population receiving continuous PPI therapy that did not conform to the criteria considered in this study. The sensitivity analysis based on a relaxed persistence definition yielded results similar to the main analysis, suggesting that such selection bias, if any, was limited.</p><p>Fifth, information on additional potential confounders or effect modifiers (eg, sociodemographic characteristics, food consumption, potentially contagious contacts, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption) were not available. Only the comorbidities whose treatment rely on disease-specific drug classes could be measured and accounted for. They were indeed more frequent in PPI users. These comorbidities could result in more-frequent contact with the health care system and, thus, a greater likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for AGE; patients who are not as ill may not seek medical care for viral gastroenteritis. Thus, the presence of comorbidities might be a confounder of the investigated association, on which the models were adjusted. Imbalances observed between exposed and unexposed patients for the measured confounders may also be present in other unmeasured confounding factors. However, the association estimated in this study was significant (particularly among elderly patients), and it remained relatively stable after adjustment for the measured confounders.</p><p>Sixth, even though patients with antibiotics prescribed along with AGE drugs were not counted as AGE cases, other antibiotic dispensing events were not taken into account. Seventh, confounding by indication cannot be ruled out, but we could not find any published evidence linking AGE risk and disorders for which PPIs are indicated (eg, gastroesophageal reflux or peptic ulcer disease).</p></sec></sec><sec id="H1-5-ZOI190614"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Continuous exposure to PPI therapy among individuals aged 45 years and older was associated with an increased risk of developing AGE during periods of highest circulation of enteric viruses. Despite the limitations related to exposure and outcome ascertainment and potential residual confounding, the results reported in this study support the hypothesis that continuous PPI use is associated with an increased risk of infections with enteric viruses and motivate the need for further studies to confirm this association and investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="REF-ZOI190614"><title>References</title><ref id="zoi190614r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name name-style="western"><surname>Maes</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Fixen</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Linnebur</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name></person-group>
