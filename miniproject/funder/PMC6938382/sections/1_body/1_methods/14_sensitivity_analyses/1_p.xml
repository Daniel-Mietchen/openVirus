<p>To test the dependence of our results to parameter values, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses in which we altered or removed parameters. For these sensitivity analyses, we focused on the TasP target (
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub> value) needed to reduce long-term incidence (i.e., incidence 20â€“25 years after the start of the TasP campaign) 20-fold compared to a no-ART control. In preliminary work, we found that this 20-fold reduction allows for more meaningful comparisons than an absolute cutoff (e.g., incidence less than 0.1 infections/100 person-years) because parameter changes can dramatically change the baseline incidence rate. Given our 2% annual post-TasP increase in viral suppression, we found in preliminary work that a 20-fold reduction in incidence led to eventual viral eradication in all of the scenarios studied here. For sensitivity tests in which the parameter perturbation resulted in a substantially weakened epidemic, we increased an unrelated parameter (baseline transmission rate) to create a more realistic epidemic and reduce run-to-run variation.
