<p>As a part of these sensitivity analyses, we explored the effect of allowing 10% of treated individuals to discontinue treatment each year [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We did not include this in the default model because members of a target group who discontinue ART are more likely to be relinked to care than those who are not. This effect could, in principle, cycle an increasing percentage of people into the target group into ART as people outside the target group drop out.
