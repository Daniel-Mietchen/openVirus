<p>For the simulations with “sudden” pre-TasP rollouts, we quantified impacts as a function of 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub>, the percent of infected people linked to effective care in response to the TasP campaign. We note that 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>targ</italic>
 </sub> gives the percentage of HIV+ people receiving suppressive therapy at a single point in time (i.e., just after the TasP target has been hit). For a TasP campaign that succeeds in reducing the number of untreated people, the percentage of HIV+ people receiving ART will exceed 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>targ</italic>
 </sub> as the treatment expands at the annual post-TasP rate, 
 <italic>r</italic>. For a TasP campaign that fails to reduce the number of untreated people, the percentage of HIV+ people receiving ART will remain at or fall below 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub> depending on how fast the epidemic expands compared to the post-TasP expansion rate 
 <italic>r</italic>.
