<p>In the era of test-and-treat, the treatment strategies employed in Sub-Saharan African countries now most closely reflect the randomized treatment model we use in the United States. We included two additional non-random strategies, SPVL- and CD4-based targeting in order to understand how age-based strategies perform against other strategies that have the potential to outperform random (untargeted) TasP. Doing so allows us to separate the general effect of having a structured, targeted campaign from the specific effects of focusing on younger age groups. We are aware that SPVL, as defined in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, has never been used and that CD4-based targeting, while once used, is no longer recommended. We are, furthermore, aware that “CD4&lt;500” and “SPVL”, respectively, assume access to information that will be inconsistently or rarely available.
