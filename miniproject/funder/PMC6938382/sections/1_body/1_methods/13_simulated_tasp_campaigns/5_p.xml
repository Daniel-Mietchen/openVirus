<p>For each value of 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub>, we quantified the impact of TasP campaigns using: mean incidence 20â€“25 years after campaign initiation; the total number of AIDS deaths and person-years of therapy during the first 25 years of the campaign; the percentage of the population initiating suppressive ART that was 
 <italic>not</italic> a part of a target group; and the percentage of untargeted infected people receiving suppressive ART. Since strategies that do not suppress viral load in a significant percentage of people outside the target group could be considered unethical, we used the two last measures as screening tools to help us decide which strategies to investigate in more detail.
