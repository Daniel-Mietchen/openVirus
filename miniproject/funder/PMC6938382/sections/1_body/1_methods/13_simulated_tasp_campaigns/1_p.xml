<p>Following the pre-TasP ART rollout, we introduced a targeted TasP campaign that increases the number of HIV+ people receiving suppressive ART ~2-fold to 
 <italic>S</italic>

 <sub>0</sub> is the number of infected people at the start of the TasP campaign. (This will be an exact doubling if the number of infected people does not change between the start of the pre-TasP rollout and the start of the TasP campaign). To allow us to make more precise statements about the percentage of people treated, we stipulated for our default runs that the TasP campaign was implemented instantly (as we did for the pre-TasP rollout). After the TasP target has been hit, the 
 <italic>absolute number</italic> of individuals receiving suppressive ART was assumed to grow annually at rate 
 <italic>r</italic> (default 2% per year) to account for population growth and general increases in public health expenditures. That is, we capped the number of people receiving ART at
