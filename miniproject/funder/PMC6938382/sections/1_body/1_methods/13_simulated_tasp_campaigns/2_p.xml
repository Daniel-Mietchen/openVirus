<p>Under the targeted TasP campaigns, different categories of individuals were targeted for linkage to effective care in different scenarios. Targeting strategies included: age (e.g. “under age 25”), immunological status (e.g., “CD4&lt;500”), combinations of age and immunological status (e.g., “Under 25, CD4 &lt; 500”), viral load (e.g., “SPVL”), and no targeting at all (“random”) (

Several of the strategies include a targeting hierarchy within the primary target range. “Under age 30”, for example, targets those under age 25 first, and then those between ages 25 and 30. In these cases, agents are linked to care at random within each successive target group until the overall treatment limit is reached. To ensure that equal numbers are treated under all strategies (prior to one strategy linking 100% of people to effective care), all strategies included a final “random” (untargeted) component that is applied once all of the people in the target groups have been linked to effective care.
