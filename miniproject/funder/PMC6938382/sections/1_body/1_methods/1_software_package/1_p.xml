 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/EvoNetHIV" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://github.com/EvoNetHIV</ext-link>), a stochastic, agent-based HIV epidemic model that accounts for a broad set of virological, immunological, behavioral, and epidemiological phenomena [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Each agent has attributes such as age, sex, HIV status, viral load, CD4 count (discretized into 5 bins), and HIV diagnosis status. Partnership lists and agent attributes (such as viral load and CD4 counts) were updated sequentially each day. The formation and dissolution of sexual partnerships were modeled using separable temporal exponential random graph model (STERGM) terms [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since the model accounts for changes in behavior with age (e.g., young people having shorter relationships and preferentially forming attachments with other young people) and infection status (e.g., AIDS patients dying and/or having lower probabilities of sex) the model can be classified as a time-evolving adaptive network. The R package includes modules for HIV testing; viral load changes within hosts; age-dependent relationship durations; age- and viral load-dependent CD4 decline; CD4-dependent probabilities of sex; the effect of treatment on viral load; age- and diagnosis-dependent condom use; and age-, sex-, condom-, circumcision-, and viral load-dependent transmission rates. Different modules (sexual relational formation, viral load updates, etc.) were updated sequentially each time step.
