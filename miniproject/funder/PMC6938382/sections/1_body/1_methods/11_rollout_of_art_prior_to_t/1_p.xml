<p>To establish the presence of suppressive ART in the population prior to our targeted TasP campaign, we modeled both gradual and sudden rollout schemes where the number of people receiving suppressive ART increases linearly from zero treated, starting either 9 years (gradual) or 1 year (sudden) prior to the targeted TasP campaign, to

The “/2” in the equation above signifies that the subsequent TasP campaign will roughly double the number of people receiving suppressive therapy in our model. Under both the gradual and sudden pre-TasP rollout schemes, random subsets of agents received suppressive ART. While gradual rollouts are more realistic, sudden rollouts allow for more precise statements about the percentage of people receiving ART at the start of the TasP campaign. That is, under a gradual rollout, the percent of people receiving ART prior to the TasP campaign is a complex function of other dynamic variables (e.g., the age distribution and the percentage of people in the two relationship-length groups). We focused, therefore, on sudden pre-TasP rollouts for summary figures with
