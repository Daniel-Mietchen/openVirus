<p>To represent age-disparate relationships, we added a network term that pushes the average age difference between men and women to equal a specified value (default: women partner with men who are, on average, 4 years older [

To mimic the tendency of people to partner with others who are about the same age, we added an additional term that forces the average age difference in the population (after adjusting for the average male-female age difference) to equal a specified value (default 4 years). With these default values, 20-year-old women will typically partner with men between 20 and 28. In
