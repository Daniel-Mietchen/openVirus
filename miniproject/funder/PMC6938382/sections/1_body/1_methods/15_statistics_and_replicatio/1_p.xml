<p>Error bars in the figures represent standard deviations using

 <italic>n</italic> is the number of replicates. Experiments shown in the figures and tables were replicated either 16 (default) or 32 (marked by ++ signs in the summary table below) times. For some of the experiments described in the text, we replicated the simulation 120 times.
