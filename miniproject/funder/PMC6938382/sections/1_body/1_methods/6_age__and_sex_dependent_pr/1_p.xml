<p>We assumed that women have a higher (default 2-fold) per act probability of infection [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] used in our previous studies [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we also assumed that the relative per-act risk of transmission is higher when the susceptible partner is young (default: RR 1.492 for each decade under 46).
