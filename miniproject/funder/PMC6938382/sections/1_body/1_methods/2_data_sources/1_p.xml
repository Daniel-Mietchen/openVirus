<p>We have derived most of the parameters from studies of sub-Saharan countries (mainly South Africa); however, we have used parameters from other regions when they were of significantly better quality and/or more applicable to our model. We give more details about data sources, algorithms, and network estimation procedures in the Supplemental Methods.</p>
