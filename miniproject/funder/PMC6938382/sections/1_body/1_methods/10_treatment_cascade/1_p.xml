<p>We assume a certain percentage of the population (default 95%) is linkable; i.e., could become virally suppressed in response to a TasP campaign. We assumed that 100% of the linkable population is tested annually but only a subset of diagnosed people, the size of which we vary in our simulations, were linked to effective care, resulting in a suppressed viral load. In our default runs, individuals remained in care indefinitely even if they were originally linked to care due to a factor (e.g., youth) that no longer applies.</p>
