<p>We are aware that our age-specific relationship terms provide but a loose approximation to a broad, but heterogeneous (and potentially unreliable) swath of data. Nguyen 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], for example, show that estimates can vary 3-fold depending on methods used to analyze the data. Fortunately, we are able to show below that our main results do not depend on the exact values. Rather than trying to create a more complex model or trying to fit of this model to additional data, we have elected to stick with these approximate values and then examine the effect of changing the relationship duration terms in sensitivity tests (including tests in relationship durations are assumed to be completely independent of age).
