<p>To approximate the tendency of young people to have short-term relationships [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we divided the population into two groups: agents in group 1 (primarily composed of young people) tend to form short-term partnerships (default 2 years), agents in group 2 (primarily composed older people) tend to form long-term partnerships (default 10 years). We assumed that 90% of agents entering the sexually active population at age 16 belong to group 1. Agents in group 1 (median age 27) were assumed to have a small probability (default 0.00011 per day = ~5.5% per year) of transitioning to group 2 (median age 44). That is, agents exhibit a tendency to have longer partnerships as they age. These values were chosen so that the mean duration for people under 25 will approximate the midpoint of estimates in refs [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and so that the ratio of the number partners per unit time for people under 25 to those over 40 is consistent with refs 23–26 (however, see below for caveats). Relationships between people from different groups were assumed to break up each day with probability 1/(365*
 <italic>AveDur</italic>), where 
 <italic>AveDur</italic> is the geometric mean of each partner’s duration tendency. Use of the geometric mean (i.e., the square root of the product) means that relationship durations are determined more strongly by the partner with the shorter relationship tendency. With the parameters given above, relationships will last an average of ~6 years in a typical simulation, with ~40% and ~60% of agents, respectively, belonging to groups 1 and 2.
