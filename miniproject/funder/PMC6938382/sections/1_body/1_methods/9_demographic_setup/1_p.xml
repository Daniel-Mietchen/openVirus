<p>HIV-negative people were assumed to enter the sexually active population in our model at age 16 and die of natural causes according to age-specific mortality tables; the arrival rate was set so that the population will increase by ~1% per year in the absence of HIV-induced mortality. We set the initial age distribution so that the age distribution will be stable in the absence of HIV-induced mortality. Because our TERGM-based network model is computationally time-consuming, we set the initial population size (
 <italic>N</italic>) to 2,000. Simulations yielding interesting or important results were then re-run with 
 <italic>N</italic> = 10,000 or 20,000. Since key transmission rate parameters, such as the average number of partners per person, are independent of population size for sexually transmitted diseases [
