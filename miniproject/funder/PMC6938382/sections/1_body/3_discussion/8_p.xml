 <italic>et al</italic>. proposed their models when public health officials had just introduced the 90-90-90 concept. In the time that has elapsed since their papers, public health officials have since introduced the 95-95-95 concept, a level of suppression what would be well within the ~80% linkage to care that optimizes age-based TasP in our model. In other words, we have taken an aspirational approach that asks what it would take to end the epidemic rather than accept the

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 20) our model accounts for the potential for youth-focused TasP to dampen spread by selecting for less virulent viruses (since young people are less likely to have died from high SPVL viruses prior to the TasP campaign).
