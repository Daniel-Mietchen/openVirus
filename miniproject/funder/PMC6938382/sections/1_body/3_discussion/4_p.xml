<p>Within the context of our general population heterosexual model and our goal of reducing incidence (but not prevalence) to zero, youth-focused TasP yielded the largest benefits in simulations with treatment coverage under ~70% (i.e., at levels below those that would be attained under UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals for 2020). At higher levels, incidence could be driven to negligible levels under all strategies considered here. However, there are reasons to expect that youth-focused TasP could be beneficial even in regions that have met or are on target to meet 90-90-90 goals. For populations in which virus spreads rapidly, the 73% viral suppression conferred by 90-90-90 may not be enough to drive incidence to zero. In fact, our simulations show that in the presence of a subpopulation of people with very short relationship durations that no amount of youth- or adult-focused treatment could end the epidemic despite annual testing (

Even in populations in which 90-90-90 is sufficient, it may be hard to sustain treatment services for the full 50–60 years needed to eradicate the virus from the population (i.e., to get to the point where there are no sexually active infected people left in the population). At any time during this period,

These and other considerations (e.g., uncertainties in funding; lack of an effective vaccine) dictate that public health officials should consider additional efficacies that modelers identify and demonstrate as robust in the context of broader ethical and logistical considerations identified by other stakeholders.
