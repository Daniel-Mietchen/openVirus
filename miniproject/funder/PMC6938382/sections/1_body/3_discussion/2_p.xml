<p>Our model does not include MSM, PWID, people with very high mean degrees (e.g. sex workers), entry of HIV+ people from other regions, and people infected with drug resistant viruses. We decided against including these groups for two reasons. First, for the sub-Saharan countries with the highest HIV-1 prevalence, HIV is predominately spread via heterosexual contact (thus reducing the need to include MSM and PWID). Second, we wanted to establish the effects of youth-focused TasP in a population with a minimum number of non-age-specific complications. Had we created a comprehensive model that included all of these groups, we would likely have ended with a complex multi-part recommendation that could have obscured the significant and potentially unique role that untreated young people play in sustaining transmission within heterosexual populations with risk characteristics of the general population. That said, we did perform supplemental sensitivity analyses showing that age-based TasP can significantly outperform untargeted TasP in the presence of both an age-independent high-risk group (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 3) and an age-dependent high-risk group (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbations 4 and 5). While these perturbation analyses were limited, they show that the model is not overtly sensitive to the presence of high-risk groups. The model also includes sex-specific concurrency terms that cause a higher proportion of men to have concurrent partners than women. In combination with our term for age-disparate male-female relationships, this parameter increases the proportion of men having concurrent relationships with younger women.
