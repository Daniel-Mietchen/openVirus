<p>We note that predicted inter-infection times, furthermore, tend to be shorter (mean &lt; 22 months) in MSM-dominated cohorts [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] than in our heterosexual model (mean ~2.4 years). Indeed, Yousef et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] estimated an inter-infection time of ~6 months in an MSM-dominated transmission cluster; i.e., an inter-infection time that is considerably shorter than the typical time from infection to diagnosis. In populations like this, it is conceivable that no amount of TasP (regardless of the strategy) will be enough control the epidemic. In such cases, TasP would need to be combined with other strategies (e.g., PrEP).
