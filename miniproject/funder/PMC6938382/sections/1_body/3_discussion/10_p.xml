<p>There are, of course, many additional details concerning age-related infection risks that could potentially impact the effectiveness of age-based treatment. Brewis and Meyer [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], for example, suggest the overall reduction in coital frequency with age is a result of strong reductions in coital frequency with age in males masking an underlying tendency for coital frequency to peak around age 29 in females. A more detailed coital frequency function could, in principle, capture this and other complexities (e.g., the effect of partnership duration on the probability of coitus) described in the sexual behavior literature. Similar complexities exist with parameters for age-dependent relationship durations, and per-act probabilities of transmissions. Our finding, however, that youth-focused TasP continues to provide large benefits in variants of the model in which key age-related parameters were completely removed indicates robustness of the model to these potential complications.
