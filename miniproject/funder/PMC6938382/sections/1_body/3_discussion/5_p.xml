<p>We had expected that setting a higher age target for men might benefit the population by protecting young women partnered with older men. However, our “men under 30, women under 25” strategy was not measurably better at reducing long term incidence than our “under age 25” and “under age 30” strategies, or one that included a higher target for women (“men under 25, women under 30"). Sex-stratified age targeting conferred few long-term benefits because treatment of young people extends to older people over time. A strategy that treated all infected women under 25, for example, would, in the absence of drop outs, cover a significant percentage of women under 30 after 5 years. While we leave open the possibility that more extensive investigations with a more detailed model will show a benefit to sex-specific age targeting, we expect any such benefits to be small compared to the large benefits that accrue to straightforward age-based targeting.</p>
