<p>Given the inverse correlation between HIV viral load and CD4 counts we had also expected that previously used CD4-based targeting would reduce incidence compared to random (untargeted) TasP. Our simulations, however, showed, if anything, slightly worse long-term outcomes under CD4-based targeting. This can be explained, in part, by delays between infection and CD4 decline: people with low CD4 counts will, on average, be older than people with high CD4 counts. Another factor is that our model accounts for reductions in sexual activity in late-stage AIDS. CD4-based targeting, therefore, channels a greater percentage of "resources" to people who would otherwise be non-infectious due to illness. However, we severely doubt that treatment of end-stage AIDS patients (i.e., patients who are most likely to seek out care) would negatively affect the percentage of non-AIDS patients who receive therapy in real-life. The slightly worse performance of the CD4-based strategies, therefore, is, in part, an artifact of the way we set up the comparisons in our model.</p>
