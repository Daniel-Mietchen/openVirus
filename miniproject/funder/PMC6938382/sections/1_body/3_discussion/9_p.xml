<p>Because of the way we set up our comparisons, we believe that our model provides a clearer illustration of the potential of youth-focused treatment and prevention services than previous studies. Our model is also backed by extensive sensitivity analyses designed to identify the key factors responsible for the success of age-based TasP. Our model, furthermore, takes advantages of an established and well-reviewed set of social network routines that preserve key features of the network over time. Although somewhat tangential to our main hypothesis, the ability to preserve network features contributes interesting and potentially explanatory details; for example, we noted that the increase in prevalence in

 <italic>’s</italic> models, however, have other strengths. Bershteyn 
 <italic>et al</italic>., for example, include a greater variety of relationships, while Alsallaq 
 <italic>et al</italic>. include cost and quality life-year calculations that we have not incorporated in our model. Although we differ in the magnitude of the benefit, the fact that independently derived models that include different levels of detail and methods of analysis all show advantages to age-based HIV treatment and prevention services lends support to our findings.
