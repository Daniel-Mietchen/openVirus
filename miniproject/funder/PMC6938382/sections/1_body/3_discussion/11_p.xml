<p>While we used time-dependent treatment limits (i.e., we assumed a “zero-sum” game) to ensure a fair comparison of strategies in the simulations, this should in no way be taken to argue for redistributing HIV/AIDS resources from “old” to “young” PLHIV (or from AIDS patients to non-AIDS patients) in order to “more efficiently” end the epidemic. We argue instead for expanded funding and efforts to increase care and treatment for all ages and CD4 counts.

Giving extra attention to youth-centered testing and treatment services could therefore be an equitable means of bringing the epidemic to an end in the context of an overall expansion of care. Attention to HIV infection in youth may take on a particular urgency in low- and middle- income countries where a looming demographic 'youth bulge’ [
