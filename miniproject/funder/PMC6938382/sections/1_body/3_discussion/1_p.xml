<p>Within a heterosexual epidemic with ordinary risk behaviors, our model shows that age-based TasP can halve the percentage of people that need to be virally suppressed in order to reduce HIV incidence to negligible levels. Benefits to youth-focused TasP were obtained in scenarios in which each of the age-related risk factors (e.g. shorter relationship durations in young people) were removed, in scenarios where the male-female age difference was doubled, and in scenarios in which only ~60% of people could be linked to care given a sufficiently vigorous TasP campaign. These benefits were not due to age-based TasP treating more people over time. In fact, for TasP campaigns treating more than ~50% of infected people, age-based TasP typically reduced the total number of person-years of therapy relative to untargeted TasP (Figs

Age-related homophily is important because, in its presence, treatment of young people provides age-specific herd immunity (ASHI) that protects adolescents entering the sexually active population (a concept referred to as “ring immunity” by Bershteyn

Protection of these adolescents will, in turn, translate to protection for subsequent cohorts of adolescents entering the sexually active population. Over time, ASHI gives rise to an ever-expanding “AIDS-free generation” that drives HIV to extinction.
