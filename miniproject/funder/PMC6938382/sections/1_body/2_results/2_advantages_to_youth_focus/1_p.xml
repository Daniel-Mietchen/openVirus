<p>We compared age-based TasP strategies to untargeted TasP (random), a theoretical strategy (SPVL-based) and a historical (CD4-based) strategy (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for definitions). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2</xref> we show the number of infected, the number treated, incidence, and AIDS death rates under the “CD4&lt;500”, “random”, and “under age 30” targeting strategies in a simulation in which ~60% of infected people received suppressive therapy as a result of the TasP campaign. In contrast to the “CD4&lt;500” strategy and random (untargeted) TasP, where the final mean incidences were ~0.65 and ~0.3, respectively, incidence in the “under age 30” strategy dropped to less than 0.1 infections/100 person-years in all (16/16) replicate simulations ~15 years after the start of the TasP campaign.
