<p>The increase in prevalence under the "CD4&lt;500" targeting strategy in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2A</xref> is due primarily to HIV-infected people living longer and the failure of this strategy to reduce incidence to zero. However, we note that demographic shifts (AIDS deaths reducing the number of people between ages 30 and 50) also contribute to increasing prevalence in this and other simulations. This attrition increases the proportion of people who have a higher risk of getting infected (i.e., young adults) in the first 20 years of the TasP campaign. Also, because our baseline model includes comparatively favorable conditions for the spread of virus, the average SPVL increases by about ~0.1 logs between years 0 and 20 (due to a well-known evolutionary tradeoff verified in earlier versions of our software [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). This small increase in the average SPVL contributes somewhat to the increasing prevalence during this period.
