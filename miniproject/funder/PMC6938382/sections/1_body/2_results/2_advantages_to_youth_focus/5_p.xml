 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> also show that the benefit of age-based targeting depends on the percentage of the overall population that can be virally suppressed. For high levels of suppression (

 </sub> &gt; = 80%), the advantage to age-based targeting largely disappears. A similar effect can be seen using our alternative (gradual) rollout strategy in which the number of people being treated increases linearly with time: age-based targeting is highly effective when rollouts are slow or moderate (
