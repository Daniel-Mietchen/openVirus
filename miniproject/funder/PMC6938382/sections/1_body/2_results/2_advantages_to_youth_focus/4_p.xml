 <sub>targ</sub> (percent infected people linked to effective care in response to the TasP campaign) demonstrating the range of scenarios over which age-based strategies convey an advantage. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3A</xref> (average incidence 20–25 years after implementing the TasP campaign) shows that 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>targ</italic>
 </sub> had to be set to 70% and 80%, respectively, to reduce incidence rates to negligible levels for the “random” and “CD4&lt;500” targeting strategies. Under the age-based targeting strategies, by contrast, incidence could be reduced to negligible levels using 
 <italic>S</italic>

  <italic>targ</italic>
 </sub> values of 40% to 60%. Age-based strategies also resulted in fewer AIDS deaths over 25 years than random or “CD4&lt;500” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). The SPVL strategy gave results comparable to the age-based strategies for

 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub> &lt; 50%. With the exception of the “CD4&lt;500” strategy, which resulted in more person-years of therapy for

 <sub>targ</sub> between 60 and 80%, the total number of person-years of treatment over the course of the simulation was similar for all strategies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). This shows that the success of the age-based strategies is not due to these strategies treating more people. In particular, it shows that this success is not due to the longer lifespan of younger people starting therapy (relative to old people starting therapy) increasing the number of person years of therapy.
