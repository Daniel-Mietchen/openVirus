<p>The purple lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref> give the percent of the population that was treated specifically due to their having CD4 counts below 500 and being under age 30, respectively. For the “Under age 30” strategy, the percent of treated people who were treated specifically due to being &lt;30 peaked at ~38% after ~6 years, then declined slowly to ~32% at year 15 (after which ~100% of people were virally suppressed). For the “CD4&lt;500” strategy, the percent of treated people who were treated specifically due to having a low CD4 count increased monotonically from ~44% at year 1 to ~83% at year 25. This indicates that the “under age 30” strategy succeeded in reducing incidence despite being significantly less exclusionary that the historical “CD4&lt;500” strategy.
