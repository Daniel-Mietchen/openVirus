<p>Our base model gives a pre-TasP epidemic that reproduces broad features of sub-Saharan African epidemics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], namely: an initial prevalence of ~10% and a decline in incidence, though not necessarily prevalence, following a ramp-up in treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>, years -0 to 10). Prior to the TasP campaign reducing incidence, the model predicts 2- to 3-fold higher prevalence in young women than young men and higher prevalence in people between 25 and 50 than in people under 25 or over 50, as reported by Shisana
