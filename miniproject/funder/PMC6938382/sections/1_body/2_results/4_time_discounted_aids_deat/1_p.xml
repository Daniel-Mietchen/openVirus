<p>While age-based targeting greatly reduces the number of deaths over the long-term, it comes at the cost of slightly more AIDS deaths relative to CD4-based targeting in the years immediately following the TasP campaign (as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2I</xref>). This tradeoff can be quantified using time-discounted AIDS deaths; i.e., a measure of AIDS deaths that gives less weight to future deaths than current deaths. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007561.s007">S6 Fig</xref>, we show that, for discount rates between 0 and 7% per year, age-based targeting reduces time-discounted AIDS deaths compared to the other strategies in
