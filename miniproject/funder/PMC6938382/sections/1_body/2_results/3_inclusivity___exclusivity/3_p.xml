 </sub> in that it quantifies “inclusivity” at a single point in time (i.e., just after the TasP target has been hit). For TasP campaigns that reduced prevalence, the percentage of 
 <italic>untargeted infected individuals receiving suppressive therapy</italic> increased over time (as can be inferred from the narrowing difference between the red and blue lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, for the TasP campaigns that failed to reduce prevalence, the percentage of untargeted individuals receiving suppressive therapy either decreased or remained roughly constant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2C</xref> before prevalence flattened around year 20) or in subsequent years. In other words, the successful TasP campaigns became more inclusionary over time, while unsuccessful TasP campaigns either became more exclusionary or retained similar levels of inclusivity over time.
