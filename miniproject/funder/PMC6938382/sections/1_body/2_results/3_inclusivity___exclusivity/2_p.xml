 </sub> = 60% and the “under age 25” strategy, for example, ~87% of people initiating suppressive therapy at the start of TasP campaign fell outside the target group—a result that can be attributed to there being relatively few HIV+ people under the age of 25. For the “under age 30”, “under age 35”, “SPVL”, and “CD4&lt;500” strategies, the percentages outside the targeted group were 58%, 35%, 7% and 0%, respectively (

If we were to include people who were virally suppressed prior to the TasP campaign, the percentage of treated people who were not a member of the target group for the “under age 25”, “under age 30” “under age 35”, “SPVL”, and “CD4&lt;500” strategies, would jump slightly (to ~90%, ~70%, ~50%, ~25%, and ~10%, respectively). In subsequent simulations, we focus mainly on comparing the “under age 25” and “under age 30” strategies and variants thereof with the “random” and/or “CD4&lt;500” strategies.
