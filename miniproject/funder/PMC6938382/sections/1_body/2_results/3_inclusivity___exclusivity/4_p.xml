<p>Fortunately, our simulations suggest that one will not have to wait long to find out whether a campaign will succeed. For the successful “under age 30” strategy shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2</xref>, for example, we observed a ~2-fold drop in incidence within 2 years of starting the TasP campaign. While drops in incidence are unlikely to be as rapid under more realistic scale-ups, incidence is a highly sensitive measure that can, with the aid of an epidemiological model, predict whether an in-progress TasP campaign is likely to reduce prevalence. In cases where incidence cannot easily be calculated, age-based TasP can be assessed from HIV prevalence in cohorts of young people who become sexually active after starting the TasP campaign. For our “under age 30” strategy in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g002">Fig 2</xref>, for example, we observed a 4.8-fold drop in prevalence in those under 25 six years into the TasP campaign.
