 <sub>targ</sub> above a specific threshold (given by points in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3D</xref> in which the lines intersect the 
 <italic>x</italic>-axis) result in treatment being directed almost entirely to people outside the target group. For the “under age 25” and “under age 30” strategies we observed continued benefits (e.g., reductions in AIDS deaths) as

 <sub>targ</sub> increased beyond this threshold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). For the “under age 25” strategy in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, for example, we observed lower incidence and fewer AIDS deaths for

 <sub>targ</sub> = 20% than for 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub> = 10% (the value of 
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>targ</sub> at which all reachable agents under the age of 25 have been linked to care). While not surprising, this is important for broader discussions about age-based TasP (see last paragraph of
