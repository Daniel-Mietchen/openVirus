<p>Our analyses have focused so far on strategies that consider age, sex, and CD4 status in isolation. We also studied strategies that integrated these in various combinations. Although we hypothesized that combining age and CD4 status for targeting might yield even better results than either factor in isolation, we did not see any clear advantages to strategies combining “under age 25” and either “CD4&lt;500” or “CD4&lt;200.” (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007561.s008">S7 Fig</xref>) that we switched to “CD4&lt;200”-age hybrids.] CD4-based strategies that utilized age as a secondary criterion performed about the same as those that used only CD4 status, while age-based strategies that utilized CD4 status as a secondary strategy performed about as well as strategies that used only age (
