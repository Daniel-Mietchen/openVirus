<p>However, when we pushed incidence even higher by reducing relationship durations in both groups and increasing the proportion of agents in group 1 (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 6), we found that none of the strategies could reduce incidence to zero despite 100% of eligible agents (i.e., 95% of all agents) receiving suppressive therapy. While incidence was unrealistically high, this establishes that TasP (age-based or not) is not assured of controlling the epidemic.
