<p>To test the extent to which our results depend on parameter values and functional forms, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses in which we altered parameters identified 
 <italic>a priori</italic> as being likely to contribute to the success of age-based TasP targeting (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">methods</xref> for details). In 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, we demonstrate continued benefits of age-based targeting when: (i) the probability of transmission was increased; (ii) all agents have the same average relationship duration; (iii) young and old people have the same coital frequency; (iv) young people no longer have a higher per-act risk of infection; (v) the average age difference between male and female partners increased to 8 years; (vi) the average difference in ages after accounting for the male-female age difference has increased to 8 years; (vii) the age-related homophily term was removed in its entirety so that young people no longer preferentially form relationships with other young people; (viii) the percentage of people who could potentially be linked to HIV-1 treatment services was decreased; (viii) testing rates were varied; (ix), treated people have a small per-day probability of discontinuing treatment; (x) all agents have the same SPVL, and (xi) in a triple-perturbation experiment in which relationship durations, transmission rates, and probabilities of coitus were all independent of age (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 14) (though in this case only "Under age 30" and "Under age 35" performed substantially better than untargeted TasP). We also observed benefits to age-based TasP when condom use was independent of age, though this is not surprising since our baseline model assumes that young people use condoms more often.
