<p>The largest and most informative reductions in the efficacy of age-based TasP relative to random (untargeted) TasP occurred in perturbations in which we removed the age-related homophily term (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbations 13 and 15) and in which we reduced the maximum percentage of people who could be linked to care to 60–70% (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbations 17 and 18 and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We note that neither age-based homophily nor overall linkage to care directly affects the susceptibility of a young person. Instead, they affect the probability that a young person’s

Together these results point to a substantial contribution of age-specific herd immunity (ASHI) to the success of age-based TasP: in order for ASHI to work, a sufficient percentage of the partners of HIV- adolescents entering the sexually active population need to be virally suppressed.
