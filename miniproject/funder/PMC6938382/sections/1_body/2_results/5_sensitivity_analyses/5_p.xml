<p>Contrary to our initial expectations, SPVL variation had little effect on the efficacy of age-based TasP (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 20). We found that untreated HIV+ people under the age of 30 have SPVLs that are roughly double those of untreated HIV+ people over 50, an increase that should translate to ~25% increase in the infectivity of untreated young people. However, this is proved to be fairly small compared to other age-based risks shown to have modest effects in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The probability of sex, for example, will be roughly halved by age 50, and yet we continued to a large advantage to age-based TasP when the term for age-based coital frequency was removed from the model (
