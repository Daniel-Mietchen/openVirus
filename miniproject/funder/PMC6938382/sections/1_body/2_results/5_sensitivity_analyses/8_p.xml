 <sub>targ</sub> &lt; 55 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g005">Fig 5</xref>, final incidence and total AIDS deaths continued to be lower for the age-based strategies than for our “random” and “CD4&lt;500” strategies. For some of these simulations, “SPVL” (which doesn’t depend on ASHI) reduced final incidence and AIDS deaths more than "under age 25” for selected

 <sub>targ</sub> values. However, we have not considered “SPVL” further because it is, as defined in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, a theoretical strategy introduced for purposes of comparison. “SPVL” furthermore did not perform as well as “under age 30” in our baseline simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007561.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), and is considerably more restrictive (Figs
