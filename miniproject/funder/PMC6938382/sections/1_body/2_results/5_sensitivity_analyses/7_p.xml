<p>While decreasing the maximum percentage of people who could be linked to care reduced the efficacy of age-based TasP, we found it remarkable that age-based TasP could succeed (albeit not as dramatically) in a model in which only 60% to 70% of agents could be linked to care (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbations 17 and 18). Three factors that contributed to this success. First, the percentage of people who are not linkable decreases over time in the face of HIV-induced mortality. Second, and more interestingly, surviving HIV+ people who are not linkable became less infectious over time due to increases in their average age (since age-based TasP reduces incidence in young people) and reductions in their average viral load (since people infected with high SPVL viruses die sooner in the absence of therapy).
