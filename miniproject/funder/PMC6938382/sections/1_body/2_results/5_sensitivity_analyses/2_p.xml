<p>To keep our focus on normal age-related risks, we did not include a very-high-risk group in our base model. To explore the effect of adding a "very-high-risk" group to our model, we did a series of perturbation experiments in which we manipulated relationship durations for groups 1 and 2, made these groups age-independent, and/or changed the proportion of agents in the two groups. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> (perturbations 3â€“6) gives some representative results. We found that age-based TasP greatly outperformed random (untargeted) TasP when members of group 1 have very high risks and do not transition to group 2 (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 3), as well as when a greater percentage of people belong to group 1 and in which a group 1 has moderately or greatly elevated risks (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbations 4 and 5, respectively). (We note that the coloring in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> understates effects when percentages are high: in perturbations 4 and 5 age-based TasP doubled the number of people who did 
 <italic>not</italic> have to treated in order to drive incidence to zero.) These perturbations, therefore, show that age-based TasP can be highly effective in a model with a risk group that results in a heavy-tailed partnership-distribution curve (
