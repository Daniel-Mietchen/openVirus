<p>To address these complexities, we used an agent-based model for HIV epidemiology that accounts for SPVL variation to test the long-term effects of targeting young people for linkage to effective care in a generalized heterosexual epidemic. To keep the focus on age effects, we model a population with risk behaviors characteristic of the general population; that is, we do not explicitly model high-risk groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers, and people who inject drugs (PWIDs). The model, which utilizes established routines for the underlying social network dynamics, was parameterized to reproduce broad features of sub-Saharan HIV-1 epidemics. To create a basis for comparison, we compared age-based targeting strategies to untargeted treatment (similar to currently recommended Test and Treat) and to targeting strategies based on CD4 count (historically recommended by the UNAIDS/WHO), viral load, and combinations of CD4 and age. Because of age-disparate relationships, we also tested strategies with sex-specific age targets, hypothesizing that a higher age target for men could improve age-based TasP by protecting younger female partners.</p>
