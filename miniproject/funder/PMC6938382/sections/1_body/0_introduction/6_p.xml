<p>For any given strategy and coverage level (i.e., percent of HIV+ people who are virally suppressed after the TasP campaign), we quantified total and time-discounted AIDS deaths over 25 years, person-years of therapy over 25 years, and incidence 20â€“25 years after the start of the TasP campaign. We also measured the percentage of people who receive therapy specifically as a result of being a member of a target group (i.e., the relative inclusivity/exclusivity of the strategy). Finally, we performed sensitivity analyses in which we removed each of the age-related risk factors and altered parameters for testing rates, dropout rates, background incidence, and the percentage of people who could potentially be linked to care under a vigorous TasP campaign.</p>
