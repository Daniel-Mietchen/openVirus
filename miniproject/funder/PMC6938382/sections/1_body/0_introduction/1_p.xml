<p>Despite the scale-up of antiretroviral treatment, HIV continues to be a major source of mortality in people ages 15–24 in low- and middle-income (LMIC) countries [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This can be traced to high rates of infection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], low testing rates [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], difficulties linking young people to care [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and low treatment adherence rates compared to older people [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HIV infection is distributed unevenly between the sexes at these ages, with young women having 3- to 5-fold higher rates of infection than young men [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Higher rates of infection in young women are in part due to higher per-act probabilities of infection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and age-disparate relationships with older men [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who are more likely to be HIV positive and less likely to use condoms [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These gaps in coverage have led to numerous calls to ramp-up testing and treatment of young people [
