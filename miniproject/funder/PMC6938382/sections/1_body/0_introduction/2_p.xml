<p>Two computational models suggest that youth-focused treatment as prevention (TasP) could reduce HIV incidence and/or increase quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These models assume that young people are more likely than older people to have short-term relationships [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They also include, either implicitly [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the potential for treatment of young people to protect adolescents entering the sexually active population. Neither of these studies, however, makes a particularly strong case for youth-focused TasP. Alsallaq

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] show a small increase in cost-effectiveness of youth-focused treatment parameterized for a specific country (Kenya) and a specific set of cost values. Bershteyn 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] propose a slightly more general model that predicts stronger advantages to age-based TasP; however, they conclude with the pessimistic note that age-targeted TasP is "unlikely to eliminate HIV epidemics.” These models, however, do not account for two age-related risks: age-related declines in coital frequency within relationships [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and higher per-act rates of infection in young people [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Also, since people infected with high setpoint viral load (SPVLs) viruses (i.e., more virulent viruses) die earlier in the absence of therapy and since older HIV+ people will, on average, have been infected for a longer time, older HIV+ people may be infected with fewer high SPVL viruses before the start of a TasP campaign. This opens up the possibility that youth-focused TasP, by treating individuals infected with higher SPVLs, could select for lower SPVL viruses, a factor that could reduce incidence and HIV-related mortality over time.
