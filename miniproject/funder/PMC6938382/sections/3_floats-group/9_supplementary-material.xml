  <title>Ages of infectors of women and men under the age of 35.</title>
  <p>Each histogram shows the ages of the infectors (i.e., the ages of people who infected someone in the group shown in each histogram) in the absence of treatment. The bars show all infection events between years 0 and 5 involving infectors and recipients who were in the relevant age range at the time of infection. Each bar gives the average of 16 replicates. Red bars indicate infectors who were in the same age range as the recipients.</p>
