  <title>Cumulative distribution of partnership numbers for our baseline model and selected perturbation experiments from

  <p>The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axes give natural logarithm of the total number of partners per person for people. The 
   <italic>y</italic>-axes give the natural logarithms of cumulative distribution starting with the agent with the most partners. To reduce variation caused by young people not having as much time to form relationships as older people, we plotted distributions for people within narrow age ranges. The red circles and blue squares, respectively, show distributions for two representative age ranges: 30–32 and 50–52. The red and blue lines, respectively, show Poisson distributions with means equal to the 30–32 and 50–52 age ranges (i.e., the distributions that would result if partnership numbers were distributed at random). The five panels all show distributions from year 25 after a simulated TasP campaign with
