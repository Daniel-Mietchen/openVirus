   <bold>Simulations showing the percent of the population that is HIV+ (panels a-c, red lines), HIV+ and receiving treatment (panels a-c, blue lines), and HIV+ and receiving treatment specifically due to being part of a target group (panels a-c, purple lines); incidence (panels d-f); and AIDS death rates (panels g-h) following our “CD4&lt;500” (left-side), “random” (middle), and “under age 30” (right side) treatment-as-prevention (TasP) strategies.</bold> To account for existing treatment, we assume a linear increase in the number of people receiving suppressive therapy beginning nine years before the TasP campaign. The TasP campaign immediately increases the percentage of HIV+ people receiving therapy to ~60%. Once the TasP campaign starts, the model uses the CD4-, random- or age-based strategies to link a subset of unsuppressed diagnosed people to care. The 2%/yr increase in the number treated after the campaign reflects population growth and generalized increases in health care efficiency or expenditures. Thick lines give the mean of 16 independent replicates; thin dashed lines show individual runs. The decline in prevalence of treated people after year 15 in panel c (blue lines) occurs because prevalence decreases once all infected agents are treated. The black lines in panels h and i give the means from the CD4&lt;500 simulations in panel g (to highlight differences between short- versus long-term effects of “CD4&lt;500” and “Under age 30”). For these simulations, we set the initial population size to 20,000 to reduce run-to-run variation.
