  <title>Performance of age-based TasP in sensitivity experiment in simulations [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007561.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, perturbation 14] in which 
   <italic>all</italic> of the primary age-related risk factors except for age-related homophily were removed (i.e., in a model in which relationship durations, transmission rates, and probabilities were all independent of age).

  <p>(a) Incidence 20â€“25 years after the TasP campaign. (b) AIDS deaths between years 0 and 25. (c) Person-years of therapy. (d) Percentage of HIV+ people initiating treatment at the start of the TasP campaign who were not a member of a target group. Error bars present standard deviations based on 32 replicates.</p>
