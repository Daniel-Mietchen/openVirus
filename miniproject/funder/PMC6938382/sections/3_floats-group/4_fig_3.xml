The apparent decline in panel d between 90% and 100%, a decline not seen in other experiments, reflects statistical noise accentuated by the fact that only 95% of the population is linkable in this simulation (i.e., 
   <italic>S</italic>
   <sub>targ</sub> = 100% translating to 95% suppression). Each point is the mean of 16 replicates. Bars give standard deviations (
   <italic>SD</italic>s). For normally distributed data, 95% confidence intervals would be ~55% the width [since 
   <italic>t</italic>
   <sub>0.025,15</sub> *
   <italic>SD</italic>/sqrt(15) = ~0.55*SD]. For this simulation, we set the initial population size to 10,000. In this and subsequent figures we assumed sudden pre-TasP rollouts so that the TasP campaign will roughly double the number of virally suppressed people.
