  <title>Ages of sexually active males plotted against the age of their sexually active female partners.</title>
  <p>While the model allows for partnerships between people of different ages, the majority of people partner with someone who is about the same age after accounting for age-disparate relationships. The red line is a lowess fit to the data. The blue line is the 
   <italic>y</italic> = 
   <italic>x</italic> line that would occur if women partnered only with men who were exactly the same age. This graph shows data from a simulation in which treatment had reduced incidence to zero.
