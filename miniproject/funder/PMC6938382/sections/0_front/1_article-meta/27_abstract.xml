 <p>We used an agent-based model for heterosexual epidemics to evaluate the effects of focusing treatment-as-prevention (TasP) efforts on young people. To keep the focus on age effects, we modeled populations with average risks (i.e., no MSM, no PWIDs, no sex workers). For our baseline model, we found that a long-term TasP program that focuses on HIV+ people under the age of 30 can halve the number of people who need to be treated in order to drive incidence to zero. Within the context of an overall expansion of care, we were able to identify multiple scenarios in which a successful youth-focused TasP campaign also expanded care for older people. Interestingly, we continued to see strong advantages to age-based TasP in sensitivity tests in which we removed key age-related risks (e.g., the tendency for young people to have shorter relationships). Youth-focused TasP succeeds, in large part, because it protects HIV- adolescents entering the sexually active population; i.e., a population that would otherwise be at high risk not only for getting infected but also for spreading the virus to others. This protection of adolescents leads to a steadily expanding AIDS-free generation that drives the virus to extinction.</p>
