<p>Assessment of the quality of DNA and RNA extracted from infant food is reported in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-00506">Supplemental Table S2</xref>. DNA and RNA of 13 different types of bacterial, viral, and protozoa enteric pathogens was detected in 79 of the 127 (62%) infant weaning food samples collected over the three-month span (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00506-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The most commonly detected pathogens were 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> (20%), Enterohemorrhagic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 0157 
 <italic>(EHEC)</italic> (17%), Enteropathogenic 
 <italic>E. coli (EPEC)</italic> (17%), Enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>E. coli (ETEC)</italic> (13%), 
 <italic>Adenovirus 40/41</italic> (12%), and non-
 <italic>parvum/</italic>non-
 <italic>hominus Cryptosporidium spp</italic>. (10%), with eight other pathogens occurring in less than 10% of overall infant weaning food samples (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00506-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Infant food samples collected during March have higher raw contamination rate than food collected during January and May (90%, 52%, and 60%, respectively). ETEC and non-
 <italic>parvum</italic> or 
 <italic>hominus Cryptosporidium spp</italic> were detected frequently in January. In March, detection frequencies for Adenovirus 40/41, EPEC, EHEC 0157, STEC, EIEC/
 <italic>Shigella spp</italic>., and 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> were highest. 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> were detected frequently in May. A median of one pathogen per sample (standard deviation of 1.58; range of 0 to 9 pathogen) was detected, with 37% of foods being co-contaminated by more than one pathogen type.
