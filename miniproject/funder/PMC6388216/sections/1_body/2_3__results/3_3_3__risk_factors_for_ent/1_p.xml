<p>Food type, the infant sharing eating containers with other family members, and feces in preparation area were associated at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.3 with presence of any pathogen in the bivariate analysis, and were included in the multivariable analysis (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00506-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Sharing an eating container did not improve model fit and was removed. In the final multivariable model, cow milk was significantly more likely to contain an enteric pathogen when compared with porridge, but non-milk/porridge foods were not statistically different from porridge. Pathogens were detected twice as often in milk (95%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 19/20) as porridge (56%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 45/81) and non-milk/porridge foods (56%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 15/26). Observation of feces in preparation area was statistically associated with a lower risk of pathogen presence compared to feces not observed.
