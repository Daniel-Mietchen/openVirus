<p>One hundred and twenty-seven households (caregivers/infant dyads) participated in this study.

Most infants of caregivers were over 6 months old (76%). Among the caregivers who provided the study samples, 83% were married. Half of the caregivers (50%) had only a primary education, whereas 21% had some secondary education and 30% completed secondary education. Almost half (47%) of the caregivers who reported their employment status were unemployed (
