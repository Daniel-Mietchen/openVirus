<p>Eight community health volunteers (CHVs) who served the four neighborhoods in our study area facilitated the recruitment of participants. First, CHVs conducted a household census with the research team in December 2016 to generate a list of all infants less than nine months of age that were living in each CHVâ€™s catchment area. Then, the list of households was randomly sorted, and in January CHVs and enumerators approached each house to verify infant eligibility, obtain consent to participate in the study, and perform data collection and food sampling. CHVs maintained surveillance of their respective catchment area through May 2017 to identify new infants as they became age-eligible, and to approach their caregivers about participation in the study.</p>
