<p>Eligibility of a household was defined as having an infant between three and nine months of age, verified by reviewing the infant’s birth identity card, who was being fed supplemental food in addition to or in replacement of breastfeeding. Exclusion criteria included refusal to participate, inability to produce infant health card for verification of age, or caregiver reporting that the infant was exclusively breastfed and did not eat other food or liquid. Upon verification of eligibility and availability of food for sampling, the child’s primary caregiver provided consent to participate in the study in the presence of the CHVs. The study was described in the caregiver’s natural language, and a signed copy of the consent form was left for her records.</p>
