<p>Both sets of models followed the same two-stage process. Including all variables in the model was deemed statistically implausible due to a low events per variable ratio and convergence problems caused by sparse data for categories of some variables of interest [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the model selection process for this study was based on the Hosmer and Lemeshow method for iterative and purposeful selection of covariates [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. First, bivariate associations between environmental and behavioral risk factors were determined. Risk factors with p-values smaller than 0.30 in the bivariate testing were included in the multivariable analysis to achieve a balance between including important adjustment variables in the model versus obtaining numerically stable estimates and standard errors. We then followed a backwards selection process. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) score was noted for the model with all selected-in variables [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Then variables were removed individually, and the AIC score was recorded. Variables retained in the final models were selected based upon the model with the lowest AIC score, adjusted for educational level of the caregiver and month of sampling.
