<p>There were two primary outcomes assessed during analysis. First, a binary indicator was defined based on the presence of one or more target pathogens detected in the sample (any-path). Second, pathogen diversity was calculated by summing the total number of target pathogens types detected in the sample (sum-path). Caregiver education level and sampling month were selected a priori as potential confounders of infant health and caregiver food preparation practices [

Proposed risk factors for food contamination by enteric pathogens were selected based upon general household conditions that could lead to the introduction (e.g., animals near food, feces, flies) or sustained presence (e.g., floor type) of feces with pathogens in the food preparation and feeding area, and food-specific practices (e.g., storage container, handwashing station presence and usage) that could influence whether pathogens in the preparation and feeding areas could be introduced into food (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00506-f001">Figure 1</xref>). We documented ownership of domestic animals (yes/no) and whether animals were kept inside the household (yes/no). In food preparation and feeding areas specifically, we recorded permeable (dirt, grass) versus non-permeable (concrete, linoleum, metal) floor type, the presence of flies (yes/no), feces (yes/no), and a handwash station (yes/no). Food hygiene practices included sharing eating containers with family (yes/no) and the type of food container (bottle/jug, covered container, uncovered container, fresh food, and thermos). Food type was not specified ahead of time and was based upon whatever caregivers were feeding the child, which ultimately included cow’s milk, porridge (grains, water, and sometimes with milk), and “other” less common foods (tea, mashed potato, bread, beans). Due to infrequent (&lt;5%) detection rates for tea, water, and other foods, these types were combined into one “other” group for the single and multivariable analysis to ensure model convergence.
