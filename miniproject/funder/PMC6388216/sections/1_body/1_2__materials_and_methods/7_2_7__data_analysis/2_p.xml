<p>Analyses were completed through SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Separate generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were developed for the binary indicator of any pathogen detection (any-path model) and the pathogen diversity measures (sum-path models) to assess relationships between environmental and behavioral risk factors and primary outcomes. For the any-path model, the log link and binomial distribution specifications were used, and regression results were converted to risk ratios. For the Sum-path models, Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated negative binomial distributions were evaluated, and the log link and negative binomial distribution family was ultimately determined to best fit the distribution of outcome data. Regression results were converted to risk ratios.</p>
