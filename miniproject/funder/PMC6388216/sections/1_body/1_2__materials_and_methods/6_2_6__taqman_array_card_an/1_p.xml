<p>Primers and probes for a total number of 37 gene targets of pathogen of interest in the TaqMan assays are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-16-00506">Supplemental Table S1</xref>. The Ag-Path-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for the TaqMan card analysis. For each sample, 40 µL of re-amplified DNA/RNA extract (in 1 to 10 dilutions with nucleic acid-free water) were mixed with 50 µL of 2× RT-buffer, 4 µL of 25× AgPath enzyme, and 6 µL of nucleic acid-free water. All the TaqMan runs were completed in a ViiA7 instrument (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and the cycling conditions were: 45 °C for 20 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification of a pathogen-specific gene target was used to define a sample as positive for the presence of that pathogen. If multiple gene targets were used to detect different one type of pathogen (norovirus, Enteroaggregative

 <italic>E. coli</italic> (EPEC), Enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC), Shiga toxin-producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (STEC) amplification of either gene resulted in a sample being considered positive. Two virulence gene indicators were used to detect pathogenic bacteria on the card, so in this manuscript samples were considered positive for the overall species of bacterial pathogen if either gene was detected.
