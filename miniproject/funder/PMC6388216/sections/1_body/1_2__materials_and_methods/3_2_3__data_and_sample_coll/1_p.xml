<p>After agreeing to participate in the study, caregivers were interviewed about household status, their level of education; access to water, sanitation, and hygiene resources; and key infant weaning food preparation, storage, and feeding practices. Caregivers were then asked to provide approximately five grams of already-prepared infant food of any type fed to the child that day. The timing of food preparation for infants varied throughout the day, so the field team scheduled follow-up visits with households at times when food would be available. Food was placed into a sterile, labeled WhirlPak bag (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) by the caregivers, using whatever means (fingers, utensil) that the caregiver normally used for handling the childâ€™s food. Food was placed on ice packs in a cooler and was transported to the laboratory for processing within six hours of collection.</p>
