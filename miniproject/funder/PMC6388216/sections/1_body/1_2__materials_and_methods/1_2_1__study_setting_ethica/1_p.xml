<p>This exposure assessment study was conducted as part of formative research aimed at developing and testing an infant hygiene intervention to inform the development and evaluation of an infant weaning food hygiene intervention in Kisumu, Kenya. Kisumu is a city in the western region of Kenya, with a projected population of approximately 490,000 people by 2017 (Kisumu County Integrated Development Plan 2013â€“2017). The study site includes four villages of a low-income peri-urban neighborhood in Kisumu. This infant weaning food hygiene intervention will be evaluated as part of the Safe Start study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial (Clinical Trials identifier: NCT03468114) involving Great Lakes University of Kisumu, Kenya (GLUK), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and the University of Iowa (UI).
