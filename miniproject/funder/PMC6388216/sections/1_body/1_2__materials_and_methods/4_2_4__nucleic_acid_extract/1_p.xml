<p>All food samples were processed by following the manufacturer's instructions for the ZymoBIOMICS™ DNA/RNA extraction mini-kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) for DNA and RNA parallel purification. A 250 mg food sample was measured into the Zymo-Shield tube, vortexed until blended, and stored at 4 °C. Samples were then transported in a cooler at ambient temperature to the University of Iowa for the remainder of the extraction. A subset of samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 77) was spiked with 5 µL of 1.8 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of live bacteriophage MS2 to serve as an extrinsic process control to assess for RNA degradation as a function of storage and transport conditions. Once purified DNA/RNA was obtained, it was stored at −80 °C until further analysis.
