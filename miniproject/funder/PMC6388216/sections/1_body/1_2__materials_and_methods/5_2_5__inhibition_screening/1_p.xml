<p>DNA and RNA extracts from the samples (6 µL each) were screened for evidence of inhibition with the QuantiFast Pathogen PCR +IC Kit and QuantiFast Pathogen qRT-PCR+ IC kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a QuantStudio real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Seventy-seven samples were screened for inhibition, defined as having amplification of the RNA internal control over cycle threshold value (CT value) of 34 in a sample according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The QuantiFast Pathogen qRT-PCR +IC Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for pre-amplification PCR. For each sample, a total volume of 12 µL of DNA and RNA extract (6 µL each) was mixed with a master mix containing 5 µL of 5× Quantifast Pathogen MM, 0.25 µL of 100× Quantifast Pathogen RT Mix, 0.5 µL of 50× high ROX dye solution, 0.15 µL of ultrapure 50 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2.5 µL of 0.2× custom TaqMan pre-amplification primer and probe pool (Appendix 1), 2.5 µL of internal control assay, and 2.0 µL of internal control RNA. If extracts were determined to be inhibited during the inhibition screening, the inhibited extracts would undergo 1:10 dilution before mixing with the pre-amplification master-mix. The cycling conditions for the pre-amplification PCR were: holding stage of 50 °C for 20 min and 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 44 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s [

All the completed pre-amplified samples would undergo a 1:10 dilution with nucleic acid-free water before proceeding to TaqMan quantitative PCR card analysis.
