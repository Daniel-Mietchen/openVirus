<p>This study aimed (1) to describe the frequency and diversity in enteric pathogen contamination of infant weaning foods in low-income, neighborhoods of Kisumu, Kenya, and (2) to identity the leading environmental conditions and behaviors that contribute to pathogen presence and absence and higher pathogen diversity. The methodologies described and applied in this paper are useful for future research on foodborne illnesses in LMICs. Furthermore, our findings inform public health and healthcare professionals as a basis for prevention of pediatric diarrheal diseases in LMICs.</p>
