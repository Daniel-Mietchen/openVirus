<p>There is increasing recognition that consumption of pathogen-contaminated food is an important exposure pathway for diarrheal disease in children in LMICs [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Contaminated food causes an estimated 582 million cases of illness, death, or disability-adjusted life years each year globally, with young children and Africans bearing most of the foodborne disease burden [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The risk of diarrheal disease typically increases as infants transition from exclusive breastfeeding to consumption of weaning foods and water due to both decreases in passive protection from maternal breastmilk and more exposure to contaminated food [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many caregivers worldwide struggle to exclusively breastfeed up to six months of age, resulting in infants being provided weaning food instead of breast milk before 6 months of age [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, a premature transition from exclusive breast feeding to weaning foods may be especially important as one of the earliest causes of enteric infection [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Little is known about how often infants in LMICs are exposed to pathogens via food, and which risk factors should be targeted to reduce food-related exposure of children to enteric pathogens. In addition, infantsâ€™ diets become more diversified as they develop, and each of these additional food types may pose different exposure risks for different enteric pathogens [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More evidence is needed to understand which risk factors should be targeted to reduce food-related exposure of children to enteric pathogens in LMIC settings [
