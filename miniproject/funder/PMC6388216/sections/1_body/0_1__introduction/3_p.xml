<p>While foodborne transmission of enteric pathogens into the food supply chain is rigorously monitored in high-income countries (HICs) via regulatory authorities [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many common infant weaning foods, like cowâ€™s milk, are sourced from outside the household. Unsanitary and unregulated farm and market practices can result in contamination of milk by human or animal feces, well before entry to the household [

In addition to sub-optimal water and market food supplies, insufficient hand washing and sterilization of food preparation areas, improper cooking temperature of infant food, storage of perishable foods at ambient temperatures, and storage of food in containers open to flies [
