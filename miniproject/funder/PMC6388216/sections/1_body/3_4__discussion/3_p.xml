<p>We demonstrated that the risk of pathogen exposure for an infant can vary by type of weaning food, which has important implications for designing interventions. Cowâ€™s milk was significantly more likely to be contaminated by one or multiple types of enteric pathogens compared to other common infant foods, such as porridge. For many in urban and rural Kenya, raw milk is more affordable and accessible than pasteurized milk [
