<p>Studies vary in their conclusions as to which pathogens cause the most foodborne enteric disease in LMICs, e.g., Norovirus, 
 <italic>Campylobacter spp</italic>., 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>, ETEC, EPEC, 
 <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella spp</italic>. are all attributed with a substantial amount of foodborne illness or death [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The etiology of foodborne disease may vary year to year, or month to month as suggested by our study, which has implications for ranking the priority foodborne pathogens in settings where outbreak or food monitoring information is limited. Many types of pathogens were detected in food during our 5-month study in Kisumu, with 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> being the most common pathogen, followed by EHEC O157, ETEC and EPEC, and human adenovirus 40/41. Aeromonas is extremely common in the environment, including foods, but is not considered a priority foodborne pathogen [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, EHEC O157 is notorious as a deadly cause of foodborne epidemics, and the emergence of so many O157-positive food samples in March alone suggests potential for a foodborne outbreak. March is the onset of the rainy season in Kisumu. The increased detection of multiple pathogens during this month may reflect an influence of seasonality on foodborne transmission risks in Kenya. This foodborne danger would have been missed had we sampled in a narrower timeframe.
