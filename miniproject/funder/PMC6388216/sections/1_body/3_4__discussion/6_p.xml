<p>One of the strengths of our study is that we examined food for pathogens, rather than bacterial indicators, using rigorous microbiological protocols to ensure quality of data was preserved from field labs in Kisumu to molecular labs in Iowa. Fecal indicators, which are typically used as a proxy for determining risk from fecal pathogens, are nonspecific and often do not correlate well with viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens [

Addressing the need for information on infant food contamination in LMICs required finding an effective microbial testing method that enabled quantitative and target-specific measuring of a broad array of the most common types of diarrhea pathogens in infant food. Even though qPCR is frequently applied for the quantitative detection of pathogen presence in foodborne outbreak analysis [

 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], it has not been widely applied in food samples in LMICs. Our methods are novel in their ability to detect a wide array of pathogens simultaneously. The qPCR approach is also a limitation, since qPCR-determined concentrations may detect non-infectious organisms that cannot cause disease. We are not certain what fraction of the PCR-detected pathogens in this study were viable, viable-but-non-culturable, or dead microbial organisms. However, the distinct variability in contamination patterns in infant food and the consistency of cowâ€™s milk as a risk factor for pathogen presence suggests qPCR was a valid approach for identifying infant food risk factors.
