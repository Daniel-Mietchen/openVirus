<p>Estimates of the importance of food as an enteric infection pathway for young children in LMICs are limited by the absence of primary data on food outbreaks and frequency of food contamination by enteric pathogens, especially with respect to weaning foods provided to infants [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This study demonstrated that infants as young as three months of age in informal settlements of Kisumu ingest food contaminated by a variety of different types of enteric pathogens. Our qPCR-based enteric pathogen detection frequency of 62% is similar to what has been reported for frequency of fecal indicator bacteria in infant food in similar high disease burden settings, such as Bangladesh (40â€“58%), Indonesia (45%), South Africa (70%), India (56%), and Peru (48%) [
