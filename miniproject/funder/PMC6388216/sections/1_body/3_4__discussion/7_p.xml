<p>Several challenges had to be overcome for measuring and analyzing infant weaning food contamination in this study, challenges which apply to many LMIC settings. First, multi-target enteric pathogen detection capability is limited in LMICs due to limited laboratory facilities, requiring samples to be sent to specialized labs for precise analysis. We minimized sample degradation risks by using a ZymoBIOMICSâ„¢ DNA/RNA extraction kit that allowed us to preserve samples at ambient temperature for storage, transport, and extraction [

This makes the method more desirable for use in laboratory-limited LMICs or any field-based scenario, as samples can be shipped to an equipped laboratory for processing with ease. The high rates of recovery of MS2 virus spiked into samples before storage and transport confirmed that we experienced no loss in nucleic acid using this process. Second, the wide variety of physical and chemical properties of different food types makes optimization of microbial food testing protocols complex, especially if the goal is to measure multiple types of pathogens (

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We pre-piloted all protocols to confirm that protocols for DNA and RNA recovery of spiked pathogens was not affected by food type, then rigorously evaluated each sample for signs of inhibition prior to qPCR analysis. Low inhibition rates and low variability in MS2 Ct values across all food types showed that the Zymo extraction kit can produce high-quality nucleic acids free of inhibition from foods (

 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Third, pathogens may be present in food at concentrations that are lower than the methodological limit of detection, which results in misclassification of some pathogen-positive samples as uncontaminated. Pre-amplification increased the concentration of starting content before conducting the quantitative measurement step of PCR.
