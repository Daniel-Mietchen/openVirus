<p>After sale, household food preparation, feeding, and storage conditions can contribute to new sources of infant food contamination [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Kenya, milk is often consumed in liquid form, as well as is added to a variety of infant foods. Depending upon how the milk is provided to the infant, it may or may not receive proper treatment to eliminate microbial pathogens. If caregivers perceive milk to be safe due to prior pasteurization, they may not treat it further. In this study, we classified food by its primary ingredient, however tea and porridge (made from maize meal, sorgum meal alone, or sorgum mixed with millet meal) are also typically made with milk. If milk is added to infant foods, it may be reheated as a part of the cooking process or can be added to food after the preparation process without reheating. If the latter is more common, some of the pathogens detected in tea and porridge in this study may have come from milk sources. Milk is an optimal growth medium for bacteria, and may be particularly sensitive to cross-contamination from unclean surface, hands, and flies or uncovered and unclean containers. Public health interventions targeting safety of milk products may be particularly effective for reducing foodborne diarrheal diseases in infants in LMICs.
