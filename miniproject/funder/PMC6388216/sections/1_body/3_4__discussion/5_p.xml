<p>Household water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have been suggested as key in combating enteric pathogen transmission and infections [

While we found some domestic food hygiene risk factors were associated with enteric pathogen presence and diversity in bivariate analysis, most of these associations reduced in magnitude and did not improve model fit after adjustment for food type. Counterintuitively, observation of feces in the food preparation area—a rare situation to begin with—was associated with a lower likelihood of pathogen presence after model selection, rather than higher child food contamination as expected [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00506" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This association may be caused by unmeasured confounding factors or reactivity of some caregivers who were aware of the purpose of our visit. Timing household visits to coincide with food availability is logistically challenging unless caregivers store food for infants for prolonged periods of time. Thus, if food was not present during our first visit, we had to work carefully with households to time our follow-up visits to coincide with when they would have food for the child. Some caregivers may have reacted to the presence of feces in their preparation area before our visit and contaminated the infant’s food in the process of removing it. The inability to determine causality is a limitation of our cross-sectional design. The lack of association between other well-known risk factors of bacterial contamination in infant food could be caused by lack of statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes, although does not detract from the dominant role of food type in explaining pathogen detection. Analysis with a larger sample size are underway to improve knowledge about foodborne pathogen transmission in Kisumu.
