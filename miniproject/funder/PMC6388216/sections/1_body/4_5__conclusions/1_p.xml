<p>Foodborne disease transmission of enteric pathogens may contribute substantially to the global diarrheal disease burden, yet receives limited attention. Our evidence highlights a need for more interventions targeting safe preparation and storage of infant foods, particularly high-risk foods such as milk. The ongoing Safe Start study in Kisumu is evaluating whether behavior improvements in caregiver food preparation, feeding, and storage behaviors can reduce enterococcus contamination in infant food and enteric pathogen infections in infants during weaning. Alongside interventions aiming to improve food hygiene practices of caregivers, interventions targeting hygienic milk handling and storage at the point of sale and among manufacturers may be needed to address upstream risks. The intersecting Market to Mouth study will contribute more information about the role of locally sold milk sources on pathogen contamination of infant food and the ability of the Safe Start intervention to mitigate enteric pathogen contamination passed via the food system.</p>
