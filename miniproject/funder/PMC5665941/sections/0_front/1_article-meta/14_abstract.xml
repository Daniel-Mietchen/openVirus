 <p id="Par1">CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) are microbial nuclease systems involved in defense against phages. Bacteria also resist phages by hosting phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICI) which prevent phage reproduction. 
  <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> which causes cholera epidemics, interacts with numerous phages in the environment and in cholera patients. Although CRISPR-Cas systems are usually carried by bacteria and archea, recently 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic> specific ICP1 phages were found to host a CRISPR-Cas system that inactivates PICI-like elements (PLE) in 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic>. We analyzed a collection of phages and 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic> isolated during seasonal cholera epidemics in Bangladesh, to study the distribution, and recent evolution of the phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system. Five distinct but related phages carrying the CRISPR-Cas system, and possible CRISPR-Cas negative progenitor phages were identified. Furthermore, CRISPR arrays in the phages were found to have evolved by acquisition of new spacers targeting diverse regions of PLEs carried by the 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic> strains, enabling the phages to efficiently grow on PLE positive strains. Our results demonstrate a continuing arms-race involving genetic determinants of phage-resistance in 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic>, and the phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas system in the co-evolution of 
  <italic>V</italic>. 
  <italic>cholerae</italic> and its phages, presumably fostered by their enhanced interactions during seasonal epidemics of cholera.
