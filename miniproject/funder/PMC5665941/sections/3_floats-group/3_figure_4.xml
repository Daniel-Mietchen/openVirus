 <caption>
  <p>Genomic organization of PLE and protospacer targets of CRISPR-Cas carried by various JSF phages. PLE 1 and PLE 2 consists of 25 and 28 ORFs respectively. Unique ORFs of PLE1 and PLE2 are represented in cyan and fire brick colors respectively. ORFs of PLE1 and the corresponding ORFs of PLE2 that share similar sequences are shown in blue color. The genomic regions of PLE corresponding to spacers of different JSF phages are shown using different colors as indicated.</p>
