 <caption>
  <p>Structure of CRISPR-Cas system carried by phages JSF5, JSF6, JSF13, JSF14, JSF17, and ICP1_2005_A showing the diversity and arrangement of the spacers. The repeat (28 bp) and spacer (32 bp) are shown as green diamonds, and red rectangles respectively. An AT-rich leader sequence precedes each CRISPR locus (black rectangle). Spacers are marked with vertical, horizontal or no lines to show their 100% identity.</p>
