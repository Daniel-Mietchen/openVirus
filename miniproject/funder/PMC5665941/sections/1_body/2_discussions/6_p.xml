<p id="Par19">In summary, we have demonstrated the emerging diversity of the CRISPR-Cas system in cholera phages by acquisition of new spacers to expand their ability to counter PLE-mediated phage defense of diverse 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains. We also showed the presence of a CRISPR-Cas system in a number of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> non-O1 non-O139 strains. However, features of the CRISPR-Cas carried by the phages and that of the 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> non-O1 non-O139 strains differ considerably, and hence do not support a direct relationship in terms of their origin. On the other hand, extensive phage-bacterial interactions during seasonal epidemic cycles of cholera might have contributed to rapid evolution of the CRISPR-Cas system in phages and deviate considerably from the original source. The antagonistic interaction between a genetic determinant of phage resistance in 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic>, and the evolving phage encoded CRISPR that neutralize the bacterial defense, represent a continuing armsâ€™ contest that is occurring between 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> and its phages. In addition to a better understanding of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems in phages, these results may have relevance in developing engineered phages and strategies for phage mediated control of cholera.
