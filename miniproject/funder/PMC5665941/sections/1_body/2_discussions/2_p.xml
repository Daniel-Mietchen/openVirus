<p id="Par15">The nucleotide sequences of the spacers in a CRISPR array carried by the phages should be identical to a region (protospacer) in the target PLE responsible for interfering with reproduction of the invading phage, in order to recognize, and subsequently inactivate the function of the anti-phage system in the bacteria. The genomes of these phages carry a cluster of six 
 <italic>cas</italic> genes and two CRISPR loci, identified as a CRISPR-Cas subtype I-F system

 </sup>. A number of spacers in these CRISPR arrays are identical to sequences within the PLE resident in the 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> host genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our results further showed that the number of spacers matching the PLEs has progressively increased in phages isolated in different years. Moreover, phages with increased number of spacers were able to form more plaques on PLE positive 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains (see supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). These findings suggest that having more than one spacer targeting the PLE provides increased fitness to the phage in surviving PLE mediated elimination. Since the phages included in this study were isolated during seasonal epidemics of cholera in Bangladesh, these results provide important evidence in support of the adaptive immunity developed by phages through their resident CRISPR-Cas system under natural conditions of phage bacterial interactions, during seasonal cholera epidemics.
