 </sup>. The unique ecology and socio-economic setting in Bangladesh fostering seasonal cholera outbreaks also provide an opportunity to test predictions into the emergence, co-evolution and diversity of genetic elements involved in the “arms-race” among 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> and their phages under natural conditions. The CRISPR-Cas system has been described as a microbial adaptive immune system in that the system extends its range of targets by continually acquiring new spacers matching protospacer regions in the invading nucleic acids. The remarkable evolutionary success of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages in countering the PLE mediated defense of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> is thus expected to be sustained by further diversification of the CRISPR arrays in terms of number and variety of their spacers.
