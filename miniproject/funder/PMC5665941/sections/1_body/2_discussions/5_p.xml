<p id="Par18">The use of phages as bio-control agents in the environment or in potential phage therapy in patients requires a more clear understanding of the mechanisms causing selection of phage resistant bacteria and the co-evolution of bacteria and phages. The interactions between epidemic strains of

 <italic>cholerae</italic> and their lytic phages is known to modulate seasonal epidemics of cholera

 </sup>. Thus predatory phages can shape microbial community structure during the natural course of self-limiting epidemics. The acquisition of a CRISPR-Cas system by phages and subsequent evolution of the system to counter bacterial PLE add additional challenges in phage mediated control of cholera. However, monitoring of the CRISPR-Cas arrays in phages, and the bacterial PLE allows to understand the genetic variability and phage-bacterial co-evolution. This knowledge may be useful in designing engineered phages targeting various regions of the bacterial anti-phage genomic determinants, in potential phage therapy or environmental interventions to control cholera.
