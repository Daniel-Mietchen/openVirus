 </sup>. Interestingly, we found that all spacers in the phage-encoded CRISPR arrays target various ORFs of the PLE, and not the intergenic regions. While most of these ORFs encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function, we propose that one or more of these gene products may influence the process that restricts phage replication and involves spread of the PLEs instead of the phage genome through heterologous packaging. However, functional studies involving deletion of these target ORFs of PLE would be required to verify this assumption.
