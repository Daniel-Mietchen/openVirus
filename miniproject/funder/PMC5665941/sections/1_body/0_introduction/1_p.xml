<p id="Par2">Bacteriophages contribute to the evolution of their host bacteria in a variety of ways including promotion of genetic diversity by horizontal transfer of genes, and by providing a selective pressure for better fitness of the bacteria

 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> the causative agent of cholera epidemics interacts with numerous phages in the aquatic ecosystem, and in the intestine of cholera patients. Seasonal epidemics of cholera reportedly collapse due to predation of the pathogen by phages

Interactions of phage and bacteria may lead to the evolution of numerous phage resistance machineries and mechanisms in bacteria such as blocking of adsorption, abortive infection system, restriction modification system, and the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) system
