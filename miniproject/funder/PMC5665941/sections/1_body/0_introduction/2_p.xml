<p id="Par3">CRISPR-Cas loci in microbial hosts contain a combination of CRISPR-associated (
 <italic>cas</italic>) nuclease genes as well as genes for non-coding RNA elements capable of programming the specificity of the CRISPR-mediated nucleic acid cleavage

 </sup>. A CRISPR array consists of short direct repeats separated by different short sequences called spacers. To allow nucleic acid cleavage by the associated Cas nuclease, the non-coding CRISPR array is transcribed and cleaved within direct repeats into short crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences. The crRNAs then direct Cas nucleases to the target site (protospacer) which has a sequence complementary to the spacer sequence of the crRNA, and the Cas protein complex degrades the foreign genome in the interference stage
