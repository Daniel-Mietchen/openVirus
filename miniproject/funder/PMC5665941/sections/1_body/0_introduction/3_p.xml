<p id="Par4">Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by hosting a chromosomal island called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI), which being excised from the bacterial chromosome upon phage infection, circularizes, replicates and interferes with phage reproduction

 </sup>. The 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), which carry and spread critical virulence genes represent well studied examples of PICIs

 </sup>. Upon infection by specific helper phages, SaPIs are induced to excise from the bacterial chromosome, replicate, and package themselves to produce mature phage particles containing SaPI DNA instead of the phage genome, restricting the reproduction of the invading phage

 </sup>. Therefore, following lysis of the infected cell, SaPIs are spread to neighboring cells instead of the helper phage genome. Several strategies used by SaPIs interfere with recognition of the phage genome and its packaging into the phage capsid, and instead promote their own packaging and propagation using the helper phage. These include remodeling the phage capsid proteins to generate small capsids that can accommodate the smaller SaPI DNA and leave out the larger helper phage genome

 </sup>. The SaPIs may encode proteins that interfere with phage packaging by blocking the small subunit of phage terminase, and instead allowing the small subunit of SaPI terminase to bind the phage-encoded large subunit to cleave SaPI DNA for packaging
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Another interference mechanism involves interrupting phage late gene activation, which is essential for phage packaging and cell lysis
