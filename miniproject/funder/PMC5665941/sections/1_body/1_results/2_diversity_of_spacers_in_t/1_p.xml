<p id="Par8">The overall structure of the CRISPR-Cas loci in the five representative CRISPR-Cas positive phages resembled that of previously reported ICP1 phages
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>, with two CRISPR loci (CR1 and CR2) and 6 
 <italic>cas</italic> genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, there were differences in the sequences, as well as in number of spacers in the CRISPR array carried by various phages analyzed in the present study. Each of the phages designated JSF5 and JSF6 carried a total of 8 spacers spanning the two CRISPR loci, of which 7 spacers were reported previously in CRISPR carried by ICP1 phages
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. Although the CRISPR arrays in JSF5 and JSF6 phages were identical, their entire CRISPR-Cas regions were not identical (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each of JSF13 and JSF14 carried a total of 7 spacers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but the CRISPR array of JSF13 and JSF14 differed in the sequence of one of the spacers. Three of the spacers of JSF13, and 2 spacers of JSF14 were identical to spacers of ICP1 phages
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>
 </sup>. JSF17 was found to carry a total of 11 spacers and 4 of these were identical to spacers of ICP1 phages. Therefore, 16 of the 33 different spacers identified in the 5 phages were identical to spacers carried by the CRISPR-Cas positive ICP1 phages, whereas the remaining 17 spacers were new. Sequences of most of the spacers in the CRISPR arrays carried by the phages were identical to diverse regions (protospacers) of the two PLEs carried by

 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains (Figs

 </sup>. Notably, all identified protospacers in the PLEs were found to be located within ORFs, and not in intergenic regions. The putative proteins encoded by some of these ORFs found by BLAST or domain analysis are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) which are short conserved motifs that are present in immediate vicinity of the protospacers were identical to that of previously reported ICP1 phages
