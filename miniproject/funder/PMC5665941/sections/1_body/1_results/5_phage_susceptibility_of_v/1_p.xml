<p id="Par11">We compared the sequence of PLEs carried by various 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains and identified sequences which matched the spacer sequences in the CRISPR array carried by different phages, in an attempt to explain the observed phage-susceptibility patterns of the 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains. In this analysis, we identified multiple regions in both PLE1 and PLE2 that would be potentially targeted by the CRISPR-Cas system of different phages based on the sequence of the spacers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). In all of these instances the PLEs were targeted within one or more ORFs and not in intergenic regions. Phages JSF5 and JSF6 carried spacers which matched with 3 different loci within two ORFs in PLE1; 2 of these 3 loci were also shared by PLE2. Spacer sequences of JSF13 phage correspond to sequences within 5 different ORFs of PLE2 and one ORF of PLE1. Phage JSF14 carried spacers corresponding to sequences located within 4 different ORFs of PLE2 and 2 ORFs of PLE1, whereas JSF17 phage carried spacers matching sequences within 4 different ORFs of PLE2 and 3 ORFs of PLE1. Notably, there have been a temporal increase in number of ORFs of the two PLEs that were targeted by the CRISPR-Cas system carried by different phages. Apparently, this also increased susceptibility of the PLE positive 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains to phages carrying increasing number of spacers targeting the PLEs. Presumably, targeting multiple protospacers in PLEs might have increased the chance of cleaving the PLE DNA and thus more efficiently diminish the function of PLEs. A semi- quantitative estimate of phage susceptibility of various 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains based on plaques formed by different phages are presented in Table
