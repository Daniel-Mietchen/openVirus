 </sup>. Twenty nine representative phages which were isolated during January 2001 to November 2015, were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Analysis of the genomic sequences for the occurrence and organization of the CRISPR-Cas loci revealed the presence of CRISPR-Cas related sequences in 5 of the 29 phages (17.2%). These 5 phages were related but also had notable differences in their genomic sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also identified CRISPR-Cas negative phages with otherwise similar genomic sequence to that of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages except for the presence of the CRISPR-Cas loci (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), suggesting that the CRISPR-Cas negative phages could possibly be progenitors of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages. On the other hand, since phages also evolve by mosaicism, there may not be any direct progenitor. The genomic sequence of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages excluding the CRISPR-Cas region was between 84% and 99% identical to the whole genome sequences of 9 CRISPR-Cas negative phages (see Supplementary Table
