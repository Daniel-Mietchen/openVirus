<p id="Par13">The CRISPR-Cas region in 7 of 8 CRISPR-Cas positive non-O1 non-O139 strains sequenced in our study were found to be identical with that of strain HC-36A1 described previously

 <italic>cas</italic> genes in one of our strains 173V1015 were found to share no sequence homology with that of the other islands analyzed, although the predicted protein sequence show more than 82% identity with Cas proteins of 
 <italic>Salinivibrio costicola</italic> (Accession no. OOF32727.1, WP_077670175.1) and 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (Accession no. WP_088136878.1, WP_088136879.1, WP_088136862.1), with quarry coverage ranging from 74% to 100%. In all the islands analyzed, Integrase, CRISPR-array and Type VI secretion system genes were found to be conserved with &gt; 95% identity.
