<p id="Par10">We analyzed the susceptibility of a chronological collection of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor biotype strains isolated during different cholera epidemics in Bangladesh from 2001 through 2015 to 8 different phages. Five of these phages carried the CRISPR-Cas system whereas 3 were CRISPR-Cas negative, but otherwise similar in genomic sequence to the CRISPR-Cas positive phages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Further details on these and other phages are available in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref> (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). This analysis was done to understand possible effect of the emerging diversity in phage-encoded CRISPR-Cas structures on the susceptibility of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains with or without harboring the PLE. All 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains isolated during 2001 to 2004 were negative for PLE, and were susceptible to all 8 phages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thus the CRISPR-Cas negative phages i.e., JSF1, JSF2, and JSF4 formed clear plaques at high efficiency on the PLE negative 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains isolated during 2001 to 2004. However, with the emergence of PLE2 positive 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> isolates, the susceptibility of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> to the CRISPR-Cas negative phages diminished (see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). On the other hand, as expected CRISPR-Cas positive phages represented by JSF5 and JSF6 were able to infect and form plaques on all 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> isolates from 2001 through 2007 including those that carried PLE2 and were resistant to the CRISPR-Cas negative phages. Similarly JSF13 and JSF14 with more and diverse spacers in the CRISPR array could plaque on most 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> isolated during 2001 to 2011 including the post-2008 isolates which were positive for PLE1 and were resistant to JSF5 and JSF6 phages. With highest number of spacers in the CRISPR array, JSF17 phage infected and formed plaques on all 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> O1 El Tor isolates of 2001 through 2015 included in the study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>; see Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Notably, JSF17 continued to be one of the most prevalent phages from 2013 through 2015.
