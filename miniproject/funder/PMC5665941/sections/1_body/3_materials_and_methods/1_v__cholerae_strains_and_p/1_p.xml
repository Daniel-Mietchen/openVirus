 </sup>, and hence represented distinct groups. Phages were isolated from surface water samples in Dhaka city or stools collected anonymously from cholera victims reporting to the hospitals of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). One or more of the indicator strains including G-3669 (El Tor), P-27457 (El Tor), AI 1852 (O139), and MO1220 (O139) were used as host bacteria for purification and amplification of different phages for the present study. Phages were stored in SM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM MgSO4, 0.05 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 0.01% gelatin) at 4 °C.
