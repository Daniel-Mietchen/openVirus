 <italic>cholerae</italic> strain. For growing the phage in liquid medium, an overnight culture of the host strain was diluted 1:100 in fresh nutrient broth and grown at 37 °C for 4 h. The culture was then inoculated with phages from a single plaque. The bacterium-phage culture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, when lysis of most of the bacteria occurred. The culture was centrifuged at 10,000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size filter (Millipore). The number of phage particles in the filtered supernatant was determined by testing serial dilutions of the supernatant by the soft agar overlay method with the propagating strain. The host range for the phage was tested at a titer of 10
 <sup>3</sup> pfu/ml using a variety of bacterial strains. For a semi-quantitative comparison of susceptibility of different bacterial strains to particular phages, susceptibility was scored as −, +, + and +++, based on the number of plaques formed with an equal titer of phage particles used in the soft-agar assay.
