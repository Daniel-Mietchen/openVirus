<p id="Par24">Two different PCR assays were used for screening of 
 <italic>V</italic>. 
 <italic>cholerae</italic> strains for the presence of PLE and CRISPR-Cas related sequences. The sequence of primers used for PLE 1 were F-TGCTAGAAGCTGCCAAAGGT, and R-TTGTTGTCCAGCTTCCACTG, and those for PLE2 were F- CAACAGGAATTGCAAGCAGA, and R- CTCCAAACCTGCAAACCATT. Sequence of primers used for 
 <italic>cas1</italic> were F- GCT GGC TCT CAT TCT GGT T, and R- GCT GGC GAA ACT CTT GTT C, and those for 
 <italic>cas3</italic> were F-GCTAAACACCAGCACCACAA, and R- GCGACTTTTCATCCACCAAC. PCR amplification was performed using a Bio-Rad PCR machine, in a 25 ml reaction volume consisting of 12.5 µL Taq master mix, 0.5 µL forward primer, 0.5 µL reverse primer, 10 µL nuclease free water, 0.5 µLDMSO, and 1 µL template DNA. Thermocycle parameters for PLE PCR were 90 seconds at 95 °C for initial denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of 30 sec at 95 °C, 30 sec at 55 °C (primer annealing), and 90 sec at 72 °C; plus a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Thermocycle parameters for 
 <italic>cas1 and cas3</italic> PCR were same as above except that the annealing temperature used was 57 °C. Expected sizes of the PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis with appropriate DNA size markers using standard methods
