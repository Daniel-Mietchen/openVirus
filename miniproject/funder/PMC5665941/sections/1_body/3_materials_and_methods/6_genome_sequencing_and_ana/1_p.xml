<p id="Par25">The phage and bacterial genomes were sequenced at the icddr,b genomics centre using Illumina based technology. Genomic fragment libraries for whole-genome sequencing were prepared using Illumina Nextera® XT DNA library Preparation Kit (Cat. no, FC-131-1024) as per manufacturer’s instructions, and sequencing was conducted with Illumina Nextseq. 500 or MiSeq sequencers. FastQC tool was used to check the quality of raw sequence. Sequence reads with average quality less than Q20 were removed using Prinseq-lite v0.20.4
