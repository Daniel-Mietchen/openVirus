 </sup> was used to detect and estimate phage concentration in samples. Briefly, logarithmic-phase cells (500 µl) of a host bacterial strain in nutrient broth (Difco, Detroit, Mitch.) were mixed with 3.5 ml aliquots of soft agar (nutrient broth containing 0.8% Bactoagar, Difco), and the mixture was overlaid on nutrient agar plates. Samples tested for the presence of phages including aliquots of water, cholera stool supernatants, or bacterial culture supernatants, were pre-filtered through 0.22 μm pore size filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA) to make them bacteria-free, inoculated on the plates, and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. A sample was scored positive for phages when a plaque was observed on the bacterial lawn in the plates. Plaques were counted to estimate the concentration of phage particles in the sample.
