<p id="Par23">For isolation and analysis of phage nucleic acids, culture supernatants containing phage particles were filtered through 0.22 μm pore-sized filters (Millipore). The filtrates were mixed with one-fourth volume of a solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) and 10% NaCl, and centrifuged at 12000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> to precipitate phage particles. The precipitate was dissolved in a solution containing 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 60 mM Kcl, 10 mM MgCl, 10 mM NaCl, and digested with pancreatic DNAseI (100 units/ml) and RNAse A (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 hours. The solution was extracted with phenol-chloroform, and the total nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Phage nucleic acids were suspended in deionized water and purified using the SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega Madison, USA). The phage nucleic acid was digested with restriction endonucleases (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis following standard procedures to initially check for diversity and select different phages for sequencing.
