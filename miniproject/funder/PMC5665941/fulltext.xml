Interactions of phage and bacteria may lead to the evolution of numerous phage resistance machineries and mechanisms in bacteria such as blocking of adsorption, abortive infection system, restriction modification system, and the CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. On the other hand, phages also evolve and occasionally effectively bypass these antiviral strategies of bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">CRISPR-Cas loci in microbial hosts contain a combination of CRISPR-associated (<italic>cas</italic>) nuclease genes as well as genes for non-coding RNA elements capable of programming the specificity of the CRISPR-mediated nucleic acid cleavage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A CRISPR array consists of short direct repeats separated by different short sequences called spacers. To allow nucleic acid cleavage by the associated Cas nuclease, the non-coding CRISPR array is transcribed and cleaved within direct repeats into short crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences. The crRNAs then direct Cas nucleases to the target site (protospacer) which has a sequence complementary to the spacer sequence of the crRNA, and the Cas protein complex degrades the foreign genome in the interference stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by hosting a chromosomal island called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI), which being excised from the bacterial chromosome upon phage infection, circularizes, replicates and interferes with phage reproduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), which carry and spread critical virulence genes represent well studied examples of PICIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Upon infection by specific helper phages, SaPIs are induced to excise from the bacterial chromosome, replicate, and package themselves to produce mature phage particles containing SaPI DNA instead of the phage genome, restricting the reproduction of the invading phage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, following lysis of the infected cell, SaPIs are spread to neighboring cells instead of the helper phage genome. Several strategies used by SaPIs interfere with recognition of the phage genome and its packaging into the phage capsid, and instead promote their own packaging and propagation using the helper phage. These include remodeling the phage capsid proteins to generate small capsids that can accommodate the smaller SaPI DNA and leave out the larger helper phage genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The SaPIs may encode proteins that interfere with phage packaging by blocking the small subunit of phage terminase, and instead allowing the small subunit of SaPI terminase to bind the phage-encoded large subunit to cleave SaPI DNA for packaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Another interference mechanism involves interrupting phage late gene activation, which is essential for phage packaging and cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">

PLE activity was shown to reduce phage genome replication and accelerate cell lysis following infection by ICP1 phages, thus killing infected cells and preventing the production of progeny phage.

Twenty nine representative phages which were isolated during January 2001 to November 2015, were subjected to whole genome sequencing. Analysis of the genomic sequences for the occurrence and organization of the CRISPR-Cas loci revealed the presence of CRISPR-Cas related sequences in 5 of the 29 phages (17.2%). These 5 phages were related but also had notable differences in their genomic sequence (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We also identified CRISPR-Cas negative phages with otherwise similar genomic sequence to that of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages except for the presence of the CRISPR-Cas loci (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), suggesting that the CRISPR-Cas negative phages could possibly be progenitors of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages. On the other hand, since phages also evolve by mosaicism, there may not be any direct progenitor. The genomic sequence of the CRISPR-Cas positive phages excluding the CRISPR-Cas region was between 84% and 99% identical to the whole genome sequences of 9 CRISPR-Cas negative phages (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

However, there were differences in the sequences, as well as in number of spacers in the CRISPR array carried by various phages analyzed in the present study.

Although the CRISPR arrays in JSF5 and JSF6 phages were identical, their entire CRISPR-Cas regions were not identical (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each of JSF13 and JSF14 carried a total of 7 spacers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but the CRISPR array of JSF13 and JSF14 differed in the sequence of one of the spacers. Three of the spacers of JSF13, and 2 spacers of JSF14 were identical to spacers of ICP1 phages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. JSF17 was found to carry a total of 11 spacers and 4 of these were identical to spacers of ICP1 phages. Therefore, 16 of the 33 different spacers identified in the 5 phages were identical to spacers carried by the CRISPR-Cas positive ICP1 phages, whereas the remaining 17 spacers were new.

The CRISPR-Cas system has been described as a microbial adaptive immune system in that the system extends its range of targets by continually acquiring new spacers matching protospacer regions in the invading nucleic acids.
