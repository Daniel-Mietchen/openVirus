  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the NV viral protein 1 major capsid gene. Nucleotide sequences spanning nucleotides 5081–5362 (length = 282 nt) of NVs isolated in Hohhot were aligned with reference strains obtained from GenBank. The reference strains of Hohhot NoV strains from 2008 to 2010 are GenBank acc. Nos. MK319151–MK319216 and MK319301–MK319330. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the nucleotide sequences using the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates using MEGA ver. 7.0. Bootstrap values &gt; 75% are shown</p>
