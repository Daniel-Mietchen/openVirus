<p id="Par20">Overall, the NV positivity rate was 24.15% (450/1863). From 2012 to 2017, NV positivity ranged from 17.94 to 32.92%. The highest positivity was observed in 2015 (Table

Of NV AGE, 14% occurred before the age of 3 months. By the age of 24 months, nearly 97% of NV-positive cases had occurred. The cumulative NV-positive rate by age indicated that 0–23 months was the main age group for NV infection (Fig.
