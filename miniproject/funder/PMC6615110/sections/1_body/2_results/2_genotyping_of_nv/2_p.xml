<p id="Par23">The analysis of the 296 sequences of both the RdRp and capsid genes showed that at least 11 RdRp/capsid NV genotypes circulated in Hohhot during the last 6â€‰years (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The most common genotype was the GII.12/GII.3 recombinant (69.6%), followed by the GII.Pe/GII.4 (13.2%) and GII.P4/GII.4 (9.8%) recombinants. The remaining identified recombinant genotypes (GII.P16/GII.2, GII.P12/GII.4, GII.P16/GII.4, GII.P4/GII.3, GII.P16/GII.13, GII.P12/GII.13, GII.P12/GII.12, and GII.P22/GII.5) were uncommon.
