<p id="Par22">Of the 450 NV-positive samples, 332 (74%) were genotyped. NV geno-grouping revealed that all belonged to GII and none belonged to GI. Of the 332 genotyped samples, both the RdRp and capsid genes were genotyped in 296 samples, only the RdRp gene was determined in 26 samples, and only the capsid gene in 10 samples. Based on the capsid gene, strain GII.3 was predominant with 71.24% (218/306) prevalence, followed by strains GII.4 (23.53%, 72/306), GII.2 (2.61%, 8/306), GII.13 (1.63%, 5/306), GII.6 (0.65, 2/306), and GII.5 (0.33%, 1/306). Based on the RdRp gene, GII.P12 was most prevalent at 71.42% (230/322), followed by GII. Pe (12.42%, 32/322), GII.P4 (11.18%, 36/322), GII.P16 (4.04%, 13/322), GII.P7 (0.62%, 2/322), and GII.P22 (0.31%, 1/322).</p>
