<p id="Par26">In Hohhot, GII.4 was the second-most dominant genotype from 2012 to 2017, accounting for 34, 22, 24, 23, 27, and 12% in the respective years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). During the study period, three variants of the GII.4 genotype were identified. Fourteen identified GII.4 strains were clustered closely with the GII.4/2006b variant, sharing 98.1–100% identity with the AB291542/GII.4/Kobe034/2006/JAN strain. Fifty-six identified with the GII.4/Sydney 2012 variants and shared 98.1–100% identity with the JX459908/GII.4/Sydney/2012/AU strain. Two were the GII.4/New Orleans 2009 variant, sharing 99.3 and 99.7% with the KX354038/GII.4/New Oreans/2009/US strain, respectively. We obtained 61 reference sequences of Hohhot NV GII.4 strains from 2008 to 2010 in GenBank (acc. no. MK319151–MK319171, MK319176–MK319214, and MK319215–MK319216), 59 of which belonged to the GII.4/2006b variant, and 2 to the GII.4/New Orleans 2009 variant. In 2012, the predominant strain was the GII.4/2006b variant, but after 2013, the GII.4/Sydney 2012 variant replaced the GII.4/2006b variant as the epidemic strain, and the GII.4/2006b variant was not detected. Based on the RdRp genotype (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the GII.4/2006b variant was detected in combination with GII.P4; the GII.4/Sydney 2012 variant was detected in combination with GII. Pe, GII.P4, GII.P12, and GII.P6; and the GII.4/New Orleans 2009 variant was detected in combination with GII.P4.
