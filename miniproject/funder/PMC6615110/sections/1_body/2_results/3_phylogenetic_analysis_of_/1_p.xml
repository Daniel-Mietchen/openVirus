<p id="Par25">In Hohhot, GII.3 was the predominant genotype from 2012 to 2017, accounting for 58, 78, 76, 75, 71, and 74% in the respective years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial capsid gene sequences demonstrated that all of the Hohhot GII.3 strains (
 <italic>n</italic> = 248) grouped into two clusters (I and II) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We obtained 30 reference sequences of Hohhot NoV GII3 strains from 2008 to 2010 in GenBank (acc. no. MK319301–MK319330), which belong to GII.3/cluster I. Whereas the GII.3/cluster II strain was the main epidemic strain in 2012–2014, GII.3/cluster I was not detected. Nevertheless, in 2015, the GII.3/cluster I strain began to re-emerge and became common simultaneously with the GII.3/cluster II strain. From 2016 to 2017, the former became the main epidemic strain and the latter was not detected. Based on the RdRp genotype (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), the GII.3/cluster I and GII.3/cluster II strains were both detected in combination with GII.P12 and GII.P4, and the latter was detected in combination with GII. Pe and GII.P6.
