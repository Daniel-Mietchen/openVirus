<p id="Par33">We found high NV prevalence in children younger than 5â€‰years in Hohhot who were hospitalized for AGE. GII.3 NV was identified as the most common cause of AGE from 2012 to 2017, and circulating genotypes changed over time with the emergence of new genetic variants. Continuous monitoring with molecular genotyping is necessary for NV diseases in children and will be helpful for the local control and prevention of AGE.</p>
