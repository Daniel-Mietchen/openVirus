<p id="Par27">In the present study, we conducted long-term surveillance for NV-associated gastroenteritis in hospitalized children younger than 5 years of age in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. From 2012 to 2017, the NV positivity rate was 24.15% in Hohhot, which was close to that in Wuhan (2007–2010, 25.9%), but higher than that in other parts of China [

Furthermore, 93% (1741/1863) of AGE cases were children aged 0 to 23 months, and NV positivity was higher in the 0–23-month age group than in children older than 24 months, which implies that young children are more vulnerable to NV infection. This result is consistent with previous studies [
