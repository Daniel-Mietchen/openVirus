<p id="Par32">NV recombination was genetically characterized via analysis of regions from both the capsid gene and RdRp gene. In our study, lacking the overlap genes from the RdRp and VP1 regions, the NV recombinants were not conformed and may actually have come from two different coinfecting NV genotypes. However, since 2018, a conventional RT-PCR, as developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) (J. Vinj√©, pers. comm., 2017 Mar 1, [
