<p id="Par30">Furthermore, a broad genetic diversity of NV GII 4 genotypes among children hospitalized for AGE was found in Hohhot. From 2006 to 2011, the GII.4/2006b variant was the predominant cause of sporadic NV cases and outbreaks in China and Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, this strain was replaced by the GII.4/Sydney 2012 strain in October 2012, and this strain caused a worldwide increase in NV outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. GII.4/Sydney 2012 was first identified in Australia, France, and New Zealand, and subsequently isolated in the United States, Belgium, Denmark, Scotland, Japan, and China. Of note, after 2012, the GII.4/Sydney 2012 variant was the dominant epidemic strain in Hohhot and most other regions of China, both in sporadic NV cases and NV outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Previous studies show GII.4 usually caused epidemics in adult populations, whereas GII.3 NV was prevalent in young children and infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The reasons for the difference between GII.4 and GII.3 are still unknown. Perhaps a variety of factors account for it, including cross protection from heterologous strains or the minimal infectious dose necessary to cause disease. More studies are needed to address this issue.
