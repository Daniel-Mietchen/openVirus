<p id="Par28">According to a systematic review of the global seasonality of NV, in the Northern Hemisphere NV usually peaks in cold seasons, whereas it does not exhibit a consistent summer or winter peak in the Southern Hemisphere [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], whereas in North China, NV infections occurred commonly in the winter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, in this study we found three peaks of NV infection per year in Hohhot. The highest peak was observed in winter, and two small peaks occurred in spring and fall. Hohhot is located in the northern part of China in the continental Mongolian plateau, with short, hot, rainless summers, and long, severe, cold, snowless winters. This differs from the climate in the other northern regions in China. The seasonal pattern of NV in Hohhot might be related to this unique local climate.
