<p id="Par29">The oldest GII.3 NV strain identified to date is from a 1983 sample isolated in the Goulburn Valley of Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and GII.3 has been reported to be the major cause of sporadic pediatric NV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In China, early reports on NV showed GII.3 was prevalent in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and until now, GII.3 was reported as the dominant genotype next to GII.4 in sporadic NV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. However, in this study, we found that NV GII.3 was the most prevalent strain among children hospitalized for AGE from 2012 to 2017. Hohhot, located in the North China Plateau, is vast and sparsely populated, and lags behind the developed cities of our country in socioeconomic development and the convenience of transportation. Population flow and economic trade in Hohhot are infrequent. During this period, the GII.P12/GII.3 recombinant was the most common genotype, and it was also detected more frequently in China and Japan than in other parts of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The GII.3 strains identified in our study were grouped into two clusters (I and II) in a phylogenetic analysis of the capsid gene sequences. Lacking early NV surveillance data from Hohhot, it is not yet possible to determine whether GII.3/cluster II strains emerged and spread before 2012. However, our results suggested the hypothesis of an alternating epidemic pattern between GII.3/cluster I strains and GII.3/cluster II strains in Hohhot. Because only partial capsid gene sequences were obtained, rather than the complete VP1 region, or even the longer genome including the ORF1/ORF2 overlap region, we cannot clearly delineate the evolutionary characterization of GII.3 strains; this gap in knowledge should be addressed in the future.
