<p id="Par31">Unlike neighboring cities and other parts of China, where emerging GII.P17-GII.17 NVs caused outbreaks during 2014–2015, no GII.P17-GII.17 was found in children hospitalized for AGE in Hohhot in 2015. Previous reports showed that infection with the emergent GII.P17-GII.17 was more likely to occur in older children and adults [
