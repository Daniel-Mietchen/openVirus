<p id="Par11">NVs are belonging to 
 <italic>Caliciviridae,</italic> with a 7.5-kb-long ssRNA genome. Three different open reading frames (ORFs) encode different proteins of NVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Six non-structural proteins are encoded by ORF1, such as p28, VPg, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, and the structural proteins are encoded by ORF2 (VP1) and ORF3 (VP2) to form the capsid of NVs. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Total seven genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII) NVs are classified by the identities of VP1 and RdRp amino acid sequences of NVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Human beings are the major host to genogroups GI, GII, and GIV NVs, however, other genogroups NV are mainly infected with animals. The epidemic of human acute gastroenteritis are mainly caused by GI or GII NVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the recombination between ORF1 and ORF2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], antigenic variation of P domain of VP1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are contributed to generate novel NV strains. The emerging of NVs leading to the epidemic of human acute gastroenteritis in the worldwide,at hence, it is important to determine both the capsid and RdRp genotypes for strain characterization.
