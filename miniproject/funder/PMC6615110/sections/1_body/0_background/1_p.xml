<p id="Par10">NVs are a leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], responsible for at least 90% of all non-bacterial gastroenteritis cases and 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. All age groups can be infected by NVs, especially children, the old, and the immunosuppressed. The acute gastroenteritis which caused by NVs has become the second infectious disease due to its highly transmission with fecal-oral route and lowly infectious dose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the developing countries, more than 200,000 deaths per year are caused by NVs infection [
