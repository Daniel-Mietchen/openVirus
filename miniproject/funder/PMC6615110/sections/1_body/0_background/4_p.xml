<p id="Par13">China is a vast country, and the prevalence of NV varies by region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, reports and knowledge of routine sporadic NV disease in northern China have been limited. Furthermore, in several recent years, rare NV genotypes (GII.2, GII.6, and GII.17) have caused prevalent outbreaks in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and other parts of Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to explore the NV strains in sporadic AGE cases, which may also aid in understanding the prevalence of human NV in the population. In the present study, we explored the epidemiological and molecular characteristics of NVs in children younger than 5â€‰years hospitalized for AGE from 2012 through 2017 in Hohhot, China.
