<p id="Par12">Despite the large number of NV genotypes co-circulating in children over the past decade, genotypes GII.4 and GII.3 have predominated worldwide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Up to nowadays, six outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis are associated with at least seven distinct GII.4 NV variants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Three major clusters (I–III) and five smaller genetic lineages (A–E) have been identified in the VP1 region of GII.3 NV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Global surveillance data over the years indicated that the majority of outbreaks of NV were caused by GII.4, but the recent NV outbreak strains in Asia were GII.2 and GII.17 [
