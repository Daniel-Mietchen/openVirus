<p id="Par14">Between January 2012 and December 2017, 1863 fecal samples were collected from children younger than 5 years admitted to Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Hohhot with acute gastroenteritis (AGE). AGE was defined as two or more loose stools within a 24-h period. Stool specimens were collected within 7 days after the onset of the disease. All AGE cases admitted to the hospital were enrolled. All specimens were sent to the Inner Mongolia Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for NV detection, and the NV-positive samples were sent to the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC, for further testing and sequencing. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a standard questionnaire. Oral informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all hospitalized children for samples and data collection.</p>
