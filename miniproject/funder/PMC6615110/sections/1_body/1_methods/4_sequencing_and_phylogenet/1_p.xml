 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The dendrogram was determined using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA7. Bootstrap resampling (1000 replications) was used and bootstrap values â‰¥75% are shown. The partial nucleotide sequences determined in this study were submitted to GenBank (acc. no. MK319217 to MK319535).
