<p id="Par16">Following NV detection, positive samples were tested by conventional RT-PCR for amplification of the partial RdRp and VP1 gene regions of NV using the QIAGEN One-Step RT PCR Kit (QIAGEN). The 5′-end capsid gene (region C in ORF2) was amplified with oligonucleotide primer sets G1SKF/R and COG2F/G2SKR for 330 bp of the GI and 344 bp of the GII capsid genes respectively, as previously described [
