<p>Despite the geographical diversity of the studies, there were indeed some common risk factors. The most frequently reported factor was the animal movement

 </bold>). The uncontrolled animal movement leads to other risk factors such as mixing of animals around water and grazing points, a risk factor that is widely identified in Africa, undoubtedly linked to the farming and transhumance practices. However, there are some specific risk factors like the contact between wild animals and domestic animals which are more relevant in Africa [
