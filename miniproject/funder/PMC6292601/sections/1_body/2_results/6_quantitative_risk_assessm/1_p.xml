<p>In this review, 14 articles presenting a quantitative analysis of FMD risk were selected. In quantitative risk analysis, Monte Carlo simulation is usually used to assimilate the probability components of the import scenario. Several software programmes have been developed within a spreadsheet environment for Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertainty associated with an input and its known variability was modelled as a probability distribution. Although the electronic search yielded only few articles, published in recent years, risk analysis has been earlier applied in the field of animal health, particularly in food safety (microbiological risk assessment) and import risk analysis (IRA), including number of studies on FMD risk assessment. Indeed, most of the studies reported risks related to the importation of potentially contaminated animal products (milk or meat) [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Some studies were related to the risks associated with movement of either people or animal products possibly infected with FMDV [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Most reviewed IRAs originated from FMD free countries, mainly in Europe and USA [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Only one included published study on quantitative risk assessment was performed in an FMD endemic country namely Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Through these quantitative risk assessment studies, the critical pathway analysis showed that the risk of FMDV entering a country is overall low [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, depending on the research question and model assumptions, some risks could be considered as relatively high depending on their nature, i.e. the illegal importation of meat and the terrestrial movement of livestock [

 <bold>Part B of 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0208296.s003">S3 Table</xref>
 </bold>). The reviews performed by Garland &amp; De Clercq [

 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] related to the risk assessment approach were not included in the analysis of this review, based on the exclusion criteria. However, important insight has been provided by these reviews, for instance, Garland &amp; De Clercq [
 <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] reported a comprehensive review of risk assessment related to vaccinated animal import. It was demonstrated through this review that the risk from products derived from vaccinated animals is very low when risk mitigation measures are correctly applied.
