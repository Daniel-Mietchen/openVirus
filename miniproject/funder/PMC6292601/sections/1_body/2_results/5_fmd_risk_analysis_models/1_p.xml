<p>There are two main approaches to risk analysis: qualitative and “quantitative. In a qualitative risk analysis, the risk level is appreciated in qualitative terms; like, for example, “the risk of introduction is “negligible”. In a quantitative analysis, the risk is appreciated in quantitative terms e.g. by risk rates, usually as a probability. Additionally, there is broad agreement concerning the definition of risk analysis defined as 
 <italic>"A process consisting of three components</italic>: 
 <italic>risk assessment</italic>, 
 <italic>risk management and risk communication”</italic> and, for risk assessment, defined as 
 <italic>“A scientifically based process consisting of the following steps</italic>: 
 <italic>(i) hazard identification</italic>, 
 <italic>(ii) hazard characterization</italic>, 
 <italic>(iii) exposure assessment</italic>, 
 <italic>and (iv) risk characterization"</italic> [
