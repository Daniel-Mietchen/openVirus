  <p>Logistic regression models are used to measure the association between a set of explanatory variables and either the presence or absence of an FMD outbreak at a given location [

  <p>Poisson regression models are used to analyse count data as a function of a set of predictor variables. These methods are suitable to quantify the number of infected places identified over a given time frame. However, these models have many applications, not only to the analysis of counts of events, but also in the context of models for contingency tables and the analysis of survival data [
   <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Poisson regression assumes the response variable Y has a Poisson distribution and a logarithmic link function. Indeed, it assumes that the logarithm of its expected value can be modelled by a linear combination of unknown parameters. A Poisson regression model is sometimes known as a log-linear model, especially when used to model contingency tables. In this context, Poisson regression models are used to estimate incidence risk or incidence rates adjusting for important factors or confounders.

  <p>when over dispersion of data is a problem in the Poisson regression, an alternative is the use of a negative binomial regression [

   <xref rid="pone.0208296.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This alternative distribution may be used to determine the relationship between incidence risk/rate of FMD outbreaks by (e.g.) space, province or district), time (year or month), vaccine coverage or density of population like the number of bovines per province or district.
