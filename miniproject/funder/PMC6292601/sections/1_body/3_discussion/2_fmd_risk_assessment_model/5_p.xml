<p>One of the strengths of this review is to identify some FMD occurrence risk factors either at farm-level or animal-level. This subsequently may allow the proposition of some basic recommendations for preventive measures of FMD. First, it should be noted that the control measures depend largely on the epidemiological status of a given country or region, the livestock production system, but notably also on the available financial resources. For example, in developed countries, in case of an FMD outbreak, a recommended policy is to strictly implement stamping out (or pre-emptive culling when the risk of transmission or spread is present). Although the economic impacts are very high, these costs are usually covered by national compensation schemes that remove many of the objections to the application of these measures for the effective control of the epidemic. On the contrary, in developing countries, with most of them being FMD endemic, this option cannot reasonably be considered for many reasons including the financial losses to rural communities. Hence, forr the principal risk factor (animal movement) and other factors resulting from the movement (as mixing herds around water points and on pastures), the recommended control measure is the prohibition or restriction of movements during FMD outbreaks as much as possible. Considering that transhumance or nomadism system are dominant in some African regions like SSA, vaccination of animals before going on transhumance could effectively reduce the incidence of the disease. However, for implementing this measure, there is an ultimate need of an updated knowledge of FMDV serotypes circulating in the region. Indeed, the combined use of vaccination of animals every 6 months with improved methods for sero-surveys to monitor viral activity could be decisive to overcome the concerns that vaccination would hide infection [

In case of FMD clusters with a well-known seasonal pattern of occurrence of the disease, selective vaccination campaigns, surveillance activities and control of movements before and during the season at higher risk could be appropriate. Some studies reported that in detected FMD clusters, young animals are the most susceptible to FMD infection. Therefore, increasing the frequency of vaccination among herds followed by the intensification of surveillance activities (where young calves are abundant, surveillance targeted to this specific animal group) could be recommended. In addition, the implementation of risk based surveillance, would certainly improve the efficiency of the use of resources.
