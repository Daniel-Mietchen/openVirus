<p>Apart from the limitations related to the types of models and the quality of data used, some weaknesses of this review should also be noted. Some limitations could essentially be related to the search methodology applied. The time criteria as well as the Boolean operators used may have caused us to inadvertently miss pertinent research articles. For example, the use of the term “model” instead of “prediction” or “simulation” could probably result to miss certain published articles, which do not include these in their titles, abstracts and/or keywords one of these keywords. But, the Boolean operator “AND” was used between the two keywords “Foot-and-Mouth Disease" and "Epidemiology" to avoid this and typically this could encompass all epidemiological studies of FMD. Moreover, it excluded the epidemic (real or simulated) models, especially those based on UK FMD 2001 models and similar models. The heterogeneity of the selected studies, mainly in relation to the used assumption and parameters, was a major constraint for data extraction and accordingly it precluded a more extensive quantitative comparison between studies. In addition, risk factor analysis through seroprevalence studies could have some deficiencies because of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests used [
