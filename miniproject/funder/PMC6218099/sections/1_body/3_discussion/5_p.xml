<p>Based on the 2015 survey, the DENV seroprevalence rate in Sanmin and Nanzih districts increased from 2.1% (30–39 y/o), to 17.1% (60–69 y/o) and 50% (70–79 y/o) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The sharp increase in DENV seroprevalence in the 70–79 y/o group paralleled a drastic increase in the proportion of severe dengue among total dengue cases in that age group, suggesting that in addition to age and other risk factors, significant numbers of monotypically immune individuals in that age group may contribute to the observed severe dengue diseases among the elderly in Taiwan [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006879.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In agreement with this, analysis of indigenous dengue cases from 2002 to 2007 revealed that the majority of DHF cases (84% of total DHF cases or DHF cases ≥60 y/o) were secondary DENV infections, whereas the majority of DF cases were primary DENV infections except in 2002 [

We have performed FRNT to DENV1 and DENV2 for 20 DENV IgG positive samples from the elderly (60–69 and 70–79 y/o age groups) in the Sanmin district and found 40% and 60% to be monotypically and multitypically DENV-immune, respectively. After an island-wide outbreak presumably of DENV1 during WWII (1942–1943), there have been several DENV2 outbreaks in Kaohsiung City (2001–2002, 2003, 2011, 2012 and 2013) before 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006879.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), making the assessment of the time-interval between DENV1 and DENV2 infections more complicated. Based on the DENV seroprevalence among those ≥70 y/o during the 2015 survey (52.8%) and the assumption that they were infected during the 1942–1943 outbreak, the attack rate was estimated to be 52.8%.
