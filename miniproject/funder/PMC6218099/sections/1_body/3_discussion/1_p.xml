<p>In this study, we investigated DENV seroprevalence in a major city in southern Taiwan affected by dengue outbreaks for decades. Our findings on the heterogeneity of DENV seroprevalence in a metropolitan area and a pattern of age-specific DENV seroprevalence which differed from that of DENV-hyperendemic countries have implications for the use of currently available, as well as future, DENV vaccines in countries of low DENV endemicity and for understanding the epidemiology of severe dengue in these countries.</p>
