<p>All serum samples (at 1:100 dilution) were tested by the InBios DENV detect IgG ELISA (DENV 
 <italic>Detect</italic>IgG ELISA kit, InBios International, Inc.), which utilizes a recombinant DENV envelope (E) protein as antigen. The ratio of optical density (OD) to DENV-derived recombinant antigen and OD to negative control antigen was calculated as the immune status ratio (ISR). ISR of ≤1.65, ISR of 1.65–2.84 and ISR of ≥2.84 were interpreted as negative, equivocal and positive, respectively. Equivocal samples were repeated in duplicate to determine the immune status according to the manufacture’s instruction. The performance of the assay was validated by a previously described focus-reduction neutralization test (FRNT) and DENV inactivated-virion IgG ELISA in 105 samples with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 100% [
