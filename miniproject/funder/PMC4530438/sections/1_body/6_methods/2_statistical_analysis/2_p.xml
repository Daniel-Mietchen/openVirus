<p>The temperatureâ€“morbidity association in each prefecture is generally considered in the context of temperature measured using an absolute scale. However, temperature ranges differ among the 47 prefectures, so combining curves across prefectures using non-overlapping temperature ranges is problematic. Additionally, because several studies have indicated climate change adaptation among populations

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, overall effects might be more reliable in terms of temperature percentiles than in terms of absolute temperature scales
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Therefore, we evaluated the overall effects of temperature on morbidity using relative temperature scales, and we standardized prefecture-specific temperatures to prefecture-specific percentiles. Results are expressed in terms of temperature percentiles, which correspond to different prefecture-specific temperatures. When curves on the relative temperature percentile scale are similar across prefectures, relative risk across percentiles is also similar. Conversely, when curves on the absolute scale of temperature are similar, they differ on the relative scale across prefectures with different climates.
