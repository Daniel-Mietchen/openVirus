<p>We employed a two-stage analysis using time-series data from 47 Japanese prefectures to investigate temperature–morbidity associations at the national level. In the first stage, we used a time-series model for each prefectural dataset to estimate prefecture-specific temperature–morbidity relationships, allowing for nonlinearity and delayed effects. These estimated relationships were then pooled at the prefecture level in the second stage within a multivariate meta-analysis. The details of this approach have been documented elsewhere
