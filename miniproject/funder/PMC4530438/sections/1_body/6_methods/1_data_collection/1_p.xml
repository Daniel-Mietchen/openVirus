<p>The number of infectious gastroenteritis cases is reported on a weekly basis using data from approximately 3,000 sentinel medical institutions in Japan under the Infectious Disease Control Law
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Infectious gastroenteritis is defined by clinical factors including sudden stomach ache, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, sentinel medical institutions are not required under this law to report information obtained from laboratory tests. We obtained clinical data recorded and reported by sentinel volunteers to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the national research institute of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. We also obtained data from the Japan Meteorological Agency on daily average temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall in 47 Japanese prefectures. Weekly means for average temperatures, relative humidity, and rainfall were calculated from daily records.
