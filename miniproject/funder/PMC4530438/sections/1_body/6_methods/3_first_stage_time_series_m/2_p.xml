<p>The prefecture-specific parameters of the cross-basis function expressed the nonlinear and delayed temperature–morbidity association of each prefecture, which was then reduced to three summaries expressing the overall cumulative exposure–response relationship and the lag-response association specific to the 25
 <sup>th</sup> and 75
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles. The latter two summaries represent the lag pattern of lower and higher temperatures, respectively. Reduction was performed for each summary by computing transformed parameters for the unidimensional natural cubic splines for temperature or lag space using the original parameters of the cross-basis delineated above. This method is described in more detail elsewhere
