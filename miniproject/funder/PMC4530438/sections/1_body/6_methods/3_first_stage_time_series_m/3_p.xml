 <italic>rh</italic>, 
 <italic>df</italic>  ) represents the natural cubic spline of relative humidity, and df is the degrees of freedom for relative humidity; 3 df was used to control for the effects of relative humidity. 
 <italic>NS</italic> (

 <italic>NS</italic> (
 <italic>time</italic>, 
 <italic>df</italic>  ) represents the natural cubic spline of time, with 3 df per year used to control for the effects of seasonality and long-term trends. The choice of 3 df for relative humidity, rainfall, and seasonality and long-term trends was motivated by previous studies
