<p>In the first stage of data analysis, we used a regression model to obtain prefecture-specific estimates assuming a quasi-Poisson distribution, thereby allowing for overdispersion. For each prefecture, we modelled the nonlinear and delayed effect of temperatures using distributed lag nonlinear models

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A flexible, cross-basis function was defined using a natural cubic spline for temperature space. We also defined a natural cubic spline with an intercept for the lag space, with a maximum lag time of up to 11 weeks. We set a natural cubic spline basis using 3 degrees of freedom each for temperature and lag. The choice of natural cubic spline was motivated by previous study
