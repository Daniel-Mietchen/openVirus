<p>We observed a broadly inverted U-shaped association between temperature and morbidity, consistent with previous regional studies conducted in Fukuoka, Japan
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, which also included a variety of weather-related variables, lag times, and statistical modelling techniques to control for time-varying confounders. However, such factors could alter temperatureâ€“morbidity associations between prefectures. By using consistent methods across all prefectures, we eliminated the possibility that comparisons could be confounded by methodological differences.
