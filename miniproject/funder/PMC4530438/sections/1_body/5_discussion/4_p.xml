<p>We also observed that the effects of lower temperature were acute, whereas the effects of higher temperatures were delayed at the national level. This suggests that timely preventive measures could reduce morbidity risk at lower temperatures; measures allowing for several weeks of protection should be implemented to reduce morbidity risk at higher temperatures. The complex lag pattern that we observed could be due to differences in the pathogens causing infectious gastroenteritis. Although data on infectious gastroenteritis pathogens were not available for analysis, previous studies suggest an increased risk of both bacterial diarrhea during summer and viral diarrhea during winter

We speculate that the complex lag effects as our results suggested would be related to these characteristics, however, the lag pattern difference between lower temperature effect and higher temperature effect suggests difference in the biological mechanism. Because the response of bacterial and viral pathogens to the effects of climate variability may differ, our data may only reflect responses to the most common causes of infectious gastroenteritis and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, these characteristics of infectious gastroenteritis highlight the need for further studies on the effects of weather variability on specific pathogen-induced infectious gastroenteritis.
