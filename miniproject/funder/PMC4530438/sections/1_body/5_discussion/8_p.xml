<p>The results of this study have practical implications for public health officials. Elucidation of the relationship between climate variability and infectious gastroenteritis transmission is important for disease control and prevention. The present findings may facilitate public health officialsâ€™ ability to predict epidemics in each prefecture and to prepare for the effects of climatic change on infectious gastroenteritis. This could be achieved by implementing preventive public health measures, including forewarning medical staff, community-based campaigns, early-warning weather forecasts, and more efficiacious infectious gastroenteritis control programs. Our data suggest that local health departments in each prefecture should consider regional sensitivity to temperature when planning region-specific policies for disease control and prevention.</p>
