<p>In conclusion, this study provides quantitative evidence that the temperatures associated with the highest morbidity in infectious gastroenteritis occur at approximately the 60
 <sup>th</sup> percentile in all 47 Japanese prefectures. The effects of lower temperature were immediate but disappeared after a few weeks, whereas the effects of higher temperatures were delayed but persisted for several weeks. Public health strategies aimed at controlling temperature-related infectious gastroenteritis may be more effective when tailored to region-specific weather conditions.
