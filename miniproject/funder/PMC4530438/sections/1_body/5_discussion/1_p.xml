<p>This study produced several notable results; most importantly, the pooled overall risk of infectious gastroenteritis morbidity was highest around the 60
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of temperature in all 47 prefectures. Moreover, the effects of lower temperature were immediate and disappeared after a few weeks, whereas the effects of higher temperatures were delayed but persisted for several weeks. Despite wide variation in climatic conditions, maximum-morbidity temperatures were observed at approximately the 60
 <sup>th</sup> percentile in all 47 prefectures. These findings suggest that, to a certain extent, populations adapt to local weather conditions.
