<p>Using a pooled analysis, we observed that the overall national maximum-morbidity temperature corresponded to approximately the 60
 <sup>th</sup> percentile, indicating that infectious gastroenteritis risk may be greatest at this percentile. We also confirmed that the inverted U-shapes of the pooled associations predicted in absolute temperature scale were broadly consistent with that predicted in relative temperature scale. These results suggest that the consistency of inverted U-shape associations between temperature and the risk of infectious gastroenteritis is remarkable, and provide the good evidence for the associations. Prefectures with colder temperatures were characterized by lower threshold temperatures, whereas those with hotter temperatures exhibited higher threshold temperatures. Differences in threshold temperature according to prefecture may reflect differences in socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical factors, in addition to weather patterns
