<p>In the meta-regression that included latitude, the modifying effect of this variable was substantial, particularly in more southerly prefectures. This spatial heterogeneity in the temperatureâ€“morbidity relationship could be explained in terms of differing degrees of acclimatization of populations to local weather conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Additionally, the modifying effect of latitude could be due to variations in the epidemiological characteristics of the different population subgroups. Although we could not identify all of the factors that might modify the decline in morbidity, our data suggest that preventive measures should focus on preparing local people and using more appropriate adaptation measures to better respond to potential future temperature changes.
