<p>The present study has several limitations. First, not all cases of infectious gastroenteritis in the community are represented by surveillance data. Such under-reporting can occur anywhere in the reporting chain, i.e., from the initial decision of a patient not to seek health care to failure of medical personnel to record cases in the disease registry. However, we suggest that this did not result in substantial bias because the degree of under-reporting is unlikely to have varied over time. Second, the participating sentinel medical institutions were recruited on a voluntary basis. However, this did not undermine the validity of comparisons made over time, which represented the primary goal of this study. Third, we analyzed weekly data between 2000 to 2012; the modeling accuracy of these associations would improve commensurate with a longer study period or more detailed dataset. Fourth, there are many factors need to be considered in explanation of the heterogeneity between prefectures other than latitude, such as the proportion of people living in urban/rural environment; population density, the proportion of children under 5 year old in the population, education level, and living in poverty. For applying these variables as meta-predictors, further study would be important.</p>
