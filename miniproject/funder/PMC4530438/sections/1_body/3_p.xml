<p>In the present study, we explored variations in the relationship between temperature and weekly infectious gastroenteritis incidence between 2000 and 2012 in all 47 Japanese prefectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to quantify national variations in the effects of temperature on infectious gastroenteritis incidence using a two-stage, time-series analysis.</p>
