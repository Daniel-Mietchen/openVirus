However, the majority of previous studies have examined the effects of temperature only in a single city or region, thus not representing the wide range of climatic, social, demographic, and cultural conditions that occur at the national level. A recent study estimated the potential effects of projected climate change on diarrhea in six regions using five empirical datasets and reported an association between increased diarrhea incidence and higher temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, that study involved linear assumptions (pertaining to the temperatureâ€“diarrhea incidence relationship), and each empirical dataset was associated with only a single geographical region. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated distinctly nonlinear relationships between temperature and infectious gastroenteritis incidence, in which the morbidity-modifying effects of temperature were spatially heterogeneous

It is essential to elucidate the complex, nonlinear, and multi-parameter relationship that exists between climate variability and infectious gastroenteritis transmission on a national scale.
