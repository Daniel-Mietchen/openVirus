<p>To investigate whether the results were sensitive to the level of control exercised for time trends, analyses were repeated using different degrees of freedoms. The estimated effects of temperature changed only marginally. Specifically, the model yielded a pooled overall RR values with respect to the incidence of infectious gastroenteritis of 1.15 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.20) with 1 df and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.06) with 2 df. We also confirmed that the shapes of the pooled associations predicted in absolute temperature scale (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs S1–S3</xref>) were broadly similar to that predicted in relative temperature scale (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>). The highest pooled overall RR was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.85) at 16.3 °C.
