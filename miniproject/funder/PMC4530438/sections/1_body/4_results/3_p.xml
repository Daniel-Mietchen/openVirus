<p>Pooled estimates of predictor-specific summary associations at lower (25
 <sup>th</sup> percentile) and higher (75
 <sup>th</sup> percentile) temperatures based on the main model are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>. The effects of lower temperature began immediately and disappeared after 2–3 weeks; in contrast, the effects of higher temperatures were delayed and then persisted for several weeks. Cochran Q tests were significant for the lag curve in the 25
 <sup>th</sup> and 75
 <sup>th</sup> temperature percentiles (
