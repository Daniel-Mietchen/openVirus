<p>The pooled overall cumulative relationship between relative risk (RR) of infectious gastroenteritis and temperature, illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, exhibited a broadly inverted U-shape. The highest pooled overall RR was 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.15) in the 59.9th percentile of temperature. The multivariate Cochran Q test for heterogeneity was significant (
