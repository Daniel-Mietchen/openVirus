<p>The results of the meta-regression including latitude are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. The top panel suggests a differential overall cumulative association between northern and southern prefectures. Overall, the evidence for a modifying effect was substantial, and the Wald test statistic was signficant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Latitude accounted for heterogeneity among prefectures, with an 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> of 78.7% and a significant Cochran Q test statistic (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The bottom panels indicate an identical modifying effect in predictor-specific summary associations at the 25
 <sup>th</sup> and 75
 <sup>th</sup> temperature percentiles. The Wald test consistently indicated significance at higher (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and lower temperatures (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.038). Cochran Q tests were also significant for the lag curve at the 25
 <sup>th</sup> and 75
 <sup>th</sup> temperature percentiles (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> values of of 63.7% and 67.9%, respectively.
