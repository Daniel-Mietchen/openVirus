<p>We analyzed a total of 12,915,273 (100%) infectious gastroenteritis cases occurring between 2000 and 2012 among 47 Japanese prefectures. The weekly average number of cases was 406.5 (individual prefecture range: 70.8–1265.6). The weekly mean temperature across the 47 prefectures was 15.5 °C (range: 9.3–23.3 °C), the weekly mean humidity was 68.4% (range: 59.5–77.2%), and the weekly mean rainfall was 4.5 mm (range: 2.6–7.1 mm). Latitude ranged between 26.2 and 43.1 degrees north. The mean number of cases and mean temperature varied markedly by prefecture, consistent with the diverse range of climatic conditions (
