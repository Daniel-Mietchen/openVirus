<p>The correlation coefficient between the district-level survey domain estimates of HIV prevalence in the general population and HIV prevalence among pregnant women was 0.71 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0212445.s003">S1 Table</xref>), so that the latter explains approximately 50% of the variation in the former. In contrast, the correlation coefficients between district-level prevalence in the general population and the percentage of formal dwellings among residences, dependency ratio, socio-economic quintile, maternal mortality rate, percentages of births in health facilities and population density were –0.36, 0.29, -0.28, –0.14, 0.09 and 0.01, respectively. Thus, we should expect HIV prevalence among pregnant women to make the largest contribution of information in SAE.
