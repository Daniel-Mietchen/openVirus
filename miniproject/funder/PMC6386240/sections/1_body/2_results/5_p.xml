<p>A strong east-west gradient in HIV prevalence is evident (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212445.g004">Fig 4</xref>, upper). However, the population is concentrated in eastern urban centers (City of Johannesburg and Tshwane [Pretoria] in the northeast, and eThekwini [Durban] on the east coast). Therefore the numbers of PLHIV are concentrated in those urban centers, along the eastern borders with eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) and Mozambique, and to a lesser extent around the City of Cape Town on the southwest coast (
