<p>The AIC-best Fay-Heriott model (model 3) produced district-level estimates of HIV prevalence which were typically more precise, and never less precise, than the direct survey-based domain estimates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212445.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The reduction in relative standard errors of estimation (RSE) were greatest among districts which produced the least precise direct estimates; SAE gains little where direct estimates are precise. Assuming, for example, that “useful” estimates are those for which RSE ≤ 20%, then model 3 produced useful estimates from 15 of the 23 districts for which direct estimation failed to produce useful estimates. Accordingly, the Fay-Herriot estimates of HIV prevalence had narrower 95% confidence intervals than the direct estimates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212445.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Additionally, some point estimates of HIV prevalence differed rather substantially (e.g., Sedibeng, iLembe, Central Karoo and West Rand). The design-based survey domain estimate of HIV prevalence in West Rand was of little value for lack of precision, and likely misleading, whereas the small-area estimate was similar to surrounding districts and consistent with programmatic data.
