<p>The AIC-best model (model 3) included only ANC prevalence and dependency ratio as out-of-survey predictors (
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, pairwise AIC differences among models 1–3, 5–7, 10 and 11 were smaller than 5, and therefore all of those models are plausible alternatives. Differences among log-likelihoods were small except for differences between either models 9 or 12 and the others, so that AIC differences are generally dominated by model complexity rather than fit. ANC prevalence was the superior predictor of survey-based prevalence. Inclusion of auxiliary predictors other than dependency ratio (model 3), resulted in larger AIC values than ANC prevalence alone (model 1). Further, exclusion of ANC prevalence yielded the worst of the models (model 9). Inclusion of the SAR spatial effect of district location did not improve model fit (i.e., compare models 1 with 10, 3 with 11 and 8 with 12).
