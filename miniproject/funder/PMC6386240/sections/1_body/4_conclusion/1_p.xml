<p>The basic area-level “Fay-Herriot” model is a viable choice for estimation of HIV prevalence and numbers of PLHIV in small, unplanned survey domains. Major advantages include use of commonly available aggregated area-level covariates, and relative ease of implementation using freely available software. We assert that the basic area-level model is the most easily implemented alternative, and requires only very modest computational resources. Our results demonstrate that incorporation of data from ANC clinics, commonly available from sub-Saharan Africa, can yield better estimates of HIV prevalence in the general populations of small areas than the types of behavioral demographic variables which have been incorporated previously [
