<p>Sample sizes for the South African surveys are calculated to detect a 5% change in HIV prevalence in each of the five reporting domains (sex, age, race, locality type and province). Sample sizes also provide a 4% margin of error in the prevalence estimates from the reporting domains, including the domain of the nine provinces of South Africa [

However, the 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2012 surveys do not provide adequate precision for estimation of prevalence within the 52 districts which comprise the nine provinces, and the 2017 survey prioritized only certain districts for HIV prevalence estimation. Achieving adequate universal district-level precision from a probability survey would require substantial increases in sample size. Therefore, model-based methods which incorporate multiple sources of data are needed which can improve precision of district level estimates without requiring large increases in sample size.
