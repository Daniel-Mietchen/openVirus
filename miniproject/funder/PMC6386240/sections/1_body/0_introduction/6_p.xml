<p>To date, subnational estimation of HIV prevalence from probability surveys has been based upon several approaches. PrevR [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] uses kernel density estimation to interpolate from geographic point estimates of HIV prevalence from a DHS to produce continuously scaled choropleth maps. PrevR does not incorporate the uncertainty of estimation from the DHS, and cannot produce quantitative estimates of uncertainty. Bayesian kriging of individual-level data from a household survey has been used for subnational estimation and display of HIV prevalence in South Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Fully Bayesian geostatistical models have been used to estimate subnational HIV prevalence from individual-level health survey data [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unlike PrevR, those Bayesian models accommodate the uncertainty in the data and can produce probability intervals on the estimates. However, all of those approaches used only data from a probability survey, and therefore precision remained limited largely by the information content of the survey.
