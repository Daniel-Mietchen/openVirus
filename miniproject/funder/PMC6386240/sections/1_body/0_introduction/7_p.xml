 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] enable augmentation of survey data with, for example, data from convenience sampling or routine monitoring to improve precision over design-based domain estimation using the survey data alone. Unit-level SAE models require that auxiliary data are available from each primary sampling unit present in the survey data, which limits the choice of auxiliary data. Area-level models require only that auxiliary data are available for the estimation domains from the survey. Suppose, for example, that estimates are required for the second subnational (SNU2) level, and data are available from a probability survey designed to produce estimates at the first subnational (SNU1) level. Imprecise design-based domain estimates at the SNU2 level are computed using conventional survey methods. The key idea is to model those health survey-based prevalence estimates as functions of predictors from data which are external to the survey. The precision of the resulting small-area estimates is a function of the precision of the direct domain estimates and the degree to which the auxiliary covariates predict those domain estimates. For example, area-level synthetic SAE of HIV prevalence in local municipal areas of South Africa was based on data from a national household survey and five demographic variables [
