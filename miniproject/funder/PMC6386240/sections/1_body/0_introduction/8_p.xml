<p>Despite well-known relations between HIV prevalence in the general population and prevalence among pregnant women who attend ANC clinics [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], to our knowledge, no previous subnational estimation efforts have exploited the information content of the latter to improve estimation of the former. We postulated that area-level SAE of HIV prevalence for the 52 districts of South Africa would produce substantially more precise estimates than conventional design-based domain estimation because auxiliary estimates of HIV prevalence from ANC surveillance should be good predictors of prevalence in the general population. Our aim was to demonstrate the potential for improved district-level estimation using 2012 HIV household survey domain estimates by incorporating HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending ANC clinics and other covariates.
