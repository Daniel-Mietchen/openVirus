<p>However, existing data sources do not usually provide reliable sub-national estimates of HIV prevalence [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, monitoring of HIV prevalence in countries has historically relied on surveillance among pregnant women included in semi-systematic convenience samples from (sentinel) antenatal care (ANC) clinics [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, there are many important biases inherent in ANC sentinel surveillance [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and those data require careful analysis and interpretation [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Pregnant women who attend sentinel ANC clinics may not represent the broader population in terms of HIV burden or transmission dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Urban populations may be over-represented among ANC sites [
