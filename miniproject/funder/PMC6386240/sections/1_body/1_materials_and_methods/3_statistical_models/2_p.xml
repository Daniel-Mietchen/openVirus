<p>The response variable for all models was the logit transformation of the direct domain estimates of HIV prevalence proportions among all persons, regardless of age or sex, and sampling error variance was estimated as Delta-method approximation using the variances of the domain estimates. Eleven of the 12 models included the logit transformation of district-level ANC prevalence proportion as an auxiliary predictor. Model 1 included only the logit of ANC prevalence proportion. Models 2–5 augmented model 1 with inclusion of the district-level percentages of formal dwellings, dependency ratio, socio-economic quintile and maternal mortality rate, respectively. Model 6 augmented model 2 with inclusion of the dependency ratio. Model 7 augmented Model 6 inclusion of maternal mortality rate. Model 8 augmented model 7 with inclusion of the percentages of births which occurred in health care facilities. Model 9 was reduced from model 8 by deletion of the logit of ANC prevalence, and provides the contrast needed to assess the value of ANC prevalence. Models 10–12 relax the assumption of independent model errors in models 1, 2 and 8, respectively, with inclusion of a SAR spatial covariance structure. Relative model performance was assessed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. AIC balances model fit against model complexity; smaller values of AIC indicate relatively better predictive ability. AIC is a dimensionless relative measure, and differences of 5 between models are customarily considered to be important.
