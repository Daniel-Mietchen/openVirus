<p>We used variations of the basic area-level model [

 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to estimate district-level HIV prevalence in the general population. Briefly, the basic area-level model combines survey-based direct area-level domain estimates, auxiliary (out-of-survey) predictors, and area-specific random effects which borrow strength across areas. Conventionally, the area-level random effects are assumed to be independently normally distributed, but spatial covariance structures can also be modeled. We fitted 12 variations of the basic area-level model, which differed in the inclusion of auxiliary predictors and assumptions about the random effects. We fitted models which assumed independently normally distributed random effects and, alternatively, simultaneously autoregressive (SAR) random effects [
