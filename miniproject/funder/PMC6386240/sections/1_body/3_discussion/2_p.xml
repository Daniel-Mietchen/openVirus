<p>The improvement in precision that we observed over survey domain estimation was largely due to the availability of published district-level estimates of HIV prevalence among pregnant women obtained from ANC surveillance. Data on HIV prevalence among pregnant women, either from sentinel surveillance or routine reporting from prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services, are available from most sub-Saharan African nations [

 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] provide those data from many sub-Saharan nations. The PHIA surveys include testing for major metabolites of anti-retroviral medications and estimation of serum HIV loads and, in principle, enable SAE of the entire 90-90-90 cascade (proportions of HIV-positive people who know their status, on treatment, on treatment and virally suppressed).
