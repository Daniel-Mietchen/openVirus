<p>Small area estimation can improve estimates of HIV prevalence in small, unplanned analysis domains. However, precision is ultimately limited by survey sample size. Therefore there is no guarantee that any method for estimation in small unplanned domains will yield desirable precision in any domain. The best that can be done is to use the best-available data and then critically evaluate the utility of the gains for each small domain.</p>
