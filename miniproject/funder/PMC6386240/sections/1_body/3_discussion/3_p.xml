<p>Inclusion of the spatial SAR covariance structure did not improve the small-area estimates of HIV prevalence in our data and models. However, that result does not imply that spatial correlation is unimportant in other contexts. The SAR covariance structure is coarse-grained in area-level models. First, it is based on binary indicators of whether pairs of districts are adjacent. In contrast, distance between districts is also likely to matter. Second, the spatial grain (districts) is too coarse to capture finer scale correlations which may exist, say among census enumeration areas. For example, spatial correlation is extremely important in geostatistical models which incorporate more sensitive models for spatial structure [
