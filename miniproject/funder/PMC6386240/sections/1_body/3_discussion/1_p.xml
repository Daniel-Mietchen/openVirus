<p>Successful HIV epidemic control in the era of increasingly limited resources will require targeted delivery of the “right things, in the right place and at the right time” [
 <xref rid="pone.0212445.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Data-driven public health actions that can deliver on this goal will require valid and reliable estimates of HIV prevalence and numbers of PLHIV in areas containing small populations, including those which are inadequately sampled by health surveys. Estimates should be as precise as possible to minimize the risk of inefficient allocation of HIV program services. Multiple, statistically principled, methods are available to estimate quantities over small geographic areas [

The Fay-Herriot model provides epidemiologists and public health planners with an effective and easily implemented approach to estimate HIV prevalence and numbers of PLHIV in small subnational areas.
