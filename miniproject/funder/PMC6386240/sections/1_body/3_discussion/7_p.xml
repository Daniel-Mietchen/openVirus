<p>We chose the Fay-Herriot model because it is simplest method for SAE from aggregated area-level predictor covariates, and is easily implemented using freely available software. Data which are aggregated to subnational levels are often readily available because frequently public health programs managed and census results are reported at those levels. Estimation is straight-forward once the data have been obtained. The basic Fay-Herriot area-level model requires the assumption that area-level level variances in the response variable are known. Uncertainty may be underestimated as a result, and future applications of SAE of HIV prevalence, numbers of PLHIV and HIV incidence may benefit from the application of more sophisticated methods which relax that assumption [
