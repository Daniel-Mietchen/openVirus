 <p>Influenza, or the flu, causes significant morbidity and mortality during both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Recently developed influenza forecast systems have the potential to aid public health planning for and mitigation of the burden of this disease. However, current forecasts are often generated at spatial scales (e.g. national level) that are coarser than the scales at which public health measures and interventions are implemented (e.g. community level). Here we build and test influenza forecast systems at county and community levels, which either include spatial connectivity among locations or are run in isolation. We test these four flu forecast systems (i.e. 2 models Ã— 2 spatial scales) using data collected from 2008 to 2013, including the 2009 pandemic, for the five boroughs (corresponding to county level) and 42 neighborhoods (corresponding to community level) in New York City. We compare the performance of the four forecast systems in predicting the onset, duration, and intensity of flu outbreaks and found that the performance varied by spatial scale (borough vs. neighborhood), season (non-pandemic vs. pandemic) and metric (onset, duration, and intensity). In general, the inclusion of spatial network connectivity in the forecast model improves forecast accuracy at the borough scale but degrades accuracy at the neighborhood scale.</p>
