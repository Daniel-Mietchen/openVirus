  <title>Comparison of forecast accuracy among forecast systems.</title>
  <p>The six lines in each panel show forecasts made using the borough-level network model and the EAKF (solid red line), the borough-level isolation model and the EAKF (dashed red line), the neighborhood-level network model and the EAKF (solid blue line), the neighborhood-level isolation model and the EAKF (dashed blue line), the baseline analog model with historical records from all localities (solid green line), and the baseline analog model with local historical records (dashed green line). Each row shows the forecast accuracy for different epidemic intensity levels (i.e. 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% ILI+) at different leads (x-axis); each column shows the accuracy predicting onset, duration, and cumulative incidence. For onset predictions, the leads are relative to the predicted onset, e.g., 5 weeks in the future (lead = 5), or 5 weeks in the past (lead = −5); for duration or cumulative incidence predictions, the leads are relative to the midpoint of predicted onset and ending. For onset, a predicted value within ±1 week of observed onset was deemed accurate; for duration, a prediction with an onset within ±1 week of observed onset and a duration within ±2 week of observed duration was deemed accurate; for cumulative incidence, a prediction with an onset within ±1 week of observed onset and cumulative incidence over the predicted duration within ±20% of observed cumulative incidence was deemed accurate.</p>
