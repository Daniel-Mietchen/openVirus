  <title>Distributions of differences in forecast accuracy between the network model and the isolation model.</title>
  <p>Each subplot (A-R) shows the difference in forecast accuracy (in percentage) for forecasts made for the same spatial scale and metric using the network model v. the isolation model, for -5 to 5 week leads (in orange), 0 to 5 week leads (in green) and -5 to -1 week leads (in blue). The forecasts are grouped by season, lead, and location as in 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; each subplot corresponds to one cell in 
   <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The numbers (in percentage) in each subplot show the mean and 95% confidence intervals for each of the three lead times.
