  <title>Comparison of the borough level network model and borough level isolation model forecasts.</title>
  <p>Each colored square shows the difference in accuracy predicting the timing of onset, duration, and cumulative incidence for each ILI+ level (shown on the x-axis) with respect to predicted lead (y-axis). For each bin (i.e. ILI+ level and lead), accuracy difference (Î”Acc), calculated as the accuracy of forecasts using the network model minus those using the isolation model, was averaged over all boroughs and either over all seasons (A-C), inter-pandemic seasons (D-F), or the two pandemic waves (G-I). Grey color indicates insufficient data for bins with &lt;20 forecasts.</p>
