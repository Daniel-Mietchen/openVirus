  <title>Spatial structure and heterogeneity of ILI+ within New York City.</title>
  <p>(A) NYC UHF neighborhoods. Borough boundaries are shown in black and UHF neighborhood boundaries are shown in grey. (B) ILI+ intensity relative to the seasonal maximum. Relative ILI+ is computed as the local ILI+ divided by the maximal ILI+ among all neighborhoods for each season/pandemic wave. Each colored square shows relative ILI+ for each UHF neighborhood (x-axis) in each week of the study period (y-axis). Vertical dashed black lines indicate borough divisions.</p>
