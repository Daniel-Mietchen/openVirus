<p>Mechanistic models used for disease forecast systems fall into two general categoriesâ€”compartmental and agent based. Compartmental disease models divide a population into different groups (e.g., susceptible, infected, and removed) according to relevant disease states and apply a set of ordinary differential equations to compute the flow of simulated people among those compartments. In contrast, agent based models simulate the activity and infection state of individuals within a synthetic population based on prescribed schemes of individual behaviors and interactions. While agent based models are more computationally expensive and their model complexity limits their generalizability, compartmental models are often criticized for oversimplifying system dynamics. In particular, compartmental models assume that the entire population (e.g. a country, state, or city) is perfectly mixed; however, even within a city there may be considerable spatial heterogeneity leading to differing disease dynamics at different sub-populations and locations.</p>
