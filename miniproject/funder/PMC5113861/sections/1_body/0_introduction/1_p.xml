<p>Each year, influenza epidemics in the U.S. lead to between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths and cost an estimated $87 billion [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These significant costs motivate development of forecast systems to predict the epidemic growth of this disease to aid the implementation of more proactive countermeasures. Recent efforts have developed a number of forecast systems for predicting influenza epidemics [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The skill of each of these systems depends on a number of factors, including: (1) the accuracy and richness of available observational data; (2) the ability of the disease model to capture disease dynamics (should a disease model be part of the forecast system); and (3) the effectiveness of the statistical method used to estimate the data and/or model epidemic features prior to forecast (either statistical characteristics of the epidemic curve or optimized model state-space). Addressing the last factor, our previous work [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] compared the performance of six statistical methods—three ensemble filters and three particle type filters—for the forecast of seasonal influenza epidemics in the US, using the same influenza epidemic model, and revealed key differences among those methods. The model employed for that study depicted influenza transmission dynamics at the municipal scale and had no spatial component. Here we examine whether the inclusion of spatial dynamics improves influenza forecast. In addition, the effect of observation scale, i.e. granularity, on forecast performance is also explored.
