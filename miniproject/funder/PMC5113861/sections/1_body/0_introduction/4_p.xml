<p>In this study, we investigate how the inclusion of spatial heterogeneity affects the accuracy of influenza forecast for different geospatial scales. Specifically, we address two questions: (1) at what spatial scale (i.e. granularity) of simulation does inclusion of spatial connection improve forecast performance; and (2) whether forecast performance differs between interpandemic and pandemic seasons given the differing transmissibility of influenza strains. To address these questions, we build a forecast system using a patch network epidemic model [
