<p>Such heterogeneities are evident in

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], varies in space and time in the 42 neighborhoods of New York City (NYC). Both epidemic intensity and timing differ considerably among the neighborhoods, as disease dynamics are likely driven by both local transmission and inter-locale interaction. Indeed, past studies have shown that commuter flows contribute to the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza epidemics in the US and drive the spatial synchrony among states [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As such, the ability of a model to capture spatial connectivity could be an important factor for developing accurate predictive models, as has been demonstrated for a number of infectious diseases [
