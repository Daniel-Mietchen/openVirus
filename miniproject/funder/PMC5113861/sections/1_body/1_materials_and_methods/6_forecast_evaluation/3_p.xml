<p>These new forecast metrics will provide users (e.g. public health officials) additional information on the progression of an epidemic that we believe may be more relevant for planning at the local scale. For each metric, we focus our evaluation at shorter leads from 5 weeks (i.e. the event is predicted to occur 5 weeks ahead of the forecast week) to -5 weeks (i.e. the event is predicted to have passed 5 weeks prior to the forecast week). Note forecast accuracy at negative leads is important as well, as it indicates the forecast system is not generating false predictions.</p>
