<p>In our previous studies, we evaluated the accuracy of predictions of epidemic peak timing (i.e. the week with highest ILI+) and peak intensity. In this study, because observations at finer spatial scale may include relatively larger observational errors and thus render the specific week and level of peak incidence less meaningful (e.g. multiple weeks may have similar ILI+ magnitudes, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>), we here instead evaluated the accuracy predicting the timing and number of weeks at or above various levels of ILI+ (i.e. 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, and 3%). These ILI+ levels represent different stages of influenza activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>). ILI+ at 0.1–0.25% is close to incidence levels during the onset of an outbreak, 0.5–1% represents incidence at mid-season, 1–2% represents peak levels during inter-pandemic seasons and the Fall 2009 pandemic wave, and higher levels (e.g. 3%) mostly only occurred during the Spring 2009 pandemic wave.
