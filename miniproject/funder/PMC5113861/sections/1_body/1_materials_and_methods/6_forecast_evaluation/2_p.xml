<p>For each level, we evaluated system accuracy predicting the onset (i.e. the first week ILI+ reaches the target level), the duration (i.e. the number of weeks above the target level), and cumulative ILI+ over the duration. To account for observational noise in the data, we computed the 3-week centered moving average for each ILI+ time series and used those moving averages to evaluate the forecasts (referred to as reference hereafter), rather than use the raw ILI+ observations. For onset, a forecast within ±1 week of the reference onset was deemed accurate; for duration, a forecast with a predicted onset within ±1 week of the reference onset and a predicted duration within ±2 weeks of the reference duration was deemed accurate; for cumulative ILI+, a forecast with a predicted onset within ±1 week of the reference onset and a predicted ILI+ sum over the predicted duration within ±20% of the reference value was deemed accurate. Note that the evaluation of duration and cumulative ILI+ takes into account the predicted epidemic timing, in addition to the time span or magnitude; for instance, a forecast with a predicted onset at Week 1 and a predicted duration of 10 weeks will be deemed inaccurate if the observed epidemic started from Week 3 and lasted 10 weeks.</p>
