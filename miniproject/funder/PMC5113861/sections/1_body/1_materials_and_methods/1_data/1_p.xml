<p>Influenza-like illness (ILI) data were collected by the emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance system of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This dataset includes weekly ILI syndrome ED visit counts and all-cause ED visit counts at the patient zip-code level, from the week ending 1/12/2008 to the week ending 9/21/2013. ILI syndrome ED visits were defined for patient chief complaints containing a mention of fever and cough, fever and sore throat, or an influenza term [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], analogous to the traditional surveillance definition of ILI as patient presentation with fever ≥37.8°C, a cough or sore throat without a known cause other than influenza [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In Staten Island, one of the five NYC boroughs, the majority of ILI syndrome ED visits were recorded only when a visit resulted in hospitalization; as such, ILI syndrome ED visit counts in Staten Island are biased low relative to other boroughs.
