<p>The ILI+ time series here include three full inter-pandemic seasons (i.e. from Week 40 to Week 20 of the next year for seasons 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2012–13), two half seasons (data for the 2007–08 season beginning Week 2 of 2008 and for the 2008–09 season truncated at Week 16 of 2009 due to the pandemic), and two pandemic waves (Weeks 14–33 in 2009 for the spring wave and Week 31 in 2009 through Week 20 in 2010 for the fall wave). Note the main epidemic course was captured for both of the two half seasons.</p>
