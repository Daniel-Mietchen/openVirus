<p>As described in the Data section above, the ILI+ observations were measured as the proportions of ILI+ ED consultations among all-cause ED consultations. It is thus not a measure of per capita incidence rate, as simulated by the model. To compute the model-counterpart of ILI+,

 </inline-formula>, we divided the model-simulated incidence rate by a scaling factor γ. This scaling factor represents the relative likelihood a person seeks medical attention for any cause to that for influenza infection and achieves the conversion per Bayes’ theorem; the scaling factor was estimated by the EAKF in this study. For detailed derivation of this conversion, please refer to [
