<p>Further, all unobserved state variables and parameters are updated according to their co-variability with the observed state variable [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. After the update, the ensemble is integrated to the end of Week 2 and then is updated again using the Week 2 observation of ILI+. This prediction-update filtering process is repeated up to the last observation prior to the generation of forecast. In so doing, the EAKF recursively optimizes the model system to obtain more truthful estimates of model states and parameters. Following any weekly update, a forecast can be generated by integrating the optimized ensemble of model simulations, i.e. the posterior, to the end of the influenza season.
