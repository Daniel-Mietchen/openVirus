<p>The system was run discontinuously for each flu season, i.e., the system was initialized at the beginning of each season and “trained” using observations for the current season up to the week of forecast. For all interpandemic seasons but 2007–08, this initialization occurred at Week 40; the incomplete 2007–08 season was initialized at Week 2; the pandemic waves were initialized when influenza transmission occurred out-of-season. Once the first 4 weeks of observations had been assimilated, forecasts were generated weekly until the end of the season (i.e. Week 20 of the next year for interpandemic seasons or four weeks prior to the last observation for the 2008–09 season and the spring pandemic wave). To account for stochasticity in model initialization, 20 separate ensemble simulations were initialized and used to generate weekly forecasts for each season.</p>
