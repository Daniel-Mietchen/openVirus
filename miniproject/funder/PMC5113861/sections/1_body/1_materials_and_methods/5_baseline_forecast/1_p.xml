<p>For comparison, we developed an additional set of forecasts using an analog method as baseline. Briefly, the Pearson correlation coefficients between the ILI+ time series for the current season up to latest observation and the same period of each historical season were computed. These correlation coefficients represent the similarity in epidemic timing and intensity between the current season and historical seasons. A prediction of ILI+ for the remainder of the season was then computed as the weighted average of the historical time series that correlated positively with the current season (weights are proportional to the correlation coefficients and summed to 1). For real-time forecast, only available historical record can be used; however, as our study period included only seven outbreaks, here we used records for all seven outbreaks to generate the forecasts, regardless of temporal sequence. Due to the small number of locales at the borough scale (i.e. 5) and outbreaks (i.e. 7), we performed this comparison only at the UHF neighborhood scale (i.e. 42 in total). We developed the weighted average in two ways—one using historical records for the same neighborhood (corresponding to the “isolation” model for the EAKF forecasts) and one using records from all neighborhoods (corresponding to the network model for the EAKF forecasts).</p>
