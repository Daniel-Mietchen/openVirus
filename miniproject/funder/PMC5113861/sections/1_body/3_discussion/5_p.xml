<p>To test the impact of the latter factor, i.e. confounding from outside signals through data assimilation, we generated forecasts for the 3-wk and 5-wk centered moving averages of the neighborhood ILI+ time series. These smoothed signals are less erratic than the raw observations so that the signal from connected neighboring localities is more stable over time. Indeed, the forecast accuracies for these two smoothed time series were substantially higher than those for the raw observations, and forecasts generated using the network model-EAKF forecast system were more comparable to those run in isolation (
