<p>The effects of spatial connectivity on disease transmission are usually two foldâ€”it can introduce a disease into new regions during the early phase of an epidemic [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here we examined both effects in the context of influenza forecast. We found that inclusion of spatial connectivity within a city improved the accuracy of 
 <italic>prospective</italic> forecast of epidemic onset, particularly during interpandemic seasons. This finding underscores the importance of spatial connectivity to disease invasion during the very early phase of an epidemic. In contrast, the effect of inclusion of network structure in the forecast system was mixed in predicting the duration and cumulative ILI+, two later phase metrics. For forecast during the pandemic at the borough scale, the network structure improved prediction accuracy for cumulative ILI+. Influenza moved rapidly through the city during the pandemic, leading to more synchronized dynamics among locales; these synchronized observations probably reinforced the inference and further optimized the system prior to the generation of forecast. However, the network structure degraded the accuracy of cumulative ILI+ for interpandemic events. This finding indicates that the influence of spatial connectivity wanes over the course of a seasonal influenza epidemic and that once the epidemic is established in a locality it is fueled primarily by local transmission dynamics.
