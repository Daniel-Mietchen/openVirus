<p>We recognize a number of limitations in this study. Our conclusions were drawn based on only seven outbreaks; a more robust evaluation is warranted as more observations become available. We did not include age-structure in our model, an important demographic factor shaping influenza transmission dynamics. The ED ILI counts were recorded by age group; however, age-grouped ILI ED counts were too low at the UHF neighborhood level to allow meaningfully analysis. Future work using data from other surveillance systems may resolve this issue. Another potential confounder stemmed from the ED ILI data for Staten Island, one of the five NYC boroughs, which only included hospitalized cases. To address this issue, we used a different prior distribution of scaling factor (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that this scaling factor is able to compensate for missing data; it thus may to some extent mitigate adverse impacts on the network model.
