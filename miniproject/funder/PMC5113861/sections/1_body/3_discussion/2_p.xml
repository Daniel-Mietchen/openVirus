<p>The network connection in our forecast system was formulated as a combination of the gravity model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the radiation model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). In essence, this network connection model computes the raw connections between sub-region pairs (e.g. between boroughs) using a gravity-type formula and further normalizes these raw quantities over the entire region (i.e. all of NYC), which resembles the radiation model. In previous work, we applied this network connection model to sub-regions delineated by population size and area, and used it to compute the spatial connection and infer the transmission network of the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, we used population density instead of population size as model input. This choice was motivated by the high variability of population density within NYC. For example, population density in Manhattan, the borough that attracts the largest number of commuters [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], is 2.58 times of the city average, even though its residents only make up 19.4% of the city’s population. Using this configuration, our model was able to generate commuter flows similar to those revealed in census data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for the majority of boroughs. To test further the impact of potential misrepresentation of the network connectivity, we used commuter census data for the five boroughs in NYC [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] to configure the network connections in the forecast system (see Supplementary Material). The forecasts made using this alternative network configuration had similar accuracy to those made without the commuter census data (paired

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2954, Supplementary Material). This finding suggests that our network model is able to capture the impact of spatial connectivity on influenza transmission dynamics in NYC at the borough scale. In addition, the model parameters estimated using the network model were in general consistent with those reported previously for U.S. cities [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005201.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (see Supplementary Material and
