<p>Due to a lack of city-specific data, we used influenza viral isolation rates reported for HHS Region 2 to compute the ILI+ for NYC. As viral testing practice may vary by geographical location, the viral isolation rates used here may not be representative of those for NYC and may introduce systematic biases into the ILI+ data. In addition, the ILI+ data used here were based on ED ILI visits and hence may not be representative of influenza activity among the general population. Nevertheless, forecast of ED ILI+ in itself is important as it could provide health professionals at EDs advanced lead-time to plan for changes in influenza-related visits.</p>
