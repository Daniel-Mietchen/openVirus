Here we examine how the inclusion of spatial structure among sub-populations within a municipality influences the performance of an influenza forecast system. We applied a patch network model in conjunction with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and weekly ILI+ observations at both the borough and neighborhood levels in NYC and forecast both seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks at those two granularities.
