<p>The inclusion of network structure and additional data streams in general improved forecast accuracy at the borough level but lowered the accuracy at the neighborhood level. The inferior performance at the neighborhood level may be attributed to two factors: (1) the network model failed to capture the connectivity among neighborhoods, i.e. how local dynamics and heterogeneities propagate across neighborhoods; and (2) assimilation of data streams from outside neighborhoods amplified observational noise, which in turn degraded forecast accuracy. For the former, heterogeneities in epidemic progression at the neighborhood level not only come from differing rates of population mixing (for which the network structure is primarily designed), but also from other factors such as population demographics (e.g. different age-structure and school-age populations) and healthcare seeking behaviors, which affect the number of cases recorded by the surveillance system. These heterogeneities, as captured in the observed ILI records (
