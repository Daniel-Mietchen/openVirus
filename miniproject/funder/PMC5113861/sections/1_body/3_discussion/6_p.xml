<p>Together, these findings suggest that the heterogeneities captured in the neighborhood level dataset represent local dynamics or observational biases that do not impinge upon the signal of other neighborhoods. As a result, forecasting at the neighborhood scale is more accurate when each neighborhood is run independently in isolation. In contrast, at the borough scale, these heterogeneities are aggregated and homogenized; our network model, capturing the connectivity via commuter flow, likely reflects the primary inter-connections among boroughs and thus to some extent improved forecast accuracy. For these reasons, our findings here do not entirely dismiss inclusion of spatial heterogeneity among subpopulations in forecast models. Rather, it suggests that to improve the forecast model, the network structure should represent spatial connectivity at the appropriate scale. Indeed, the lack of forecast improvement at the neighborhood scale may simply indicate that alternate, more detailed modeling approaches are needed. Such approaches would need to be supported by richer observation at an appropriate granularity so that critical epidemiological processes, in addition to population mobility, could be represented and optimized.</p>
