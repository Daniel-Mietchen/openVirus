<p>In summary, we have developed a network model-filter forecast system for the forecast of influenza at borough and neighborhood geospatial scales. When tested using data for NYC, this network forecast system was able to improve forecast accuracy at the borough level, for which spatial connection is linked primarily via commuter flow. In contrast, it degraded forecast accuracy at the neighborhood scale. NYC is a large municipality with a sizeable geographic extent and many neighborhoods; however, even within smaller cities, community and neighborhood heterogeneity may lead to variable disease transmission dynamics. Local public health measures implemented at sub-municipal scales would therefore benefit from surveillance and forecast enacted at those more local scales. Future work should continue to explore spatial granularity and identify the optimal scales for disease surveillance, forecast and intervention. In so doing, the network model forecast system should be extended to other cities and geographic units (e.g. states) to examine its utility in these different settings and spatial scales.</p>
