<p>We additionally examined how the inclusion of network structure in the model affects forecast accuracy during interpandemic seasons and the two pandemic waves. While the inclusion of network structure at the borough scale substantially improved forecast accuracy for duration (8.3%; confidence interval: [5.6%, 11.1%], at -5 to 5 week leads,

In addition, at the borough scale, the network model consistently outperformed the isolation model when predicting onset during both the interpandemic seasons and the two pandemic waves. At the neighborhood scale, the inclusion of network connection significantly improved forecast accuracy for the timing of onset during interpandemic seasons (7.4% [6.8%, 8.0%] at -5 to 5 week leads and 13.9% [12.8%, 14.9%] at 0 to 5 week leads,
