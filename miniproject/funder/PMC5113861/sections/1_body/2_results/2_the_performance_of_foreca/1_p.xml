<p>As epidemic intensity varies substantially by season and spatial scale, the same ILI+ level can correspond to different phases of an epidemic. For instance, in the borough of Manhattan, 0.5% ILI+ is roughly the peak of the 2008–09 season but the start of the spring pandemic wave (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, generally, 0.25% ILI+ corresponds to influenza activity at the start of the season, 0.5–1% ILI+ corresponds to elevated influenza activity, and 2% and above ILI+ corresponds to peak levels. Therefore, in general accurate prediction of onset, duration, and cumulative ILI+ at the 0.25% level corresponds to accurate prediction of outbreak onset, duration for the flu season, and cumulative ILI+ over the entire season (1
