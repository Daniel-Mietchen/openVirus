 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows forecast accuracy for the four forecast systems using the EAKF (network vs. individual locale and borough vs. neighborhood) over the 2007–08 through 2012–13 seasons for four ILI+ levels. All four forecast systems were able to accurately predict onset for different ILI+ levels, and largely outperformed the baseline analog forecast method. Tallied over all weekly ensemble forecasts, forecast accuracies were 81.9% (0.25% ILI+), 73.8% (0.5% ILI+), 55.3% (1% ILI+), and 28.5% (2% ILI+) 1 week prior to the 
 <italic>predicted</italic> onset (i.e. 1 week lead), increased to 97.3%, 91.9%, 86.0%, and 84.9%, respectively, for the four ILI+ levels at 0 lead, and stayed at similar high accuracies at negative leads (i.e. when the onset is predicted to be in the past).
