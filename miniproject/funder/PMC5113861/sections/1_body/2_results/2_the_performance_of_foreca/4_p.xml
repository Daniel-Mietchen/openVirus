<p>Similarly, forecast accuracy for cumulative ILI+ was lower than for onset. Forecasts of cumulative ILI+ for the duration above a given level had accuracies of 54.18% (0.25% ILI+), 44.8% (0.5% ILI+), 41.3% (1% ILI+), and 40.8% (2% ILI+) at the week the epidemic was predicted to have reached the midpoint of time above target ILI+ level (i.e. 0 lead). These accuracies increased steadily over time and reached 80.1%, 76.2%, 63.0%, 63.9%, respectively, for the four ILI+ levels 5 weeks after the predicted midpoint.</p>
