<p>In comparison, forecast accuracy for duration at each level was lower, specifically, with 43.8% (0.25% ILI+), 49.3% (0.5% ILI+), 71.2% (1% ILI+), and 77.1% (2% ILI+) of forecasts accurate at the week the epidemic was predicted to have reached the midpoint of the time-interval ILI+ was above the target level (i.e. 0 lead). Such lower accuracies are not surprising as prediction of duration depends on the ability to predict both the onset and the end point above a given ILI+ level; prediction of the end point is challenging, in particular for low ILI+ levels (e.g., 0.25%) for which the duration could last over 20 weeks (

For the two higher ILI+ levels (i.e. 1% and 2%), for which the outbreak duration tended to be shorter, accuracies were much higher. However, forecast accuracy at all levels improved over time and reached 64.9%, 77.8%, 82.7%, and 84.9% for the four ILI+ levels 5 weeks after the predicted midpoint for the corresponding ILI+ level, which for many localities and seasons was still in advance of the end of the outbreak.
