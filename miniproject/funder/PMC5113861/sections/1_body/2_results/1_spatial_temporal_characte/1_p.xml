 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the ILI+ time series over the study period for the five boroughs within NYC. While varied in magnitude, the borough-level ILI+ time series were highly correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.955; range: 0.857−0.996), indicating a high level of synchrony among the boroughs. During 2008–2013, NYC was divided into 42 UHF neighborhoods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), each borough with 4 to 11 neighborhoods. At the neighborhood scale, ILI+ varied substantially both in magnitude and timing. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, the epidemic intensity varied dramatically and ILI+ could peak weeks apart (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.919; range: 0.347−0.996).
