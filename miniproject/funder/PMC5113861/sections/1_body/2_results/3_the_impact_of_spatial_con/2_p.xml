<p>The differences in forecast accuracy at borough scale over different leads are further demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Tallied over all seasons, prospective forecasts (i.e. positive leads) for onset and duration at lower ILI+ levels (0.1–1%) generated by the borough network model forecast system were more accurate than those generated by the isolation model forecast system (the red regions in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). However, for higher ILI+ levels (1.5–3%), the isolation model forecast system outperformed the network version (blue regions in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005201.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). For forecasts of cumulative ILI+ at all levels evaluated, the borough network model forecast system was more accurate at -5 to 1 week leads while the isolation model forecast system was more accurate at 2 to 5 week leads (
