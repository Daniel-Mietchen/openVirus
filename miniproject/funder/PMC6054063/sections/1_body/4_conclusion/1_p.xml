<p>In the southernmost extreme of epidemic transmission in the Americas, the pattern of dengue cases concentrated during the warm season was associated with different proxies for temperature conditions during the previous autumn and virus pressure from neighboring endemic countries. This provides a valuable opportunity to prepare in advance for a qualitatively strong epidemic during the following summer if the autumn of a given year is propitious for transmission, and enable the onset of early alerts by close follow up of the situation in endemic bordering countries.</p>
