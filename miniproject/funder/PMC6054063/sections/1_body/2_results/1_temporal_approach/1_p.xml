<p>The best model associated the (log transformed) number of dengue cases at the national scale between 2009 and 2016 (Ta) positively with the number of dengue cases in bordering endemic countries and negatively with the DNT during the autumn of the previous year in the central region of the country (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In other words, higher number of cases in Bolivia and south of Brazil were correlated with more intense outbreaks in Argentina, and when a given autumn presented fewer days necessary for transmission, a larger outbreak could be expected the following warm season. The latter result makes sense for the central temperate region, in which temperature is a limiting factor for vector development, whereas in northern subtropical areas DNT values are consistently smaller. The model explained 95.2% of the variability of the data, and the correlation between the response values and those predicted by the model was 0.97. However, the model required three parameters for explaining only eight values. No retro extrapolation of this model to the years 1999â€“2008 could be performed, given that no reports of dengue cases in Bolivia were available for those years.
