<p>When aiming to propose a model able to predict future dengue epidemics, considering the entire time span of epidemics since vector re-invasion (Tb) and deliberately excluding variables with no predicting power, the best model associated the intensity of epidemics with temperature conditions during the previous autumn and winter, estimated as days of possible transmission for each season (

Although at lower explanation percentages (57%), once again the meteorological situation during the previous autumn was a significant predictor of the following outbreak. This model is valuable in providing a risk estimation for the following warm season based on in advance and easily available climatic data as only input. The model predicted an intensity epidemic of class 1 for 2017, as has been verified to date (254 confirmed and 299 probable cases up to epidemiological week 28;
