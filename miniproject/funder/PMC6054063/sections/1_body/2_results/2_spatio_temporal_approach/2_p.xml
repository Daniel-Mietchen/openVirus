<p>When considering &gt;100 cases as an epidemic, the selected model classified the observed values 63% better than chance (
 <italic>K</italic> = 0.63), at a cut-off point of 0.39. No random factors were significant. Results were consistent with the former analysis and associated the occurrence of an epidemic with the DNT of the previous May, the intensity of outbreaks in neighboring countries (Bolivia and Brazil), and positively with human population density (
