<p>When considering &gt;20 cases as an epidemic, the selected model classified the observed values 72% better than chance (
 <italic>K</italic> = 0.72), at a cut-off point of 0.38. None of the tested grouping random factors (1—District, 1—Year and Year—District) significantly improved the model. DNT values in autumn months of the previous year (best represented by May) resulted determinant; once again, dengue cases within a district were associated with mild conditions during the previous autumn (that is, lower DNT values). High DNT during the spring also favored the occurrence of epidemics, along with the number of dengue cases in Bolivia and Paraguay (
