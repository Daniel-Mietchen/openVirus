<p>The model published in 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani (2012)</xref> for the 2009 epidemics was re-run using the occurrence of two or more dengue cases per district in 2016 as a response variable, and the same explanatory variables that predicted the previous outbreak. These were the DPT, distance to water courses, population number (log scale) and the percentage of population change in the period 2001–2010 (last two national censuses). In Argentina, national censuses are typically performed on a decadal basis; therefore, updating of the demographic variables was unfeasible. The model was not very accurate in predicting the new cases (
 <italic>K</italic> = 0.47, correct classification 0.7, sensibility 0.4, specificity 0.9). An alternative explanation for the low predictive model is the difference in the origin of both epidemics. The one in 2009 came down from Bolivia, whereas the latter 2016 outbreak was caused by an unusually high incidence in north-eastern neighboring countries (Brazil and Paraguay). Also, unexpectedly two northeastern provinces did not communicate any cases during 2009 (
