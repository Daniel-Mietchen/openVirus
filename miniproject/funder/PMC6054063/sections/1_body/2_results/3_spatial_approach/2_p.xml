<p>The best model for the occurrence of two or more dengue cases per district included autumn minimum temperature and human population (log scale) as fixed factors, and the province as a random grouping variable (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Mild temperatures during the previous autumn and higher population numbers were associated with the occurrence of dengue cases per district. Prediction accuracy of the observed values was 80% better than chance (
 <italic>K</italic> = 0.8) at a cut off-point of 0.4. Explanatory power of the fixed factors (marginal 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) was 0.74, whereas including the random factor (conditional 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) raised explanation to 0.86.
