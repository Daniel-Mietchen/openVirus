<p>Mean temperature has increased by about 0.5 °C across most of Argentina during the past century. The strongest positive changes since 1960 occurred in the mean summer minimum temperature, even though in this season the mean maximum temperatures mostly decreased, except in Patagonia. In the second half of the past century, there was a general warming in Patagonia where both the maximum and the minimum temperature had a positive trend that was consistent with a more frequent northern flow component in the low levels of the atmosphere. Regarding precipitation, annual positive trends in northern Argentina can be partly attributed to variations in the frequency and intensity of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. The rest of subtropical Argentina was influenced by the southern shift of the western edge of the South Atlantic high that enhanced moist advection from the Atlantic Ocean (
