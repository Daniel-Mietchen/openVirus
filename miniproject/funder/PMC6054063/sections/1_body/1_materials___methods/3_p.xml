<p>Information on dengue cases was obtained from dengue notifications reported in the National Health Surveillance System. During laboratory surveillance (SIVILA), diagnosis was confirmed through the detection of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction or detection of neutralizing antibodies (IgG) by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). After the onset of epidemics in a given city, cases were further confirmed by detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies or NS1 antigen detection. Unknown data regarding department and province of residence was reconstructed using different sources: (1) district and locality in the domicile section of the SIVILA database; (2) direct consultation with the provincial Health Surveillance Area referents; or (3) data of province and district of sample collection consigned in SIVILA. Data of province or country of contagion was reconstructed from epidemiological comments of each case report. Cases registered in the SIVILA database were classified as autochthonous or imported according to the site of acquisition of the infection. All cases whose possible site of infection coincided with the jurisdiction of the patientâ€™s habitual residence, without a history of travel to an area with dengue virus circulation, were defined as autochthonous. All cases with residence in an area without dengue virus circulation and with a history of travel to an area with circulation of the dengue virus in the last 15 days prior to the onset of symptoms were defined as imported. The database was available per district and epidemiological week.</p>
