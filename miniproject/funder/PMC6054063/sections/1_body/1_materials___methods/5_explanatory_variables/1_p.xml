<p>The selection of explanatory variables was based on available data at the spatial and temporal detail required along with previous knowledge of which factors may affect dengue dynamics (see 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani, 2012</xref>). For instance, the distance to the nearest water body has been described as a proxy for the need of people to store water in containers, which eventually become larval habitats for 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, whereas human population increase or decrease in a given locality may reflect habitational and urbanization processes also associated with the generation of potential immature habitats. Variables included were divided in four classes: climatic, epidemiologic, geographic and demographic (definition of variables, units and data sources are shown in
