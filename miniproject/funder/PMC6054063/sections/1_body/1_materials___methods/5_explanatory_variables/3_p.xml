<p>The extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of the dengue virus in the mosquito is the lapse from ingestion of infected blood to the virus transmission in a subsequent feed, and varies as a function of temperature (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Morin, Comrie &amp; Ernst, 2013</xref>). The proportion of the EIP completed per day was calculated for each meteorological station using a temperature dependent model in two hour intervals based on an asymmetric interpolation of the daily maximum and minimum (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">File S2</xref>). With this information, two metrics were estimated. The days of possible transmission (DPT) is the number of days per year that the EIP could be completed before the death of the vector. It adds up the proportion of daily virus development for a number of days equal to the mosquito life expectancy. If unity is reached it is assigned a value of 1, and 0 otherwise (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani, 2012</xref>). This metric has the caveat of having to define a life expectancy, which was set to 15 days based on a previous study (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo et al., 2001</xref>). A value for each district was obtained using the same methodology as for climatic variables described above. The second metric counts the number of days necessary for transmission (DNT). Beginning in each day of the year, the proportion of daily virus development is added up until unity is reached, a lower DNT value indicating higher transmission risk. It was resumed by its monthly and seasonal mean for each of the 15 meteorological stations, all values were averaged and also regional (center, east and west) values were calculated. The relation among DNT, DPT and mean temperature is shown in
