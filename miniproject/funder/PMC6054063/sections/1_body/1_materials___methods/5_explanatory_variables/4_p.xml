<p>The ENSO condition includes El Niño, La Niña and neutral phases. It was considered in the models by means of the monthly Oceanic Niño Index 3.4 (5N-5S, 120E-170W), estimated as a trimester mobile mean (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">NOAA, 2017</xref>). This index, which captures SST anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific, presents a unique value for the entire country. A El Niño event occurs when this anomaly is positive (above 0.5 °C) and a La Niña event occurs when it is negative (below −0.5 °C) (
