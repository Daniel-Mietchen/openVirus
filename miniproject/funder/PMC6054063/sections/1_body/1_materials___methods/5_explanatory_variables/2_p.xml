<p>Climatic variables were calculated based on the Global Surface Summary of the Day, downloaded from NOAA Satellite and Information Service (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">NCDC, 2016</xref>). This data is derived from the Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset, which includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center and considers a minimum of four observations per day. We downloaded daily values from 33 country-wide meteorological stations throughout the country (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>), which presented no missing values for periods longer that 15 consecutive days along the period 1999–2016. To calculate country-wide annual and seasonal values, daily records of all meteorological stations located contiguous to case positive districts for at least one year were averaged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). We considered this subset of 15 stations because in such locations, conditions for the occurrence of cases are guaranteed, i.e., the vector is present in the district (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Vezzani &amp; Carbajo, 2008</xref>) and virus transmission has been reported. Also, three regions were defined following the criterion of dengue cases recompilation of the National Ministry of Health (center, east and west, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>) and values of the stations within each region were averaged. To obtain single mean values of temperature, precipitation, dew point and wind speed per district, monthly means from the period July 2011–June 2016 were averaged for each of the 33 meteorological stations. Such values were interpolated for the whole country (inverse weighted distance method, 15 km square cell grid) and the grid value corresponding to the centroid of each district was extracted and taken as the value for the district. For this interpolation, eight fictitious stations were added at the northwestern limit of the country, in the high Andes range, which were assigned the lowest values in the lowlands for each climatic variable. As no stations are present in the region, low values were needed to limit the interpolation to the west.
