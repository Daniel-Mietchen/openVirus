<p>From a database available per week at the district level, we considered cases between 2009 and 2016 grouped by district and epidemiological year. This analysis was restricted to case positive districts for at least one year and contiguous to any of the available 33 meteorological stations. The combination of both conditions resulted in a subset of 15 districts retained (squares in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). Two alternative dichotomic response variables were defined. Of the first, a value of 1 was assigned to a district in a given year if &gt;20 cases were reported that year, a value of 0 otherwise (30% of the database is classified as positive; the number of positive district does not differ when considering the threshold between 15 and 20 cases). In the second, a value of 1 was assigned to a district in a given year if &gt;100 cases were reported, a value of 0 otherwise (20% of the database classified as positive). Both were modeled in a GLM with binomial error distribution and link logit. Explanatory variables included were climatic and cases in endemic neighboring countries (
