<p>Tb. Annual cumulative number of dengue cases at the country level between 1999 and 2016. Acknowledging different surveillance data quality, the analysis of this dataset attempted to predict the risk of future outbreaks including all available information. Given that the number of cases presents a random component and too much dispersion, the response variable was classified in four categories of epidemic intensity: 0 (0 cases), 1 (1–1,000), 2 (1,001–5,000), 3 (&gt;5,000) (

Explanatory variables describing El Niño events during the summer and dengue cases in bordering countries were excluded because the time span in which they are calculated restrict anticipating power.
