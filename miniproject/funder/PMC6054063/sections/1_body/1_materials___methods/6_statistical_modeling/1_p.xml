<p>Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) can treat data with errors that do not follow a normal distribution, and include random terms (grouping variables) to account for temporal or spatial correlation. Error distribution was selected in each analysis according to the definition of the response variable (Gaussian, Poisson or dichotomic binomial). First, univariate analyses were run (results in

Then, a forward stepwise procedure was performed in which centered explanatory variables were entered one-by-one, along with quadratic relations and two-way interactions. Colinearity issues were first assessed considering correlation matrices (
