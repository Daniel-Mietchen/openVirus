<p>For Gaussian and Poisson distributions, the percentage of explanation achieved was calculated as the deviance explained by the selected model divided by the deviance of the null model. For dichotomic models, as the output variable of the binomial model lies between 0 and 1, a threshold probability must be selected to distinguish positivity from negativity (dengue occurrence and absence, respectively). All possible cut-off points from 0.01 to 0.99 were assessed to select an optimum cut-off point (cp) which maximized the classification effectiveness of the model. This was evaluated by applying the Kappa index (K) to assess improvement of classification of the model over chance (
