<p>To analyze the yearly temporality and spatial distribution of dengue cases in Argentina along the period 1999â€“2016, three methodological approaches were followed: (1) the 
 <italic>temporal approach</italic> aimed to identify the years in which the most important outbreaks occurred in association with environmental variables and propose a risk estimation for future epidemics; (2) the 
 <italic>spatio-temporal approach</italic> intended to identify which variables explain the occurrence of local outbreaks through time, taking into consideration the spatial variation country-wide; and (3) the 
 <italic>spatial approach</italic> put particular emphasis in the 2016 epidemics, to describe the geographical distribution of dengue cases and identify its environmental drivers.
