<p>Where dengue is epidemic, the occurrence of an outbreak depends on virus arrival, the presence of a susceptible human population, a competent vector population and adequate environmental conditions for virus development and transmission. Therefore, dengue dynamics is affected by multiple mechanisms, in which temperature is an important determinant of mosquito traits relevant to transmission, namely the biting rate, egg and immature development, adult survival and fecundity, and development time of the virus in the mosquito (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>). While both seasonal and inter-annual climatic variability influence the geographical distribution of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic>, other factors also determine habitat suitability. Importantly, the successful exploitation of artificial containers as larval habitats, which translates in a high domestic condition of the vector, allows 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> to persist in regions that may otherwise be unsuitable based solely on climate (
