<p>Despite its recent history of epidemics, several studies with different geographic scopes have been performed to study dengue dynamics in Argentina. The spatio-temporal pattern of dengue cases during the 2009 epidemic has been analyzed within a city (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Seijo et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Estallo et al., 2014</xref>) and at the country scale (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani, 2012</xref>). Regarding the 2016 outbreak, studies have been undertaken only at the city scale (
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Rotela et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo et al., 2018</xref>). As no country-wide comprehensive analysis has been performed so far, and given the recent upsurge of the disease, the objective of this work was to identify the environmental factors that trigger epidemic events in Argentina by analyzing the spatio-temporal pattern of dengue cases since the re-emergence of the disease.
