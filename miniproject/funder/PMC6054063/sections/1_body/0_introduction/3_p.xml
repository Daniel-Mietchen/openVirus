<p>In Argentina, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is distributed along temperate and subtropical latitudes (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Vezzani &amp; Carbajo, 2008</xref>). Adult activity is concentrated in the warm season throughout its distribution and is absent during winter in temperate zones (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo &amp; Vezzani, 2015</xref>). As neighboring countries to the northeast (Brazil and Paraguay) and northwest (Bolivia) are endemic for dengue, Argentina represents the southern limit of dengue transmission in South America with epidemic outbreaks concentrated in the warm season (November to May) (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani, 2012</xref>). In this transmission fringe, dengue re-emerged in 1998 causing epidemic outbreaks of different magnitudes in tight association with the incidence in endemic neighboring countries (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>). Before 2016, the biggest outbreak had occurred in 2009, with nearly 27,000 cases of DEN 1, followed by 2013, in which 2,922 cases were reported and co-circulation of DEN 1, 2 and 4 was verified (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">MSN, 2015</xref>). In 2016, the biggest dengue epidemic in the country so far was experienced, concomitant with first to date autochthonous transmission of Zika and chikungunya (26 and 322 confirmed cases, respectively) (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">MSN, 2016</xref>). Also, a recent outbreak of yellow fever has been reported in Brazil with over 1,000 confirmed cases (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, 2018</xref>). These arboviruses are all transmitted in urban settings by the same mosquito vector, 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref>). There is currently no antiviral therapy against dengue, and although the vaccine CYD-TDV “Dengvaxia
 <sup>®</sup>” has been approved in the country (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">ANMAT, 2017</xref>), the development of haemorragic dengue in a first infection after vaccination has been recently reported (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2017</xref>). Therefore, preventing contact between mosquitoes and people is still considered the main tool in the struggle against dengue.
