<p>Spatio-temporal models of dengue cases distribution between 2009 and 2016 presented significant association with the same type of variables, prioritizing the days necessary for transmission during autumn months and the incidence in neighboring endemic countries. These models also lack predictive power and are particularly sensitive to the characteristics of the on course epidemics. This could also be appreciated when comparing 2009 and 2016 spatial models, in light of the poor correspondence in terms of numbers and geographical distribution of positive districts that presented the 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Carbajo, Cardo &amp; Vezzani (2012)</xref> model for the 2009 epidemics to predict the situation in 2016. Both main dengue outbreaks in Argentina started in locations close to endemic borders and further expanded to other localities, however their origin was different. In 2009, the epidemic was triggered by high incidence in Bolivia, spreading south from the northwest, whereas in 2016 it started in the northeast, due to high incidence in south Brazil and Paraguay. For this reason, the proper identification of imported cases is especially relevant during transmission onset. We also found no relation between El Niño events and dengue patterns. It has been described that river flow of water courses located within the northeast region of the country are strongly affected by ENSO events, whereas those located in the northwest region are not (

This may partly explain the lack of association of dengue outbreaks and El Niño in Argentina, as described elsewhere, however we were unable to test this hypothesis due to the short history of northeast and northwest derived epidemics in the country.
