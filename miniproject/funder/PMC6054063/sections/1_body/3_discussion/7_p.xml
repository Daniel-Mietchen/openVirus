<p>The systematic data gathering of dengue cases in a country-wide system allows for the constant updating of the epidemiological situation, as well as the identification of high risk areas to prioritize prevention and control measures both at the communitarian and individual levels. The strength of the 2016 outbreak manifests the flaws of the mitigation strategies. This, in conjunction with a higher dengue incidence in neighboring countries and the introduction of other arboviruses transmitted by the same vector (Zika, chikungunya, and potentially yellow fever), forecast a complex scenario which claims for an integrative research approach with joint work from the areas of education, infrastructure and health. Along with the need to develop better and faster diagnostic methods, we need to achieve consciousness in the population, whose contribution is essential. The optimal use of models to inform policy decisions requires a continuous dialogue between the multidisciplinary infectious disease dynamics community and decision makers (
