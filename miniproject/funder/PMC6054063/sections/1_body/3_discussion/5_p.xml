<p>The geographic distribution of dengue-positive districts during the 2016 epidemics was positively associated with minimum autumn temperature and human population, the latter variable being also associated with the 2009 outbreak (

Also, larger cities usually present precarious and overcrowded conditions, and are therefore more susceptible to experiencing an outbreak (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Brunkard et al., 2007</xref>). This is combined with a large number of artificial containers due to uncontrolled urbanization and land uses linked to urban areas (e.g., cemeteries, rubbish and tire deposits), which represent optimum habitats for immature vector development. Within the spatial model, the inclusion of Province as a random grouping factor may reflect non biological features, such as asymmetries in case records or in the efficiency of prevention and control interventions. The total absence of cases reports during 2009 in some northeastern provinces is an extreme example of this issue. These areas experienced unreported transmission, which could have substantially affected the predictability of the 2009 model as it occurred to
