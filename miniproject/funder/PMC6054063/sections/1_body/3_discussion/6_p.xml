<p>Comparing dengue distribution models may be problematic because of differing modeling approaches and scales, the diverse quality of the data used, and the selection of variables associated with disease distribution (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2015</xref>). Further issues arise in the particular case of Argentina due to its geography. It constitutes one of the potential areas of transmission expansion and intensification, where many models do not agree in their predictions (
 <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2015</xref>). It extends along 3,800 km including a gradient of transmission risk due to climatic variables roughly decreasing from north to south, but almost a third of the population lives at the transmission fringe in the center-east of the country. The epidemic inter-annual pattern is irregular, with frequent virus circulation in the north and large sporadic outbreaks extending to almost half of the country. This implies that the maximum geographic extension does not repeat regularly and may respond to particular conditions occurring in certain years. Global models are not aimed at identifying these particular events, what would need a spatial and temporal detail not yet implemented or simply not available globally. Although the inclusion of demographic and socio-economic factors has improved global models (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Astr√∂m et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Mordecai et al., 2017</xref>), its application in Argentina would require a district detail to account for the internal heterogeneity in, for example, the geographical distribution of income along the country.
