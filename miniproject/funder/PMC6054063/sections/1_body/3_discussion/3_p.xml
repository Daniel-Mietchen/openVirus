<p>Including information of the years 1999â€“2008, we reached a model only relying on in advance climatic conditions. In this way, with easy-available temperature data we can anticipate if the following year will present an epidemic of mid-high intensity. Models predicting epidemic intensity rather than number of cases are more robust to particular and/or stochastic conditions of a given year. The presented model properly predicted the 2017 situation; however as only two major outbreaks (2009 and 2016) have occurred so far in Argentina to train the models, more time is needed to test its efficiency.</p>
