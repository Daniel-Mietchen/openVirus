<p>We built a temporal model based on the period 2009â€“2016, which lacks predictive power because it relies on the ongoing year virus pressure from endemic neighboring countries. However, it does provide a hint regarding the conditions of the previous autumn. If the autumn of a given year is propitious for transmission, caution should be taken for the following summer and the situation in bordering endemic areas should be followed up closely. We propose that mild autumns represent an advantage for mosquito vector populations. In temperate regions with no mosquito reproduction during winter, this advantage could manifest as a larger egg bank deposited during autumn from which the adult population will re-emerge in spring.</p>
