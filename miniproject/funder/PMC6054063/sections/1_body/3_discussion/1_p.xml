<p>Modeling disease outbreaks in time and space is a powerful tool to qualitatively predict future potential epidemics (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Myers et al., 2000</xref>). Given the epidemic nature of dengue in Argentina, virus pressure from endemic neighboring countries along with climatic conditions are crucial to explain disease dynamics. Remarkably, in all three methodological approaches used to analyze the spatial and temporal pattern of dengue cases, different proxies for temperature of the previous autumn were among the best predictors. The number of days necessary for transmission presented higher explanatory power than the raw variable in two approaches. Although this proxy is mainly used for transmission risk calculations, it may well resume conditions for the mosquito. As temperatures seldom reach extreme inhibition values during autumn, the temporal detail and the inclusion of temperature amplitude in its calculation may favor DNT instead of mean temperature.
