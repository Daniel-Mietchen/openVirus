<p id="Par14">All pig slaughterhouse workers, farmers and traders who visited the slaughterhouses to deliver pigs or to purchase meat, animal health personnel and others working in the slaughterhouses were requested to participate in the study. For pig sampling, an estimated seroprevalence of 20% was assumed, precision level of 5% and at 95% confidence level, giving a minimum sample size of 246 per sampling period. The slaughterhouses were visited each consecutive working day for 10Â days to sample the pigs. For Uthiru (Kiambu) slaughterhouse, we sampled every other pig to a maximum of 25 per day. For Kisumu and Bondo (Siaya) slaughterhouse where volume of pigs slaughtered is low, all the pigs presented for slaughter on each day of sampling were targeted for sampling.</p>
