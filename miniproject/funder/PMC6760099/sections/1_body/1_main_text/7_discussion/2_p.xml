<p id="Par28">Our study provides evidence of intense circulation of swine influenza virus among pig populations in two distinct geographical regions of Kenya, located &gt; 350 kilometres apart, with the high average seroprevalence of 20%. The higher prevalence reported in Bondo (34.5%) and Kisumu (22.6%) slaughterhouses located in Western Kenya may be due to the free-range nature of pig production there, when compared with Uthiru slaughterhouse in the central region of the country where confined production system is practiced. Our findings also point to higher influenza transmission during the colder months (July–September) as supported by almost two-thirds of the seropositive pigs sampled during this period. In addition, all the PCR positive samples were collected during the cold season. Trends in human seasonal influenza in Kenya have also shown higher transmission during the colder months of June to August [
