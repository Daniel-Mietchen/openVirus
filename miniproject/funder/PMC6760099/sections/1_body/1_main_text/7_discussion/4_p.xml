<p id="Par30">In conclusion, our study reports detection of influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) among pigs and high seroprevalence adding to the evidence of intense circulation among pigs from the few studies in the East Africa region. The increasing commercialization of pig farming in Kenya, provides a suitable environment for exposure and occurrence of zoonotic events related to influenza A virus [

The evolution of reassortant viruses and their potential transmission to humans is unpredictable making routine monitoring at the pig-human interface a priority. Virological surveillance offers a mechanism to detect early any changes in the antigenic structure or zoonotic transmission events.
