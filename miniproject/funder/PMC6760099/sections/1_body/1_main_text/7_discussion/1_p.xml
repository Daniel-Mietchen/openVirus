<p id="Par27">We found evidence of both active influenza A virus infection and widespread exposure (seropositivity) among pigs but no infection among humans in a linked human-animal study in three slaughterhouses in Kenya. Influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) virus RNA and antibodies, which is associated with seasonal human influenza in Kenya, was detected in the pig samples from central and western Kenya, suggesting either persistent human to pig transmission of influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) or establishment and continued circulation of influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) among pig populations [
