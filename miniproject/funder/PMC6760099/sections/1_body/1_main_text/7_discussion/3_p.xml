<p id="Par29">The occurrence of influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 virus in pigs has been documented in most regions of the world, including Africa where it has been reported in Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Studies have shown that when influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) circulates in local pig populations it continues to undergo antigenic changes over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The influenza A virus seroprevalence reported in our study was comparable to 17% reported in an earlier study in Kenya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, studies from other countries showed varied findings ranging from 5% in Uganda to 49% in Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The variations in prevalence reported in the studies may be due to differences in sampling methodology (farm level vs live market vs slaughterhouses), and pig populations in the study area. The Southeast Asia region has large pig farms that likely support higher influenza virus transmission [
