<p id="Par31">Our study had several limitations. We were not able to collect demographic data such as age, sex and farm level factors among the sampled pigs to allow for testing for associations with seropositivity. While most of the pigs brought for slaughter were mature adults, they were mostly delivered by traders who would not provide reliable farm level data on the sampled pigs. Another limitation is that we did not conduct haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to confirm the influenza strains circulating among pigs. However, another study in 2010â€“2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] reported 72% of seropositive pigs had influenza virus (A/H1N1/pdm09) by HI, findings which might reflect the diversity of influenza virus among pigs in our study.
