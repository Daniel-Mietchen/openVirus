<p>The sequences of LASV isolated in humans are readily available in Genbank, thanks in particular to the research of Andersen et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Siddle et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They mainly concern lineages II and IV circulating around Ekpoma in Nigeria and Kenema in Sierra Leone, respectively. In this article, we use the new Nigeria sequences published in 2018 because they are localized by state. For Sierra Leone, however, we use those of 2015 [
 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] differentiating sequences from Kenema, Bo, and Liberia. The sequences from humans used in our study are listed in
