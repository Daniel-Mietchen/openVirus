<p>In the absence of the complete S segment, a combination of partial GP and NP sequences to increase genome information offers a good compromise (1612 nt together in one analysis instead of two separate analyses with GP, 900 nt, and NP, 712 nt, respectively). This combination with two partial genes in the open reading frame has never been done before. However, our analysis showed more recent dates of divergence compared to studies done on the complete S segment. For instance, the date of divergence in Sierra Leone is 107 (91–124) years in our analysis versus 118 (102–137) in the Andersen study [

We therefore suggest that the dates presented in this analysis are slightly underestimated because we used a shorter nucleotide sequence than the complete S segment (1612 nt instead of ±3400 nt). As we consider that the bias is similar for each strain, the comparison between the different viral populations remains valuable.
