<p>The viral population from Malian rodents is the oldest (96 years), and we can suggest that the virus was then exported to Faranah, South Upper Guinea, 20 years later, and lately to Sierra Leone with another jump of 20 years. The viral population found in Denguedou, a locality between the Sierra Leonean/Guinean border and Guekedou, is probably a signature of human displacements during the civil war in Sierra Leone (1994–2004) as it emerged only 20 years ago. During that time, 700,000 Sierra Leonean refugees arrived in Forest Guinea and were dispatched all along the border. The times of the most recent common ancestor (tmrca) estimated in our study is higher than the one estimated in Lalis et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] because we used the GP in addition to a short NP fragment. The recent viral population discovered in Madina Oula in 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] emerged between those observed in Denguedou and those observed in Kenema. These sequences are phylogenetically very different as they cluster to Liberian strains. The village of Madina Oula regularly receives some loggers from Forest Guinea who probably imported this strain. Finally, the strains found in the Nigerian 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> from Ekpoma are quite recent, ±55 years, similarly to those found in the Kenema area.
