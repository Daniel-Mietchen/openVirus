<p>Phylogenetic clustering in the clades representing Kenema (within lineage IV) and Ekpoma (in lineage II) show that human-derived LASV sequences are significantly ancestral to those obtained from the 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> rodent, regardless of time of sampling. Normally, one would have expected rodent-to-human transmission (where long-term evolution of the virus takes place in rodents and spills over intermittently to humans) to be consistent with the LASV strains from 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> being generally ancestral or at least randomly interspersed on the phylogenetic tree compared to those obtained from humans [
 <xref rid="B13-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, our results may suggest the occurrence of human-to-rodent transmission (reverse zoonosis).
