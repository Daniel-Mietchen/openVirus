<p>During epidemics of certain diseases, patterns of ancestry and descent have helped determine that virus routes of transmission were from humans to other mammals. For instance, investigations in Sri Lanka and Mexico concerning Influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) emergence in a cluster of farms showed that virus transmission between humans preceded infection in swine [

The idea that humans may function in some circumstances as “reservoir hosts” of LASV is counter-intuitive, as infection is usually associated with acuteness, severe illness and mortality. However, there are also data demonstrating that up to 70% of LASV seropositive humans show benign or no symptoms [
