<p>Lassa fever causes a deadly zoonotic disease that kills 5000 or more people every year in West Africa [
 <xref rid="B1-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), which causes this illness, is borne by rodents. The Natal multimammate mouse 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> is recognized as the main LASV reservoir while the Guinea multimammate mouse 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> and the African wood mouse 
 <italic>Hylomyscus pamfi</italic> were recently identified as additional hosts [
 <xref rid="B2-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-biology-09-00026" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Primary (rodent-to-human) transmission of the virus occurs when humans come in contact with excreta or body fluids of infected rodents. Human-to-human spread is regarded as secondary. Further knowledge on the epidemiology of Lassa fever, particularly at the rodentâ€“human interface, is needed to control this disease.
