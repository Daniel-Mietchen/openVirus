<p>The influenza C virus is a member of the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, enveloped and segmented negative-sense RNA virus with seven segments. The fourth segment of the viral genome encodes hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which determines the major antigenicity of the virus and has a variety of functions in the viral replication cycle. At least nine antigenic sites (A-1 to A-5 and B-1 to B-4) of the HE glycoproteins are proposed; of them, amino acid positions responsible for four antigenic sites have been identified [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In addition, glycosylation of the proteins also affects the virusâ€™ antigenicity [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The influenza C virus utilizes the HE glycoprotein as an attachment protein to a cellular receptor of the virus, 9-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The HE glycoprotein also catalyzes fusion of the viral envelope with endocytic vesicles [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Proteolytic cleavage of the protein into two subunits, HE1 and HE2, is an essential prerequisite for the membrane fusion activity [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the HE glycoprotein has esterase activity that functions as the receptor-destroying enzyme to release the progeny of viral particles from infected cells [
