<p>Differences in ecological, epidemiological, and evolutionary characteristics between influenza A, B, and C viruses are of great interest. Apart from antigenic analyses using viral isolates and sera or monoclonal antibodies against the viruses [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], phylogenetic analyses using genetic sequence data of the HE gene could provide important information about the evolution of the influenza C virus. However, because isolation of the influenza C virus using cell cultures, such as MDCK and LLC-MK
 <sub>2</sub> cells requires technical proficiency and intensive observation of inoculated cells, isolation of the virus is rarely performed. This is one of the reasons why sequence data of the virus are still limited.
