<p>The influenza C virus was first isolated in 1947 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Since then, it has been reported that antigenically and genetically-distinct lineages of the virus are co-circulating [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the influenza A virus, there are two subtypes currently circulating among human populations; A/H1N1 and A/H3N2. In contrast to the influenza C virus, antigenically and genetically-similar strains of seasonal influenza A virus are circulating worldwide at a given time; and new antigenic variants, which are descendants of formerly circulating viruses, replace the previous viruses and become a predominant strain [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The influenza B virus does not have subtypes, but currently circulating influenza B viruses are divided into two phylogenetically and antigenically distinct lineages: B/Victoria/2/87-like (B/Victoria) lineage and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (B/Yamagata) lineage [
