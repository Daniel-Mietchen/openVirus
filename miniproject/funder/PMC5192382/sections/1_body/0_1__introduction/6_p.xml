<p>We recently reported the analysis of the full genome sequence of 102 strains of the influenza C virus and unveiled a history of frequent reassortment of the virus [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Reports and sequence data of the virus from many parts of the world have also been increasing [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this study, we exploited sequence data available to date, many of which are from our recent study, with phylogenetic techniques to see the evolutionary pathway of the influenza C virus over a period of 68 years. We also compared the evolution of influenza C viruses with those of influenza A and B viruses.
