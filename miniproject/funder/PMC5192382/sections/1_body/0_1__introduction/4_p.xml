<p>The seasonal influenza A virus accumulates mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, which encodes a major surface antigenic protein of the virus [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The virus causes annual epidemics by continuous antigenic change (antigenic drift), which allows viruses to evade herd immunity [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, positive selection that results in cumulative mutations in antigenic sites of the HA gene through evolutionary history has been observed [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The HA protein of the influenza A virus can also gain or lose glycosylation sites, which can alter the antigenicity of the virus [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There is a selection pressure on antigenic sites in the HA gene of influenza B viruses as well, although it is considered weaker than that of the influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Buonagurio et al. and Muraki et al. reported little or no accumulation of mutations in the HE gene of the influenza C virus in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively; although they analyzed limited numbers of sequences available then (&lt;20 strains) [
