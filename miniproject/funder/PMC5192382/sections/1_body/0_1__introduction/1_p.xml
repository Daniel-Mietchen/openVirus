<p>The influenza C virus is predominantly found in humans, and infection in humans can cause respiratory and febrile symptoms that are similar to those caused by influenza A and B viruses. Influenza C virus infections are generally mild and self-limited but can also cause more severe lower respiratory tract illness, such as bronchitis and pneumonia [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The infection is considered common based on high seroprevalence [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The influenza C virus has also been found in pigs, and there are some reports about interspecies transmission of the virus between humans and pigs [

 <xref rid="B7-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, pigs are not considered to play a significant role in the transmission cycle of the viruses in humans [
