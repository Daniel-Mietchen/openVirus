<p>In this study, we analyzed the evolutionary pathway of the influenza C virus using 218 viral sequences collected over 68 years. Slow evolution of the influenza C virus is characterized by weak and infrequent selective bottlenecks and a small number of mutations that possibly alter antigenicity. Most sequence data of the influenza C virus are from one country, Japan; while our datasets for influenza A and B viruses consist of sequence data from various parts of the world. There may be selection bias for the influenza C virus. Data collection from a restricted area, however, could lead to overestimation of the strength of selective bottlenecks. Even with the possibility of not underestimation, but overestimation, our analyses found that selective bottlenecks for the influenza C virus are weak and infrequent through its evolution pathway.</p>
