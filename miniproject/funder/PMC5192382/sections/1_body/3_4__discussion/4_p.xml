<p>One limitation of this study is that we analyzed only one segment, the HE gene, of the influenza C virus. Analysis of the only one segment might lead to some loss of information. However, it is difficult to analyze evolutionary characteristics of the virus with the whole genome because of a complicated history of reassortment [
