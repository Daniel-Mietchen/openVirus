<p>It is still unknown why the C/Taylor lineage, the C/Aichi lineage, the C/Mississippi lineage, and the C/Yamagata lineage disappeared, whereas the C/Kanagawa lineage and the C/Sao Paulo lineage persist. The existing two lineages experienced surge of genetic diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As genetic diversity is associated with effective population size, occasional outbreak with a large number of infected people, which can lead to increase of genetic diversity and fitness of the virus, might be required to prevent it from extinction. It would be intriguing to see whether the high and constant genetic diversity of the influenza C virus would lead to the emergence of novel lineages that would co-circulate with existing lineages.
