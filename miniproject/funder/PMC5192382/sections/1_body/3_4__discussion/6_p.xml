<p>Transmission dynamics, such as age at infection and global circulation patterns have also been suggested to affect the evolutionary pathway of influenza A and B viruses [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. There could be unique transmission dynamics of the influenza C virus affecting its evolution in addition to unique virological, immunological, and epidemiological characteristics of the virus. Further studies, combining experimental, epidemiological, and theoretical analyses, are needed for better understanding of the evolutionary and ecological aspects of the influenza C virus.
