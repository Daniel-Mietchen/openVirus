<p>The unique evolutionary characteristics of the influenza C virus, have resulted in multiple lineages of the virus co-circulating in different countries. This is similar to the behavior of the influenza B virus whereby multiple lineages of the virus co-circulate, and antigenic variants appear to be slower than in influenza A viruses [
