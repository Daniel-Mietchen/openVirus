<p>Further questions arise, such as what mechanisms underlie the evolutionary differences between influenza A, B, and C viruses. Selective bottlenecks of the HA/HE gene of influenza viruses at the population level must be mainly driven by the immune pressure of herd immunity [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Multiple factors must be important to limit the genetic diversity of influenza viruses, including infection incidence rate, seroprevalence, protective immune response, duration of the immunity, and broadness of immunity against heterologous viruses [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. A rare selective bottleneck for the influenza C virus suggests unique characteristics of the virus and its infections. Seroprevalence and incidence of the influenza C virus do not seem as high as those of the influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to understand the epidemiological and immunological aspects of influenza C viruses, such as whether multiple exposures throughout life are common, whether immunity against the virus can prevent reinfection, how long the immunity lasts, and whether the infection can induce strain non-specific immunity to constrain genetic diversity. We have limited knowledge of the epidemiological and immunological aspects of influenza C viruses, which must be responsible for its evolutionary characteristics.
