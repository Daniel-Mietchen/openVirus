<p>The evolutionary history was inferred by using PhyML 3.0 with the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Gamma distribution was used to model the evolutionary rate differences between sites; the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable. A fast approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) was calculated for branch supports [
