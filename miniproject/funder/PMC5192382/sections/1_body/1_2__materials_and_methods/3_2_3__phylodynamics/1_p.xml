<p>Time-scaled phylogenies were inferred using a relaxed molecular clock model in a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework with the BEAST program version 1.8.2 that incorporates virus sampling dates (year) to concurrently estimate phylogenetic trees, rates of nucleotide substitution, and the dynamics of population genetic diversity using a coalescent-based approach [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We performed at least 20 million generations sampled every 1000 runs. After the appropriate removal of burn-in (10% of samples), a summary maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred. The MCC trees were also used to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) among contemporaneous (same year) and posterior (at least three years) strains [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Evolutionary rate of influenza A/H1N1pdm virus were not analyzed in this study because of insufficient duration of circulation of the virus (ca. six years). The past population dynamics of each lineage were compared using a Bayesian skyride analysis in BEAST, which utilizes a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) smoothing to estimate the changes in relative genetic diversity in successive coalescent intervals [
