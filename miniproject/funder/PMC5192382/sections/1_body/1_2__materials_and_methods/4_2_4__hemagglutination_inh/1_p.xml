<p>The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was done as previously described [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, viruses were isolated from throat swabs by inoculating them into the amniotic cavity of nine-day-old embryonated hen’s eggs. Fifty microliters of 16 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of virus suspension per ml was added to each well containing 50 μL of two fold-diluted monoclonal antibodies [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 100 μL of 0.5% chicken erythrocytes was added to all wells, and plates were stored for 60 min at 4 °C. The HI titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest antibody dilution which completely inhibited hemagglutination.
