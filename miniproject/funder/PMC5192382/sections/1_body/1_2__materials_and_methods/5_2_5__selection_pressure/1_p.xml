<p>Relative numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions (dN and dS, respectively) through evolutionary history were analyzed to see selective pressure by HyPhy version 2.2.4 for the entire gene (global model) and for each codon (single-likelihood ancestor counting(SLAC) method) [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Selection pressure of influenza A/H1N1pdm virus were not analyzed in this study because of insufficient duration of circulation of the virus (ca. six years). Sites where dNâ€“dS showed positive and negative values were inferred as positively- and negatively-selected, respectively. A
