<p>Nucleotide sequences of the HE gene (nucleotide position from 64 to 1989 corresponding to the complete coding region excluding the signal peptide) of 102 influenza C viruses were analyzed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to our data, all available full-length nucleotide sequence data of the HE gene of the virus detected from humans were obtained from the Influenza Virus Resource [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and GISAID [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Sequence data of the HA gene of human influenza A and B viruses were also obtained from the Influenza Virus Resource database; we randomly selected a maximum of 20 strains per year for each dataset: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B. Sequence data used are available in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00321">Supplementary Materials (Data S1â€“S4)</xref>. Sequence data of C/Yamagata/10/81 (GenBank accession number: M11641) were excluded from phylodynamics analyses described below because the strain is suspected of cross-contamination with C/AnnArbor/50 [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For evolutionary analyses of the influenza A/H1N1 virus, sequence data collected between 1977 and 2008, and data collected in 2009 or after, were analyzed separately because the A/H1N1 virus which circulated before and after the pandemic in 2009 must have undertaken a different evolutionary pathway [
