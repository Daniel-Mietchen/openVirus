<p>Of all sequence data of the full length of the HE gene (excluding a region encoding signal peptide) of the influenza C virus collected from 14 countries between 1947 and 2014, we identified 218 unique sequences. Of the 218 strains, 137 were from Japan, 32 were from Australia, and 15 were from the USA (

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Although most strains were collected in Japan, strains from other countries were also scattered in the phylogenetic tree without any particular geographic clustering. For example, viruses in all lineages, except the C/Aichi lineage, were found in Europe. This suggests that there is no “indigenous” lineage, and multiple lineages are circulating globally.
