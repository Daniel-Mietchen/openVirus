<p>We then compared genetic diversity of the lineages of the influenza C virus. Genetic diversity of the C/Kanagawa lineage peaked around 2002 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f002">Figure 2</xref>). There was a large outbreak of the influenza C virus between 1999 and 2004 in Japan [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The great genetic diversity during that time probably reflects the population size during the outbreak. Interestingly, C/Kanagawa lineage strains circulating at the time can be classified into at least three antigenically close, but distinct, groups defined by monoclonal antibodies (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-08-00321-t002">Table 2</xref>). The variation of antigenicity can be attributed to a large outbreak and great genetic diversity. C/Kanagawa lineage strains collected in or after 2012 were also analyzed for their antigenic characteristics; we found that all strains belonged to a single antigenic group (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-08-00321-t002">Table 2</xref>). The results are compatible with our finding that genetic diversity has decreased since the peak around 2002 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Along with a decline of genetic diversity of the C/Kanagawa lineage, that of the C/Sao Paulo lineage has increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, genetic diversity for all lineages of influenza C virus has remained high and constant.
