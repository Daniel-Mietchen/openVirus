<p>We then compared the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of contemporaneous and posterior strains among influenza A, B, and C viruses. tMRCA of all lineages of influenza B and C viruses has been linearly increasing because of co-circulation of multiple lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). We did not plot the tMRCA of all influenza A viruses (A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm, and A/H3N2 together) because they are not monophyly; they originated independently from avian or swine influenza viruses. The disappearance of the C/Mississippi lineage and the C/Yamagata lineage in 2005 was responsible for the sudden descent of tMRCA at the time for all lineages of influenza C virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). In contrast, a short and constant tMRCA of the influenza A virus was observed, which must be due to the continuous emergence of new antigenic variants and the replacement of formerly circulating strains by new strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). The most fit strains from diversified viruses were selected by the selective bottleneck [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Short and constant tMRCA of contemporaneous strains, which can be seen for the influenza A virus, reflects a continuous selective bottleneck, while the linear increasing trend of tMRCA of contemporaneous strains means the absence of such selective bottlenecks. Fluctuation of tMRCA for two lineages of the influenza B virus suggests that such a selective bottleneck was present approximately every eight years for each lineage of the influenza B virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Similarities and differences between the two lineages of the influenza B virus were discussed well elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Selective bottleneck was also found at genetic lineage level of the influenza C virus, although tMRCA of each lineage of the influenza C virus has kept increasing, except the C/Yamagata lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). The selective bottleneck for the influenza C virus was, therefore, weak and infrequent.
