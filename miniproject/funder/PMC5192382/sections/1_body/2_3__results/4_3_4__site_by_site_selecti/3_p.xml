<p>Finally, we looked at whether the number of 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sequons (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr, where Xaa is any amino acid except Pro) has increased in the HE1 region through evolution to alter antigenicity, as observed in influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the numbers did not increase at all for any lineages of influenza C virus (

 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites has been maintained at six for most influenza C viruses.
