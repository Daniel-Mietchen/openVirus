<p>We also conducted lineage-by-lineage analyses to see how selection on antigenic sites worked within each lineage (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00321">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The analyses still calculated positive values for some antigenic sites, although there was no statistical significance. As mentioned above, there were three antigenically close but distinct groups in the C/Kanagawa lineage around 2002. Amino acids at positions 190 and 212 are associated with the antigenic characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-08-00321-t001">Table 1</xref>). We found positive values of dNâ€“dS for the two sites in the C/Kanagawa lineage (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00321">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The site could be under weak positive selection by immune pressure.
