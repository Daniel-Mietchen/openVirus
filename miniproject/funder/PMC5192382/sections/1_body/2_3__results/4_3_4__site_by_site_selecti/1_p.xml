<p>Site-by-site selective pressure analyses of the HE gene of the influenza C virus found 101 sites under significant negative selection and no sites under significant positive selection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Although there are no sites under significant positive selection, some sites responsible for antigenicity [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed positive selection pressure (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00321">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and positive blue bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, other positions in antigenic sites showed negative selection pressure (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-08-00321">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and negative blue bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Even within antigenic sites, negative selection pressure can be found if there is a strong functional constraint for amino acid substitution [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, mutation at a structurally adjacent site may be enough to alter antigenicity [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In contrast to antigenic sites, selection pressure for most sites in a receptor-binding domain [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] were under negative selection, as expected (orange and red bars in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f005">Figure 5</xref>), because mutations in these sites must be fatal for the virus.
