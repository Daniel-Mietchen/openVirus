<p>We next analyzed and compared evolutionary characteristics of the influenza C virus HE gene with those of the influenza A and B viruses HA gene at the molecular level. The evolutionary rate was the highest for the influenza A virus (HA gene), followed by the influenza B virus (HA gene) and the influenza C virus (HE gene) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). The difference in the evolutionary rate could result from different strengths of selection pressure on the gene. We, therefore, calculated the relative rate of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations (dN/dS) for the viruses. As expected, the selection pressure (dN/dS) was higher for the influenza A virus than for the two other viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). The evolutionary rates of the first and second positions in the codon were lower in the influenza B virus than in the influenza A virus, whereas the evolutionary rates of the third position in the codon were similar between the influenza A and B viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Therefore, strong positive selection pressure of the influenza A virus can explain its high evolutionary rate compared with the influenza B virus.
