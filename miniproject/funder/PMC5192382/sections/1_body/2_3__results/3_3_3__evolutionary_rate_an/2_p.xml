<p>The strength of selection pressure of the influenza C virus (HE gene) was comparable with that of the influenza B virus (HA gene) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Selection pressure cannot, therefore, explain the slow evolution of the influenza C virus compared with that of the influenza B virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). It is intriguing that the evolutionary rate of not only the first and second positions in the codon, but also of the third position for the influenza C virus are much lower than the corresponding evolutionary rates in influenza A and B viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-08-00321-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). The findings indicate that a natural capability of inducing random mutations in the influenza C virus is inferior to the capability of the other two viruses. Possible explanations for this could be a slow replication cycle [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], low yield of progeny virus in infected individuals [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and high fidelity of viral RNA polymerase (no published evidence to our knowledge) of the influenza C virus.
