 <caption>
  <p>Population dynamics of genetic diversity of each lineage of the influenza C virus. The relative genetic diversity of each lineage of the influenza C virus using the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model. Data are shown after 1985 because few sequences were available before that year. No plots for the C/Aichi lineage and the C/Taylor lineage are presented because of the paucity of sequence data.</p>
