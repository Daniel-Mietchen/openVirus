  <p>Phylogenetic tree for the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene. The evolutionary history was inferred using the PhyML method for the HE gene (1917 positions) of influenza C viruses. Genetic lineages were defined by our previous study [
   <xref rid="B18-viruses-08-00321" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) branch supports at the node to define each lineage are shown. Branches are colored by country.
