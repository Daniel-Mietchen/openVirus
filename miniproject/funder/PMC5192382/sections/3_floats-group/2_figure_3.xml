  <p>Time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of influenza A, B, and C viruses. Temporal trend of tMRCA among contemporaneous (same year) and posterior (at least three years) strains for the HA gene of influenza A and B viruses and the HE gene of the influenza C virus, in panel 
   <bold>A</bold>, 
   <bold>B</bold>, and 
   <bold>C</bold> respectively. We did not plot the tMRCA of all influenza A viruses (A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and A/H1N1pdm together) because they are not monophyly. Additionally, tMRCA of influenza A/H1N1 (before 2009) and influenza A/H1N1pdm (in or after 2009) was calculated separately. Data are shown after 1985, since few sequences were available before that year. Since strains collected over four years are required to calculate tMRCA, sequence data up to 2014 yielded tMRCA up to 2011. No plots for the C/Aichi lineage and the C/Taylor lineage are presented because of the paucity of sequence data.
