 <caption>
  <p>Site-by-site selection pressure for the HE gene of the influenza C virus. Selection pressure (relative number of non-synonymous substitutions minus synonymous substitutions (dNâ€“dS)) on each codon is shown. Amino acid positions between 1 and 14 encoding signal peptides were excluded for the analysis. Selection pressure on antigenic sites (13 positions in total) is colored in blue. Selection pressure on receptor binding sites (11 positions in total) is colored in red (with statistical significance) and orange (no statistical significance). Black and gray bars indicate significant and non-significant selection pressure on the other positions, respectively. Amino acid positions were depicted with bars for antigenic sites under positive selection and receptor binding sites under negative selection.</p>
