 <caption>
  <p>Evolutionary rate and selection pressure of influenza A, B, and C viruses. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Evolutionary rate (nucleotide substitution per site per year); (
   <bold>B</bold>) selection pressure (relative rate of non-synonymous and synonymous mutation); and (
   <bold>C</bold>) relative evolutionary rate of each position in the codon compared with the influenza A/H3N2 virus. In all three panels, results were calculated using data of the HA gene for influenza A and B viruses and the HE gene for the influenza C virus. Error bars show 95% highest posterior density intervals.
