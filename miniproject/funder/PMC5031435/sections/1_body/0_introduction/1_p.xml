<p>Human activity is responsible for global environmental and climate changes, which can negatively impact human health. Uncontrolled urbanization, deforestation, large-scale agriculture, road construction, dam building, and rapid expansion of global trade and air travel are important factors that have been associated with the spread of viruses, including those transmitted by small mammals and arthropods, which are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality rates [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Viruses transmitted by small mammals belong to the families 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Mammarenavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Reptarenavirus</italic> genera) and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> genus) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The small mammal hosts of these viruses are typically chronically infected; however, the viruses do not appear to cause obvious illness in them. Transmission to humans occurs mainly by inhalation of air contaminated with virus particles shed by infected small mammals in their urine, feces, and saliva. Most infections caused by arenaviruses never go beyond causing a “flu-like” illness, but sometimes these symptoms herald the onset of neurologic diseases (e.g., 
 <italic>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus</italic>) or hemorrhagic fevers (e.g., 
 <italic>Junin virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Machupo virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lassa virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Guanarito virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sabia virus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lujo virus</italic>) of varying severity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Infection with hantaviruses can progress to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (e.g., 
 <italic>Sin nombre virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Andes virus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Laguna Negra virus</italic>) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (e.g., 
 <italic>Hantaan virus</italic> and 
 <italic>Dobrava virus</italic>) in Asia and Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) include the most important emergent and re-emergent viral agents worldwide. The arboviruses belong to seven taxonomic families: 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Nairovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genera), 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus), 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus), 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Seadornavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Coltivirus</italic> genera), 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Vesiculovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ephemerovirus</italic> genera), 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Thogotovirus</italic> genus) and 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> (
 <italic>Asfarvirus</italic> genus). They cause a wide range of infections in humans and domestic and wild animals [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. More than 150 arboviruses are known to infect humans, and infection most commonly leads to fever, headache and malaise, but encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever may also occur [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. All viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods have RNA genomes, with the exception of asfarvirus, which has a DNA genome.
