<p>We used SMAvirusChip v1 to screen for the presence of viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods in patients suspected to have malaria who tested negative for malaria by capillary blood test. We also used this assay to screen for the presence of viruses in mosquitoes. The microarray experiments were performed using serum (n = 6) and whole blood (n = 9) samples from the malaria-suspected patients (n = 9) and pools of mosquitoes (n = 4). All clinical and mosquito samples were negative for virus genomes detection. We also spiked one whole blood sample and one pool of mosquitoes with DENV-2 to evaluate the ability of SMAvirusChip to detect viruses in these sample types. Total RNA purified from these samples was analyzed with SMAvirusChip v1, which showed the specific detection of DENV-2 (
