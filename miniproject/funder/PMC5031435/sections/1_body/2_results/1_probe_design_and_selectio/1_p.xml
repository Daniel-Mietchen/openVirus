<p>We retrieved ~9000 viral target sequences from GenBank to design probes for the detection of viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods. Complete or partial nucleotide sequences (as many as possible) of the open reading frame for each virus species were aligned and used to design probes from highly conserved regions, which were selected by either the CLC Main Workbench or SCPrimer software. Probes showing ≥95% identity to the corresponding virus species and &lt;80% identity to non-target sequences were selected. Up to 10 probes were selected for viruses presenting a single genomic segment, and up to three probes per segment were selected for those presenting more than one genomic segment. For 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family viruses, which have 10–12 RNA genomic segments, probes were designed for the genomic segments encoding the structural proteins VP2 and VP5 and the non-structural protein NS3. Fewer probes were selected for viruses with few sequences available in GenBank. Two versions of the SMAvirusChip were designed: SMAvirusChip v1 contains 4209 probes for 409 virus species (109 viruses transmitted by small mammals and 300 arboviruses), and SMAvirusChip v2 contains 4943 probes for 416 virus species (112 viruses transmitted by small mammals and 304 arboviruses) (

A DNA microarray slide with eight identical sub-arrays containing viral probes that were replicated at least three times to complete the array with 15,000 probes, including positive and negative control probes, was designed. The number of probes selected for each virus species multiplied by the number of replicates represents the total number of probes used for each virus species in each sub-array. This number was also used for statistical analysis.
