<p>We initially tested SMAvirusChip with 20 laboratory reference-strain viruses obtained from C6/36 and Vero E6 cell cultures and from the brain of a baby mouse (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, RNAs extracted from uninfected C6/36 or Vero E6 cell cultures were used as controls to analyze cross-hybridization. RNA from each viral and control sample was hybridized to the SMAvirusChip in separate array experiments. The data obtained in the microarray experiments were analyzed with RAF, which showed that the group of probes for each virus tested in each array was the only group showing a mean of signal intensity ≥1 (a value at least double the mean signal intensity of the negative control probes) and that this value was significantly higher (
 <italic>P</italic>-value ≤0.05) than the mean signal intensity of the negative control probes. In contrast, no significant difference was observed between the mean signal intensity of the group of probes of any virus species and the mean signal intensity of the negative control probes when RNA extracted from uninfected cells was used. This last result, together with the specific detection of ZIKV in the brain of a baby mouse, confirms that cellular DNA/RNA does not interfere with the microarray assay.
