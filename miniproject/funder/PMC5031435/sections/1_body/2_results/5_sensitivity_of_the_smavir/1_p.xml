<p>The lower limit of detection for SMAvirusChip v1 was determined using DENV-1 (2.6E10 RNA copies/mL) collected from the supernatant of an infected C6/36 cell culture. Microarray experiments were performed with 10-fold serial dilutions of purified RNA and compared with quantitative real-time RT-PCR data. SMAvirusChip v1 was able to detect as few as 2.6E3 RNA copies/ml, a sensitivity one log
 <sub>10</sub> lower than that measured for quantitative real-time RT-PCR (2.6E2 RNA copies/ml).
