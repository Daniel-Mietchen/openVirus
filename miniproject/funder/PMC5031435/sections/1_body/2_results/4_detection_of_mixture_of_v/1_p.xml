<p>Co-infection with more than one virus is a natural event that can be seen in individuals during epidemic outbreaks. Therefore, we tested the ability of SMAvirusChip to detect a mixture of viruses within a single sample. In this experiment, we analyzed four pools of viruses that were artificially mixed: 1) viruses from different families, including BSQV (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), MAYV (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) and PIRYV (
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>); 2) 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus viruses, including DENV-2, ROCV, and SLEV; 3) the four DENV serotypes; and 4) viruses that have caused epidemics in Brazil, including CHIKV, DENV-1 and ZIKV. The microarray experiments were performed as described above and analyzed with RAF, which showed that all viruses were specifically detected in each of the four pools (
