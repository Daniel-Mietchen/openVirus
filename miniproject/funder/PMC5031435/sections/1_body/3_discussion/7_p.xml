<p>During the development of this work, Genisphere stopped the production of their labeling 3DNA Array 900MPX kit, which was used for SMAvirusChip v1. Therefore, we used a different labeling kit for SMAvirusChip v2 (the Low Input Quick Amp WT Labeling kit, one color). This labeling kit uses RNA as a target molecule, which is why we did not include random genomic amplification in SMAvirusChip v2. In the future, we plan to standardize a random PCR amplification method for viral genomes to be used with the Low Input Quick Amp WT Labeling kit, one color, thus maintaining the sensitivity of the test.</p>
