<p>We searched for viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods in sera from dengue-suspected cases, but no viruses were detected. This result is in agreement with a study performed in Nicaragua, which showed that dengue-suspected patients were not infected with arboviruses or viruses transmitted by small mammals. Instead, they were mainly infected with herpesviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], this event seems to be rare, which might explain why we did not detect any viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods in the dengue-suspected cases. We were also unable to detect any viruses in malaria-suspected patients and in mosquitoes, potentially because of the low number of samples tested.
