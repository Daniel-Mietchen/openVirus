<p>Most emergent viruses transmitted by arthropods and small mammals over the past 50 years were caused by known viruses that were previously detected in their natural hosts or caused sporadic infections in humans. These include 
 <italic>Dengue virus</italic>, 
 <italic>West Nile virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Zika virus</italic>, 
 <italic>Chikungunya virus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rio Mamore virus</italic>, among others. Therefore, we were interested in the development of a DNA microarray platform that could enable the surveillance of known viruses because we believe that the emergence of viruses transmitted by arthropods and small mammals would more likely be caused by known viruses compared to new ones. We suggest that DNA microarray platforms designed with highly specific probes for known virus species be used as surveillance systems and that only when these platforms fail should next-generation sequencing methods be used to identify new viruses, thus reducing the cost of surveillance. Between August and September of this year, the Olympics and Paralympic games will held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, representing a risk for the introduction of new viruses. The SMAvirusChip platform could play an important role in the early detection of viruses to assist national health authorities.
