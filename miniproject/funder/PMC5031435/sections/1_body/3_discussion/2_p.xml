<p>Due to the circulation of several viruses transmitted by arthropods in tropical and sub-tropical countries, there is a risk of co-infection with more than one virus. Several studies have detected humans presenting with co-infection with two DENV subtypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], DENV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], or WNV and JEV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. National surveillance systems use virological methods capable of detecting only one virus per assay, leading to a proven underestimation of the number of co-infections. In the current study, SMAvirusChip was able to detect several viruses artificially spiked into a single sample, including a mixture of the four DENV subtypes as well as a mixture of DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV, which are transmitted by the same vector (
