<p>DNA microarray technology has recently emerged as a high-throughput method for screening numerous pathogens in a single assay. In this study, we designed a highly specific and sensitive DNA microarray platform for the detection and surveillance of viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods. Several of the screened viruses represent important threats to human health, while others have the possibility of becoming emergent. DENV (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus), which is transmitted mainly by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, is the most important arbovirus worldwide, with more than 390 million human infections occurring every year [

 <italic>Chikungunya virus</italic> (
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus) and 
 <italic>Zika virus</italic> (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus) were recently introduced in the Americas and have become important causes of morbidity and mortality in the region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Zika virus has been associated with increased incidences of Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. SMAvirusChip was capable of detecting these three viruses, suggesting that this platform can be used for the surveillance of these important arboviruses.
