<p>The ability of SMAvirusChip to detect a mixture of viruses was evaluated by analyzing four pools of viruses: 1) viruses from different families, including BSQV (
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), MAYV (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) and PIRYV (
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>); 2) viruses of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus, including DENV-2, ROCV, and SLEV; 3) the four DENV serotypes; and 4) viruses that have caused epidemics in Brazil, including CHIKV, DENV-1 and ZIKV. Viral RNAs were purified and used at equal volumes to prepare the pools, which were assessed with the microarray assay as described above.
