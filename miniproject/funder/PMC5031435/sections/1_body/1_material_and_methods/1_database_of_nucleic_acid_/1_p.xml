<p>The complete and partial nucleotide sequences of all viruses transmitted by small mammals and arthropods that can be found in GenBank were retrieved to design a DNA microarray platform (SMAvirusChip). Sequences deposited in GenBank until September 2013 were used to design the first version of the platform (SMAvirusChip v1) and those deposited until November 2013 were used for the second version (SMAvirusChip v2). The viral species transmitted by small mammals were selected based on the virus taxonomy list of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV 2011) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Nairovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hantavirus</italic> genera and the 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> family, 
 <italic>Arenavirus</italic> genus. The virus species transmitted by arthropods were selected from the virus taxonomy list of the ICTV and the Arbovirus Catalog of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (
