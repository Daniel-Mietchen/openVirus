 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The reaction mixture for cDNA synthesis contained 12 μl of RNA, 1.2 mM of the random primers (Invitrogen, USA), 2 μL of a 1:5000 dilution of the positive RNA control (Agilent, USA), 0.4 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen, USA), 40 U RNAse inhibitor (RNAseOUT, Invitrogen, U.S.), 4 mM DTT, 200 U of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) and 5 μl of 5X buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) in a total volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes, followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours and, finally, incubation at 85°C for 5 minutes. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using a 1:9 mixture of the random primers and a primer targeting a specific primer sequence on the random primer (5’-CGC CGT TTC CCA GTA GGT CTC-3') [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005017.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition to the primers, the PCR reaction mixture contained 4 μl of cDNA, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM dNTP, 5 U of Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), and 5 μl of 10X buffer [SO
 <sub>4</sub> 600 mm Tris (pH 8.9), NH
 <sub>4</sub> SO
 <sub>4</sub> 180 mM] in a total volume of 50 μl. Amplification was performed using a Thermal Cycler MyCycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The reaction mixture was subjected to 8 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 25°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 minute, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 minute. PCR products were purified using Wizard SV Gel and a PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR products were labeled with a 3DNA Array 900MPX kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, the PCR products were tagged with a capture sequence for 3DNA dendrimers, which contain Cy3 dye as fluorescent reporter molecule. The tagged PCR products were added to hybridization buffer (Genisphere, USA), heated at 80°C for 10 minutes, and then added to each sub-array on the SMAvirusChip for hybridization at 65°C overnight in an Agilent Hybridization oven (Agilent Technology, USA) at a rotation speed of 15 rpm. After hybridization, the slides were washed (2X SSC, 0.2% SDS) three times to remove non-hybridized PCR products. The 3DNA dendrimers were mixed with the hybridization buffer (Genisphere, USA) and then added to the SMAvirusChip for hybridization at 65°C for 4 hours at a rotation speed of 15 rpm followed by a washing step as described above.
