<p>Many challenges have been identified while setting up and implementing clinical trials during the West African Ebola epidemic. We found that, despite implementing a study with new research partners in a district with poor infrastructure and health services, where clinical research is in its infancy, interest in participation was high. The EBOVAC-Salone study has enrolled a total of 443 adults, 192 adolescents, and 132 children between October 2015 and December 2017, and the study continues to enrol younger cohorts of participants. However, in common with other research groups, we recommend that research should be more closely involved in outbreak response planning, which could expedite the establishment of research projects and maximise their chances of success.</p>
