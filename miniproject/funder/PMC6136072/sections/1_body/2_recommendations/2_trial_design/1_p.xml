<p>Research teams, funders, regulatory authorities, and ethics committees should be flexible and prepared for additional workloads when initiating and implementing clinical trials in outbreak settings, as trial designs may need to be adapted and submitted for review several times over a short period. Modelling can be utilised to predict trends and help identify research sites as the epidemic unfolds. For trials of investigational medical products, study design changes may continue after an epidemic ends as the advice of international regulatory authorities may also change if the results of the trial are part of the submission for licensure. There is now a substantial body of information regarding the acceptability of outbreak-specific trial designs from the Ebola epidemic that could be used to inform template trial designs in advance of future outbreaks.</p>
