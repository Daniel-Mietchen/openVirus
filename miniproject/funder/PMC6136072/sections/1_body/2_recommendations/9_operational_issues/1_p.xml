<p>During an outbreak, researchers may need to choose study sites that are not ideal in order to conduct the study in a suitable target population while avoiding other research projects. Researchers should respect emergency restrictions, but may be able to explore dispensations with the public health authorities if they do not pose a risk to outbreak control activities. Researchers should establish what happens to these dispensations should the outbreak end.</p>
