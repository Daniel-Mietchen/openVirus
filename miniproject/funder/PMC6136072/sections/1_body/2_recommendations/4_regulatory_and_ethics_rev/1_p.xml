<p>Ethical and regulatory authorities in countries with limited experience of clinical trials or other studies conducted during an epidemic may need to be supported by regional and international bodies to develop guidelines for study submissions during epidemics. Additional funding may be required to increase capacity for urgent reviews. The African Vaccine Regulatory Forum and similar bodies can usefully support ethics committees and regulators to facilitate the review and approval of clinical trials conducted during an epidemic if utilised at the right time, and sponsors and researchers should engage early with such a forum.</p>
