<p>This article offers observations on some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned while setting up and recruiting participants into a clinical trial during and after an epidemic, and makes recommendations on how these could be addressed in the future should a similar public health emergency arise. Several research groups have published their own experiences of conducting clinical trials during the Ebola outbreak, and the literature paints a picture of the context within which the EBOVAC-Salone trial was established. A number of researchers have described the difficulty of designing a robust yet ethical trial during an outbreak
