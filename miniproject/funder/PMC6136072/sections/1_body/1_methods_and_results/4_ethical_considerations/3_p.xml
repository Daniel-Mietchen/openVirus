 </sup> During initial discussions held in Sierra Leone in early 2015 by the EBOVAC-Salone team, the country’s authorities did not favour a randomised placebo-controlled trial, and this ethical concern informed the study design as discussed above. In common with some other Ebola vaccine trials taking place in the region, the research team therefore developed an innovative trial design to study efficacy without the use of a placebo. This trial design was never implemented, because the epidemic’s decline made it impossible to establish vaccine efficacy before this study could be initiated.
