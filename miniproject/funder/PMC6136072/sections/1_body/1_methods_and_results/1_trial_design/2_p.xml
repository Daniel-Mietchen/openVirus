 </sup> In January 2015, taking into account ethical concerns, the epidemic circumstances, field conditions, and statistical considerations, the trial was redesigned as a large cluster-randomised trial of approximately 800,000 participants to be randomised to receiving either immediate or delayed vaccination. Regulatory authorities in Sierra Leone requested a staged approach to recruitment to first determine the safety of the vaccine, with initial enrolment of 40 adults who were to be offered immediate vaccination (Stage 1), followed by enrolment of 400 adults (Stage 2) before commencing the main cluster-randomised trial.
