<p>Site visits and mathematical modelling were used to help determine both the sample size and geographical location of the study. By the first quarter of 2015, the epidemic was slowing and it was important to determine whether there would be a sufficient number of cases to determine vaccine efficacy. Kambia District in northern Sierra Leone was chosen as the site for the study because no other prophylactic vaccine trial was underway in that part of the country and because modelling data predicted a 50% probability of the epidemic being over in Kambia District by October 2015, compared to a 75% likelihood in Port Loko and Western Area, the other districts under consideration, by August 2015.</p>
