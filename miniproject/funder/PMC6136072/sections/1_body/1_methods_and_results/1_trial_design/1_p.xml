<p>The design of the EBOVAC-Salone study was revised on several occasions in response to the evolution of the Ebola epidemic. During the epidemicâ€™s peak in 2014, an 80,000-person, individually randomised, controlled trial was considered briefly that aimed to determine the efficacy of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo regimen compared to a control vaccine. However, administration of a placebo during a viral outbreak with such a high case-fatality rate had never been done before, and the ethics of this were hotly debated.
