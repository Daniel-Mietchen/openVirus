 </sup> with an estimated sample size of approximately 3500 participants. Stage 1 was kept as open label vaccination of 40 healthy adult participants. In December 2015, following the end of the outbreak, the use of placebo was reintroduced to the study design. Stage 2 was formally amended to a double-blind randomised controlled trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen, with follow-up for 12 months and a sample size of approximately 730 participants. Enrolment of 400 adults (randomised in a 3:1 ratio of Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo to MENVEO
