fast-tracked in order to identify prophylactic vaccines and experimental
treatments that might be useful in preventing or treating Ebola. These
trials included the ongoing EBOVAC-Salone study, which was established and
implemented in Sierra Leone to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1740774518780678"><title>Methods</title><p>This article describes the experiences of the EBOVAC-Salone research team in

research teams aiming to conduct clinical trials in future outbreak
situations.</p></sec><sec id="section3-1740774518780678"><title>Results</title><p>Establishing a clinical trial during an outbreak brought some unique
challenges, including those related to trial design and the regulatory
environment, operational issues, and community engagement. The situation was
further complicated by the weak infrastructure and limited experience of
clinical trials in Sierra Leone. However, operating in an outbreak context
also brought some benefits to the research team, including strong
stakeholder support. The EBOVAC-Salone study recruited participants both
during and after the outbreak, leading to additional challenges to trial
implementation during the post-outbreak transition.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1740774518780678"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Many lessons have been learned about setting up and implementing a clinical
trial during a devastating Ebola epidemic, and some of the experiences of
the EBOVAC-Salone team were mirrored by those of other researchers operating
in the region. Common to several of these research groups is a
recommendation that research should be more closely incorporated into
outbreak response planning, which could expedite the establishment of timely
and appropriate research projects. We recommend that the lessons learned by
researchers during the West African Ebola epidemic are built into programmes
and strategies to improve the responses to future epidemics, wherever they
occur.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ebola</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>trial</kwd><kwd>Sierra Leone</kwd><kwd>lessons</kwd><kwd>epidemic</kwd><kwd>recommendations</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1740774518780678"><funding-source id="funding1-1740774518780678"><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Medicines Initiative</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1740774518780678">115854</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section5-1740774518780678"><title>Background</title><p>The scale of the 2014&#x02013;2016 West African Ebola outbreak was unprecedented. Over 28,000
people were infected across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, 11,300 of whom died.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> As part of the global response, clinical trials of experimental treatments
and prophylactic vaccines were fast-tracked for testing.</p><p>In December 2014, the Innovative Medicines Initiative awarded funding from the Ebola
+ programme to the EBOVAC1 consortium of research institutions in partnership with
the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &#x00026; Johnson (Janssen) to support
the development and evaluation of a prime-boost prophylactic Ebola vaccine
regimen.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>
The EBOVAC-Salone study in Sierra Leone, which is still ongoing, is part of the
EBOVAC1 project.</p><p>The EBOVAC-Salone study is assessing the safety and immunogenicity of the
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost regimen in a population affected by Ebola and is
being carried out in Kambia District in northern Sierra Leone. It is coordinated by
the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the
College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences in Sierra Leone, and is sponsored by
Janssen. The Innovative Medicines Initiative is also funding the related Ebola
Vaccine Deployment, Acceptance and Compliance consortium which supports
communications, community engagement and enabling technologies for the EBOVAC-Salone trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Collaborations for the EBOVAC-Salone study were established quickly between November
2014 and March 2015 in an emergency context in which the Ebola epidemic was still
claiming lives across Sierra Leone. Vaccination of adult trial participants began on
9 October 2015. The study is ongoing and has recruited and vaccinated participants
both before and after the end of the Ebola epidemic, declared by the World Health
Organization on 7 November 2015.</p><p>This article offers observations on some of the challenges encountered and lessons
learned while setting up and recruiting participants into a clinical trial during
and after an epidemic, and makes recommendations on how these could be addressed in
the future should a similar public health emergency arise. Several research groups
have published their own experiences of conducting clinical trials during the Ebola
outbreak, and the literature paints a picture of the context within which the
EBOVAC-Salone trial was established. A number of researchers have described the
difficulty of designing a robust yet ethical trial during an outbreak<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and then having to amend or
abandon their original study objectives as the epidemic waned.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Others highlighted the
limitations imposed by the infrastructure of the country in which they were operating.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The challenges were not just for researchers: the burden on local ethics
committees, dealing with huge increases in workload, was also noted.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>While many of the challenges and lessons described in this article have been shared
by other researchers, this article makes a novel contribution to the literature as
one of the few trials to enrol participants both during and after the epidemic. This
gives the authors an additional perspective into issues such as community
engagement, participant recruitment and trial design, all of which were affected by
the end of the outbreak.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section6-1740774518780678"><title>Methods and results</title><sec id="section7-1740774518780678"><title>Trial design</title><p>The design of the EBOVAC-Salone study was revised on several occasions in
response to the evolution of the Ebola epidemic. During the epidemic&#x02019;s peak in
2014, an 80,000-person, individually randomised, controlled trial was considered
briefly that aimed to determine the efficacy of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo
regimen compared to a control vaccine. However, administration of a placebo
during a viral outbreak with such a high case-fatality rate had never been done
before, and the ethics of this were hotly debated.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Alternative trial designs were considered, including a cluster-randomised trial
and a stepped-wedge design.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In January 2015, taking into account ethical concerns, the epidemic
circumstances, field conditions, and statistical considerations, the trial was
redesigned as a large cluster-randomised trial of approximately 800,000
participants to be randomised to receiving either immediate or delayed
vaccination. Regulatory authorities in Sierra Leone requested a staged approach
to recruitment to first determine the safety of the vaccine, with initial
enrolment of 40 adults who were to be offered immediate vaccination (Stage 1),
followed by enrolment of 400 adults (Stage 2) before commencing the main
cluster-randomised trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Site visits and mathematical modelling were used to help determine both the
sample size and geographical location of the study. By the first quarter of
2015, the epidemic was slowing and it was important to determine whether there
would be a sufficient number of cases to determine vaccine efficacy. Kambia
District in northern Sierra Leone was chosen as the site for the study because
no other prophylactic vaccine trial was underway in that part of the country and
because modelling data predicted a 50% probability of the epidemic being over in
Kambia District by October 2015, compared to a 75% likelihood in Port Loko and
Western Area, the other districts under consideration, by August 2015.</p><p>However, the epidemic declined at a faster rate than expected during the first
quarter of 2015 throughout Sierra Leone. By May 2015, it was clear that the
study would be unable to determine vaccine efficacy. The cluster-randomised
trial protocol was therefore abandoned before it was approved by the regulatory
authorities, and the primary objective for the study was changed to
determination of the safety and immunogenicity of the regimen,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> with an estimated sample size of approximately 3500 participants. Stage 1
was kept as open label vaccination of 40 healthy adult participants. In December
2015, following the end of the outbreak, the use of placebo was reintroduced to
the study design. Stage 2 was formally amended to a double-blind randomised
controlled trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen,
with follow-up for 12&#x02009;months and a sample size of approximately 730
participants. Enrolment of 400 adults (randomised in a 3:1 ratio of
Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo to MENVEO<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) has been followed by an age
de-escalation component for paediatric participants.</p><p>The changes to the trial design affected many aspects of the study beyond what is
typically encountered in the setup phase of a trial. As the trial design
evolved, budgets underwent multiple revisions, and project plans changed
significantly while the team waited for approvals, with associated amendments to
orders and procurement of equipment and consumables. The expectations of
stakeholders and community members had to be managed as the study enrolment
target was significantly reduced which shrank the study&#x02019;s geographical footprint
from an initial district-wide catchment area, to just the inhabitants of two of
the district&#x02019;s main towns.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1740774518780678"><title>Partnerships</title><p>The time pressures of operating during an outbreak influenced how partnerships in
Sierra Leone were established, and the study was implemented by organisations
which had not previously worked together. Partners in-country were needed
quickly to provide local leadership and expertise, and to implement field
activities for the trial. After discussions with Sierra Leone&#x02019;s Ministry of
Health and Sanitation and other stakeholders, a research partnership was
established with the University of Sierra Leone&#x02019;s College of Medicine and Allied
Health Sciences. However, College of Medicine staff had limited experience of
clinical trials and therefore significant technical support was required from
the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine and the trial sponsor.</p><p>Two non-governmental organisations also worked on the trial. Goal joined as the
trial&#x02019;s logistics partner, while World Vision were engaged to provide community
engagement and IT support, amongst other activities. Clinical research is
outside of the usual remit of these organisations, and therefore it was
essential that all partners understood others&#x02019; requirements and limitations from
the beginning of the project.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1740774518780678"><title>Regulatory and ethics reviews</title><p>EBOVAC-Salone study approvals were required from the London School of Hygiene
&#x00026; Tropical Medicine Ethics Committee, the Sierra Leone Ethical and
Scientific Review Committee, and the Pharmacy Board of Sierra Leone the national
regulatory authority. During the Ebola epidemic, the African Vaccine Regulatory
Forum, with support from the World Health Organization, established a platform
for conducting joint reviews of clinical trial applications with input from
international regulatory agencies. This aimed to achieve rapid comprehensive
reviews of clinical trials in the context of potentially limited regulatory and
ethics review capacity in the sub-Saharan African countries participating in
Ebola vaccine trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The EBOVAC-Salone study team engaged with the African Vaccine Regulatory
Forum review process at a meeting in April 2015 that was also attended by the
Pharmacy Board of Sierra Leone and the Sierra Leonean ethics committee.</p><p>During the epidemic, the ethics committees and the Pharmacy Board implemented an
expedited review process for Ebola-related studies. Both Sierra Leonean
authorities experienced a dramatic rise in workload in 2014&#x02013;2015 as they were
receiving frequent submissions for Ebola-related research. Despite this, the
authorities continued to give thorough reviews and completed most reviews within
1&#x02009;month following submission. The sponsor and study team engaged the authorities
from the start of the project, to prepare them for the possibility of study
design changes in response to the evolving epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1740774518780678"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Shortly after the Ebola epidemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern, the World Health Organization established a panel of
experts to discuss ethical questions relating to the use of unproven
interventions, with discussions held around appropriate trial designs during an outbreak.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Both the World Health Organization&#x02019;s ethics panel and a group of expert
anthropologists issued guidance to research groups planning to conduct clinical
trials during the epidemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>An overarching ethical concern was that clinical research should not impact on
the health system or the emergency response. The World Health Organization
coordinated prioritisation of the most promising research, so as not to
overburden the health systems in the affected countries.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In Sierra Leone, planning for the EBOVAC-Salone study was undertaken in
partnership with the College of Medicine and Allied Health Sciences, and a
criterion was set that healthcare workers involved in the emergency response
would not be recruited to the study team. Senior staff were therefore recruited
from overseas to provide technical support, while also building the experience
of more junior national staff who had not previously been involved in clinical
research.</p><p>The question of whether trials should be placebo-controlled was particularly
contentious,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="bibr17-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr18-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> although not a new debate.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> During initial discussions held in Sierra Leone in early 2015 by the
EBOVAC-Salone team, the country&#x02019;s authorities did not favour a randomised
placebo-controlled trial, and this ethical concern informed the study design as
discussed above. In common with some other Ebola vaccine trials taking place in
the region, the research team therefore developed an innovative trial design to
study efficacy without the use of a placebo. This trial design was never
implemented, because the epidemic&#x02019;s decline made it impossible to establish
vaccine efficacy before this study could be initiated.</p><p>Further ethical issues became apparent once the study began. EBOVAC-Salone social
science research indicated that one of the motivating factors for participation
in the trial was an expectation that the vaccine would be effective. The
research team addressed this by placing additional emphasis on the
investigational nature of the vaccine during community outreach activities and
the informed consent process. The latter included a test which participants had
to pass before being enrolled to demonstrate their understanding of the
trial.</p><p>Initial participant recruitment took place prior to the end of the epidemic, and
demand to participate in the study at that time was greater than the number of
participants needed. To ensure fair subject selection, a lottery system was
devised, whereby households were selected and prioritised in an open ballot.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> An age de-escalation approach was adopted with safety data being reviewed
by an independent data monitoring committee prior to the enrolment of each
cohort of children. Pregnant women were excluded because of concerns over the
safety of viral vaccines given during pregnancy. This exclusion criterion was
common to all Ebola vaccine trials in the region, although some authors have
argued that, in future, pregnant women should not be denied the potential
benefits of participating in clinical research in an outbreak of such high mortality.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section11-1740774518780678"><title>Communications and engagement</title><p>The normal processes of engaging with communities prior to a trial of a new
investigational medical product were given an additional layer of complexity by
the Ebola outbreak. The challenges of community engagement and building trust
and awareness in a setting with no experience of clinical trials, such as
Kambia, were exacerbated by the urgency to commence the research.</p><p>Formative, qualitative research into community dynamics and perceptions around
Ebola and the clinical trial were especially important during a period that was
characterised by a lack of trust in both national and international organisations.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This research, and ongoing tracking of rumours and concerns, helped
target engagement approaches and community messaging. For example, a rumour that
the vaccine trial was bringing Ebola back to the community, nicknamed &#x02018;Ebola
Phase Two&#x02019;, was identified by the social scientists. The community liaison team
responded by visiting the market where the rumour had originated and initiating
meetings to address the concerns with the support of pre-briefed local
stakeholders.</p><p>Establishing the study while the emergency response infrastructure was in place
was challenging for the study&#x02019;s community engagement in some ways, but
facilitated it in others. The Ebola response centres brought stakeholders
together, providing an efficient mechanism through which these individuals could
be briefed. Because many stakeholders were already engaged in the fight against
Ebola, they were often particularly receptive to research teams.</p><p>However, in an environment where people were desperate for solutions, the study&#x02019;s
community engagement had to clearly differentiate the research project from the
Ebola response to avoid possible misinterpretations that the trial was
delivering a licenced vaccine as part of the humanitarian response.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1740774518780678"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>During the outbreak, community interest in participating in the first stage of
the study was high. EBOVAC&#x02019;s social science research indicated a range of
motivating factors behind participation in the early stages of the trial,
including the notion of &#x02018;sacrifice&#x02019; or duty as a citizen; and hope or belief in
the power of the vaccine to prevent Ebola.</p><p>Contrary to the experience of some groups conducting research during the
outbreak, generous financial compensation was not necessary to stimulate
participation in the trial in Kambia.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Study partners sought advice from the national ethics committee before
agreeing to rates that would fairly recompense a participant&#x02019;s time and
transport without providing undue inducement, based on estimated lost earnings
and transport costs to and from the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1740774518780678"><title>Human resources</title><p>The limited pool of clinicians in Sierra Leone was severely affected by the
outbreak as Ebola-related mortality among health workers was particularly high.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Prior to the epidemic, Sierra Leone ranked fifth from bottom among 193
countries in terms of numbers of physicians per head of population.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As discussed above, so as not to further weaken the wider health system,
the research team committed not to recruit any healthcare workers employed in
the government health system or involved in the Ebola response without the
approval of the appropriate authorities.</p><p>Because limited clinical research had been conducted in Sierra Leone prior to the
Ebola epidemic, there were very few individuals in the country with appropriate
research experience, and those that had this were generally involved in other
Ebola-related studies. Technical and scientific support was therefore provided
to the in-country team, facilitated by the London School of Hygiene &#x00026;
Tropical Medicine&#x02019;s response to the epidemic that allowed staff to temporarily
leave their current post to work on the Ebola response.</p><p>It proved challenging to attract suitably qualified and experienced applicants to
work in longer term positions on the trial. This may have been due to the
perceived risk of working in an Ebola-affected country, because the trial site
was in a relatively undeveloped district, and because people with the relevant
skills were not available to apply for posts at short notice. In addition, the
London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine is not an emergency response
organisation and therefore did not provide hardship or risk allowances to staff
employed on the study.</p></sec><sec id="section14-1740774518780678"><title>Operational issues</title><p>Many operational challenges arose because the epidemic occurred in a region with
a low level of development; Sierra Leone remains among the world&#x02019;s poorest
countries and suffers from poor infrastructure.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1740774518780678" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Outside an outbreak situation, a rural district like Kambia would not be
a natural choice for an urgent trial due to the extensive requirements and costs
of delivering a Good Clinical Practice&#x02013;compliant study in this setting.</p><p>Kambia is not on the national power grid and therefore a 24 hour generator-based
power supply was installed for vaccine storage, offices, and laboratories, and a
fuel supply chain and fuel store were established. While it was possible to
rent, renovate, and equip existing buildings for the research clinics and
offices, it was necessary to construct a vaccine storage facility and establish
a research laboratory. Logistics became hugely time-consuming, necessitating
dedicated operations staff to oversee construction, electrical installations,
and laboratory setup. In common with many emergency situations, the cost of
accommodation, rental and construction of buildings, and goods such as furniture
rose substantially with the arrival of Ebola response partners.</p><p>Emergency public health restrictions implemented to curtail the spread of Ebola
affected the establishment of the study. For example, nightly curfews limited
working hours, including on the study-related construction and renovations, and
restricted the movement of people and vehicles throughout the country.</p><p>However, engagement with the Ebola response authorities allowed the team to gain
special dispensation to assist with setting up the research project. These
included securing permits to allow team members to travel during curfew periods
in Kambia; and a blanket exemption on import tax for equipment and
consumables.</p></sec><sec id="section15-1740774518780678"><title>Post-outbreak transition</title><p>The EBOVAC-Salone trial is now in the age de-escalation stage of the trial and
has experienced the transition from working in an outbreak setting to a
post-outbreak setting, and the return to &#x02018;business as usual&#x02019;.</p><p>The response infrastructure in Sierra Leone was quickly dismantled once the
outbreak ended and the stakeholder landscape changed almost overnight as roles
and responsibilities at national and district level reverted to their pre-Ebola
position. The study team had to reassess the potential influence of various
individuals or institutions on the trial and adjust relationships
accordingly.</p><p>The dispensations related to the emergency situation were suspended rapidly once
the outbreak was declared over. This included the waiver on importation taxes,
which was not clearly communicated to the research team, thereby complicating
the clearing of a subsequent shipment.</p><p>After the outbreak had ended, interest in study participation decreased, in part
due to a shift in the risk/benefit perception of members of the community, many
of whom felt that Ebola had been eradicated permanently. The household lottery
method for recruiting participants was therefore expanded and a broader &#x02018;first
come, first served&#x02019; approach was adopted.</p><p>Post-outbreak, many of the logistical challenges remain such as the lack of a
mains power supply, and staff recruitment and retention to a relatively remote
area of the country. Despite these challenges, the study completed enrolment of
adult participants in October 2016 and is recruiting participants into the age
de-escalation component of the trial. Over 100 Sierra Leonean study personnel,
including some Kambia Government Hospital staff, have been trained in essential
research skills and clinical management. This will hopefully provide a legacy
and a platform on which to build further research in the district.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section16-1740774518780678"><title>Recommendations</title><p>Following the experiences of establishing the EBOVAC-Salone trial and the lessons
learned between 2014 and 2017, we have a number of recommendations for teams aiming
to conduct research during epidemics.</p><sec id="section17-1740774518780678"><title>Trial design</title><p>Research teams, funders, regulatory authorities, and ethics committees should be
flexible and prepared for additional workloads when initiating and implementing
clinical trials in outbreak settings, as trial designs may need to be adapted
and submitted for review several times over a short period. Modelling can be
utilised to predict trends and help identify research sites as the epidemic
unfolds. For trials of investigational medical products, study design changes
may continue after an epidemic ends as the advice of international regulatory
authorities may also change if the results of the trial are part of the
submission for licensure. There is now a substantial body of information
regarding the acceptability of outbreak-specific trial designs from the Ebola
epidemic that could be used to inform template trial designs in advance of
future outbreaks.</p></sec><sec id="section18-1740774518780678"><title>Partnerships</title><p>Identifying partnerships with established, on-the-ground organisations may
require urgent networking and meetings to build trust and agree goals if
partners have not worked together before. Linkages with organisations that are
not necessarily &#x02018;classical&#x02019; research partners can be extremely valuable for
implementing research in an emergency situation.</p></sec><sec id="section19-1740774518780678"><title>Regulatory and ethics reviews</title><p>Ethical and regulatory authorities in countries with limited experience of
clinical trials or other studies conducted during an epidemic may need to be
supported by regional and international bodies to develop guidelines for study
submissions during epidemics. Additional funding may be required to increase
capacity for urgent reviews. The African Vaccine Regulatory Forum and similar
bodies can usefully support ethics committees and regulators to facilitate the
review and approval of clinical trials conducted during an epidemic if utilised
at the right time, and sponsors and researchers should engage early with such a
forum.</p></sec><sec id="section20-1740774518780678"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Experiences around ethical issues pertaining to the design and implementation of
clinical trials during the Ebola epidemic should be considered for future
outbreaks. As soon as an outbreak is declared, the potential need for
appropriate research should be considered as an integral part of the response
planning to ensure that possible ethical concerns come to the fore and are
debated at the first possible opportunity. Research must not have a detrimental
impact on either the outbreak response or health systems.</p></sec><sec id="section21-1740774518780678"><title>Communications and engagement</title><p>Social scientists should be considered an integral part of any large clinical
trial team, particularly for trials in an outbreak situation where it is vital
to understand community dynamics and concerns that may change frequently. During
an outbreak, additional efforts may be needed to explain and reinforce the
distinction between an investigational medical product and a licenced treatment
or vaccine, especially when fear of infection may be more likely to influence
participant decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="section22-1740774518780678"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Interest in participation may fluctuate based on community perceptions of risk
associated with the outbreak and the benefits of participation, and recruitment
strategies may therefore need to be adapted as epidemics evolve or wane.</p></sec><sec id="section23-1740774518780678"><title>Human resources</title><p>Researchers should engage local health authorities to establish guidelines for
recruiting staff to prevent weakening outbreak responses or health systems.
Recruitment of certain cadres of staff from countries or areas not affected by
the outbreak may need to be considered, at least temporarily.</p></sec><sec id="section24-1740774518780678"><title>Operational issues</title><p>During an outbreak, researchers may need to choose study sites that are not ideal
in order to conduct the study in a suitable target population while avoiding
other research projects. Researchers should respect emergency restrictions, but
may be able to explore dispensations with the public health authorities if they
do not pose a risk to outbreak control activities. Researchers should establish
what happens to these dispensations should the outbreak end.</p></sec><sec id="section25-1740774518780678"><title>Post-outbreak transition</title><p>Researchers should ensure that they identify and engage both routine and response
structures and government regulations to help ensure continuity of support and
trial activities once an outbreak is over.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section26-1740774518780678"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Many challenges have been identified while setting up and implementing clinical
trials during the West African Ebola epidemic. We found that, despite implementing a
study with new research partners in a district with poor infrastructure and health
services, where clinical research is in its infancy, interest in participation was
high. The EBOVAC-Salone study has enrolled a total of 443 adults, 192 adolescents,
and 132 children between October 2015 and December 2017, and the study continues to
enrol younger cohorts of participants. However, in common with other research
groups, we recommend that research should be more closely involved in outbreak
response planning, which could expedite the establishment of research projects and
maximise their chances of success.</p><p>While many of the lessons learned from the EBOVAC-Salone experience will be specific
to the context of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, it is hoped that the
principles behind them are transferable to research teams in other outbreak
situations. These recommendations could be added to programmes and strategies to
improve the responses to future epidemics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the support and hard work of all of the partners and staff
