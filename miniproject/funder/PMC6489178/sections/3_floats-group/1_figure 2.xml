   <bold>Farm locations (randomly distributed within communes they belong to) and trade network (Brittany, France).</bold> Each dot represents one farm included in the model (12 750 farms, belonging to 1173 communes). Each line corresponds to aggregated animal movements occurring between two connected farms over the period 2005–2013 (links are not directed for visual simplicity, but are in the model; line thickness is proportional to the number of traded animals). The western continuous border delimitates the Finistère department.
