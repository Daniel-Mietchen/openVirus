   <bold>A</bold>, 
   <bold>B</bold> Simulated vs. predicted probability by the Random Forest regression. Each point represents one herd-year. The green and red solid lines are respectively the regression line and the nonparametric-regression smooth. The red dotted lines are the estimations of the variance function. 
   <bold>C</bold>, 
   <bold>D</bold> Explanatory variables ranked by importance as measured by the Random Forest method (using %IncMSE, Additional file 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>H). Variables with larger values are more important. Variables are: number of herds in the neighbourhood (nNB), annual number of animals purchased (InStrength), annual number of animals of less than 1 year purchased (InStrength_Less1yr), annual number of source herds (InDegree), annual number of animals purchased by neighbouring herds (InStrengthNB), annual number of animals of less than 1 year purchased by neighbouring herds (InStrengthNB_less1yr), proportion of cows aged 24–36 months (%24_36), herd size (SizeTot), number of females younger than 1 year (Size1yr). Analyses were based on 100 runs.
