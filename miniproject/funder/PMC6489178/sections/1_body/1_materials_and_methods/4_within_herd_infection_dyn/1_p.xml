<p id="Par27">The within-herd infection dynamics was adapted from a previously published model fully described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In brief, it was a stochastic model in discrete-time with a 2-week time-step. It described within-herd demographic and infection processes, accounting for both vertical and horizontal transmissions. Thereafter are described the main specificities of this within-herd model and updates implemented before its integration into a regional model.
