<p id="Par25">Herd locations were required to calculate distances between herds and to define neighbourhood contacts (see “
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Neighbourhood contacts</xref>” section). However, the exact locations were not known except for the Finistère subset for which GPS coordinates of the main farm building were available. Nevertheless, information in the FNCD enables to assign each herd uniquely to a commune (the smallest administrative division in France). Hence, we used the geo-coordinates of French commune borders to randomly distribute herds within their commune (R package {maptools}). The metapopulation area was composed of 1173 communes. The negligible impact of this procedure of geo-coordinates assignment was assessed by comparing model predictions obtained in Finistère when using the exact herd locations vs. the randomly assigned ones (Additional file
