<p id="Par24">In addition, the FNCD contains animal movements, with its date, the source and destination holdings (farms or commercial operators, i.e. markets and assembly centres, acting as intermediary nodes and as hubs of the trade network), as well as the causes and dates of entry into (birth, purchase) and exit from (death, sell) each holding. Pregnancy status was not available, neither the filial relationship between calves and dams. For a descriptive analysis of the national dataset, see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Only trade movements of females where the source or the destination holding belonged to the modelled metapopulation were accounted for. Movements to and from markets and assembling centres were not explicitly represented as the duration in these holdings is short (1 day in markets and ~3 days on average in assembly centres). Hence, movements going from farm A to a market or assembly centre and then to farm B were considered as direct movements from A to B in the model. A total of 1056 565 movements was considered, 226 553 occurring between farms of the metapopulation (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The remaining movements concerned trade with partners located outside the metapopulation: 324 430 movements went into and 505 582 went out the metapopulation. The characteristics of the trade network in Finistère were closely in line with those of the whole metapopulation (Additional file
