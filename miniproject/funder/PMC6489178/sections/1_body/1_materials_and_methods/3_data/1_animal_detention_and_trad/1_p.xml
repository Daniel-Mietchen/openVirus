<p id="Par23">The French National Cattle Database (FNCD) is a comprehensive database describing individual cattle life trajectories from birth to death. Cattle are defined by their national identification number, their breed and sex, and their date of birth, which enables all of the demographic parameters (birth rates and age-specific outgoing rates other than trade movements) to be estimated per herd per year (TableÂ
