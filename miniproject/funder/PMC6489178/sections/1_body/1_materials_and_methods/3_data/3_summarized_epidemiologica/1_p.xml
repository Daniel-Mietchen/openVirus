<p id="Par26">In the period 2000–2003, before the implementation of the regional control strategy for BVD in Brittany, the Animal Health Services (AHS) followed twice a year serological status of herds using ELISA tests on collected milk. Herds were considered positive if their seroprevalence was above 10% [

Seroprevalence in herds ranged from 54 to 62% during the endemic phase of BVDV spread (i.e. during the pre-control period), in agreement with previous observations made on a smaller subset of herds [
