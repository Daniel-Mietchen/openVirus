<p id="Par37">For each herd, the initial herd structure was based on the corresponding demographic structure on 1/1/2005 as observed in the FNCD. To mimic a BVDV regional endemic situation, we first generated 100 runs over the 9Â years of available trade data starting with 1 P cow randomly introduced into 10% randomly selected herds at 1/1/2005. All of the remaining animals were assumed to be susceptible. These preliminary simulations led to the generation of 100 infection dynamics gathering information for each herd. Then, this information was used as new starting conditions (i.e. the empiric distribution of initial conditions in endemic situations).</p>
