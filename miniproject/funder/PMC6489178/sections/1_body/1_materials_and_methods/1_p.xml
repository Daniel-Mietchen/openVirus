<p id="Par21">We developed a discrete time stochastic compartmental model describing within-herd demographics calibrated on herd-specific detention data and BVDV vertical and horizontal transmission dynamics. The within-herd modules are coupled at a regional between-herd scale through discrete trade movements represented explicitly from historical cattle movement data, as well as through neighbourhood contacts modelled as an infection pressure from infected herds located within a given radius around each exposed herd (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The model was developed in C++.
