<p id="Par22">We modelled over the period 1/1/2005–31/12/2013 a metapopulation composed of 12 750 dairy cattle herds located in Brittany (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), a region in Western France densely populated with dairy herds mostly calving year-round using artificial insemination. Selected herds corresponded to all of the dairy herds located in Brittany and having more than 10 adult females and a sustained activity over the 9-year period. Since these herds are mainly composed of females, males were not kept in the model. In addition, summarized information from epidemiological data and the exact herd geographical coordinates were available for a subset of the metapopulation composed of 2652 dairy herds located in the Finistère department (i.e. 21% of the dairy herds from Brittany distributed over 20% of the area). This subset was used for qualitatively calibrating the model as regards the most unknown epidemiological parameters.
