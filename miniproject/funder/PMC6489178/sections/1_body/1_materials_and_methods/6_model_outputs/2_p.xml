<p id="Par35">For model calibration, two outputs were recorded: (i) the herd seroprevalence, calculated as the proportion of herds with more than 10% of R animals, and (ii) the yearly test-based herd incidence, defined as the annual number of herds detected as newly infected. In both cases, the outputs were defined similarly as in epidemiological data to enable comparison. For herd incidence, a regular sampling scheme was implemented in the model, using the proportion of animals in health state R as a proxy for test result and with tests implemented every 6Â months. Test result was assumed to be negative for herds having less than 10% of R animals, positive otherwise. A simulated herd was considered as detected as newly infected if it was negatively tested at two consecutive sampling points immediately before two consecutive positive tests. The number of newly detected herds was aggregated per year.</p>
