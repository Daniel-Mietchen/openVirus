<p id="Par36">To assess the contribution of the two transmission routes to BVDV regional spread, six model outputs were generated. At each time step over 9 years, we recorded: (i) the number of infected herds in the metapopulation (i.e. herds with at least 1 P or T animal); (ii) the number of newly infected herds (i.e. herds with no P nor T animal at time 
 <italic>t</italic> − 1 and at least 1 P or T animal at time 
 <italic>t</italic>); (iii) the annual probability of a herd to be infected (
 <italic>Prob_being_inf</italic>), calculated as the proportion of runs in which the herd was infected over a year; (iv) the annual probability of a herd to be newly infected (
 <italic>Prob_getting_inf</italic>), calculated as the proportion of runs in which the herd was newly infected that year. As spontaneous fade-out is frequent for this disease, we also assessed (v) the herd re-infection probability, defined as the probability of a herd being newly infected at least twice over the 9-year period, and (vi) the proportion of presence time of at least one P animal over the 9 years in a specific herd.
