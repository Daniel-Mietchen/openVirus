<p id="Par43">Finally, we analysed how the within-herd infection dynamics and the causal herd infection route interacted. Limiting the analysis to herd-runs for which new infections occurred, the proportion of time over the 9Â years a herd possessed at least one persistently infected animal was related to the proportion of these new infections which were due to neighbourhood contacts. The proportion of recovered animals in the herd at the start of a new infection was used as a proxy for herd immunity and its distributions were compared between causal infection routes.</p>
