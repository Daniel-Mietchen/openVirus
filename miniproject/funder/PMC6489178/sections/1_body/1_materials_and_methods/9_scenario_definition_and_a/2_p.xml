<p id="Par42">For the most complete scenario with both transmission routes, we also assessed whether herds at extreme percentiles (5 and 95) of the distribution of the probability of being infected (
 <italic>Prob_being_inf</italic>) could be discriminated by their number of neighbours and of animals purchased, and if these herds had a specific spatial distribution in Brittany (spatial clustering analysis using DBSCAN method). Then, we characterized the annual probability of getting infected (
 <italic>Prob_getting_inf</italic>) per causal transmission route using the Random Forest method (R package {randomForest}). Potential explanatory variables were per herd: the number of herds in the neighbourhood (nNB), the annual number of animals purchased (InStrength), the annual number of animals younger than 1 year of age purchased by the herd (InStrength_Less1yr), the annual number of source herds (InDegree), the annual number of animals purchased by neighbouring herds (InStrengthNB), the annual number of animals younger than 1 year of age purchased by neighbouring herds (InStrengthNB_less1yr), the proportion of cows aged 24 to 36 months (%24_36) in the herd, the number of females younger than 1 year of age (Size1yr) and the herd size (SizeTot). Furthermore, assuming herd re-infection probability was barely correlated to its probability to be infected (
 <italic>Prob_being_inf</italic>), we investigated the four possible patterns of successive infections: both by neighbourhood contacts, first by neighbourhood contacts and second by trade movements, both by trade movements, and first by trade movements and second by neighbourhood contacts. Analysing these pairs enabled to assess if herds were randomly infected with respect to the transmission route, or if they were more exposed to one or the other route (Additional file
