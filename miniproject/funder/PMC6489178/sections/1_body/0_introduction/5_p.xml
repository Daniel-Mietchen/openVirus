<p id="Par19">From the point of view of control and eradication, a transmission routes of underestimated contribution can undermine the efficacy of pre-planned control programs. In addition, it has been shown that herd structure, between age-group transmissions, the probability of birth and the presence of persistently infected animals could significantly influence the BVDV within-herd spread [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This is directly related to within-herd infection prevalence, thus to the likelihood that contacts with an infected herd generate new outbreaks. Hence, these herd-specific features might indirectly impact virus spread at a regional scale. Therefore, carrying out a more comprehensive study including trade movements and neighbourhood contacts as transmission routes, and accounting for herd heterogeneity is required to explore BVDV propagation mechanisms in a region, for which a complete multiscale mechanistic model is necessary.
