<p id="Par16">Assessing the contributions of different transmission mechanisms to pathogen spread provides policymakers with valuable information on how to allocate limited disease control resources more effectively over the course of a control program. In this context, modelling has been proven as an efficient approach to investigate the spread mechanisms of pathogens and to assess the impact of control strategies (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] for bovine tuberculosis; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] for bluetongue in cattle and sheep; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] for bovine paratuberculosis). This approach is complementary to observations especially when sufficient biological information is not available or when field studies are difficult to perform. Well-developed models could assist the evaluation of control strategies before their implementation in the field, which supports authorities with decision making.
