<p id="Par15">In managed metapopulations such as farming systems, endemic pathogens commonly spread at local and regional levels through different routes of transmission. Trade movements are primarily the consequence of constant renewal of the breeding stock to sustain productivity and herd size [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and could happen between farms within either short or long distances, resulting in the possible introduction of infectious animals into the destination herds (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]). Pathogens can also spread among farms within close proximity through direct contacts of animals or indirect contacts via agents (human, other animals, insects, and contaminated tools). Such a transmission route, named thereafter as neighbourhood contacts, is of particular importance in densely populated areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other routes, such as environmental routes (air), also contribute to the spread of some pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].
