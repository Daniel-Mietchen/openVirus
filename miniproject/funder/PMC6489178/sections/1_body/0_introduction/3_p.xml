<p id="Par17">Bovine viral diarrhoea is an endemic disease distributed worldwide among industrial cattle herds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is transmitted both vertically and horizontally, via direct contacts, bodily secretions, and contaminated fomites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Animals exposed are either persistently (after vertical transmission) or transiently (after horizontal transmission) infected. Persistently infected animals are the most important source of virus, continuously shedding BVDV during their lifetime, while transiently infected animals shed fewer viruses during a limited infection period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. BVDV infection could reduce reproductive performance and milk production, and increase occurrence of other diseases in cattle, leading to significant economic losses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. For example, economic impacts estimated based on experiences in several European dairy industries (Denmark, Norway, and UK) range from 10 to 40 M$ per million calvings with annual incidence rate of 20% to 40% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Various control or even eradication schemes have been implemented by farmers’ organizations in many countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While these schemes have been very successful in some countries, eradication remains a difficult task in others [
