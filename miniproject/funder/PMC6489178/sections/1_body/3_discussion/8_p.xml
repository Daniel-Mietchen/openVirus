<p id="Par59">This model could further serve as a tool to assess control strategies. Between-herd transmission not only occurs through trade movements of persistently infected animals and contacts with such animals located in the neighbourhood, but also through trade movements of transiently infected animals and of immune dams carrying a persistently infected foetus, which are much harder to detect [

According to field observations in French dairy cattle farms, despite collective control schemes implementing control of P animal movements and before pasture season, combined with test-and-cull of P animals in detected infected herds, it took several years to give rise to a decrease in prevalence without reaching full eradication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, our simulations showed that some herds are more prone to be exposed to one route over the other. This implies that the major between-herd transmission route should be considered specifically for each herd when designing control strategies aiming at eradication. All these results also indicate that regional control strategies have to be assessed according to territorial specificities in terms of prevalence of infection, intensity of trade movements, as well as intensity of neighbourhood contacts (herd and animal densities, duration of pasture season, risk of contact for gestating females, etc.). Our model can be used to investigate BVDV regional spread and evaluate control strategies in diverse epidemiological situations as long as similar datasets are available. Designed under an object-oriented framework, this model could be transferred as a support decision tool for animal health managers to evaluate adapted control and eradication strategies.
