<p id="Par57">Current approximation for neighbourhood contacts assumes that all persistently infected animals from a given neighbourhood have an influence on all herds in this neighbourhood. Such an assumption might lead to over-estimate the influence of neighbourhood contacts for some herds and under-estimate it for some others. However, a more accurate representation of neighbourhood contacts would require a precise description of land use for pasture purpose, which was not available for the whole Brittany and which might be difficult to collect. For instance, the geographical coordinates of a farm usually point to the location of the “registered” housing unit, which does not necessarily correspond to pasture locations. Indeed, the pastures of a farm could be anywhere within a few kilometres around the geolocation of the farm and are not necessarily contiguous. Precise boundaries might not be obtainable due to various difficulties including privacy concerns. Moreover, data on pasture use are not of sufficient precision, being aggregated over all livestock species [

In the absence of these data, a simple approximation was designed by using the geographical coordinates of French commune borders and by randomly distributing herds within the borders of the commune they belong to. This approximation was shown not to impair our conclusions, infection dynamics being very similar when compared to simulations obtained with real geo-coordinates of farms in Finistère (Additional file

They represent around 15% of cattle herds in Brittany, which was assumed to be low enough to be neglected. Besides, beef herds sell very few animals to dairy herds [
