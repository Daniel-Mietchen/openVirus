<p id="Par54">Trade movements have been recognized as an important, if not the main, transmission route in managed metapopulations, spreading several pathogens responsible for infectious diseases such as Johneâ€™s disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], tuberculosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], Verotoxigenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O157:H7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and foot-and-mouth disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Although animal movements cannot necessarily maintain an infection at the regional scale without the implication of complementary transmission routes (e.g. vectorial transmission in vector-borne diseases such as bluetongue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]), it still plays an pivotal role in establishing new infections (as highlighted in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Other transmission routes such as airborne transmission were shown to be important to explain the regional herd incidence in areas with a high cattle density and high prevalence (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] for Q fever). As for BVDV, the contribution of neighbourhood contacts was highlighted by evaluating the risk of a dairy herd changing its status from absence to presence of P animals in relation with location and infection status of neighbouring herds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, this study did not allow assessing the relative roles of trade and neighbourhood contacts since movements were not included. Trade movements were the main contributor in transporting BVDV thereby influencing persistence and prevalence in infected herds and the size of epidemics in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Neighbourhood contacts were negligible when assuming a random network in a very small metapopulation of one hundred herds. This conclusion does not to hold anymore when using a data-driven trade network of a much larger size in a densely populated region with cattle, highlighting the necessity to make use of realistic epidemiological models for achieving a better understanding of complex pathosystems.
