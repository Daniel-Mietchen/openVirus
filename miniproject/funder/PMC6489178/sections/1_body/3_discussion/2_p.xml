<p id="Par53">The simulations showed that even herds introducing yearly very few animals could be reached by the infection, in agreement with field observations in France [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The movement rate in the metapopulation together with the between-herd neighbourhood contacts were high enough in the studied situation to sustain infection persistence at a regional scale thanks to regular reintroductions of the virus at local scale, in agreement with previous results obtained using a theoretical framework [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A downward trend in the number of infected herds was predicted (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which could be explained by a saturation effect occurring in endemic situations: once herd prevalence has reached quite a high level (predicted to be larger than 50% 3 years after the starting point of the simulation period), herd neighbourhoods become highly seroprevalent (i.e. immune), inducing a decrease in herd incidence through neighbourhood contacts. The role of trade movements as a transmission route does not seem to be much affected by a saturation effect, the number of newly infected herds due to this route being constant over time.
