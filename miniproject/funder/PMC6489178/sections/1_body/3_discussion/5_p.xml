<p id="Par56">The proposed model includes all of the movements occurring between farms, but we neglected the intermediary stays in markets and assembly centres, which indeed have been shown to be quite frequent in the French cattle trade system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, since most of these stays are short enough (1 day in markets and ~3 days in assembly centres), the risk of infection can be expected to be low. Such intermediate stays may exhibit in rare occasion a high risk of infection and subsequently impact BVDV spread through associated trade movements, giving rise locally to more movements of transiently infected animals and of dams carrying a persistently infected foetus than assumed in our model. Nevertheless, more information is required to account for such infection events during transportation, notably about the pregnancy status of traded females, which was not available in our datasets.
