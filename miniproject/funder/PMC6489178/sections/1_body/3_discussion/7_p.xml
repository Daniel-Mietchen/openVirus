 </inline-formula>). This parameter was found to be the most important input factor of the sensitivity analysis (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) performed on three dynamical model outputs, at least in the range of parameter values considered. Despite the lack of detailed epidemiological data, we nevertheless calibrated the model by comparing the different simulated scenarios to observed herd prevalence and incidence data. These data correspond to Finistère, a subregion of Brittany containing 21% of its dairy herds distributed over 20% of its area and with a very similar trade pattern (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>A). This calibration, although qualitative, allowed to set the most influential and uncertain parameters to values compatible with data, and highlighted that neighbourhood contacts should be quite intense and within-herd transmission higher than expected for predictions to be in line with observations. Therefore, although not designed as a predictive epidemiological model for BVDV, this calibration conferred to our model a proof of plausibility with respect to data and legitimated the subsequent analyses of simulated scenarios.
