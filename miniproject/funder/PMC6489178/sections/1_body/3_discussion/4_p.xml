<p id="Par55">Unsurprisingly, the number of neighbours and the number of purchased animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] appeared to be among the most important drivers of the probability to acquire BVDV infection through neighbourhood contacts and trade movements, respectively. More interestingly, the number of young animals in the herd and the number of young animals purchased by neighbouring herds also influenced the probability of new infection (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Indeed, young animals are more vulnerable to infection since they are not yet immune. They are also an important source of potential infection, since highly contagious persistently infected animals are mostly calves (as P animals have a half-life period of 1 year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]). This finding also illustrates the interplay between the two transmission routes: the infection can arrive by trade in the neighbourhood and then locally propagates by proximity contacts.
