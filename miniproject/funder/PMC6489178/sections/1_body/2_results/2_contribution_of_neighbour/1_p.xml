<p id="Par46">BVDV persisted up to the end of the 9 years in all runs for the three scenarios. With both transmission routes (neighbourhood contacts and trade movements), the herd prevalence reached more than half of the 12 750 simulated herds (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A, black line). The number of infected herds showed a non-linear pattern when considering neighbourhood contacts only and when considering both routes, while it was mostly decreasing when considering trade movements only. This highlighted the crucial role played by neighbourhood contacts (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The occurrence of newly infected herds every 2 weeks, although decreasing, indicated a large spread throughout the metapopulation (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B). Transmission due to neighbourhood contacts gave rise to periodic variations in herd prevalence and incidence, with higher values during the pasture season. When only trade movements were considered, a much lower number of newly infected herds was predicted, but this incidence was almost consistent over the 9-year period, while the intensity of seasonal peaks decreased when considering neighbourhood contacts only. When both transmission routes were activated, 93.1% of new infections were due to neighbourhood contacts, 6.7% to trade movements, and 0.2% simultaneously to both routes.
