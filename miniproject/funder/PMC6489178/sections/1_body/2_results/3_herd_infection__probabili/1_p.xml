<p id="Par47">Ninety percent of the simulated herds had quite a high annual probability to have a detected infected status (
 <italic>Prob_being_inf</italic> of 0.42 and 0.69 corresponding to the 5
 <sup>th</sup> and 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentiles, respectively; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). Herds in extreme percentiles of this probability (&lt; 0.42 vs. &gt; 0.69) exhibited an intricate spatial pattern (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). The geographical distribution of herds in these two populations was not discriminant, both populations being situated mainly in high-density areas of farms. Herds with a moderate to low risk (percentile 5) purchased similar number of animals but had significantly fewer neighbours than herds with the highest risk (percentile 95), and their neighbours purchased significantly fewer animals than neighbours of herds with the highest risk (percentile 95) (Additional file
