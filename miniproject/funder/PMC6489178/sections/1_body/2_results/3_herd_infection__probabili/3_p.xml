<p id="Par49">In the metapopulation, 98% of the herds reported a positive re-infection probability. However, this re-infection probability was low (&lt; 0.22) for 90% of them. The re-infection probability grew linearly with respect to the infection probability, with a slight saturating effect (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). Among all herds and runs, 80% of herd-runs reported at least one BVDV outbreak, 72% of herd-runs were infected at least once by neighbourhood contacts, and 21% were infected at least once by trade movements. An increase in the mean number of purchased animals per year lowered the proportion of new herd infections due to neighbourhood contacts, while increasing the variability in the number of new infections per herd per run for a similar range of number of neighbours (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Among the 398 herds more prone to be infected through animal movements than through neighbourhood contacts, 96% purchased at least 10 animals per year. This highlighted a change in the main between-herd transmission route with purchase intensity.
