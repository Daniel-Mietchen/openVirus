<p id="Par48">Explanatory variables selected using regression based on random forest explained 66% of the variability of the probability of new herd infections due to trade movements, and 20% of the variability of probability of new herd infections due to neighbourhood contacts (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The three main explanatory variables of the probability of new herd infection due to movements were not correlated. Interestingly, one variable was a herd characteristics (size), one was related to movements (number of purchased animals), and one was related to both neighbourhood and movements (number of young animals purchased by neighbouring herds). Given the low proportion of explained variance, the model of the probability of new herd infection due to neighbourhood contacts was less relevant.
