<p id="Par50">The causal routes of two successive within-herd infections were not associated at random, with higher probability of having similar causal routes than expected, i.e. to be more exposed to one or the other route throughout time. Indeed, when the previous within-herd infection was caused by neighbourhood contacts (trade movements, respectively), the latter one was caused by the same route with probability 0.96 (0.47, respectively), whereas the probability for a herd to be infected by neighbourhood contacts (trade movements, respectively) was 0.93 (0.07, respectively). Herds only infected by neighbourhood contacts over all runs (17% among all herds) had on average 27 neighbours (range 1–65, median = 26) and purchased 0.1 animals per year (range 0–15, median = 0, percentile 95% = 4). Only 10 herds were infected exclusively by trade movements and they were all but one isolated herds.</p>
