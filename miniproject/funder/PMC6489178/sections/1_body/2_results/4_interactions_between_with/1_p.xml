<p id="Par51">Most herds predominantly infected by neighbourhood contacts had at least one persistently infected animal less than half the simulation period (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>A). However, the probability of having persistently infected animals in the herd during more than 75% of the time was still positive, even for herds only incidentally infected by neighbourhood contacts (e.g. less than 20% of new infections). The proportion of immune animals at the infection onset was significantly different in herds infected through neighbourhood contacts (most being less than 0.2) compared to herds infected by trade movements (most being close to 0.75; Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>B).
