<p>A considerable proportion of the participants of this mixed-method study agreed that everyone in the community was potentially susceptible to DENV infection, regardless of his or her age. According to the participants of both FGDs and IDIs, DENV infection is not a severe disease, because the symptoms are flu-like. However, they were well-informed about the severe consequences of DENV infection. In the case of the survey participants, 67% and 60% of them fully agreed that DENV infection is a serious condition and that people who are infected could die of the infection, respectively. Based on these results, the majority of the participants had a moderate-high perceived susceptibility and a moderate-high perceived severity of DENV infection.</p>
