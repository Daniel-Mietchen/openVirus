 <p>“People were criticising, ah, it went like a type of epidemic on the island. People had the idea that the minister did not act on time to stop the epidemic. I am not sure about the impact of the governmental programs, the programs regarding fumigation, on the community. However, people had the idea that the governmental actions were like too little too late (Dutch proverb: mustard after the meal), and it was on a small scale. Thus, the governmental actions were too late to prevent the epidemic.”</p>
