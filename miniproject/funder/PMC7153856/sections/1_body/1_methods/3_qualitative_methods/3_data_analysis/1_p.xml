<p>Qualitative data were analysed using several codes, which refer to an idea, issue, topic or opinion that is evident in the data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Some of the codes were raised by the study participants themselves (inductive) while others were prompted by the interviewers using topics in the interview guide that were derived from literature and existing theories (deductive). We employed two cycles of inductive and deductive coding. In the first cycle, 59 codes were used when analysing the FGDs and IDIs. The coding list of both the FGDs and IDIs can be found in the supporting file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008136.s002">S2 Table</xref>. These codes were assigned to 9 code families, which were analysed in the second cycle of analysis. The following code families were identified; (I) channel of information, (II) the user of the channel of information, (III) preferred channels of information, (IV) risk perception, (V) transmission routes, (VI) symptoms, (VII) preventive measures, (VIII) treatment options, (IX) trust in the channel of information. The qualitative data were analysed using Atlas.ti (version 8.2.0).
