<p>SPSS Data Entry Station (SPSS Inc. 1996–2003, version 4.0.0) was used for quantitative data entry. All quantitative data were analysed by IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. Associations between categorical variables were analysed using the Chi-square test, the Fisher’s exact test or the Fisher-Freeman-Halton exact test when appropriate. Cramér’s V and Phi coefficient were used to measure the strength of association between two nominal variables [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Multicollinearity was assessed using the variance inflation factor (VIF). In this study, no collinearity was found. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were computed to examine the association between channels of information and socio-demographic characteristics. Characteristics that were significantly associated with the dependent variable, at a 0.10 alpha level in univariate analyses, were included in the multivariate regression model [
