<p>In June and July 2015, a cross-sectional mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) study using focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews (IDIs), and individual questionnaires (survey), was performed to assess community participation in Mosquito Breeding Site Control (MBSC) in CuraÒ«ao [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The study was designed based on an integrated theoretical framework of the HBM and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This current study used the SARF, HBM and the theory of cultural schemas, as an analytical interpretive framework, to understand RC among the recruited study participants of the aforementioned cross-sectional mixed-method study. Three concepts of the HBM were incorporated in the SARF. The SARF was applied to explore which channels of information inform individuals about VBDs and the concepts of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of the HBM were applied to understand the risk perception of the study population. The information coming from different channels was considered as a cue to action. The theory of cultural schemas was also incorporated in our integrated conceptual framework to understand the cultural dimensions in the processing of information at the individual level. Both SARF and cultural schemas were not applied at the time of data collection but were used for analysis and result interpretation. In this study, the qualitative data were analysed first and were validated and supported through quantitative analyses.
