<p>The findings of this study form an important contribution to the research field of RC, because to our knowledge, no studies combining qualitative and quantitive research methods based on the SARF, HBM and cultural schemas theory to understand RC from the audienceâ€™s perspective have been published to date. We found that there are different factors

We recommend broadening the use and scope of media platforms to share information on a timely basis and with the content that convinces people of the seriousness of the matter. The health authorities can customise their channels of information by using more social media platforms to reach the younger generation and other groups in the community. We recommend to evaluate the manner in which social media was used and to what extent people were aware of the existence of these platforms to achieve the desired impact. As the health authorities are mistrusted by the public, more efforts need to be made to provide accurate information to the community through a transparent process. Lastly, further research should take more individual characteristics such as cultural schemas and heuristics into account when studying the influence of RC on risk perception and behaviour of individuals.
