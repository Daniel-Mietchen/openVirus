   <italic>MomConnect</italic> maternal health service used by 2 million women in South Africa,
   <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> is already a well-established pathway for ‘provider push’ distribution of health messages. Essential health information can also be provided through ‘user pull’ pathways (such as free or subsidised voice-on-demand services) which empower the public and carers to get the health information they want, in a form they can use, when and where they need it.

   <italic>For (the rapidly increasing number of) people with access to feature or smartphones</italic>: essential health information for the public and carers can be provided in a user pull mode through mobile ‘apps’, many of which, once downloaded, will function even without a network connection. Such applications often include short practical ‘how to’ videos that are accessible to all irrespective of literacy level. Notable examples (and the organisations that produce them) include: 
   <italic>First Aid</italic> (Red Cross),
