   <p>Effective people-centred healthcare requires the public, carers and frontline health workers to have timely access to reliable, practical, health information (we term this 
    <italic>essential health information),</italic> yet in many parts of the world this is often difficult for people to obtain.
   </p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Universal access to essential health information is therefore a 
    <italic>prerequisite</italic> for, and indeed a key component of, universal health coverage (UHC), yet this fundamental role for UHC of access to essential health information appears to have been largely neglectedâ€”for example, it does not feature in the sustainable development goal (SDG) UHC target or associated indicators.

   <p>There is growing evidence of the impact of wider access to practical, actionable, information about health and how this could accelerate the achievement of UHC and other SDG health targets.</p>

   <p>Achieving universal access to essential health information is becoming increasingly feasible and affordable, not least due to the global spread of modern communication technology, but progress is being held back by a glaring lack of high-level political and financial commitment.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>All stakeholders need to work together to accelerate progress towards universal access to essential health information; a catalyst for this would be the inclusion of universal access to essential health information in the relevant SDG target and associated monitoring indicators for UHC, a step that WHO could usefully endorse.</p>
