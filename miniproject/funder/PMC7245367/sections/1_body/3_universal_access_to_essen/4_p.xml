<p>The first column of 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> shows the framework,
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> comprising a set of areas of health, currently being used or considered for use by the UN to monitor progress towards UHC. Progress in most if not all of these areas would be supported by universal access to essential health information. For example, enhancement of care-seeking rates in pregnancy and childhood illness, by families having access to information on when and how care should be sought. We give further examples in the second column of 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>. We chose these examples not least because 
 <italic>all</italic> of this information, and more, in many LMICs, already 
 <italic>exists</italic>, though often is 
 <italic>not yet widely accessible</italic>, in traditional or digital media.
