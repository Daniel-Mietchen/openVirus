  <title>Neuraminidase inhibitors susceptibility of Mozambican influenza virus.</title>
  <p>Susceptibility of viral NA to oseltamivir (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK) was assessed by fluorescent neuraminidase activity inhibition. The NA activity was measured using the fluorescent substrate, 2’-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma, USA) and the inhibitor concentrations ranged from 0.03 nmol/L to 1,000 nmol/L.</p>
