  <title>Phylogenetic comparison of influenza B/Yamagata-lineage HA genes.</title>
  <p>The month of clinical specimen collection is indicated by colour (April to July 2015) and after each virus name. Specific viruses are highlighted: vaccine virus (bold red), reference viruses to which post-infection ferret antisera were raised (bold black) and Mozambican viruses (boxed). Amino acid substitutions defining specific genetic clusters are indicated at nodes and virus-specific substitutions are shown after the virus name (*indicates polymorphism). Genetic clades are indicated to the right of the tree and the scale bar indicates the distance between isolates.</p>
