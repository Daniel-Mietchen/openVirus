<p>The effectiveness of annually administered influenza vaccines relies on the selection of appropriate viruses that elicit optimal immunity against a wide range of influenza viruses circulating worldwide at that time [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Along with classical antigenic characterization, based on serological assays, sequencing of specific virus genes has become an integral surveillance tool that contributes to vaccine selection [
