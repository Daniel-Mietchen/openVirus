<p>Influenza viruses are considered a major public health problem worldwide due to their potential to cause pandemics and yearly epidemics with considerable morbidity and significant mortality, with more than 250,000 deaths per year occurring worldwide due to influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genome of these viruses consists of eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), have the highest evolutionary rates of all influenza proteins [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The amino acid substitutions which are accumulated in mutant viruses, enable the virus to evade the immune system [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This process of accumulation of amino acid substitutions can result in progressive antigenic changes in the surface glycoproteins known as antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to point mutations, genetic reassortment also plays an important role in the evolution of newly emerging viruses [
