<p>For RT-PCR, virus RNA was extracted from 140 Î¼L of infected cell culture supernatant or clinical sample using a QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN), as described by the manufacturers. The extracted RNA was retro transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using Invitrogen SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently amplified with Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Thermo Life Sciences). Sanger dideoxy-sequencing was performed using a Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and analysed on an ABI-3730XL DNA analyzer. Sequences were assembled and edited using the Staden software package and alignments were conducted in BioEdit. Phylogenetic analyses and comparisons with reference sequences were performed using RAxML, with the Annotator program used to indicate nodes defined by specific amino acid substitutions, and trees were drawn using FigTree version 1.4.3. The description and history of the biological effect of the identified amino acid substitutions (classical numbering) were adduced through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)-associated link to FluSurver [

All sequences generated in the course of the present study were deposited in GISAID under the following identifiers EPI_ISL_(197469, 197478, 200227, 200228, 201663, 201667, 201668 201669, 201670, 201671, 201673, 201675, 201676, 201677, 201678, 201683, 201732 201741, 201744).
