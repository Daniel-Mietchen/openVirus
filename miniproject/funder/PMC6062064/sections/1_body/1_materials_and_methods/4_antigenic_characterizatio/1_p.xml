<p>Antigenic characterization of influenza isolates was performed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, following WHO standard methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For influenza A(H1N1pdm09) and influenza B viruses, 0.75% (v/v) suspensions of turkey red blood cells (RBCs) was used. For influenza A(H3N2) viruses 1% (v/v) guinea pig RBCs in the presence of oseltamivir carboxylate was used [

Panels of post-infection ferret antisera against vaccine and references virus strains were used to assess the antigenic characteristics of Mozambican strains. Viruses were considered antigenically similar or “like” each other if their HI titers differ by two dilutions or less [equivalent to a two-well (i.e. a four-fold dilution) or less difference] [
