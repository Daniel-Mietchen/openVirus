<p>Susceptibility of viral NA to oseltamivir (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, UK) was assessed by fluorescent neuraminidase activity inhibition [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The NA activity was measured using the fluorescent substrate, 2’-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA; Sigma, USA) and the inhibitor concentrations ranged from 0.03 nmol/L to 1,000 nmol/L. Briefly, a total volume of 45 μL containing 15 μL of the virus and 66 μM MUNANA in 21.66 mM MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2.66 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> was incubated for 60 minutes at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 150 μL of 0.14 M NaOH in 83% ethanol. The fluorescence of the released 4-methylumbelliferone sodium salt was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 355/365 nm and 450/460 nm, respectively. The activity of each virus sample was titrated, by assaying serial two-fold dilutions. Virus suspensions were adjusted to equivalent NA activities, which fell into the linear portion of the activity curve and the viruses were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with oseltamivir or zanamivir at final concentrations of 5 μM to 0.05 pM, in serial ten-fold dilutions.
