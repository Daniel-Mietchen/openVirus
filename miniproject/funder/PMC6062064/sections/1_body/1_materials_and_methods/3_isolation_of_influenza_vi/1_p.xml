<p>Viruses were recovered and propagated following inoculation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and type B-positive clinical specimens in conventional Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. A(H3N2)-positive specimens were inoculated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells (engineered to express increased levels of α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) [

Cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium with Earle’s salts, non-essential amino acids and L-glutamine (Gibco no. 41-500-034) and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Gibco no. 12 800–01) respectively, both supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA). The presence of virus in the cell-culture supernatant was confirmed by hemagglutination activity (HA) according to WHO standard methods using suspensions of either guinea pig erythrocytes (1% v/v) or turkey erythrocytes (0.75% v/v) [
