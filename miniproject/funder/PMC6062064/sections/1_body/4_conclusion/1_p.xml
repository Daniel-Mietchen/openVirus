<p>Overall, all Mozambican isolates, both influenza A and B subtypes showed high antigenic and genetic similarity to African isolates and those recommended for season vaccines. Additionally, findings from this study highlight the importance and the need of permanent: (i) sharing influenza-positive samples, (ii) performing regular virologic and epidemiological surveillance and (iii) performing antigenic and genetic evolution analysis of influenza viruses at country and regional levels. Outcomes from such actions will contribute to the design of effective control measures in the region, including the use of effective vaccines. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the circulation and evolutionary patterns of the virus within the Southern Africa region.</p>
