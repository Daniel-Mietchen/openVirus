<p>All five A(H3N2) Mozambican viruses, that were analyzed by HI assays, fell in genetic subclade 3C.2a and showed antigenic and genetic similarity to reference viruses from Hong Kong isolated in 2014, including the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 strain, recommended for use in vaccines for the Southern Hemisphere 2016 and 2017 and Northern Hemisphere 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 influenza seasons [

Antiserum raised against cell culture-propagated A/Hong Kong/5738/2014 showed better results than antiserum raised against egg-cultured A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, which recognized less than half of Mozambican A(H3N2) isolates and only 53% of viruses from a range of countries [
