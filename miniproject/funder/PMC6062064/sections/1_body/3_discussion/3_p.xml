<p>The four Mozambican influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains tested were antigenically very similar to A/California/7/2009 and fell into genetic group 6B that had been in widespread circulation between 2013 and 2016 when sub-group 6B.1 viruses became predominant around the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. When compared to the reference sequence (A/California/7/2009 virus), a number of nucleotides substitutions was detected in the Mozambican A(H1N1)pdm09 strains HA sequences. As adduced from Fluserver [
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], of the substitutions detected in the Mozambican HA sequences, P83S, D97N, K163Q, S185T, S203T are known to be the most frequent and globally distributed (detected in more than 18% of the global HA sequences in more than 24 countries) while the substitutions S69P, T120A, K208R and E235D are known to be the less frequently distributed globally (detected in less than 1% of global HA sequences). Of note, all the substitutions observed in the Mozambican HA sequences were also observed in the 2015 South African HA sequences used in this study. No biological effect of the detected substitutions was elucidated or described in the literature. However, the substitutions P83S, S185T and S203T have been observed since the 2009/2010 and were considered variant markers of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2009 pandemic [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of note, none of the HA substitutions known to affect antigenic characteristics and/or disease severity (D222E, S185N, Q293H in HA1, N154I and I277V in HA2) [
