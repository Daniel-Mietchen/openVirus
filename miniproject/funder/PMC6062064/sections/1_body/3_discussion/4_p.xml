<p>As previously reported, more than half of the Mozambican influenza A(H3N2) isolates failed to agglutinate all RBCs. This loss of the ability to agglutinate RBCs and poor replicative capacity in MDCK cells have been reported worldwide as a result of low binding affinities of the viral HA molecules to their receptors [
