<p>Genetic analysis supported the antigenic analysis since all Mozambican isolates fell into the B/Phuket/3073/2013 clade. Interestingly, Mozambican HA sequences formed a sub-cluster with other African isolates carrying the HA1 M251V amino acid substitution. This sub-cluster also contained NA genes from the influenza B/Victoria-lineage. According to WHO CC London reports, reassortant viruses were sporadically seen in various parts of the world [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but no literature was found describing the origin of those reassortant viruses. However, the continuous co-circulation of influenza B lineages was not observed during 2013 and 2014 seasons in South Africa[

That subcluster formed by Mozambique and South Africa carried additional substitutions (I125L and D232N in HA1 and N504D in HA2). These substitutions, with the exception of I125L, have been observed across many countries and have no known marked biological effect. However, as adduced from FluServer, they have been associated with HA oligomerization interfaces, host cell receptor-binding and antibody recognition sites [
