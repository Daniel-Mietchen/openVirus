<p>The genetic clade 3 virus, B/Hong Kong/3417/2014, would be the best choice as a vaccine component for Mozambique, as the antiserum raised against it recognised well all the three Mozambican isolates than the antisera raised against another genetic clade 3 strain B/Phuket/3073/2013 that was recommended vaccine component for 2016 and 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza season and 2016/2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season [

 <xref rid="pone.0201248.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that poorly recognised one of the three Mozambican viruses. However, antigenic analysis of global influenza B viruses isolates showed that antiserum raised against the egg-propagated vaccine virus B/Phuket/3073/2013, recognised 100% of test viruses collected after 2015-08-31 at titres within 4-fold of the titre with the homologous virus [
