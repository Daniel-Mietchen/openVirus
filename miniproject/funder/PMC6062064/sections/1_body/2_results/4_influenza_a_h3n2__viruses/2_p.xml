<p>Hemagglutinin phylogenetic analysis showed that all 12 Mozambican influenza A(H3N2) strains, including those unable to be analysed by HI, clustered with viruses circulating globally in subclade 3C.2a (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201248.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This subclade includes the currently recommended vaccine virus A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. The subclade is defined by amino acid substitutions N145S in HA1 and D489N in HA2 (clade 3C.2) and additional HA1 substitutions resulting in the loss (L3I, N144S) and gain (F159Y, K160T, N225D) potential N-linked glycosylation sites and Q311H. All Mozambican strains isolated between January and May grouped with South African strains isolated between May and July. This group was defined by amino acid substitution in HA1 Q197R.
