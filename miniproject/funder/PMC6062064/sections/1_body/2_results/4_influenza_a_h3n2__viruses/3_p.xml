<p>A similar topology was observed when analysing the NA sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201248.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Two Mozambican isolates showed HA1 T160K reversion and two other isolates carried HA1 S124R and HA2 V505I substitutions (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201248.s005">S3 Table</xref>). Interestingly, of the five strains that could be analysed antigenically by HI, four showed loss or partial loss of the 158â€“160 glycosylation motif due to HA1 T160K or T160I substitution or T160 polymorphism (T160).
