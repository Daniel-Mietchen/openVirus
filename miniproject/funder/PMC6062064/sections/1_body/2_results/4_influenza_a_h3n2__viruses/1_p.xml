<p>All A(H3N2) viruses (n = 12) were successfully propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells, but only five were able to agglutinate guinea pig RBCs in the presence of oseltamivir. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, all five Mozambican viruses were well recognised by antiserum raised against cell culture-propagated A/Hong Kong/5738/2014 (subclade 3C.2a virus), at titres within 2-fold of the homologous titre. But antiserum raised against the other subclade 3C.2a virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 recognised the five Mozambican viruses at different titres: two at titres within 2-fold, other two at 4-fold and one virus at 8-fold reductions compared to the titres of the antisera for the homologous virus. Antiserum raised against egg-propagated A/Stockholm/6/2014, a virus from subclade 3C.3a showed similar reactivity profile as antiserum raised against A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. Antiserum raised against cell culture-propagated A/Stockholm/6/2014 recognised all five test viruses at titres 2-fold reduced compared to the titre with the homologous virus. Antiserum raised against another 3C.3a subclade virus, egg-propagated A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, previously recommended for use in vaccines, showed low dynamic range, recognising test viruses at homologous titres â‰¤ 80. All test viruses were poorly recognised by antisera raised against viruses from clades previously in circulation (A/Texas/50/2012, 3C.1; A/Hong Kong/146/2013, 3C.2 and A/Samara/73/2013, 3C.3) and A/Netherland/525/2014, 3C.3b included.
