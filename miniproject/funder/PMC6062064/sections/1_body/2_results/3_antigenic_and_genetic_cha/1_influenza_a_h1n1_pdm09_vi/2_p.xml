<p>Hemagglutinin phylogenetic analysis also showed that A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were similar to viruses circulating globally and belonging to genetic sub-group 6B defined by amino acid substitutions D97N, S185T, S203T and K283E in HA1 and E374K, S451N and E499K in HA2 (characteristic of group 6) and additional HA1 amino acid substitutions K163Q and A256T (characteristic of sub-group 6B) (
