<p>All three influenza B virus isolates from Mozambique were successfully propagated and showed HI activity and were recognised well by the hyper-immune sheep antiserum raised against the vaccine virus egg-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013. Influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses with HA genes from clade 2 (the B/Massachusetts/02/2012 clade) can be differentiated by some antisera from those with HA genes in clade 3 (the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 â€“B/Phuket/3073/2013 clade). As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0201248.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Hong Kong/3417/2014 (a clade 3 virus) recognised all three test viruses at titres equal to its homologous titre but this antiserum recognises reference viruses from clade 2 and clade 3 at titres within 2-fold of each other. Two of the three test viruses, B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 and B/Mozambique/IR1062/2015 were recognised by antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013, at titres within 2-fold of the homologous virus titre, and likewise the antiserum raised against the previous vaccine virus egg-propagated B/Wisconsin/1/2010 recognised B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 and B/Mozambique/IR1062/2015 at titres within 2-fold of the homologous titre of the antiserum, B/Mozambique/IR1010/2015 being recognised somewhat less well by both these antisera at titres 4-fold lower than the homologous titres of these antisera. B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 and B/Mozambique/IR1062/2015 were recognised by antiserum raised against the cell culture-propagated B/Phuket/3073/21013, but at titres within 4-fold of its homologous titre, and B/Mozambique/IR1010/2015 was recognised poorly by this antiserum. Surprisingly, the antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/Stockholm/1/2011 recognised all three test viruses poorly. An antiserum raised against egg-propagated clade 2 vaccine virus B/Massachusetts/02/2012 recognised B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 and B/Mozambique/IR1062/2015 at titres within 4-fold of its homologous titre but the antiserum raised against the cell culture-propagated cultivar of B/Massachusetts/02/2012 recognised only B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 at a titre within 4-fold of its homologous titre. The antiserum raised against cell culture-propagated B/Estonia/55669/2011 (a clade 3 virus) had a low homologous titre of 80 and recognised B/Mozambique/IR981/2015 and B/Mozambique/IR1062/2015 at titres within 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively, of the titre of the antiserum for the homologous virus and recognised B/Mozambique/IR1010/2015 poorly. Overall antisera raised against viruses from clade 3 recognised the test viruses from Mozambique somewhat better than the antisera raised against viruses from clade 2.
