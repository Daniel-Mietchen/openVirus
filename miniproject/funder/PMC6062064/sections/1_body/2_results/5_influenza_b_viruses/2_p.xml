<p>All three Mozambican influenza B strains had HA genes that fell into genetic clade 3 of the B/Yamagata-lineage along with the 2016 vaccine virus B/Phuket/3073/2013 (

However, these isolates carried NA genes of the B/Victoria-lineage also observed in other viruses from Africa (Ghana, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia) with which they formed a group in the phylogenetic tree characterized by HA1 M251V amino acid substitution. Mozambique isolates formed a distinct subgroup with South African isolates carrying additional amino acid substitutions in HA1 (I125L and D232N) and HA2 (N504D) (
