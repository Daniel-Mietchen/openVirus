<p>Of the 20 specimens sent to the Francis Crick Institute, influenza virus was successfully recovered from 19 specimens, yielding a recovery rate of 95.0% (19/20). The only sample that was not recovered belonged to A(H3N2) subtype. All influenza B (n = 3) and A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 4) viruses showed hemagglutination activity, but only five out of 12 (41.7%) recovered A(H3N2) viruses showed hemagglutination activity. However, all A(H3N2) viruses (n = 12) were confirmed by sialidase assay.</p>
