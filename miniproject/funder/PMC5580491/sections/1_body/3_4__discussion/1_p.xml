<p>It is generally accepted that live, attenuated influenza vaccines are superior to inactivated or subunit vaccines in terms of quality of the antiviral immune response, and the level and duration of protective immunity [

Recombinant adenovirus vectored vaccines are an attractive immunization approach given these vectors can express the antigen of interest and produce pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) that stimulate protective immune responses in the respiratory tract.
