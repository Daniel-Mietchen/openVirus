<p>In experimental animal model systems, the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of broadly neutralizing antibodies against the conserved influenza virus HA stalk domain have recently been evaluated with encouraging results [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f002">Figure 2</xref>A–E). We found that immunization with rAdH5/M2e induced levels of stalk-specific IgG2A and IgG2B that were comparable to levels induced by live PR8 and superior to those induced by inactivated vaccines (
