<p>Passive immunization experiments demonstrated that sera from mice immunized with the vectored vaccine provided cross-protection against infection with different influenza virus subtypes; however, sera from mice immunized with formaldehyde-inactivated influenza virus failed to provide protection against heterosubtypic challenge (

These findings suggest that the balanced Th1/Th2 HA stalk-specific antibody responses, specifically IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, and IgA antibodies, provided cross-protection from morbidity and mortality resulting from heterosubtypic influenza virus infection.
