<p>In summary, our study demonstrated that our adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine, rAdH5/M2e, induces a balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses that provide durable cross-protection against infection with influenza viruses. Our results further indicate that preserving the native conformations of HA antigenic epitopes, such as accomplished by our adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine, is important for induction of neutralizing antibodies, and in particular stalk-binding Abs that form the basis of broadly protective immunity against heterologous influenza virus challenge. Our findings are of relevance to the manufacture of seasonal influenza vaccines and will likely influence the development of novel universal influenza vaccines that are based on the conserved HA stalk domain.</p>
