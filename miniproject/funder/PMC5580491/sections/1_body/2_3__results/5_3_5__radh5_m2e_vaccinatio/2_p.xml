<p>Next, we assessed the duration of the hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibody responses induced by each vaccination strategy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f005">Figure 5</xref>F, and consistent with our findings presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f002">Figure 2</xref>, HA stalk-specific antibodies could be detected for all vaccination groups at 12 months after immunizations. Most notably, immunization with rAdH5/M2e significantly induced persistent levels of HA stalk-specific Abs that surpassed those induced by infection with wild-type influenza virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). To assess the quality of protection provided by these durable antibody responses, we conducted passive immunization experiments in which na誰ve recipient mice received convalescent immune sera prepared at 12 months post-immunization. The passively immunized na誰ve recipient mice were then challenged by homosubtypic or heterosubtypic challenge infection. The convalescent sera from rAdH5/M2e-immunized mice protected the na誰ve recipient mice against homotypic and heterosubtypic challenge infections (data not shown). Consistent with the morbidity and mortality shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D, convalescent sera transferred from mice immunized with FiPR8+CT protected na誰ve recipient mice from homotypic H1N1 virus infection, but not from heterosubtypic H5N2 virus infection (data not shown). These results emphasize that long-term immunization with a vectored influenza virus vaccine, but not inactivated influenza virus vaccine, can induce prolonged Ab-dependent cross-protection against influenza viruses.
