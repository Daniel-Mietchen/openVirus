<p>Since a desirable attribute of an effective influenza vaccines is the induction of durable vaccine responses that could provide protection over several influenza seasons, we next addressed whether the immunogenicity of the specific vaccines translated into long-lasting antibody responses. We examined the duration of the vaccine-induced humoral immunity for one year. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, examination of antibody titers at three, nine, and 12 months post-immunization of mice with rAdH5/M2e, live PR8 or FiPR8+CT generated significant levels of long-lasting vaccine-specific Ab titers. Consistent with our previous IgG and IgA data (
