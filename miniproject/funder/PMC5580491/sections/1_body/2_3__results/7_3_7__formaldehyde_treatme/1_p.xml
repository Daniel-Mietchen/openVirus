<p>Since immunity against conserved viral proteins can contribute to cross-protection, we next asked whether formaldehyde treatment of conserved proteins such as nucleoprotein (NP) and M2 also reduced their binding by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Cultured MDCK cells were infected overnight with PR8 virus to allow expression of M2 and NP. The infected cells were then treated with 80% acetone in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently with 0.2% formaldehyde for use in ELISA. Cell-based ELISA was then performed using anti-M2 ectodomain (M2e) or anti-NP specific mAbs. As expected, formaldehyde treatment of the infected MDCK cells reduced significantly binding of NP- and M2e-specific mAbs (

Non-infected MDCK cells treated with 0.2% of formaldehyde were included to determine background staining. These results collectively emphasize the importance of preserving the native forms of conserved viral antigens such as M2e, NP, and the HA stalk domain for induction of Abs that mediate cross-protection. In contrast to inactivated vaccines, live vaccines, such as our adenovirus vectored influenza vaccine, are preferable because of induction of broadly cross-reactive Abs and presentation of viral proteins in their native conformation to the hostâ€™s immune system.
