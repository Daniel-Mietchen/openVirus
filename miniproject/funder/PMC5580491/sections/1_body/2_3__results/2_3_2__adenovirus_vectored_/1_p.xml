<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies specific for the HA stalk domain or vaccination regimens that focus humoral responses on the HA stalk domain can provide confer cross-protection. Considering the importance of HA stalk-specific antibody responses to cross-protection, we next determined the levels of HA stalk-specific Abs in the mouse sera described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f002">Figure 2</xref> by ELISA, including recombinant baculovirus-expressed chimeric HA protein (cH9/1) containing the globular head of an H9 virus and the stalk domain of the H1 virus. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B, immunization of mice with rAdH5/M2e induced significant levels of HA stalk-specific total Ig or IgG Abs that were equal or superior to the antibody responses detected from the other vaccination groups. Interestingly, immunization with a live vaccine, i.e., FluMist
 <sup>®</sup>, live PR8, and rAdH5/M2e, generally induced the highest levels of stalk-specific IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, and IgA antibodies (
