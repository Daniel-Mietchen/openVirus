<p>To examine the antibody responses induced by our adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine, mice were immunized with formalin-inactivated PR8 plus cholera toxin adjuvant (FiPR8+CT), live PR8, or adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine, rAdH5/M2e. Groups of mice immunized with TIV (Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine) and FluMist
 <sup>®</sup> were included to allow for comparison of our vectored vaccine with licensed vaccines. Following a single immunization, we determined the H1 or H5-specific serum antibody responses against A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) or A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005 (H5N2) viruses, respectively, by hemagglutination inhibition assay and microneutralization assay. Immunization with FiPR8+CT, live PR8, or rAdH5/M2e or induced potent hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) and neutralizing antibody titers (

 <sup>®</sup> failed to induce serum antibody responses. Considering that the balance of Th1/Th2 responses will impact the humoral responses induced by vaccines, we next examined the profiles of IgG and IgA antibody levels in the convalescent sera of mice immunized with these vaccines. We first analyzed the vaccine-specific total Ig and IgG-specific antibody responses for each immunization group by ELISA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D, immunization with any of the indicated vaccinations stimulated elevated levels of vaccine-specific total Ig and IgG antibody responses. Interestingly, immunization with any of the indicated vaccines induced IgG subclass-specific responses without a notable bias of the Th1/Th2 balance (
