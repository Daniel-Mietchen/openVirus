<p>The ELISA results suggested that immunization with the adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induced relatively balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses as indicated by elevated levels of IgG2A and IgG2B, and IgG1 and IgA, respectively. Since the profile of cytokines can indicate the Th1/Th2 phenotype of the immune response, we examined the cytokine responses induced in the immunized mice to establish a correlation between the T helper response and antibody responses. IL-4 is key regulatory cytokine that induces differentiation of naive helper T cells into Th2 cells, stimulates differentiation of B cells into antibody secreting plasma cells, and promotes class switching from IgM to IgG1. Cholera toxin has been reported to strongly agonist of the IL-4 pathway and inducer of Th2 IgA antibody responses [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we analyzed IL-6 levels. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, the adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine, rAdH5/M2e, stimulated modest levels of IL-6 as compared to immunization with FiPR8+CT or live PR8. Since IL-10 is a major immune-modulatory cytokine that down regulates the expression of Th1 cytokines, and enhances B cell survival, proliferation, and antibody production [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we also analyzed IL-10 levels. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, immunization with rAdH5/M2e induced markedly higher levels of IL-10 that were comparable to levels induced by live PR8 or were higher than those induced by immunization with formaldehyde-inactivated PR8+CT. These cytokine data demonstrate that immunization with rAdH5/M2e induces Th2-type of cytokine responses that correlated with the observed IgG1 and IgA antibody titers, and balanced with Th1-type responses.
