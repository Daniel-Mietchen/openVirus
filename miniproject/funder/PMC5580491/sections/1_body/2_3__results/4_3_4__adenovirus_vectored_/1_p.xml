<p>After establishing that immunization of mice with rAdH5/M2e induces balanced Th1/Th2 antibody responses against the influenza virus hemagglutinin, we next examined the level of protection provided by this balanced humoral response against influenza virus challenge infection. To specifically focus our examination on the protective quality of the humoral immunity induced by our vaccination strategies, we passively immunized naïve mice with sera from mice immunized with FiPR8+CT, live PR8, or rAdH5/M2e. This passive immunization experiment eliminated any potential cytotoxic T cell responses that could have confounded our analysis of antibody-mediated protection from challenge infection. Following passive immunization of naïve mice, we then challenged the recipient mice by H1N1 or H5N2 challenge infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f004">Figure 4</xref>, immune sera from mice immunized with FiPR8+CT, live PR8, or rAdH5/M2e protected naïve recipient mice against challenge infection by an H1N1 virus (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). Sera transferred from animals immunized with FiPR8+CT protected naïve recipient mice from H1N1 infection, but not H5N2 infection. Importantly, passive immunization of mice with sera from rAdH5/M2e-immunized mice reduced morbidity and prevented mortality as a result of the heterosubtypic H1N1 virus infection. These results suggest that immunization with heterosubtypic H1N1 virus induced antibody-dependent cross-protection that was likely mediated by hemagglutinin-stalk specific antibodies.
