<p>Interestingly, sera from mice immunized with FiPR8+CT failed to provide cross-protection in the passive immunization experiments, and lacked high levels of stalk-specific Abs. We therefore examined by ELISA that included the cH9/1 hemagglutinin whether formaldehyde treatment could change the immunogenicity and/or antigenicity of the HA stalk domain, which, in terms of inactivated vaccines, could result in the induction of Abs that fail to recognize the native form of hemagglutinin produced during virus infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f006">Figure 6</xref>A, formaldehyde treatment significantly impacted the antigenicity of the HA stalk domain as evidenced by the reduced binding of Abs present in immune sera from immunized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). In contrast, treatment of whole PR8 virus with formaldehyde reduced the binding of Abs present in the immune sera to virus particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). These results suggested that the antigenicity of the HA stalk domain is susceptible to formaldehyde treatment. To more specifically address this observation, we employed monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 6F12 that is specific for the HA stalk of A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1), PY102 that is specific for the globular head of A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1), and 7B2 that is specific for the globular head of A/California 4/09 (Cal09) (H1N1) in the binding assays. Plates coated with recombinant cH9/1 or whole PR8 virus particles were used in ELISA to determine whether or not formaldehyde treatment of the antigens impacted their antigenicity as evidenced by reduced binding by the mAbs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, formaldehyde treatment reduced remarkably binding of the stalk domain by the stalk-specific mAb (6F12) as well as by convalescent serum raised by infection of mice with a sublethal dose of wild type influenza virus. In contrast, treatment of whole virus particles with formaldehyde did not alter significantly the binding of the virus by head-specific mAb PY102 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00234-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). These results indicated that formaldehyde treatment substantially altered the antigenicity of the conserved stalk domain but had a lesser effect on the HA globular head.
