<p>The cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-12 define a T helper 1 (Th1) response that stimulates production of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G2A and IgG2B Ab in mice [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], whereas the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 characterize a Th2 response [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and stimulate secretion of IgG1, which is the main IgG Ab subclass produced by influenza-infected mice [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. IL-6 induces inflammation and production of IL-4, which promotes differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector Th2 cells and induction of B cell responses [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the context of mouse vaccination model, decreasing IL-6 levels resulted in corresponding decreases in IL-4 and IL-6 levels, which had a significant impact on protective antibody responses [
