<p>In this study, we examined the cross-protective immunity induced by immunization with the rAdH5/M2e vaccine. Herein, we show that immunization with an adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induced strong neutralizing Ab responses against the conserved hemagglutinin stalk domain and demonstrate that these vaccine-induced, Th2-type specific stalk-specific antibodies provide protection against influenza virus infection. Importantly, we provide evidence from studies that included vaccines treated with formaldehyde that the native conformation of the epitopes are necessary for induction of protective immunity. The results provide evidence of the advantages of using an adenovirus vector as a platform for the development of universal influenza vaccines and the generation of cross-protective antibodies for control of influenza.</p>
