<p>Currently available influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines require frequent changes in viral strain composition to address the continuous antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses. However, these vaccines often provide poor immunity and are often not effective at preventing severe illness. The successes of these licensed vaccines to prevent influenza disease are limited by several factors including poor vaccine coverage, constant antigenic drift, and vaccine mismatch. Despite limitations on the data from retrospective clinical studies and a limited number of human challenge infection studies, variable protection against heterologous challenge after administration of inactivated influenza vaccine has been reported for a pediatric patient cohort [

In experimental settings, single or prime/boost vaccinations with inactivated vaccine did not induce a robust cross-reactive immune response, nor did they provide protection against heterologous influenza virus challenge in either mice or ferrets [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have been shown to induce cross-protection. A robust immune response and protection conferred by LAIV was attributed to serum and mucosal antibody responses and cell-mediated immunity in ferrets [
