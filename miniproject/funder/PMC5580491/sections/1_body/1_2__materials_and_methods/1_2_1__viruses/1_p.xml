<p>A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005 (H5N2), isolated from a wild bird in Korea 2006 and kindly provided by Young-Ki Choi of Chungbuk National University, Korea, was adapted by multiple passages (15 times) in Balb/c mice. After the final passage, a single plaque isolated by plaque purification on MDCK cells was amplified in embryonated chicken eggs. The mouse LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the H5N2 virus was determined for the challenge experiment as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) virus was prepared from lung homogenates of intranasally infected mice prior to use for challenge infections.
