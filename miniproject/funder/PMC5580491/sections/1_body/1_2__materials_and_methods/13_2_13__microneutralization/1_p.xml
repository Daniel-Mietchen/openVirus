<p>Neutralizing Ab titers were determined by microneutralization (MN) assays. Briefly, two-fold serially diluted serum samples were incubated with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of viruses. The serum/antibody mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to MDCK cells, and then the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for overnight. The presence of viral protein was detected by ELISA with anti-NP IgG Ab (Millipore). The neutralizing Ab titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that gave 50% neutralization of 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of virus in MDCK cells.
