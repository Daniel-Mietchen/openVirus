<p>Sera samples were treated with a receptor destroying enzyme (RDE-ΙΙ, Denka Seiken, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which resulted in a final dilution of 1:10 before being tested in Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Two-fold serially diluted serum samples were incubated with an equal volume containing 8 HA units of the indicated virus in V shaped-bottom 96-well microtiter plates at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, freshly prepared 1% chicken red blood cells (CRBC) were added, and plates were mixed by agitation, covered, and allowed to set for 1 h at 4 °C. The HI titers were determined by the reciprocal of the last dilution, which contained non-agglutinated CRBC. Positive and negative control samples were included on each plate.</p>
