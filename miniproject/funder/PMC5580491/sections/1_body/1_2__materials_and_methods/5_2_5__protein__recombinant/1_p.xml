<p>The M2e construct encoding three tandem copies of M2e conjugated to the C-terminal sequence of M2 protein of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus was kindly provide by Manki Song, International Vaccine Institute, Korea [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-09-00234" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The baculovirus-expressed chimeric HA cH9/1 protein contains the stalk domain of the H1 A/PR/8/34 (PR8) HA and the globular head domain of the H9 A/guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF10/99. The mouse mAbs 7B2 specific for the HA globular head of A/California/4/09 (CAL/09) H1N1, 6F12 specific for the HA stalk of A/PR8 (H1N1), and PY102 specific for the HA globular head of A/PR8 (H1N1) were kindly provided by Peter Palese, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), New York. The mAbs were previously described in detail [
