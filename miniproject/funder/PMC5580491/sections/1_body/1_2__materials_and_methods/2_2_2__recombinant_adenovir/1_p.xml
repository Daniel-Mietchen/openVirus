<p>Influenza M2 and HA antigen sequences were derived from A/Vietnam/1230/2004 (H5N1) (GenBank AY651388 and AY651334, respectively). The recombinant adenovirus (rAd) vector encoding H5 HA was selected for immediate evaluation as a vaccine candidate against a potential H5N1 pandemic. The codon optimized H5 HA sequence (synthesized by GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was cloned into the pShuttle/CMV plasmid, which allowed for homologous recombination with a plasmid encoding an Ad backbone in BJ5183

The vectors were mass-produced, purified and titrated according to the AdEasy manual. The genomes were sequenced to confirm the presence of M2e and HA genes and their flanking Ad sequences. M2e and HA of H5N1 origin were validated in lysates prepared from transduced HeLa cells by western blot analysis using Abs to M2 kindly provided by W.
