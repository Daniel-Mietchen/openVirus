<p>Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mL of a ketamine/xylazine mixture (0.15 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively), and then either i.n. immunized with 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU in 50 μL of rAdH5/M2e or with a sublethal dose of live mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) or FluMist
 <sup>®</sup> (MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MA, USA) that contains four vaccine virus strains: an A/H1N1 strain, an A/H3N2 strain and two B strains; or intramuscularly immunized (i.m.) with commercial trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV, Vaxiflu, Dong-A Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea, Injection prefilled syringe) that contains purified inactivated influenza antigen type A (A/California/7/2009X-179A (H1N1)), (A/South Australia/55/2014IVR-175 (H3N2)), and purified inactivated influenza antigen B, diluted in 50 μL of PBS per mouse, respectively. Formaldehyde-inactivated PR8 virus (FiPR8 was prepared by treatment of egg-grown PR8 with 0.02% formaldehyde overnight followed by formaldehyde removal by dialysis. Where indicated, mice were intranasally immunized with 50 uL containing an equivalent of 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of inactivated PR8 virus mixed with 2 µg of cholera toxin (FiPR8+CT) (List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA, USA). For all immunizations, mice were primed and boosted with the same procedure. For the long-term immunization, we used same dose of live PR8, and rAdH5/M2e, and mice received a booster immunization with FiPR8+CT, respectively. Four weeks after the last immunization, sera were collected and analyzed individually. For use in passive immunization experiments, sera collected from the same immunization group were pooled.
