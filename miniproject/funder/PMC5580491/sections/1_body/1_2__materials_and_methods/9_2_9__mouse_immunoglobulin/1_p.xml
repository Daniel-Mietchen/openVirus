<p>Isotyping of immunoglobulin in sera was performed using a magnetic bead panel 96-well plate assay (Millipore, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Briefly, plates were treated with 25 µL of assay buffer at RT for 10 min. Then 50 µL of standard, control or undiluted serum samples were added to the appropriate wells. MILLIPLEX
 <sub>MAP</sub> anti-mouse multi-immunoglobulin beads were then added to each well at RT for 15 min. Finally, 25 µL per well of diluted anti-mouse κ light chain PE was added at RT for 15 min. The results were obtained by reading the plates on a Luminex
 <sup>®</sup> instrument (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).
