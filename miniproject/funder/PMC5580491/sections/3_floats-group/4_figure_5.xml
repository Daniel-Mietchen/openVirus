  <p>Intranasal immunization with adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induced long-lived HA stalk-specific humoral immunity. To detect long-term stalk-specific antibody responses, Balb/c mice were intranasally immunized with FiPR8+CT, live PR8, or rAdH5/M2e. Sera were collected from immunized mice at twelve moths post-immunization, and the levels of Th1/Th2 Abs were determined by a Mouse immunoglobulin Isotyping Magnetic Bead Panel assay (Millipore, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>E</bold>). To examine the duration of the vaccine-specific and stalk-specific antibody responses, sera were collected from the immunized mice at three, nine, or twelve months post-immunization. The levels of vaccine-specific and stalk-specific Abs were determined by ELISA using plates coated with H1N1 (
   <bold>A</bold>), or baculorvirus-expressed cH9/1 protein (
   <bold>F</bold>). The values represent the mean ± SEM (vertical bars) end point ELISA antibody titers determined from five mice per group (***
