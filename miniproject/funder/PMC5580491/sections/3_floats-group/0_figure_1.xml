  <p>Adenovirus-vectored influenza vaccine induces a balanced T helper (Th)1/Th2 neutralizing antibody response. Balb/c mice were immunized with formaldehyde-inactivated PR8+CT (FiPR8+CT), live PR8 (H1N1), TIV, FluMist
   <sup>®</sup> or, rAdH5/M2e. Four weeks post-immunization, sera were collected and the hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) titers (
   <bold>A</bold>), virus neutralization titers (
   <bold>B</bold>), and vaccine-specific total Ig, IgG, IgG1, IgG2A, IgG2B, and IgA antibodies (
   <bold>C</bold>–
   <bold>H</bold>) were determined. HI and VN titer of FiPR8+CT, TIV, Flu mist, and Live PR8 were tested against H1N1 and rAdH5/M2e was tested against H5N2. The values represent the mean ± SEM (vertical bars) of end point ELISA antibody titers determined from 5 mice per group (***
