  <p>Passive immunization of immune sera from rAdH5/M2e vaccinated mice provided protection against influenza virus challenge infection. Anesthetized Balb/c mice were passively immunized by intranasal administration of sera from mice immunized with FiPR8+CT, live PR8 virus, or rAdH5/M2e vaccine. Control mice received sera from unvaccinated mice or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) only. Six hours later, recipient mice were infected with 5LD
   <sub>50</sub> of mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) (H1N1) virus (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) or A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005 (H5N2) virus (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>). Morbidity and mortality were monitored daily for two weeks after challenge infection. Body weights are expressed as the mean of the percent of starting body weight Â± SD. Mortality is expressed as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Each experimental group consisted of 5 mice per group. The data represent results from three independent experiments of five mice per group. The differences in body weight on days 5 and 6 between the groups immunized with live PR8 or vectored vaccine and formaldehyde-inactivated or unimmunized are statistically significant (
