  <p>Formaldehyde treatment reduces the binding of a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the HA stalk. ELISA were performed using mAb 6F12, mAb PY102, and mAb 7B2 that are specific for the PR8 HA stalk, globular head of PR8 virus, and globular head of A/California/4/09 (Cal/09) H1N1 virus, respectively. ELISA plates were coated with formaldehyde-treated or untreated chimeric protein (cH9/1) (
   <bold>A</bold>) or with formaldehyde-treated or untreated whole PR8 virus particles (
   <bold>B</bold>). Secondary (2nd) horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Ab alone was included as the assay control. The data represent results from three independent ELISA with six wells per antigen in 96-well plates (*
