  <p>Formaldehyde treatment alters in the antigenicity of the M2 and NP viral proteins. Confluent MDCK cells cultured in 96-well flat bottom plates were infected with influenza A virus (IAV) to provide expression of nucleoprotein (NP) and M2. The plates were then treated with acetone and subsequently with formaldehyde or PBS for use in cell-based ELISA for detection of M2e-(
   <bold>A</bold>), or NP-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (
   <bold>B</bold>). Non-infected MDCK cells were included to determine level of background. Secondary (2nd) HRP-conjugated antibody alone was used as a negative control. The data represent results from three independent ELISA with six wells per antigen in 96-well plates (***
