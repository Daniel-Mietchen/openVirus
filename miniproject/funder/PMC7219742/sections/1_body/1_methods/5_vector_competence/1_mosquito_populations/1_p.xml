<p>Two populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis were studied: WKANA from the locality of Kanahe and WLALO from the Lalolalo lake area. Eggs of the F1 generation were shipped to the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France (Arboviruses and Insect Vectors) to perform the vector competence studies. Emerging adults were maintained at 28Â°C, 80% humidity with a 16h:8h light:dark cycle and fed 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> on a 10% sucrose solution. Females were blood-fed several times on anesthetized mice to obtain the F3 generation of mosquitoes used for the infection assays.
