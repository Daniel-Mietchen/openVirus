<p>Vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis for CHIKV was investigated. This arbovirus has not been detected so far in the Wallis and Futuna collectivity, with no autochthonous case reported (personal communication from the Wallis &amp; Futuna Health Agency). Our results showed that the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> vector mosquito from Wallis transmitted CHIKV (transmission efficiency of 30% at 7 dpi) under experimental conditions. A vector competence analysis performed on a population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Tahiti (French Polynesia) displayed a weaker transmission of CHIKV (3% at 6 dpi) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These contrasting results may be explained by differences in the experimental protocol of the previous competence work (French Polynesia): mosquitoes of the F14 generation were used for infection; the infection experiments were not conducted with the same CHIKV strain (though it shares 99% homology); and the detection of infectious particles in mosquito saliva was performed on C6/36 cells instead of Vero cells and used indirect immunofluorescent assays. However, in both studies, the vector competence for CHIKV was confirmed. Furthermore, the CHIKV strain that was used in the present study (NC/2011-568) was used in previous studies to evaluate the ability of

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> appears to be a moderate CHIKV vector compared to some populations of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> from New Caledonia and the Americas. More recently, a study carried out under the same laboratory conditions and on the same population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis as in the present work (WLALO) was conducted in order to test the ability of this population to transmit ZIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Results of this study showed that less than 5% of the mosquitoes tested transmitted ZIKV. Together, these results suggest that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis displays a higher competence for CHIKV than for ZIKAV under experimental conditions in the laboratory.
