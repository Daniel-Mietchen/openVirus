<p>Few individuals of two other species of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus were found on the islands. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>oceanicus</italic> was sampled in Wallis and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic> in Alofi. Little is known about the role of these two species as vectors of arboviruses or other VBD. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>oceanicus</italic> is potentially a secondary vector of lymphatic filariasis, as reported in Tonga [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], or like other species of the subgenus 
 <italic>Finlaya</italic>, such as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>(Fin</italic>.
 <italic>) samoanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>(Fin</italic>.
 <italic>) tutuilae</italic> in other neighboring PICTs (West Samoa and American Samoa) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This species was found to play a minor role in the transmission of the Ross River virus in American Samoa in 1979–1980 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is found in natural habitats, with traditionally reported breeding sites in plant leaf axils such as pandanus and taro. However, immature stages were more recently found in domestic containers suggesting that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>oceanicus</italic> has become adapted to these water sources for oviposition [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].
