 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic>, only found on the island of Alofi, is also a species with a natural habitat. Since its description [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], very few references reported this species and its role as a vector is totally unknown [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Only one specimen was collected during our survey suggesting a low abundance of this species. However, the prospected site on Alofi, Alofitai, is the place where the inhabitants of Futuna land and embark when visiting Alofi to cultivate their fields. Human presence, even temporary, might be a factor favoring the presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> with respect to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic>; the abundance of this latter could be slightly greater in parts of the island less frequented by humans. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic> was not found on Futuna during our prospection. A larger survey should be performed in the future on the island of Alofi to estimate the population density of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic> on this island, and in the uninhabited remote areas of Futuna to ascertain its absence from this island.
