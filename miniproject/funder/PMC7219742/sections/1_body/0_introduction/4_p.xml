<p>The Wallis and Futuna collectivity was affected by a large-scale dengue epidemic in 2002–2003 with about 3,000 cases reported in both islands [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An entomological survey carried out at that time highlighted the near-exclusive presence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> on the territory islands. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was spotted only once on Wallis Island (in one garden) and was not detected on Futuna [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> is the main vector of lymphatic filariasis in the South Pacific, a parasitic disease caused by the 
 <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic> pathogen, but it is also considered a secondary vector of dengue fever [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These observations on Wallis and Futuna confirmed the role played by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> as a dengue vector in these islands. The territory was not affected by dengue epidemics that occurred later in New Caledonia (2008–2009 and 2012–2013), despite several imported cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Also, it did not experience any autochthonous case of chikungunya or Zika, despite the numerous exchanges with other territories, especially New Caledonia and Fiji which have sustained outbreaks caused by these arboviruses since 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, Wallis and Futuna recently experienced a dengue outbreak (2017–2018) with 209 autochthonous cases, 197 cases in Wallis and 12 in Futuna (including 8 imported cases from Wallis) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whether this vector is a less efficient vector than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> for dengue viruses remains a question, and these observations underline the importance of improving our knowledge on the competence of this mosquito species for arboviruses. A recent experimental work revealed a low vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic> from Wallis for the Zika virus (ZIKV) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but the ability of this mosquito to transmit CHIKV in these islands is unknown.
