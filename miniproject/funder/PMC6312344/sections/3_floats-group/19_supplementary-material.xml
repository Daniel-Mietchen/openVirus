  <title>ROC curve obtained by applying our method to one simulated dataset, using cutoffs corresponding to the 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 95%
   <sup>1/3</sup> = 98.3%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.95%, and 99.99% quantiles of the input distributions respectively.
  </title>
  <p>The simulated dataset was selected, among the 200 baseline simulations, as the only simulated dataset which happened to have the same size as our rabies dataset, i.e. 151 observed cases. TPR: True Positive Rate; TNR: True Negative Rate.</p>
