<p>For a given reporting rate, the size of outbreak clusters contains information on transmissibility, as measured by the reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>). Intuitively, low values of R will result in many sporadic cases, imported from outside of the reporting area but without subsequent transmission, while higher values of 
 <italic>R</italic> would result in a smaller number of larger clusters. Using the distribution of the cluster sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), we were able to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic> as well as the number of unobserved outbreak clusters, which we translated into a rate of importation of rabies into the population over the monitored time period. The estimated reproduction number was 0.92 (95% confidence interval CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [0.85; 1.01]) and the estimated rate of importation of rabies into the population was 4.91 (CI
 <sub>95%</sub>: [3.60; 6.65]) importations per year (see 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).
