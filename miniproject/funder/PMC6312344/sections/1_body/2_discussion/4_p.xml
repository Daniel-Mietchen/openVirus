<p>Our simulation study confirmed that our method runs fast (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s015">S14 Fig</xref>) and is able to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission, and to subsequently accurately estimate the underlying reproduction number and importation rate. Importantly, our simulations also highlighted the importance of adequately choosing the cutoffs used at the pruning step. In our rabies application, we used cutoffs corresponding to the 95% quantiles, identified in our simulation study as maximising the average between sensitivity and specificity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s013">S12</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006554.s014">S13</xref> Figs). In practice, optimal cutoffs will likely vary across datasets, diseases and epidemic contexts. Different strategies may be employed to address the issue. First, sensitivity analyses should be performed to study the impact of changing the cutoffs and reporting rates, as has been done here. Second, whenever possible, simulations can be used to identify optimal cutoffs for a specific outbreak context. Finally, further work may be dedicated to developing automated frameworks for the selection of optimal cutoffs from past outbreak data in which clusters have been identified through epidemiological investigations.
