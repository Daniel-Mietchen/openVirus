<p>As in Bourhy et al. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], we rely on a Poisson model for estimating 
 <italic>R</italic> and the number of unobserved outbreak clusters, which assumes homogeneous infectiousness amongst cases. Although the presence of superspreading would have no impact on the outbreak clusters identified by our approach, it would likely lead to underestimating both 
 <italic>R</italic> and the number of unobserved outbreak clusters [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006554.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Future research could extend the current methodology to account for such heterogeneity.
