<p>The rationale for our approach is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006554.g001">Fig 1</xref> with a schematic example including two data streams: geographical and genetic data. For each stream of data, pairwise distances between cases are computed and used to define pruned graphs where only potentially related cases are connected. These graphs are then merged into a single graph whose connected components represent likely outbreak clusters. The distribution of the sizes of these clusters is finally used for estimating transmissibility, as measured by the reproduction number
