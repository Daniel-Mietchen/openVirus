  <title>Roles of UL42 on HCMV replication.</title>
  <p>(A) UL42 enhances HCMV replication in early phase of infection. The indicated cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblotting analysis. (B) UL42 enhances HCMV and HSV-1 replication in late phase of infection. The indicated cells (1x10
   <sup>6</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or HSV-1 (MOI = 1), and the supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post infection for measurements of viral titers with standard TCID50 or plaque assays. (C) Effects of UL42-knockdown on HCMV replication in early phase of infection. The indicated cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblotting analysis. (D) Effects of UL42-knockdown on HCMV and HSV-1 replication in late phase of infection. The indicated cells (1x10
   <sup>6</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or HSV-1 (MOI = 1), and the supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post infection for measurements of viral titers with standard TCID50 or plaque assays. (E) Effects of UL42 on HCMV-GFP replication. HFFs transduced with UL42 or a control vector were left uninfected or infected with HCMV-GFP (MOI = 0.1) for 3 days before fluorescent microscopy. (F) Effects of UL42-knockdown on HCMV replication. The indicated cells (5x10
   <sup>4</sup>) were infected with HCMV-GFP (MOI = 1) for 3 days before fluorescent microscopy. (G) Effects of UL42-deficiency on HCMV replication in HFFs. Cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or HCMV-ΔUL42 (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblotting analysis. (H) Effects of UL42-deficiency on HCMV replication in HFF-MITA-KO cells. Cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or HCMV-ΔUL42 (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblotting analysis. (I) Effects of UL42-deficiency on HCMV replication. The indicated cells (1x10
   <sup>6</sup>) were infected with wild-type HCMV or HCMV-ΔUL42 for the indicated days. The supernatants were then harvested for measurements of the viral titers with standard TCID50 assays. Graphs show mean ± SD, n = 3. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01(unpaired t test).
