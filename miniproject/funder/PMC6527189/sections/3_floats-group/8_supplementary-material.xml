  <p>(A) Effects of MITA-deficiency on HCMV-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes. MITA-deficient (KO) HFF cells were generated by the CRISPR-Cas9 method. MITA-KO and control HFF cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV for the indicated times before qPCR analysis.

  <p>(B) Effects of RIG-I knockdown on HCMV-induced transcription of 
   <italic>IFNB1</italic>. RIG-I-knockdown and control HFF cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV for the indicated times before qPCR analysis.
  </p>
  <p>(C) Effects of TLR9 knockdown on HCMV-induced transcription of 
   <italic>IFNB1</italic>. TLR9-knockdown and control HFF cells(4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV for the indicated times before qPCR analysis.
