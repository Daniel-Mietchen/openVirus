  <title>UL42 collaborates with UL82 and UL31 to antagonize HCMV-induced antiviral immune response.</title>
  <p>(A) UL42 collaborates with UL82 and UL31 to inhibit cGAS-MITA-mediated activation of the IFNβ promoter, ISRE and NF-κB. HEK293T-MITA cells were transfected with the IFNβ promoter (0.05 μg), ISRE (0.03 μg) or NF-κB (0.005 μg) reporter plasmid, and expression plasmids for cGAS (0,01 μg) and UL42, UL82 or UL31 (0.05 μg each) for 20 hr before luciferase assays.</p>
  <p>(B) Effects of UL42 and UL31 on cGAMP synthesis induced by HCMV. HFF-Vec, HFF-UL42, HFF-UL31, or HFF- UL42/UL31 cells (1x10
   <sup>7</sup>) were uninfected or infected with HCMV (MOI = 3) for 5 hr, and then cell extracts containing cGAMP were delivered to digitonin-permeabilized HFFs for 4 hr before qPCR analysis.
  </p>
  <p>(C) Effects of UL42 and UL82 on cGAMP-induced transcription of antiviral genes in HFFs. Control, UL42, UL82 or UL42/82-tranduced HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were transfected with cGAMP (0.1 μg) for 4 hr before qPCR analysis.
  </p>
  <p>(D-E) Effects of knockdown of UL42, UL31, or UL82 on HCMV-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes. UL42, UL31, UL82, UL42/31 or UL42/82 shRNA stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before qPCR analysis.
