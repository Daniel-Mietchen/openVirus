  <title>UL42-deficiency potentiates innate antiviral response to HCMV.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> UL42-shRNAs inhibited expression of UL42. HEK293 cells (2×10
   <sup>5</sup>) were transfected with Flag-UL42, Flag UL82, Flag-UL83 or HA-actin expression plasmids and the indicated shRNA plasmids (2 μg each) for 20 hrs before immunoblot analysis. (B) Effects of UL42-shRNAs on HCMV- and HSV-1-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes. UL42-shRNA stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or HSV-1 (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before qPCR analysis. (C) HCMV-ΔUL42 virus elicits stronger innate immune response than wild-type HCMV. The indicated cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with wild-type HCMV (MOI = 1) or HCMV-ΔUL42 (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before qPCR analysis. (D) Inhibition of UL42 on 
   <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
   <italic>ISG56</italic>, 
   <italic>and IL6 t</italic>ranscription induced by UV-inactivated HCMV. Control or UL42 stable cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with wild-type or UV-inactivated HCMV before qPCR analysis. (E) Effects of UL42-deficiency on transcription induced by UV-inactivated wild-type or UL42-deficient HCMV. The indicated cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with untreated or UV-inactivated wild-type or UL42-deficient HCMV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before qPCR analysis. (F) Effects of UL42-shRNAs on HCMV-induced phosphorylation of downstream components. UL42-shRNA stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblot analysis. (G) Effects of UL42-deficiency on phosphorylation of downstream components. The indicated cells (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with wild-type HCMV (MOI = 1) or HCMV-ΔUL42 (MOI = 1) for the indicated times before immunoblot analysis. Graphs show mean ± SD, n = 3. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01(unpaired t test).
