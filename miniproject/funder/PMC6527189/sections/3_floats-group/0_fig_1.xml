  <title>Identification of HCMV UL42 as an inhibitor of DNA-triggered signaling.</title>
  <p>(A) HCMV UL42 inhibits cGAS-MITA-induced IFNβ promoter and ISRE activation in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T/MITA cells (1x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were transfected with the IFNβ promoter (0.05 μg) or ISRE (0.03 μg) reporter plasmid, and expression plasmids for cGAS (0,01 μg) and increased amounts of UL42 (0, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 μg) for 20 hrs before luciferase assays. (B) Effects of UL42 on IFN-β-induced STAT1/2 activation. HEK293 cells (1x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were transfected with STAT1/2 reporter (0.005 μg) and UL42 expression (0.05 μg) plasmids for 20 hrs. The cells were then untreated or treated with IFN-β for 12 hrs before luciferase assays. (C) HCMV UL42 inhibits HCMV-, HSV-1-, and VACV-induced transcription of antiviral genes in HFFs. UL42-stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were un-infected or infected with HCMV (MOI = 1), HSV-1 (MOI = 1), or VACV (MOI = 1) for the indicated times (upper histographs) or 12 h (lower histographs) before qPCR analysis. The immunoblots show the expression levels of UL42 in the HFF-UL42 stable cell lines. (D) HCMV UL42 inhibits dsDNA-induced transcription of antiviral genes in HFFs. UL42 stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were transfected with HSV120 (2 μg), DNA90 (2 μg), VACV70 (2 μg), or ISD (2 μg) for the indicated times before qPCR analysis. (E) UL42 impairs HCMV- and HSV120-induced phosphorylation of downstream components. UL42 stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were infected with HCMV (MOI = 1) or transfected with HSV120 (2 μg/ml) for the indicated times before immunoblot analysis. The lower panels are results of qPCR analysis for HCMV UL123 mRNA or HSV120 DNA. (F) Effect of UL42 on IFN-β-induced phosphorylation of STAT1. UL42 stable HFFs (4x10
   <sup>5</sup>) were untreated or treated with IFN-β (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times before immunoblot analysis. Graphs show mean ± SD, n = 3. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 (unpaired t test).
