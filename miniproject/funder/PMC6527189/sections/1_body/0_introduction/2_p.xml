<p>Among the PRRs, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) has been demonstrated as a general cytosolic DNA sensor in response to DNA virus infection in various cell lines and in mice [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. cGAS recognizes double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and utilizes ATP and GTP to synthesize the second messenger cGAMP [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. cGAMP binds to the ER-localized adaptor protein MITA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is also designated as STING, ERIS, and MPYS [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The cGAMP-bound MITA traffics from the ER to the Golgi apparatus via the inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) and TRAPβ containing translocon complex [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and then further to the Sec5-containing perinuclear punctate structures [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. During the trafficking processes, MITA recruits TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to induction of type I interferons and other antiviral effectors [
