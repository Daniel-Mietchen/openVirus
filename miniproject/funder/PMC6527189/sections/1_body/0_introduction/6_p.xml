<p>In this study, we identified HCMV UL42 as an inhibitor of innate antiviral response. UL42 is classified as a CMV-specific but function-unknown gene, which consists of 124 amino acids and partially localized at the trans-Golgi network and cytoplasmic vesicles [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, UL42 has a C-terminal hydrophobic domain predicted to be transmembrane domain and two PPXY motifs in its N terminus. Our results suggest that UL42 inhibits cGAS activation and impairs the trafficking of MITA, thereby contributes to HCMV evasion of innate antiviral responses.
