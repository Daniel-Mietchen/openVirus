<p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a member of the beta herpesvirus family, is a typical dsDNA virus that encodes over 200 proteins [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there is no vaccine to prevent HCMV infection, and the drugs currently approved for the treatment of HCMV infectious diseases suffer from low bioavailability, toxicity, and the generation of resistant viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. HCMV proteins could suppress cellular and organismal defenses, which are pivotal for establishing immune evasion and latent infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, HCMV has become an ideal model for the study of viral immune evasion due to its multiple strategies to modulate host innate and adaptive responses [
