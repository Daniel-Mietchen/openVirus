<p>Similar to many other DNA viruses, the cGAS-MITA axis also plays a crucial role in HCMV-induced host antiviral defense [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, HCMV have evolved various mechanisms to antagonize this signaling pathway for efficient infection and replication [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, it has been demonstrated that HCMV tegument protein UL82 contributes to HCMV immune evasion by inhibiting the cellular trafficking and activation of MITA to evade antiviral immunity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. UL83 inhibits gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16)- and cGAS-mediated DNA sensing for immune evasion [
