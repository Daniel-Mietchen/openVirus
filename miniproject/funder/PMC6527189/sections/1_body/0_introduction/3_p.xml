<p>In addition to trafficking, the functions of MITA are also regulated by several post-translational mechanisms. The E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM32 and TRIM56 can catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination of MITA and promote the recruitment of TBK1 to MITA, thereby positively regulating innate immune responses [
