<p>The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against microbial infection. Upon microbial infection, cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize structurally conserved microbial components called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which triggers a series of signaling events that lead to the induction of type I interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and other downstream effectors. These effectors mediate the inhibition of microbial replication, clearance of infected cells and facilitation of adaptive immune response to eliminate infected pathogens [
