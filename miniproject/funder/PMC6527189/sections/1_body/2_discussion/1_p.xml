<p>The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense against viral infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The ability of viruses to evade and modulate host innate immune response is of central importance for successful establishment and maintenance of infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. As the cGAS-MITA-TBK1 axis plays a crucial role in host defense against DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the DNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to antagonize this signaling pathway for replication and latent infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, HSV-1 tegument protein UL37 has been reported to deamidate cGAS which impairs the ability of cGAS to catalyze cGAMP synthesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; UL41directly degrades cGAS mRNA to inhibit antiviral signaling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; ICP27 targets the TBK1-activated MITA/STING signalosome to inhibit antiviral response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF52 and cytoplasmic isoforms of LANA counteract cGAS-mediated signaling [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; vIRF1 inhibits antiviral gene expression by impeding interaction of MITA with TBK1 [
