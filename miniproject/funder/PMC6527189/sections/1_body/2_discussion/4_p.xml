<p>Mechanistic studies suggest that UL42 inhibits innate antiviral response by targeting both cGAS and MITA. Firstly, overexpression of UL42 inhibited HCMV-triggered induction of cGAMP and cGAMP-induced transcription of downstream effector genes. Cellular and biochemical experiments indicated that UL42 interacted with cGAS and MITA following HCMV infection. Second, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down analysis showed that UL42 inhibited the binding of cGAS to dsDNA. In mammalian cells, overexpression of UL42 inhibited the self-association of cGAS. Third, confocal microscopy revealed that UL42 impaired the trafficking of MITA, a critical process for MITA activation. Biochemical experiments indicated that UL42 impaired the trafficking of MITA by promoting p62-LC3B-mediated autophagic degradation of TRAPβ, which is a critical component in the translocon complex. Collectively, our results suggest that UL42 antagonizes innate antiviral response by inhibiting cGAS activation, as well as promoting p62-LC3B-mediated degradation of TRAPβ and therefor impairing MITA trafficking and activation. Thus, UL42 represents a new player involved in HCMV evasion of innate antiviral response.
