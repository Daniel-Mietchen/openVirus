<p>To understand the comprehensive mechanisms on how HCMV rapidly establishes persistent infection, we systematically screened for HCMV proteins that can inhibit DNA-triggered activation of ISRE [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this report, we investigated the role of HCMV UL42, one of the non-essential genes for HCMV viral replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], in antagonizing innate antiviral response. Several lines of evidence suggest that UL42 acts to antagonizing cGAS-MITA-mediated innate antiviral response. Firstly, overexpression of UL42 inhibited cGAS-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter and ISRE. Consistently, UL42 inhibited HCMV- or cytosolic dsDNA-induced transcription of downstream effector genes, whereas deficiency of UL42 increased HCMV-triggered production of type I IFNs and downstream antiviral genes. Additionally, the viral titers of HCMV-ΔUL42 were decreased in comparison with wild-type HCMV in HFFs. Although UL42 efficiently inhibits cGAS-MITA-mediated signaling, UL42-deficiency only led to a moderate increase of IRF3 activation and induction of downstream antiviral genes. The simplest explanation is that HCMV encodes multiple proteins to antagonize innate antiviral response, therefore, deficiency of one of this protein has only partial effect.
