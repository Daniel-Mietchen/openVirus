<p>One important feature of HCMV is to establish long-term latent infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, it is understandable that HCMV may employ multiple and even redundant mechanisms to inhibit innate immune response. Previously, it has been shown that HCMV tegument protein UL83 interacts with cGAS and IFI16 in the nucleus to inhibit type I IFN induction [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; HCMV UL82 inhibits the translocation of MITA from the ER to perinuclear microsomes by disrupting the MITA-iRhom2-TRAPÎ² translocation complex, resulting the impairment of recruitment of TBK1 and IRF3 to the MITA complex [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, we identified UL42 as a new HCMV protein that impairs cGAS activation and MITA trafficking, and contributing to evasion of innate immunity of HCMV. In light of these studies, it is possible that the different HCMV proteins, which are optimally expressed in the host cells at different time points or distinct intracellular locations after infection, may antagonize innate immune response in a temporal/spatial manner. In addition, cGAS activation or MITA trafficking themselves are involved in complicated regulatory mechanisms, the HCMV UL proteins may regulate distinct molecular events in these processes.
