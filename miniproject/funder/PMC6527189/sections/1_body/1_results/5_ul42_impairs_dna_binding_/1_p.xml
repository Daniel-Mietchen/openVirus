<p>Since UL42 interacts with cGAS, we next determined whether UL42 affects cGAS binding to DNA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, both UL42 and the RNA sensor MDA5 did not bind to HSV120 DNA in pull-down assays. However, UL42 dramatically inhibited the binding of cGAS to HSV120 DNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The inhibitory effect of UL42 on cGAS binding to DNA was dose-dependent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). In addition, levels of viral DNA bound by endogenous cGAS were higher in HFFs infected with HCMV-Î”UL42 in comparison with wild-type HCMV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). These results suggest that UL42 impairs cGAS binding to DNA. Previously, it has been shown that cGAS self-association and oligomerization are important for its activation after binding to dsDNA [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that UL42 inhibited self-association of cGAS but not MITA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Consistently, UL42 markedly inhibited self-association of cGAS in a dose-dependent manner in pull-down assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). However, overexpression of UL42 did not affect polyubiquitination of cGAS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007691.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that UL42 impairs synthesis of cGAMP by inhibiting DNA binding and oligomerization of cGAS.
