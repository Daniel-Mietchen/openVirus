<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that UL31 and UL82 respectively targeted cGAS and MITA to inhibit HCMV-induced the transcription of downstream antiviral genes. Above results suggest that UL42 targets both cGAS and MITA to suppress HCMV-triggered host antiviral immune responses and promote HCMV immune evasion. Reporter assays indicated that UL42 collaborates with UL31 or UL82 to inhibit cGAS-MITA-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter, ISRE, and NF-κB in HEK293T cells stably expressing MITA (HEK293T/MITA) (
