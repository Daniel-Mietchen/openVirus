<p>It has been shown that MITA/STING is a pivotal adaptor protein for viral DNA-induced expression of downstream antiviral genes [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which is also essential for innate immune response to HCMV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results also indicated that MITA-deficiency inhibited HCMV-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes (

 <italic>IFNB1</italic>genes in HFF cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007691.s003">S3B &amp; S3C Fig</xref>). We found that replication of HCMV-ΔUL42 was decreased in comparison with wild-type HCMV in HFF-WT cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), but replications of both HCMV-ΔUL42 and wild-type HCMV were identical at early phase (6–48 hr) of infection in MITA-deficient cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). Consistently, the progeny virions of HCMV-ΔUL42 were lower than wild-type HCMV in control cells, but they were identical in MITA-knockout cells at late phase (3–7 d) of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Interestingly, both wild-type HCMV and HCMV-ΔUL42 production in MITA-knockout cells was increased in comparison to wild-type cells, consistent with a critical role of MITA in innate antiviral response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). These results suggest that UL42 plays a direct role in evasion of innate antiviral response and contribute to the replication of HCMV.
