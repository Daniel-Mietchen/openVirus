<p>Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms on the negative regulatory role of UL42 in innate antiviral response. Reporter assays indicated that UL42 inhibited cGAS- and MITA- but not TBK1- or IRF3-5D (an active mutant of IRF3)-mediated activation of the IFN-Î² promoter and ISRE (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the extracts from DNA-transfected cells contain cGAMP, which trigger induction of

 <italic>ISG56</italic>, and 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic> genes. To elucidate the mechanisms on how UL42 antagonizes innate antiviral response, we firstly examined whether UL42 affects cGAMP synthesis. Overexpression of UL42 impaired both HSV120- and VACV70-induced production of cGAMP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These results suggest that UL42 is important for inhibiting viral DNA-induced cGAS activation. Interestingly, UL42 also dramatically inhibited cGAMP-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes such as

 <italic>ISG56</italic>, and 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). cGAMP-induced phosphorylation of MITA, TBK1, and IRF3 in HFF-UL42 cells were decreased in comparison to HFF-Vec cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). These results suggest that UL42 targets at steps both upstream and downstream of cGAMP in the cGAS-cGAMP-MITA signal pathway.
