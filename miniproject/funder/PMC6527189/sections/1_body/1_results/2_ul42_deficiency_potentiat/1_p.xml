<p>To investigate the roles of endogenous UL42 in innate antiviral response to HCMV, we constructed two UL42-shRNA plasmids that could specifically knock down the expression of UL42, but not other HCMV genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). qPCR analysis indicated that knockdown of UL42 promoted HCMV- but not HSV-1-induced transcription of

 <italic>ISG56</italic>, 
 <italic>ISG54</italic>, 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic> genes at 6, 12, and 24 hr post-infection in HFFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results suggest that UL42-deficiency promotes innate antiviral response.
