<p>To further confirm the role of UL42, we generated UL42-deficient HCMV (HCMVΔUL42) by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We next examined the expression of downstream antiviral genes in cells infected with wild-type HCMV or HCMV-ΔUL42. Consistently, mRNA levels of 
 <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
 <italic>ISG56</italic>, C
 <italic>XCL10</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic> genes induced by HCMV-ΔUL42 were significantly higher than those induced by HCMV-WT at 6, 12, and 24 hr post-infection in HFFs, human primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages (

 <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
 <italic>ISG56</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic> mRNA than un-treated HCMV. In these experiments, UL42 also inhibited transcription of 
 <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
 <italic>ISG56</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic> induced by UV-inactivated HCMV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). We also examined the mRNA levels of UV-treated or untreated HCMV. qPCR assays indicated that HCMV were inactivated by UV treatment (

 <italic>IFNB1</italic>, 
 <italic>ISG56</italic>, and 
 <italic>IL6</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), suggesting that UL42 directly affects HCMV-induced transcription of downstream antiviral genes. Consistently, knockdown of UL42 increased HCMV-induced phosphorylation of MITA, TBK1, and IRF3 in HFFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). In addition, phosphorylation of MITA, TBK1, and IRF3 was increased following infection with HCMV-ΔUL42 compared to wild-type HCMV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that UL42 plays a critical role in the inhibition of HCMV DNA-triggered induction of downstream antiviral genes.
