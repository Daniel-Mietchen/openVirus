<p>Previously, we performed systematic screens for HCMV proteins that can inhibit DNA-triggered activation of interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE, which is bound by activated IRF3) by reporter assays and identified UL42 as a candidate protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Reporter assays indicated that overexpression of UL42 inhibited cGAS-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter (which is driven by ISRE and κB enhancers) and ISRE in a dose-dependent manner in HEK293T cells stably expressing MITA (HEK293T/MITA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), but did not affect IFN-β-induced activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/2 (STAT1/2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Previously, it has been shown that the human primary foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) can express downstream antiviral genes in response to HCMV infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our results indicated that HCMV AD169 strain could infect HFF cells, but could not infect endothelial HUVEC, epithelial HEK293T and Ea. hy926 cells (S1A &amp;

 <italic>ISG56</italic> and 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic> following infection with the DNA viruses HCMV, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and vaccinia virus (VACV) was inhibited in HFF-UL42 as compared to empty vector-transduced control cells (HFF-Vec) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, transcription of genes induced upon transfection of dsDNAs, including 120-mer dsDNA representing the genome of HSV-1 (HSV120), dsDNA of approximately 90 bp (dsDNA90), 70-mer dsDNA representing the genome of vaccinia virus (VACV70) and 45-mer interferon stimulatory DNA (ISD45), was impaired in HFF-UL42 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Since phosphorylation of MITA, TBK1, IRF3, and p65 are hallmarks of cGAS/MITA-mediated signaling, we further examined the effects of UL42 on these events. Consistently, ectopic expression of UL42 dramatically inhibited phosphorylation of MITA, TBK1, IRF3 and RelA (p65) in response to HCMV and HSV120 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In contrast, UL42 did not have marked effects on phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by IFN-β in HFFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). In these experiments, MITA was down-regulated after HCMV infection and HSV120 stimulation, which is a mechanism of timely termination of innate antiviral response to avoid immune damage [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As previously reported, down-regulation of MITA is dependent on its activation and happens during its trafficking from the ER to the perinuclear punctate structures [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Notably, the down-regulation of MITA following HCMV infection was inhibited in HFF-UL42, suggesting a role of UL42 in MITA-mediated signaling.
