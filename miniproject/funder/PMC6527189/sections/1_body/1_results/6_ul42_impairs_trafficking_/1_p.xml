<p>Previously, it has been shown that self-association and oligomerization of MITA are crucial for MITA-mediated signaling [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007691.s004">S4B Fig</xref>) of MITA. Interestingly, confocal microscopy indicated that UL42 inhibited accumulation of MITA in perinuclear punctate structures induced by cGAMP (
