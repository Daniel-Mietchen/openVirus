<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that iRhom2 and TRAPβ containing complex is critically involved in MITA trafficking after viral infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We found that UL42 was associated with TRAPβ and iRhom2 but not TRIM38, which mediates MITA sumoylation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Consistently, UL42-deficiency inhibited HCMV-induced degradation of TRAPβ in HFFs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that UL42 impairs the trafficking of MITA after viral infection by promoting degradation of the translocon complex protein TRAPβ.
