<p>Two major systems exist for protein degradation, including the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathways. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for UL42-mediated degradation of TRAPβ, we treated HEK293T-UL42 and HEK293T-Vec cells with various inhibitors for protein degradation pathways. The results indicated that UL42-mediated degradation of TRAPβ could be inhibited by the lysosomal inhibitor NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl and the autophagic inhibitors 3MA and bafilomycin, but not the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), suggesting that UL42 mediates degradation of TRAPβ via an autophagic lysosomal pathway. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, UL42 interacted with p62 and LC3B, two essential components involved in autophagic lysosomal degradation, and increased the associations of p62-TRAPβ or LC3B-TRAPβ (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007691.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). These results suggest that UL42 impairs the trafficking of MITA by promoting p62-LC3B-mediated autophagic degradation of TRAPβ.
