<p>The HEK293T cells were transfected with two packaging plasmids (pGAG-Pol and pVSV-G) together with a control, UL42-, UL82-, UL31, RIG-I-, TLR9-, p62-, or LC3B-shRNA retroviral plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, cells were incubated with new medium without antibiotics for another 24 hr. The recombinant virus-containing medium was filtered and then added to HFF or HEK293 cells in the presence of polybrene (6 μg/ml). The infected cells were selected with puromycin (0.5–1.0 μg/ml) for 10 days before additional experiments.</p>
