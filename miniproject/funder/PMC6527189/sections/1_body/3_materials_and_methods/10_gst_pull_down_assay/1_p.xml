<p>GST-cGAS were bound to glutathione agarose beads and incubated for 3 hrs with lysates from HEK293T cells transiently expressing HA-cGAS or UL42-HA plasmid. The beads were washed three times each with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride), then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. The input/elutes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by coomassie staining and/or immunoblot analysis [
