<p>Cells were mock-transfected or transfected with HSV120 (3 μg/ml) for 4 hours. Cell extracts were then prepared and heated at 95°C for 5 min to denature most proteins, which were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants containing cGAMP were delivered to MLFs pretreated with digitonin permeabilization solution (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM DTT, 85 mM Sucrose, 0.2% BSA, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM GTP and 10μg/ml digitonin) at 37°C for 30 min. Three hours later, the cells were collected for a qPCR analysis.
