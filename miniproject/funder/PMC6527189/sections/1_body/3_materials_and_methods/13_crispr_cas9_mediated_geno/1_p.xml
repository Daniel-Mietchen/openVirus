<p>The experiments were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Briefly, potential guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting UL42 gene were analyzed using the CRISPR Design tool. The UL42 gRNA target sequence used in this study is 5’- CGTCGTCGGGCACAGACCCA-3’. Double-stranded oligos were cloned into the lentiCRISPRv1 vector and cotransfected with packaging plasmids into HEK293T cells. Lentiviral particles were collected and used to transduce HFFs. The HFF-gRNA cells were infected with serial dilution of HCMV in 96 well plates. Twenty days later, the viruses were collected and diluted to infect HFFs for 20 days. A single plaque was pick up to infect HFFs to produce homogenous HCMV-ΔUL42 strain, which was verified by immunoblotting analysis.
