<p>Transfection and reporter assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007691.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HEK293 cells were transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. HFFs were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000. To ensure that each transfection receives the same amount of total DNA, the empty control plasmid was added to each transfection. To normalize for transfection efficiency, pRL-TK (
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase) reporter plasmid (0.01 Î¼g) was added to each transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using a Dual-Specific Luciferase Assay Kit. Firefly luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activities.
