 <p>Recognition of viral DNA by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and subsequent induction of type I IFNs via the cGAS-MITA signaling axis are important for host antiviral innate immunity. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes complications in immunodeficient populations and is a major cause of birth defects. It is known that HCMV suppresses innate immunity, which is pivotal for establishing immune evasion and latent infection. In this study, we found that HCMV protein UL42 inhibits innate antiviral responses thus promotes HCMV replication. UL42 functions by targeting cGAS and MITA through distinct mechanisms. UL42 inhibits cGAS activation by interrupting its DNA binding and oligomerization, while it targets MITA by interfering trafficking of MITA from the ER to perinuclear punctate structures, a process required for MITA activation. These findings defined an important mechanism for HCMV immune evasion, which may provide a therapeutic target for the treatment of HCMV infection.</p>
