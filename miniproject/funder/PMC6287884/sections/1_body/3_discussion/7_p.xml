<p>We recorded more diverse vector mosquito species and viruses in samples from Homa Bay County (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which concurs with reports from previous studies around the Lake Victoria basin [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], we only sampled 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. larvae from Lake Victoria. In a previous study, we found that many of the suitable larval habitats for

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the Lake Victoria region where agricultural activity is more intensive in comparison to the Lake Baringo region. Though there was an RVF virus outbreak in Baringo County in 2006/2007 and surveillance studies around the area reported possible mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006949.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], none of our mosquito samples from Baringo County tested positive for any pathogenic virus.
