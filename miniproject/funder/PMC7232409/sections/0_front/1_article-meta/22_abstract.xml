 <p>Russia has one of the largest and fastest growing HIV epidemics. However, epidemiological data are scarce. Sub-subtype A6 is most prevalent in Russia but its identification is challenging. We analysed protease/reverse transcriptase-, integrase-sequences, and epidemiological data from 303 patients to develop a methodology for the systematisation of A6 identification and to describe the HIV epidemiology in the Russian Southern Federal District. Drug consumption (32.0%) and heterosexual contact (27.1%) were the major reported transmission risks. This study successfully established the settings for systematic identification of A6 samples. Low frequency of subtype B (3.3%) and large prevalence of sub-subtype A6 (69.6%) and subtype G (23.4%) were detected. Transmitted PI- (8.8%) and NRTI-resistance (6.4%) were detected in therapy-naive patients. In therapy-experienced patients, 17.3% of the isolates showed resistance to PIs, 50.0% to NRTI, 39.2% to NNRTIs, and 9.5% to INSTIs. Multiresistance was identified in 52 isolates, 40 corresponding to two-class resistance and seven to three-class resistance. Two resistance-associated-mutations significantly associated to sub-subtype A6 samples: A62V
  <sub>RT</sub> and G190S
  <sub>RT</sub>. This study establishes the conditions for a systematic annotation of sub-subtype A6 to normalise epidemiological studies. Accurate knowledge on South Russian epidemiology will allow for the development of efficient regional frameworks for HIV-1 infection management.
