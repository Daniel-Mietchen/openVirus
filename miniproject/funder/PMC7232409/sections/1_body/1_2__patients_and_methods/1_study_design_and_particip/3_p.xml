<p>Viral RNA isolation and RT-PCR amplification for protease-reverse transcriptase (PRRT), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase (IN) were completed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with subtype-optimized primers. Next-Generation-Sequencing (MiSeq, Illumina) with a 15% cut-off was performed. Initial subtyping was done based on the RT (or PR region when the RT was not available) using the geno2pheno system (
