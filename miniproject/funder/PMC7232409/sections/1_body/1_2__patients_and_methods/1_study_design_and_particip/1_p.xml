<p>Blood samples and clinical data from all patients attending the Russian Southern Federal Centre for HIV Control (Rostov-na-Donu), Rostov State Medical University Hospital and the Krasnodar Clinical Centre for HIV Control in 1990 to 2015 were collected. This study was retrospective and non-interventional. All samples were initially analysed for diagnostic purposes within the Rostov-na-Donu-Cologne cooperation project (Ethics approval #246). Enrolment criteria were confirmed HIV infection and availability of one blood sample and provided written consent. Three hundred twenty-eight patients fulfilled these criteria. The final inclusion criterion for the study was availability of at least the reverse transcriptase (RT) and/or protease (PR) sequence from the blood sample. Three hundred three patients were included in the analyses.</p>
