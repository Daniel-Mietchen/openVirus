<p>Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Mega 7 software [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Multiple alignments of DNA sequences were generated using the Muscle tool using UPGMB for clustering with a minimum diagonal length of 24 and a maximum of eight iterations [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These alignments were used to compute nucleotide pairwise distances and neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis, using the maximum composite method in both cases.
