<p>Four main datasets were used for the phylogeny: i) RUS: 222 RT sequences from our patients, initially predicted as A1 or one of the A-containing recombinants forms 01_AE, 02_AG, or 03_AE; ii) RUS-A6: 211 samples from the RUS dataset classified as A6 through our first phylogenetic analysis; iii) A6-POL-LA: 68 available A6-annotated 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the Los Alamos database (LA) (GenBank accession numbers in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">File S1</xref>); and iv) REF-LA: 40 subtype reference sequences from LA (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Table S1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Two additional datasets were used for subtype prevalence comparison: v) RU-LA: 8355 LA HIV-1 sequences (any region) from Russia; and vi) FSU-LA: 12510 LA HIV-1 sequences (any region) from the former Soviet Union (FSU) countries (including the 8388 from RU-LA). An overview of all datasets is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Table S2</xref>.
