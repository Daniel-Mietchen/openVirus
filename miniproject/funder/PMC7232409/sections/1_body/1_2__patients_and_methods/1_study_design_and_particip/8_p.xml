<p>Resistance-associated-mutations (RAMs) and drug susceptibility profiles were analysed with the Stanford HIVdb [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Resistance levels of 1–2 were considered susceptible, levels of 3–4 as intermediate resistant, and 5 as fully resistant. Resistance levels 3–5 were considered clinically relevant. Drug class susceptibility was calculated as the highest level of resistance for any of the drugs included within the class.
