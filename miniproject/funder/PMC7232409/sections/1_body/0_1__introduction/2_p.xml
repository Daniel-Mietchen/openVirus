<p>The current Russian HIV scenario has been shaped by a massive epidemic in Ukraine and Southern Russia in the mid-1990s, which spread a new sub-subtype: the “Russian A1”, also referred to as “IDU-A”, or “A-FSU” [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, detection of A6 is challenging as there is no reference sequence yet, which in turn impedes the systematic identification by any of the HIV subtyping tools currently used in routine diagnostics. Published epidemiological studies reporting A6 samples have used different genomic regions as well as different sequences as a reference [
