<p>Considerable progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS has already been made, with rates of new infections declining in almost all world regions. However, Eastern Europe and Central Asia showed an alarming increase in annual infection rates of 29% between 2010â€“2018 [

Significantly, even the basic incidence and prevalence estimates generated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) cannot be released for Russia because of political sensitivities. Existing knowledge is based only on a limited number of publications, mostly restricted to Moscow and St. Petersburg areas [

Launched in 2014, the UNAIDS Fast-Track strategy outlined plans to step up the HIV response in critical world regions and end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 (

The first step for such an approach must be the identification of the human target population(s), which can differ from region to region. This information, together with the molecular characterisation of the circulating viral strains, will allow for the development of an efficient and specific regional frameworks for HIV-1 prevention, treatment, and monitoring.
