 <xref rid="viruses-12-00475-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) was detected in TN patients: 8.8% of the isolates showed transmitted resistance to PIs and 6.4% to NRTIs. No TDR to NNRTIs or INSTIs was detected. In TE patients, 17.3% of the PR sequences were clinically resistant to PIs, 50.0% to NRTIs, 39.2% to NNRTIs, and 9.5% to INSTIs. Multiresistance was detected in 52 isolates, 40 corresponding to two-class and seven to three-class multiresistance.
