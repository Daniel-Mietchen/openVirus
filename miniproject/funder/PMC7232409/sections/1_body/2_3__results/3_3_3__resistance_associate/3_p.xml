<p>The prevalence of specific RAMs significantly correlated to viral subtype. RAMs I54AV
 <sub>PR</sub>, L90M
 <sub>PR</sub>, M41L
 <sub>RT</sub>, D67N
 <sub>PR</sub>, and T215F
 <sub>PR</sub> were significantly more frequent in subtype G isolates. Conversely, A62V
 <sub>PR</sub> and G190S
 <sub>PR</sub> correlated with A6 infections. A62V
 <sub>PR</sub> was detected in 60/191 (31.4%) of the A6 sequences. No significant difference in the prevalence between TN (29/76; 38.2%) and TE (22/75; 29.3%) patients was observed. On the other hand, G190S
 <sub>PR</sub> was not detected in any TN patient but in 14/75 (18.7%) of the TE patients. Moreover, G190S
 <sub>PR</sub> was observed in 16/30 (53.3%) of the efavirenz (EFV)-exposed patients, resulting in a significant association of this RAM in the context of A6 and EFV-exposure (
