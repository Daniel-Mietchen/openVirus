<p>The RUS-A6 and A6-POL-LA datasets were used to generate ten different consensus sequences. The consensus sequence generated by MutExt using the high- and low-cut-offs of 70% and 50%, respectively, was selected as the reference consensus sequence (A6_pol_reference consensus sequence; nt. sequence in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Supplementary Material</xref>, page 1). It showed the lowest maximal pairwise distance (0.034) as well as median distance (0.014; IQR 0.010–0.019) to any A6 sequence (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Figure S1</xref>). EF545108 and EU861977 were the most distant sequences, with genetic distances to the A6_pol_reference consensus sequence of 0.031 and 0.034, respectively. These two sequences were still closer to A6 than to A1, as the minimal pairwise distances to any A1 reference sequence were 0.069 and 0.062, and the median distances to the four A1 references were 0.077 (0.073–0.083) and 0.070 (0.067–0.074), respectively. Subsequently, the A6_pol_reference consensus sequence was aligned to the REF-LA dataset (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Figure S2</xref>). The A1 reference sequences were the closest genetically, with a minimal pairwise distance of 0.050 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Table S4</xref>). The maximal pairwise distance to our reference consensus sequence for a query sample to be classified as A6 was selected as 0.040. This cut-off significantly discriminated A6 samples in the RUS dataset (
