<p>Initial subtyping classified 222 RT samples predicted as subtype A or as subtype A-containing recombinant forms. They were subjected to phylogenetic analysis together with the A6-POL-LA dataset, and A1, 02_AG, 01_AE, and 03_AB reference sequences. The generated NJ tree showed a cluster comprising 211 RUS samples and 66/68 A6-POL-LA sequences; EF545108, EU861977 sequences located intermediate between A6, CRF01_AE, and A1 sequences (
