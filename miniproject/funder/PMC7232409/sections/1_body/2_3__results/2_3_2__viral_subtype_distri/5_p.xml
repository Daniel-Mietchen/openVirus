<p>There were no significant divergences in the subtype distribution between males and females. On the other hand, differences were found in subtype distribution depending on the transmission route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00475-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Subtype G detection correlated with nosocomial infections (90.8%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and subtype B infections significantly associated to MSM (62.5%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The subtype distribution was independent of patientsÂ´ date of birth, with the exception of subtype G infections, which significantly correlated with a birth date between 1981 and 1990 (55.0%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00475-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This subtype was detected only in patients born before 1991 with only one exception: one vertical transmission in 2005 from a patient nosocomially infection in the late 1980s.
