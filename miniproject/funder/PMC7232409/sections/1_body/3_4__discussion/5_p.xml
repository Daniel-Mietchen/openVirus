<p>Non-B subtypes show differences in disease progression (summarised in [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) and present genetic signatures and polymorphisms in amino acid residues associated to resistance in subtype B. Subtypes C, F, G, or CRF02_AG show different susceptibility to specific antiretrovirals and may develop RAMs, which are not favoured in subtype B strains [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our analysis detected two specific RAMs significantly associated to A6 viruses: A62V
 <sub>RT</sub> and G190S
 <sub>RT</sub>. In subtype B, A62V
 <sub>RT</sub> is a compensatory mutation associated with NRTI-class resistance. A62V
 <sub>RT</sub> is observed in two unusual mutational patterns: the Q151M complex and the T69SSS insertion complex. The A62V
 <sub>RT</sub> alone is rare in subtype B, TN-samples as it reduces the replication capacity of these variants to 50% compared to the wild type (wt) virus [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In A6 samples, A62V
 <sub>RT</sub> is an endemic polymorphism with similarly high prevalence among TN and TE patients [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These prevalence trends strongly suggest that this mutation probably does not lead to a sharp reduction of replication capacity in the context of sub-subtype A6, though no experimental data to confirm this hypothesis are available yet. What is more, it opens the question of whether NRTI class-resistance patterns may be favoured in the A6 context. The limited size of our dataset hinders any conclusion in this direction. The substitution G190S
 <sub>RT</sub> confers high level resistance against doravirine, efavirenz, and nevirapine and reduces etravirine and rilpivirine susceptibility to levels of still unknown clinical relevance [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In non-A6 isolates, K103N
 <sub>RT</sub> or Y181C
 <sub>RT</sub> are preferentially detected after efavirenz exposure [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] while G190S
 <sub>RT</sub> is rarely observed, probably due to high costs in replication capacity (in the subtype B context, 20% compared to the wt) [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Conversely, G190S development in A6 isolates is significantly higher (up to 30% to 60%) after EFV and/or nevirapine (NVP)-exposure and is favoured over the K103N and Y181C resistance pathways [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These subtype differences may be partially attributable to the nucleotide exchanges required to achieve the amino acid substitution: While one transition and one transversion (GGA to TCA or AGY) are required in non-A6 isolates, only one transition is required (GGC to AGC) in the A6 genetic background [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The effect of G190S
 <sub>RT</sub> in replication capacity of A6 isolates is yet to be analysed.
