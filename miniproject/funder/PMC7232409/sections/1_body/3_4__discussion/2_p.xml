<p>In Russia compared to western countries, HIV-1 epidemiology differs in several aspects. First, females are a vulnerable collective in Russia. Moreover, we show that the female proportion of HIV patients in medical care has not significantly decreased over the years in the Southern Federal District. In addition, PWID and heterosexual contacts are the main reported transmission modes in Russia [

In West/Central Europe and North America, MSM is the most affected group, both in cumulative incidence and new infections, and these infections correlate with subtype B [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Specifically, in Southern Russia less than 3% of the patients reported to be MSM and this transmission route also correlated with subtype B viruses. Yet, 25% of our samples with unknown transmission route were classified as subtype B, suggesting that they may indeed represent cases of withheld MSM transmission. Underrepresentation of MSM in epidemiological analyses is indeed expected as marked social discrimination complicates their enrolment in clinical studies and, upon inclusion, some of them may report a different transmission route, mostly heterosexual [
