<p>In conclusion, this study enables the systematisation of A6 identification and confirms the predominance of sub-subtype A6 and subtype G in Southern Russia. Additionally, it shows that resistance is circulating in viruses from both TN and TE patients, with the presence of specific RAMs associated to individual subtypes. Efforts to increase the implementation of routine epidemiology and surveillance will further improve therapy efficacy in this region.</p>
