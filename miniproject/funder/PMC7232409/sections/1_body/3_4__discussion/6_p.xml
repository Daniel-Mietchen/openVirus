<p>Single class- and multiresistance to all antiretroviral drug classes available in Russia were detected in the present study, threatening the long-term success of antiretroviral therapy programs. In South Russian therapy-experienced patients, resistance levels are comparable to those described for TE, viraemic patients in western countries [

Further studies including additional samples from the last decade are required to clarify this question. We also identified transmission of drug resistance. PI-, NRTI-, and even PI + NRTI-resistant strains were detected in TN patients. PI-TDR in South Russia, detected in 9% of the TN patients, seems to be higher than in other European countries [
