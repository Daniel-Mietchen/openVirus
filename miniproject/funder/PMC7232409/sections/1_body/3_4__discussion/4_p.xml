<p>Exceptional within HIV Russian epidemiology is the large prevalence of subtype G in the Southern Federal District [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Subtype G strains are otherwise mostly reported from Nigeria and West African countries [

 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Table S8</xref>). They are rare in western countries, with the exceptions of Spain and Portugal, where they account for up to 12% and 30% of the infections, respectively [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In Russia, subtype G infections are unusual outside the region covered in this study [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The subtype G viruses from the Southern Federal District can be retraced to an episode of clonal infection of more than 250 children after exposure to non-sterile needles in 1988â€“1989 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This event still shapes the current HIV landscape, with subtype G prevalence of 23% of the isolates detected in this study. Almost-full genome analyses of three isolates from the nosocomially-infected cohort showed genetic similarity to African G isolates and dissimilarity to eight G viruses from other Russian regions, which were related to G/CRF14_BG isolates from the Iberian zone [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Importantly and contrary to the African and South European cases where subtype G viruses are currently being actively transmitted among the population by heterosexual contacts, this study could not detect any subtype G sample outside this nosocomially infected group, suggesting that these viruses may not have entered other transmission networks yet.
