<p>One of the major technical problems for Russian epidemiology analysis is the accurate subtyping of isolates. This is a key issue for sub-subtype A6, the most prevalent in FSU countries, but also for other CRFs such as 63_02A, which comprises 10.3% of the FSU sequences deposited in GenBank. These isolates cannot be identified by current bioinformatics subtyping tools. Therefore, our initial efforts were directed to develop a methodology to systematise its identification and subsequent annotation in Los Alamos and GenBank databases. The use of the A6_pol_reference consensus sequence allows for a clear discrimination between A6 and A1 samples based on the 
 <italic>pol</italic> nucleotide sequence. Our data do not support EF545108 and EU861977 as reference sequences, in spite of their use in a number of previous studies [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], as they cluster between African A1 and A6 sequences, suggesting that they are actually ancestors of the presently circulating A6 sub-subtype [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The subsequent analysis of A6 prevalence in our data set showed a large predominance of this sub-subtype, similar to what is described for other regions in the country. The initial expansion of this sub-subtype took place in PWID networks [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but now it has extended to all other collectives. The A6 identification methodology developed in this work has been transferred to the geno2pheno system team who are already working to extend the subtyping tool. In the near future, the use of free-access, web-based subtyping tool(s) will enable not only the effortless and straightforward identification of A6 isolates in routine diagnostics, but also the characterisation of their prevalence worldwide. Of note, 4% of the A6-annotated entries in the Los Alamos database are isolates from countries geographically close to the FSU such as Mongolia, Germany, and Turkey, but also from more distant countries like Cyprus, Spain, The Republic of Korea, U.S.A., and Australia (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00475">Table S7</xref>). We acknowledge the limitation that our analyses were based only on the 
 <italic>pol</italic> region. This region was prioritized because it is the main genomic region analysed in routine diagnostics for subtyping as well as for drug resistance testing. Current experiments in our group are investigating other genomic regions such as the 
 <italic>IN</italic> gene or the V3 loop of the gp120 subunit of the Env protein to further optimize and facilitate the detection of A6 isolates. In addition, the methodology developed in this work can also be extended to normalise the classification of other relevant subtypes/CRFs not yet detected through subtyping tools.
