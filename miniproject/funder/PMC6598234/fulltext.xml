However, when HIV has become a manageable chronic disease, older people living with HIV, defined as HIV-infected adults who are aged 50 and over, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] hit a record high of approximately 5.8 million accounting for 15.8% of 36.7 million HIV infections in 2015, according to The Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The report noted that older people also remained sexually active and exhibited a moderate to high level of interest toward sex well into their 80s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Moreover, they were even more likely to have multiple partners and use condoms inconsistently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These facts led to the realization that older people were becoming a high-risk group. Also, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annual data, the proportion of older people newly diagnosed with HIV-1 infection increased in recent years in some areas of China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Fuyang, neighboring Henan Province and located in the northwest of the Anhui Province, is an underdeveloped city with an area of 9775&#x02009;km<sup>2</sup> that represents this trend. According to a recent local HIV-1 epidemiologic survey, this city was once defined as an HIV-1 epidemic focus where infections have been primarily caused by commercial blood donations in the early phase of HIV-1 epidemics, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the number of newly reported HIV cases reached to its highest of 506 in 2004 due to the large-scale screening in previous blood donors. After implementing the policy of standardized management of blood stations, the reported HIV/AIDS cases decreased to its lowest of 143 in 2011. Meanwhile, the proportion of HIV infected through sexual contact was beginning to be higher than that of blood donations, and it has been determined that currently the HIV-1 epidemic is primarily driven by sexual transmissions, which accounted for more than 95%. By 2014, a total of 3521 HIV-1 infected cases (486 HIV infections, 1917 AIDS cases and 1118 deaths) had been reported, and the HIV prevalence was 0.031% (2403/7,823,000). Moreover, this survey also highlighted that the proportion of older newly HIV-1 infections rapidly increased from 19.0 to 32.1% in 2009&#x02013;2014, though the proportion of local older people in Fuyang which had a residential population of 7.6&#x02013;8.4 million has stabilized at 23% on average and didn&#x02019;t change significantly in last decade.

In contrast with the result of a nationwide molecular epidemiological survey indicating CRF01_AE was the most prevalent strain in China after 2007, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] it was found that CRF07_BC predominated in this area, followed by subtype B that accounted for as much as 31.77% of the strains. It is rare to have such a high proportion of subtype B after the early-mid 1990s when commercial plasma collection in central China resulted in an explosion of subtype B infections among former plasma donors (FPDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. According to a recent local HIV-1 epidemiologic survey, the epidemic in Fuyang was once affected by FPDs. It is now primarily driven by sexual contact transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, these results suggested that subtype B strains had possibly spread out of the FPDs into the general population through sexual contact. This hypothesis is consistent with the result of our previous study conducted in Henan Province [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">With further phylogenetic analysis, subtype B sequences also showed a tendency to be in local transmission clusters. Moreover, of the 69 subtype B sequences in local transmission clusters, 72.46% (50/69) sequences were obtained from older people infected through heterosexual contact. When combined with clusters in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, a more significant result was found. This was that older people were more likely to be in local transmission cluster. In particular, only one reference sequence from LANL HIV database was included in three large clusters in total. On the contrary, non-old-aged people were more likely to be clustered with reference sequences obtained from other cities in China to form national transmission clusters. This suggested that older people predominated in the local HIV-1 transmission. This discrepancy could be attributed to social and economic factors. Fuyang is a relatively economically underdeveloped city compared to first-line cities, such as Beijing and Guangzhou, where transmission clusters among older people have rarely been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Older people in Fuyang prefer to settle down, while non-old-aged people tend to work outside the city. Statistically, about 2.8 million Fuyang residents were migrant workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The possibility cannot be excluded that some non-old-aged people were seasonal migrants who were infected outside Fuyang and were diagnosed locally. As a consequence, non-old-aged infected people might engage in multiregional virus exchange, while older people are more likely to contribute to local transmission. Future studies that track the floating population may help delineate the local epidemic more precisely.</p><p id="Par44">A sexual behavior survey conducted in Guangxi, China, indicated that older people had little knowledge of HIV-1 preventions and did not perceive themselves to be at risk of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Their lower education, which was found in this study, may be one of the major factors that contribute to the increasingly high proportion of older infected people and active transmission among this group. Moreover, another important factor often overlooked is the lack of emotional care, especially in older people who are divorced. A previous study found that older people were more vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and some of them may negatively internalize or experience stigma when they are infected with HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As a result, they may engage in high-risk behaviors. This suggests that preventive interventions only are not adequate and more emotional and social support is also needed. Actually, we have not only taken actions to publicize the HIV knowledge by media like TV and radio, but also given lectures on HIV knowledge and humanistic care in communities and rural areas. By now, the treatment target is estimated to be achieved to &#x0201c;75&#x02013;94-92&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par45">Though 94% of people with diagnosed HIV infection have received sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), we should also focus on the increasing PDRMs due to extensive use of ART. In this study, the sequences of the older people had a prevalence of PDRMs (5.56%). Furthermore, all of the older people having PDRMs shared K103&#x02009;N TDR site, and 51.95% (4/7) of them were in local transmission clusters. This implied that prevention from local transmission of K103&#x02009;N which has high-level resistance to the free drugs (efavirenz and nevirapine) for HIV infections in China was in need, otherwise it will give rise to a reduction in efficacy of first-line ART. Added to this, older people were often associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Such circumstances might raise the base-line treatment complexity and increase healthcare costs when coupled with PDRMs. Therefore, tailored preventive interventions for older people are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par46">The generalizability of these results is subjected to certain limitations. For instance, although all newly diagnosed participants in Fuyang within 1 year were recruited, our results only show a representation of central cities in China. There are an increasing number of infected older people cases that have been reported for many other regions. Therefore, the contribution of older people to HIV-1 transmission should draw attention. The phylogenetic analysis applied in this study provides a useful tool for investigations of population-based HIV-1 transmission. However, our results are limited by the disadvantages of cross-sectional samples, which are unable to assess transmission dynamics. Therefore, longitudinal observational studies need to be conducted in the future to obtain more information regarding transmission among older people.</p><p id="Par47">Despite these limitations, this is the first investigation to reveal the transmission structure among older people in China using an integration of molecular, clinical, and demographic data. These findings suggest that older people play an important role in local transmission, and as a previous survey suggested, limited knowledge about HIV-1 results in a lack of motivation to seek testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, the contribution of older people may be underestimated to some extent. Importantly, it is urgent that more tailored interventions be made and implemented. Otherwise, the treatment of older HIV-1 infected people will pose a great challenge in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par48">This study highlighted that older people which was commonly assumed not to be a high-risk group for HIV-1 infection played an important role in the contribution of local HIV-1 transmission in Fuyang, Anhui Province, China. As the increasing numbers of older HIV-1 infected people were reported according to UNAIDS data, more attentions to older people should also be paid in other regions. By combining with demographic data, phylogenetic analysis was a useful tool can be applied to provide more tailored interventions which were definitely needed to the older people population subgroup.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par5">Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par6">the Center for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRFs</term><def><p id="Par7">Circulating recombinant forms</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DRMs</term><def><p id="Par8">Drug resistance mutations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPDs</term><def><p id="Par9">Former plasma donors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par10">Human immunodeficiency viruses</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDUs</term><def><p id="Par11">Injecting drug users</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>jpHMM</term><def><p id="Par12">the jumping profile hidden Markov model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LANL</term><def><p id="Par13">Los Alamos National Laboratory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ML</term><def><p id="Par14">Maximum likelihood</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSM</term><def><p id="Par15">Men who have sex with men</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NJ</term><def><p id="Par16">Neighbor-joining</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNI</term><def><p id="Par17">Nearest neighbor interchanges</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNRTIs</term><def><p id="Par18">Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRTIs</term><def><p id="Par19">Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDRMs</term><def><p id="Par20">Pretreatment drug resistance mutations</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PIs</term><def><p id="Par21">Protease inhibitors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-PCR</term><def><p id="Par22">Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNAIDS</term><def><p id="Par23">the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URFs</term><def><p id="Par24">Unique recombinant forms</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Jianjun Wu and Yu Zhang contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors thank all of the participants, peer workers, and the staff of the Fuyang Center for Disease Prevention and Control for the demographic information collection, sample preparation, and testing.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>LY and LL designed the study; ZY and WJ participated in the process of sequences editing and phylogenetic analyses; ZY, WX, SY, LH and HJ performed statistical analysis; YX, DX, HB and SB collected sample and the demographic data; ZY, WJ, XH, LJ, LY and LL participated in the writing process.
