<p id="Par46">The generalizability of these results is subjected to certain limitations. For instance, although all newly diagnosed participants in Fuyang within 1 year were recruited, our results only show a representation of central cities in China. There are an increasing number of infected older people cases that have been reported for many other regions. Therefore, the contribution of older people to HIV-1 transmission should draw attention. The phylogenetic analysis applied in this study provides a useful tool for investigations of population-based HIV-1 transmission. However, our results are limited by the disadvantages of cross-sectional samples, which are unable to assess transmission dynamics. Therefore, longitudinal observational studies need to be conducted in the future to obtain more information regarding transmission among older people.</p>
