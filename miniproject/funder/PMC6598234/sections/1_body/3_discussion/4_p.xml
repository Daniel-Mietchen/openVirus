<p id="Par45">Though 94% of people with diagnosed HIV infection have received sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), we should also focus on the increasing PDRMs due to extensive use of ART. In this study, the sequences of the older people had a prevalence of PDRMs (5.56%). Furthermore, all of the older people having PDRMs shared K103 N TDR site, and 51.95% (4/7) of them were in local transmission clusters. This implied that prevention from local transmission of K103 N which has high-level resistance to the free drugs (efavirenz and nevirapine) for HIV infections in China was in need, otherwise it will give rise to a reduction in efficacy of first-line ART. Added to this, older people were often associated with age-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypertension, and diabetes. Such circumstances might raise the base-line treatment complexity and increase healthcare costs when coupled with PDRMs. Therefore, tailored preventive interventions for older people are urgently needed.</p>
