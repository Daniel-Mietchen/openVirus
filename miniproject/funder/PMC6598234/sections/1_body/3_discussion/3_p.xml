Their lower education, which was found in this study, may be one of the major factors that contribute to the increasingly high proportion of older infected people and active transmission among this group. Moreover, another important factor often overlooked is the lack of emotional care, especially in older people who are divorced. A previous study found that older people were more vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. As a result, they may engage in high-risk behaviors. This suggests that preventive interventions only are not adequate and more emotional and social support is also needed. Actually, we have not only taken actions to publicize the HIV knowledge by media like TV and radio, but also given lectures on HIV knowledge and humanistic care in communities and rural areas. By now, the treatment target is estimated to be achieved to “75–94-92”.
