<p id="Par42">This analysis investigated the complicated HIV-1 epidemic in Fuyang that was identified to have 14 subtypes within 1 year. In contrast with the result of a nationwide molecular epidemiological survey indicating CRF01_AE was the most prevalent strain in China after 2007, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] it was found that CRF07_BC predominated in this area, followed by subtype B that accounted for as much as 31.77% of the strains. It is rare to have such a high proportion of subtype B after the early-mid 1990s when commercial plasma collection in central China resulted in an explosion of subtype B infections among former plasma donors (FPDs) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, these results suggested that subtype B strains had possibly spread out of the FPDs into the general population through sexual contact. This hypothesis is consistent with the result of our previous study conducted in Henan Province [
