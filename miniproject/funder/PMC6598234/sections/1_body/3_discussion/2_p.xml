<p id="Par43">With further phylogenetic analysis, subtype B sequences also showed a tendency to be in local transmission clusters. Moreover, of the 69 subtype B sequences in local transmission clusters, 72.46% (50/69) sequences were obtained from older people infected through heterosexual contact. When combined with clusters in CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, a more significant result was found. This was that older people were more likely to be in local transmission cluster. In particular, only one reference sequence from LANL HIV database was included in three large clusters in total. On the contrary, non-old-aged people were more likely to be clustered with reference sequences obtained from other cities in China to form national transmission clusters. This suggested that older people predominated in the local HIV-1 transmission. This discrepancy could be attributed to social and economic factors. Fuyang is a relatively economically underdeveloped city compared to first-line cities, such as Beijing and Guangzhou, where transmission clusters among older people have rarely been identified [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Older people in Fuyang prefer to settle down, while non-old-aged people tend to work outside the city. Statistically, about 2.8 million Fuyang residents were migrant workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The possibility cannot be excluded that some non-old-aged people were seasonal migrants who were infected outside Fuyang and were diagnosed locally. As a consequence, non-old-aged infected people might engage in multiregional virus exchange, while older people are more likely to contribute to local transmission. Future studies that track the floating population may help delineate the local epidemic more precisely.
