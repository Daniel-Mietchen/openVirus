<p id="Par26">Fuyang, neighboring Henan Province and located in the northwest of the Anhui Province, is an underdeveloped city with an area of 9775 km
 <sup>2</sup> that represents this trend. According to a recent local HIV-1 epidemiologic survey, this city was once defined as an HIV-1 epidemic focus where infections have been primarily caused by commercial blood donations in the early phase of HIV-1 epidemics, [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and the number of newly reported HIV cases reached to its highest of 506 in 2004 due to the large-scale screening in previous blood donors. After implementing the policy of standardized management of blood stations, the reported HIV/AIDS cases decreased to its lowest of 143 in 2011. Meanwhile, the proportion of HIV infected through sexual contact was beginning to be higher than that of blood donations, and it has been determined that currently the HIV-1 epidemic is primarily driven by sexual transmissions, which accounted for more than 95%. By 2014, a total of 3521 HIV-1 infected cases (486 HIV infections, 1917 AIDS cases and 1118 deaths) had been reported, and the HIV prevalence was 0.031% (2403/7,823,000). Moreover, this survey also highlighted that the proportion of older newly HIV-1 infections rapidly increased from 19.0 to 32.1% in 2009–2014, though the proportion of local older people in Fuyang which had a residential population of 7.6–8.4 million has stabilized at 23% on average and didn’t change significantly in last decade. Elucidation of the transmission characteristics of this high-risk population subgroup is helpful for the development of tailored interventions.
