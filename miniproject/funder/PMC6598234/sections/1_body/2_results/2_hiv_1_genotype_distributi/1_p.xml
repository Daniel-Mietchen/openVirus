<p id="Par37">Of the 362 available sequences, a total of 14 subtypes consisting of three pure subtypes, seven CRFs, and four unique recombinant forms (URFs) were identified. The distribution of HIV-1 subtypes was as follows: CRF07_BC (122/362, 33.70%), B (115/362, 31.77%), CRF01_AE (89/362, 24.59%), CRF08_BC (7/362, 1.93%), C (2/362, 0.55%), G (2/362, 0.55%), CRF55_01B (1/362, 0.28%), CRF67_01B (2/362, 0.55%), CRF68_01B (1/362, 0.28%), CRF85_BC (1/362, 0.28%), and URF (20/362, 5.52%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). CRF07_BC, B and CRF01_AE primarily contributed to the local HIV-1 epidemic. With respect to the constituent ratio of these three major circulating subtypes, the older people group was significantly different from the non-old-aged group (χ

However, CRF07_BC (42.51%, 88/207) dominated in the non-old-aged group, followed by CRF01_AE (33.33%, 69/207) and the B subtype (12.08%, 25/207) (Fig.
