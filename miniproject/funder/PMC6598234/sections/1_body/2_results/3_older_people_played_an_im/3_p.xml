<p id="Par40">Interestingly, more than half of older people in local transmission cluster (43/69, 62.32%) were identified in three large clusters (11, 12, and 22 sequences). Of these large clusters, one was all older people (13/13) and the other two clusters contained 84.62% (11/13) and 86.36% (19/22) of older people (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The median age of these clusters was homogeneous and is as follows: 73 years (13/13, Interquartile range: 69–77), 68 years (11/13, Interquartile range: 59–70), and 70 years (19/22, Interquartile range: 61.75–75). On the contrary, only one large local transmission cluster containing 10 non-old-aged people was identified. Taken together, these results suggested that older people played an important role in local transmission.
