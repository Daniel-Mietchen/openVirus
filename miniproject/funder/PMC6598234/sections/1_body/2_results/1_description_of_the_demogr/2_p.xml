<p id="Par36">Overall, the study population fraction of males to females was 4.29:1 (270/63). In reference to the transmission category, as many as 60.66% (202/333) of HIV-1 infected cases acquired the virus by heterosexual contact, 38.44% (128/333) of HIV-1 infected cases were MSM, 0.3% (1/333) were infected by injection drug use or heterosexual contact, 0.3% (1/333) were IDU, and 0.3% (1/333) of cases had an unknown transmission category. The median age of all of the participants was 44 years (Interquartile range: 31–59), of which the older people group accounted for 37.84% (126/333), and the proportion of persons in the non-old-aged group was 62.16% (207/333). The demographic comparison of these two groups is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. There was no significant difference in gender composition, but with regard to educated and married people, older people were more likely to be divorced (29.37% vs. 12.56%) and undereducated (the proportion of whom had a degree under high school: 92.06% vs. 68.08%). A more important fact is that the transmission category also exhibited statistically significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Older people were more likely to be infected through heterosexual contact (113/126, 89.68%), in contrast, the proportion of MSM (117/207, 56.52%) was higher than whom infected through heterosexual contact (89/207, 43.00%) in non-old aged group. Although there is the possibility of misclassification of MSM as heterosexuals and it has been confirmed in investigations conducted in UK, [
