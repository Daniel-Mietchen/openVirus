<p id="Par41">The overall rate of PDRMs in this study population was 4.42% (16/362), which was as low as the percentage reported in a previous survey from the Anhui Province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The rate was 4.35% (9/207) in non-old-aged group, while it reached 5.56% (7/126) among older people (Fisher’s exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, all seven older people shared the K103 N mutation that confers resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). In contrast, the PDRMs were more complicated among the nine non-old-aged people, and they had eight mutations that conferred resistance to NNRTIs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Moreover, the proportion of sequences with PDRMs in local transmission cluster was 57.14% (4/7) in older people group, while it was only 11.11% (1/9) in non-old-aged group (Fisher’s exact test, P &gt; 0.05).
