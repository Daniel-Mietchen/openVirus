<p id="Par30">Total viral RNA was extracted from plasma isolated from blood samples using the Roche High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche, REF: 11858882001). A nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to amplify a 
 <italic>pol</italic> fragment of the 1062â€‰bp length region (from 2253 to 3314 according to HXB2 calibrator) spanning the protease gene and partial reverse transcriptase gene using the One Step RNA PCR Kit (Takara, RR055A) and the ExTaq Kit (Takara, RR902A) with sets of primers and thermal cycling conditions as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The PCR products were purified and subjected to direct DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 3730 Sequencer.
