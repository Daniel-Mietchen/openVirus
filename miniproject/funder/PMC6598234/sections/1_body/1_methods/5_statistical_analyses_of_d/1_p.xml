<p id="Par34">The demographic data were all based on a self-reported standardized questionnaire administered at the time of diagnosis. The variables of gender, age, education, marriage, transmission category, and HIV-1 subtype were evaluated for the purpose of depicting the local HIV-1 infection status. To further focus on elderly people, persons aged 50 or older were considered to be in the older people group, and persons younger than 50 years old were conversely classified into the non-old-aged group. All the variables that differed between these two groups were examined. Additionally, the contribution of older people to local HIV-1 transmission was also accessed by comparing the number of older people and non-old-aged people enrolled in local transmission cluster and non-local transmission cluster. All statistical analyses were tested using Pearson’s χ
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test based on a two-sided α of 0.05 using R version 3.5.1.
