<p id="Par31">Phylogenetic analysis was used to infer the HIV-1 subtypes. The sequences were then submitted to a quality control program on The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV database (

Then, all the available sequences were aligned using reference strains of group M and the circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) in China using the ClustalW multiple alignment program included in the BioEdit software. They were then manually edited. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. For sequences of unknown HIV-1 subtype, the jumping profile hidden Markov model (jpHMM) (
