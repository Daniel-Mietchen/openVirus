<p id="Par32">For the purpose of transmission cluster analysis, we followed a methodology described previously and included a data set of similar sequences from LANL HIV database by identifying the ten closest matches with BLAST for each of the Fuyang sequences in the study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The final data set containing 1645 sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 362 from Fuyang and 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1283 from LANL sequences) was then aligned to find the best fitting nucleotide substitution model using the FindModel tool (

A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed in the PhyML 3.0 online program using the GTR nucleotide substitution model and nearest neighbor interchanges (NNI) to estimate the tree topology by approximate likelihood ratio test Shimodaira-Hasegawa (aLRT-SH) like branch support [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, the pairwise genetic distance was computed using the Tamura-Nei model in the MEGA6 software. Transmission clusters were picked out in ClusterPicker1.2 when the relationship among two or more sequences fulfilled the following two stringent conditions: the tree nodes with an aLRT-SH value ≥90 and an overall mean genetic distance less than 0.015 nucleotide substitutions per site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Clusters that had more than 80% sequences from Fuyang were defined as local transmission clusters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].
