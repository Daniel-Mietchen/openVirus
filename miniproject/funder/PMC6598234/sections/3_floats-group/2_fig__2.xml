  <p>Transmission clusters in the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees. A total of 86 transmission clusters consisting 485 sequences (
   <italic>n</italic> = 207 from Fuyang and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 278 reference sequences) were identified by constructing the ML tree. The results are shown by subtype groups: 
   <bold>a</bold>. B subtype, 
   <bold>b</bold>. CRF01_AE, 
   <bold>c</bold>. CRF07_BC and 
   <bold>d</bold>. Other subtypes. The branch support (aLRT-SH) above 90% is shown at the corresponding nodes, and corresponding branch colors indicate cluster classifications (Red represents the local transmission cluster; Blue represents the non-local transmission cluster). Square colors indicate the sequences from different population subgroups (Pink: older people; Light blue: non-old-aged people; Light green: reference sequences; Grey: unknown-aged people)
