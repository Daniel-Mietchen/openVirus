<p>Reviewer #1: In this paper, Ai et al use a standard mathematical model to investigate the impact of improving coverage with rotavirus vaccine on rotavirus disease burden, and the effect it could have on the biennial patterns that have emerged post vaccine introduction. They test increasing coverage in two patient populations: those attended by pediatricians and those attended by family practitioners. They project significant reductions in disease burden (compared to current levels) when coverage is increased among patients of family practitioners alone, and larger reductions when coverage is increased among patients of both family practitioners and pediatricians. With increased coverage, they note a disappearance of the biennial pattern of rotavirus incidence (it is replaced by a reduced annual pattern), supporting the hypothesis that biennial patterns arise from an inter-year accumulation of susceptible persons in settings with moderate coverage. This is a well written paper, that is concise and understandable even for non-modelers, with clear conclusions that are directly derived from their results, and with an important public health message. The model structure has been built to emulate natural rotavirus disease and transmission. I only have a few minor comments.</p>
