<p>In general, biennial patterns of RVGE could be caused by(a combination of) vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy, and birth rate (Pitzer 2009; Pitzer 2011). Since birth rates in the U.S have been low and fairly stable through the pre and post – vaccine era, and previous studies have indicated that incomplete vaccine coverage can drive biennial patterns, we considered vaccine coverage as the main factor in our model driving biennial patterns in the U.S. Note that these patterns do not occur in most other high-income countries with rotavirus immunization. We incorporated a detailed explanation of this rationale in the text (lines 83-89). Additionally, we also mentioned the disappearance of biennial patterns due to increasing of vaccine coverage predicted in the Weidemann 2014 modeling study in the text (lines 288 – 289)</p>
