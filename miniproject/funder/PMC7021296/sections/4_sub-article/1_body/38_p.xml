<p>In general, biennial patterns of disease could be caused by a combination of vaccine coverage rates, vaccine efficacy, and birth rate, such that susceptibles are accumulated at a certain rate (Pitzer 2009; Pitzer 2011, Shah 2018). In one study, a RVGE transmission model predicted that biennial patterns of RVGE after introduction of vaccine when birth rates are lower while an annual pattern of RVGE was predicted when birth rates are high (Pitzer 2011). In the U.S, birth rates have remained fairly stable0 in the pre and post-vaccine era. Thus, birth rate is likely not a significant driver of the biennial pattern of RVGE in the U.S. </p>
