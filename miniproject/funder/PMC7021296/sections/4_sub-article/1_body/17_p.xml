<p>Response: A likely cause of biennial patterns of disease in the U.S. is the accumulation of susceptibles that results from modest vaccine coverage. Vaccine efficacy and the rate of loss of immunity both impact the accumulation of susceptibles over time so calibrating these parameters allows the model to capture the biennial patterns that are observed in the U.S. </p>
