<p>We used data from the Velazquez 1996 study to inform the proportions of infection, symptomatic infection and severe disease and relative infectiousness of non-primary infections because of its rigorous study design and study population. Velazquez 1996 was a birth cohort study conducted in Mexico quantifying risk reduction after infection by collecting stool weekly from 200 infants from birth to 2-year-old. There are three birth cohort studies conducted in Mexican, Indian and African birth cohorts that quantify the reduced risk of subsequent infections. As there are no published birth cohort studies conducted in the U.S., we selected the Velazquez study of the Mexican birth cohort which would have more similar demographic characteristics to the U.S. than the birth cohorts from India and Africa. Moreover, the data from the Velazquez study has been used to parameterize many other rotavirus transmission models (Pitzer 2012; Atchison 2010; Atkins 2012).</p>
