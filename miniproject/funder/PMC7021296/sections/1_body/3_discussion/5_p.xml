<p>Our model had several limitations. First, though we took assortative contact patterns for children visiting PEs and FPs into account, there currently are no data that describe the true assortative contact patterns within and between patients who attend physician groups. Furthermore, the assortative contact structure between different age groups used in this model is based on the POLYMOD study, which is a population-based contact survey in Europe. This may not accurately represent the contact structure in the U.S. Second, while our model did capture the intensity in the year to year variability in the present biennial epidemic patterns, the observed RVGE cases in even rotavirus season years were much lower than the value predicted by our model [

While this database covers most states, it may not be representative of the whole U.S. population. For example, children who fall under the coverage of Medicaid, may have lower childhood vaccination coverage and higher incidence of RVGE than the children represented in the MarketScan commercial insurance database [
