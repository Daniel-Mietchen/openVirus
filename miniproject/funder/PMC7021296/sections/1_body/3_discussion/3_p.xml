<p>The emergence of biennial epidemic patterns of RVGE incidence in the U.S. after the introduction of a national vaccine program may be driven by accumulation of susceptible following modest vaccine coverage. Other developed countries with high coverage of rotavirus vaccination (&gt;85%), such as Belgium, Austria, Australia, Finland, and Germany, have not experienced the biennial epidemic patterns after vaccine introduction [

 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our model predicted that RVGE incidence shifted from a biennial pattern to an annual pattern when vaccine coverage reached 85%. Thus, promoting rotavirus vaccination in children visiting FPs lowers disease incidence rates and results in a shift from biennial to annual epidemic patterns. Higher vaccination coverage leads to a smaller susceptible population compared to the susceptible population in Status Quo. Therefore, the rate of accumulation of susceptible children over two successive birth cohorts may not be sufficient to drive biennial ‘mini-epidemics’. Shah et al. suggested that increased rotavirus vaccine coverage in the U.S. may change rotavirus epidemiological patterns since the biennial epidemic patterns may be driven by lower vaccine coverage [
