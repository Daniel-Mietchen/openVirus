<p>We modeled the epidemiological impact of higher vaccine coverage by U.S. family practitioners and pediatricians and note several key findings. First, as expected, higher coverage leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases through both direct and indirect vaccine effects. Second, under both Improved FP and Improved FP + PE vaccine coverage scenarios, we predicted current biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns would shift to more predictable, annual epidemic patterns. Third, while the mixing patterns of populations attending FPs versus PEs is unknown, we found that assuming assortative mixing among children visiting PEs and FPs amplified the impact of increasing vaccine coverage.</p>
