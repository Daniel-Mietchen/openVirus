<p>Our predictions were somewhat sensitive to assumptions about mixing patterns in children visiting PEs and FPs. When we assumed assortative mixing, we found greater impact of increasing vaccine coverage on severe RVGE incidence. Our model had a higher force of infection with assortative mixing patterns than that in random mixing patterns. Effelterre et al. found that the estimated basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of rotavirus is higher when mixing patterns are assumed to be assortative. However, that study showed that reduction in any grade of severe RVGE incidence in children under 5 years of age after vaccination is higher when the assortative mixing is lower, which contradicts our results [

This difference influences the vaccine impact on the reduction of RVGE since rotavirus vaccines have better efficacy against severe RVGE [

 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In another study, Choe and Lee indicated that the higher degree of assortative mixing had higher R
 <sub>0</sub> than random mixing [
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, after vaccine introduction, a higher degree of assortative mixing resulted in lower incidence over time. We have no data to inform mixing patterns between PEs and PFs populations. But, under either scenario, promoting vaccine coverage in children visiting FPs can have significant impacts on reducing severe RVGE incidence in children under 5 years of age in the U.S. Future rotavirus vaccine promotion strategies in the U.S. can emphasize covering children visiting FPs.
