<p>Our research aim is to assess the potential impact of improved rotavirus vaccine coverage in terms of disease incidence and epidemiological patterns of rotavirus in children under 5 in the U.S. Our main hypothesis is that the incidence of RVGE in the U.S. can be further decreased, with a shift from biennial to annual cycles if family practitioners were to provide rotavirus vaccine at the same level of pediatricians. We adapted and analyzed a dynamic transmission model of rotavirus disease and vaccination that included heterogeneity in vaccine coverage and contact patterns among children provided care by pediatricians or family practitioners.</p>
