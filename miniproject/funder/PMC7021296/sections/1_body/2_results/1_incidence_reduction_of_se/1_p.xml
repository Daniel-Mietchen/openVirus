<p>Before rotavirus vaccine introduction, the model estimated that the average incidence of severe RVGE cases was 327 per 10,000 population between 2000 and 2006 (S1 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228942.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). To account for biennial patterns of incidence post vaccine introduction, we present four-year averages of severe RVGE cases to compare the incidence of severe RVGE cases in new vaccine scenarios to Status Quo. The four-year average rates of severe RVGE cases in Status Quo, Improved FP, and Improved FP+PE were 75, 57, and 33 per 10,000 population, respectively (
