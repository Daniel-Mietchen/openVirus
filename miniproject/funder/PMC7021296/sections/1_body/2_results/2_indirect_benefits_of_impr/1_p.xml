<p>In children 0–11 months old and Improved FP, the model estimated the 2018–2029 average percent of severe RVGE cases averted were 23% in the PE population and 37% in the FP population compared to Status Quo (S2 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228942.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The percent of severe RVGE cases averted in the PE population compared to the pre-vaccine era was 85% in Status Quo and 89% in Improved FP. Since there is no improved vaccine coverage in the PE population in Improved FP, this additional 4% of severe cases (about 7000 cases) averted in PE population are indirect benefits of improved vaccine coverage from FP population.
