<p>In the sensitivity analysis (S3 Table in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228942.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) we assumed assortative mixing patterns with 80% of contacts occurring within a group and 20% of contacts occurring between groups. This resulted in an increase of 5 per 10,000 population of the four-year average severe RVGE incidence (
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) compared to random mixing patterns. However, assuming assortative mixing resulted in around 5% greater reduction in the four-year average of severe RVGE cases averted in Improved FP and Improved FP + PE, respectively, compared to Status Quo than the random mixing patterns (
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The epidemic patterns of RVGE stayed the same as random mixing patterns (
