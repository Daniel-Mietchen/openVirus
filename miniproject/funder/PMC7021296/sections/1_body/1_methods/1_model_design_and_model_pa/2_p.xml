<p>The model assumes individuals can have up to four rotavirus infections with decreasing probabilities of infection, disease and severe disease (

 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Only primary and secondary rotavirus infection were assumed to develop severe diarrhea. Additionally, we assumed primary infection, secondary infection, tertiary infection, and quaternary infection have the same duration of infectiousness.
