<p>We assumed the proportion of children visiting pediatricians was 84.4% while the proportion of children visiting family practitioners was 15.6% based on data from the MarketScan Research Database [
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We separated children under one year of age into pediatrician and family practitioner-attending groups in the model to predict the impact of different vaccine coverage in these two groups. In the model, children get the first dose vaccine at two months of age and second dose at four months of age. U.S. birth rates were informed by the CDC Wonder database [
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We assumed maternal immunity does not have an effect on vaccine efficacy and assumed that death rates equaled the birth rate so that the total population remains constant. In baseline analysis, we assumed an assortative contact structure between different age groups based on the POLYMOD study [
