<p>We used a dynamic deterministic model of rotavirus transmission with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) to represent rotavirus transmission and vaccination. This model is age-structured with six age groups: 0–1 month, 2–3 months, 4–11 months, 1–4 years, 5–24 years, and above 25 years. The model equations are shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0228942.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. Individuals are born with maternal immunity which wanes at rate 
 <italic>e</italic>. Susceptible individuals are infected at a rate 
 <italic>λ</italic> and enter the infectious compartment. Infected individuals either recover from infection and gain long-term immunity at rate 
 <italic>γ</italic> or become susceptible to subsequent infections. Immunity wanes at rate 
 <italic>ω</italic> and individuals become susceptible again. We also included seasonal forcing in our model.
