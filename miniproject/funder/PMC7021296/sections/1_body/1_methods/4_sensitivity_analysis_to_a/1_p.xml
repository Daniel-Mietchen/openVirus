<p>Initially we assumed random mixing patterns between children visiting PEs and FPs. However, it is possible that there is assortative mixing within these groups such that children who attend FPs are more likely to mix with other such children. Therefore, we tested the sensitivity of the model to this assumption of mixing by setting contact within a group to be higher than contact between groups to depict an assortative mixing pattern. We assumed that 80% of contacts occur within a group and 20% of contacts occur between groups in assortative mixing patterns.</p>
