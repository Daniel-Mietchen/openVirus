<p>We estimated four age specific transmission parameters (

 <italic>deSolve</italic> package to solve differential equations [
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We calibrated a parameter for rotavirus vaccine efficacy to allow the model to capture observed biennial epidemic patterns (
 <xref rid="pone.0228942.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Biennial epidemic patterns in the U.S. may be driven by a slower accumulation of susceptibles following modest vaccine coverage. By calibrating the vaccine efficacy and rate of loss of immunity parameters (i.e., increasing vaccine efficacy and lowering the rate of loss of immunity) we can slow the accumulation of the simulated susceptible population which allows the model to capture biennial epidemic patterns.
