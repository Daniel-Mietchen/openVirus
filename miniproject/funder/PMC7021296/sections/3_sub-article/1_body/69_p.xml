<p>I doubt whether the biennial pattern of RVGE in U.S. may be explained only by incomplete vaccine coverage. Authors should provide more evidence for this hypothesis by literature or own experience. Trend for biennal patterns or oscillations in RVGE associated hospitalizations was seen by others (e.g. Prelog M et al., J Inf Dis 2016). Authors should comment on this. The immunological or virological mechanisms behind biennial patterns or disappearance of biennial patterns should be explained to understand the association with vaccine coverage.</p>
