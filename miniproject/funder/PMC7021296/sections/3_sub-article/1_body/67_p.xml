<p>Reviewer #2: The authors focus on an important aspect of mechanisms which may influence the effectiveness of vaccines in general and in the particular setting of RV vaccination. To estimate the reduction of RVGE incidence by efforts to improve vaccination rates by FP by applying a deterministic age-structured dynamic model is a feasible approach. Overall, this is a well-written manuscript with sound results.</p>
