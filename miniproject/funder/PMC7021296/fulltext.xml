However, rotavirus vaccine coverage has remained relatively low (70&#x02013;75%) compared to other infant immunizations in the U.S. Part of the reason for this lower coverage is that children whose care is provided by family practitioners (FP) have considerably lower probability of being vaccinated compared to those seen be pediatricians (PE). We used a dynamic transmission model to assess the impact of improving rotavirus vaccine coverage by FP and/or PE on rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence and seasonal patterns.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>A deterministic age-structured dynamic model with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) was used to simulate rotavirus transmission and vaccination. We estimated the reduction of RVGE cases by 2 doses of rotavirus vaccine with three vaccination scenarios: (Status Quo: 85% coverage by pediatricians and 45% coverage by family practitioners; Improved FP: 85% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners; Improved FP+PE: 95% coverage by pediatricians and family practitioners). In addition, we tested the sensitivity of the model to the assumption of random mixing patterns between children visiting pediatricians and children visiting family practitioners.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>In this model, higher vaccine coverage provided by family practitioners and pediatricians leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases (23% averted in Improved FP and 57% averted in Improved FP+PE compared to Status Quo) including indirect effects. One critical impact of higher total vaccine coverage is the effect on rotavirus epidemic patterns in the U.S.; the biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns shifted to reduced annual epidemic patterns. Additionally, assortative mixing patterns in children visiting pediatricians and family practitioners amplify the impact of increasing vaccine coverage.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Other high-income countries that introduced vaccine have not experienced biennial patterns, like the U.S. Our results suggest that increasing overall vaccine coverage to 85% among infants would lead to an overall reduction in incidence with annual epidemic patterns.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NIAID (R01-AI112970)</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NIH/NIAID (R01-AI112970) and the Vaccine Impact Modeling Consortium.

Before the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in 2006, rotavirus caused an estimated 200,000 emergency room visits, 55,000 to 70,000 hospitalizations, and 20 to 60 deaths annually in children younger than 5 years of age, leading to approximately $1 billion in direct and indirect costs to the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) in the U.S. indicates that rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence has declined between 57% - 89% since the introduction of vaccines in 2006 [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rotavirus hospitalization rates have reduced between 70% - 98%, and all cause diarrhea-associated hospitalization rates declined between 9% - 76% in children under the age of 5 [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rotavirus vaccines have also provided indirect benefits to unvaccinated individuals across the age range [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>By 2016, full two dose coverage of rotavirus vaccines reached 74.1% in U.S. children 19&#x02013;35 months of age. However, rotavirus vaccine coverage is still lower than other routine childhood recommended vaccines (DTap&#x02265;3 doses: 95%, Poliovirus&#x02265;3 doses: 93.7%, MMR &#x02265;1 doses: 91.1%, Heb&#x02265;3 doses: 90.5% in 2016) and below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% coverage [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, to meet the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% coverage [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and decrease further rotavirus disease and economic burden, promotion of rotavirus vaccine coverage needs to be considered.</p><p>Prior to rotavirus vaccination, RVGE showed a winter-spring seasonality and geographic patterns that begin in the southwest in December-January, extending across to the U.S. and ending in the northeast during April-May. In the post-vaccine era, the rotavirus season was shorter, delayed and of smaller magnitude compared to seasons in the pre-vaccine era, but a biennial pattern of RVGE incidence emerged [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This RVGE reduction was accompanied by biennial patterns with higher seasonal peak in 2009, 2011, and 2013 compared to lower seasonal peak in 2008, 2010, and 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In general, biennial patterns of RVGE could be induced by factors that govern the rate of new susceptibles. These include incomplete vaccine coverage rates, imperfect vaccine efficacy, and birth rates [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In one study, a RVGE transmission model predicted that biennial patterns of RVGE emerge after the introduction of vaccines when birth rates are low, while an annual pattern of RVGE was predicted when birth rates are high [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the U.S, birth rates have remained fairly stable in the pre and post-vaccine era. Thus, birth rate is likely not a significant driver of the biennial pattern of RVGE in the U.S. Incomplete vaccination coverage that leads to a build-up of susceptible children may be driving this biennial pattern [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Unvaccinated children drive the higher rotavirus hospitalizations in the biennial patterns [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, other developed countries with high coverage of rotavirus vaccination (&#x0003e;85%), such as Belgium, Austria, Australia, Finland, and Germany, did not have the biennial epidemic patterns after the introduction of vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Health care providers play a critical role in promoting vaccines [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Pediatricians and family practitioners are two essential rotavirus vaccine providers in the U.S. Pediatricians provide rotavirus vaccine to all eligible infants at considerably higher levels than family practitioners do (85% and 45%, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Family practitioners may be more concerned about vaccine safety and the burden of adding additional vaccines to the childhood vaccination schedule [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Accordingly, family practitioners could play an essential role in increasing rotavirus vaccine coverage and could impact RVGE incidence in the U.S. [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Our research aim is to assess the potential impact of improved rotavirus vaccine coverage in terms of disease incidence and epidemiological patterns of rotavirus in children under 5 in the U.S. Our main hypothesis is that the incidence of RVGE in the U.S. can be further decreased, with a shift from biennial to annual cycles if family practitioners were to provide rotavirus vaccine at the same level of pediatricians. We adapted and analyzed a dynamic transmission model of rotavirus disease and vaccination that included heterogeneity in vaccine coverage and contact patterns among children provided care by pediatricians or family practitioners.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Model design and model parameters</title><p>We used a dynamic deterministic model of rotavirus transmission with susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments (SIRS model) to represent rotavirus transmission and vaccination.

U.S. birth rates were informed by the CDC Wonder database [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We assumed maternal immunity does not have an effect on vaccine efficacy and assumed that death rates equaled the birth rate so that the total population remains constant.

For the Improved FP and Improved FP + PE scenarios, we assumed a change in vaccine coverage beginning in 2018.

First, as expected, higher coverage leads to lower incidence of severe RVGE cases through both direct and indirect vaccine effects. Second, under both Improved FP and Improved FP + PE vaccine coverage scenarios, we predicted current biennial rotavirus epidemic patterns would shift to more predictable, annual epidemic patterns. Third, while the mixing patterns of populations attending FPs versus PEs is unknown, we found that assuming assortative mixing among children visiting PEs and FPs amplified the impact of increasing vaccine coverage.</p><p>A number of results from this model are consistent with what has been predicted with previously published rotavirus transmission models; high rotavirus vaccine coverage (&#x0003e;85%) resulted in reductions of annual severe RVGE incidence by 56% [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 70% [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and 84% [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for children under 5 years of age, compared to pre-vaccination levels in different model studies. One modeling study for Germany [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] predicted no rotavirus biennial epidemic patterns even after high national rotavirus vaccine coverage (90%). However, other models had different predicted effects on rotavirus epidemic patterns after high national rotavirus vaccine coverage (90%) [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These models predicted biennial epidemic patterns in medium vaccine coverage (70%) and elimination of rotavirus at 90% coverage, whereas other models predicted potential biennial epidemic patterns with 90% vaccine coverage. Differences in the assumptions and parameters of these models may explain the different predictions for epidemic patterns. For example, in our model we assumed vaccines and natural infection induce partial immunity (i.e. subsequent infection can still occur but at reduced rate) and a long duration of immunity. Another modeling study that predicted high vaccine coverage with biennial patterns assumed one-year duration of complete immunity after previous infection, then, individuals were assumed to be susceptible to infection again with partial immunity [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, our model fit to data from the U.S. whereas other rotavirus models were fit to rotavirus data from England and Wales. Differences in demographic conditions between the U.S. and England and Wales may also partly explain the differences in these results.</p><p>The emergence of biennial epidemic patterns of RVGE incidence in the U.S. after the introduction of a national vaccine program may be driven by accumulation of susceptible following modest vaccine coverage. Other developed countries with high coverage of rotavirus vaccination (&#x0003e;85%), such as Belgium, Austria, Australia, Finland, and Germany, have not experienced the biennial epidemic patterns after vaccine introduction [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Our model predicted that RVGE incidence shifted from a biennial pattern to an annual pattern when vaccine coverage reached 85%. Thus, promoting rotavirus vaccination in children visiting FPs lowers disease incidence rates and results in a shift from biennial to annual epidemic patterns. Higher vaccination coverage leads to a smaller susceptible population compared to the susceptible population in Status Quo. Therefore, the rate of accumulation of susceptible children over two successive birth cohorts may not be sufficient to drive biennial &#x02018;mini-epidemics&#x02019;. Shah et al. suggested that increased rotavirus vaccine coverage in the U.S. may change rotavirus epidemiological patterns since the biennial epidemic patterns may be driven by lower vaccine coverage [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The shift of epidemic patterns from biennial patterns to reduced annual patterns may be beneficial for public health preparedness as the burden of disease would be more consistent year to year.</p><p>Our predictions were somewhat sensitive to assumptions about mixing patterns in children visiting PEs and FPs. When we assumed assortative mixing, we found greater impact of increasing vaccine coverage on severe RVGE incidence. Our model had a higher force of infection with assortative mixing patterns than that in random mixing patterns. Effelterre et al. found that the estimated basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub>) of rotavirus is higher when mixing patterns are assumed to be assortative. However, that study showed that reduction in any grade of severe RVGE incidence in children under 5 years of age after vaccination is higher when the assortative mixing is lower, which contradicts our results [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Effelterre et al. focused on the reduction of any RVGE but our study focused on the reduction of severe RVGE. This difference influences the vaccine impact on the reduction of RVGE since rotavirus vaccines have better efficacy against severe RVGE [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In another study, Choe and Lee indicated that the higher degree of assortative mixing had higher R<sub>0</sub> than random mixing [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, after vaccine introduction, a higher degree of assortative mixing resulted in lower incidence over time. We have no data to inform mixing patterns between PEs and PFs populations. But, under either scenario, promoting vaccine coverage in children visiting FPs can have significant impacts on reducing severe RVGE incidence in children under 5 years of age in the U.S. Future rotavirus vaccine promotion strategies in the U.S. can emphasize covering children visiting FPs.</p><p>Our model had several limitations. First, though we took assortative contact patterns for children visiting PEs and FPs into account, there currently are no data that describe the true assortative contact patterns within and between patients who attend physician groups. Furthermore, the assortative contact structure between different age groups used in this model is based on the POLYMOD study, which is a population-based contact survey in Europe. This may not accurately represent the contact structure in the U.S. Second, while our model did capture the intensity in the year to year variability in the present biennial epidemic patterns, the observed RVGE cases in even rotavirus season years were much lower than the value predicted by our model [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0228942.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Third, we fit this model to a large, commercial insurance dataset. While this database covers most states, it may not be representative of the whole U.S. population. For example, children who fall under the coverage of Medicaid, may have lower childhood vaccination coverage and higher incidence of RVGE than the children represented in the MarketScan commercial insurance database [<xref rid="pone.0228942.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, we used a dynamic transmission model to predict the impact of increasing immunization rates among children who attend family practitioners. Under these higher vaccine coverage levels, we predicted that biennial patterns would shift to annual patterns with lower magnitude of RVGE incidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228942.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><p>S1 Table.

They test increasing coverage in two patient populations: those attended by pediatricians and those attended by family practitioners. They project significant reductions in disease burden (compared to current levels) when coverage is increased among patients of family practitioners alone, and larger reductions when coverage is increased among patients of both family practitioners and pediatricians. With increased coverage, they note a disappearance of the biennial pattern of rotavirus incidence (it is replaced by a reduced annual pattern), supporting the hypothesis that biennial patterns arise from an inter-year accumulation of susceptible persons in settings with moderate coverage. This is a well written paper, that is concise and understandable even for non-modelers, with clear conclusions that are directly derived from their results, and with an important public health message.

I only have a few minor comments.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comments.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Line 60: Typographical error, it should say &#x0201c;$1 billion in direct and indirect costs to the U.S.&#x0201d;</p><p>Response: The typographical error is corrected </p><p>Edits to text (line 60): &#x0201c;$1 billion in direct and indirect costs to the U.S.&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 63: Typographical error, it should say &#x0201c;rotavirus incidence has declined between 57%&#x0201d; (erase &#x02018;in the&#x02019;)</p><p>Response: The typographical error is corrected </p><p>Edits to text (line 63): &#x0201d; that rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) incidence has declined between 57% - 89%&#x0201d;</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Line 110 and Table 1: The text mentions the model is age-structured with 6 age-groups, yet the table shows parameters only for 4 age-groups, would clarify. Perhaps estimated transmission parameters are reported as larger age-groups.</p><p>Response: Indeed, age groups 0 &#x02013; 1 months, 2 &#x02013; 3 months, and 4 &#x02013; 11 months in the model shared the same group of estimated age specific transmission parameters: age-group &#x0003c;1 year. </p><p>Edits to text (line 143 &#x02013; 144):&#x0201d; We estimated four age specific transmission parameters (q_1 for &#x0003c;1 year, q_2 for 1-4 years, q_3 for 5-24 years, and q_4 for &#x0003e; 25 years)&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 145: Would expand on, explain more, how the calibration of vaccine effectiveness allows the model to capture the biennial patterns.</p><p>Response: A likely cause of biennial patterns of disease in the U.S. is the accumulation of susceptibles that results from modest vaccine coverage. Vaccine efficacy and the rate of loss of immunity both impact the accumulation of susceptibles over time so calibrating these parameters allows the model to capture the biennial patterns that are observed in the U.S. </p><p>We add the explanation of the factors driving biennial patterns to the introduction and methods to explain why we calibrate vaccine effectiveness and rate of loss immunity to capture biennial patterns. Edits to text (lines 83 &#x02013; 85): &#x0201c;In general, biennial patterns of RVGE could be induced by factors that govern the rate of new susceptibles. These include incomplete vaccine coverage, imperfect vaccine efficacy, and birth rate (Pitzer 2009; Pitzer 2011, Shah 2018). </p><p>Edits to text (156 &#x02013; 164): &#x0201c;Biennial epidemic patterns in the U.S. may be driven by a slower accumulation of susceptibles following modest vaccine coverage. By calibrating the vaccine efficacy and rate of loss of immunity parameters (i.e., increasing vaccine efficacy and lowering the rate of loss of immunity) we can slow the accumulation of the simulated susceptible population which allows the model to capture biennial epidemic patterns.&#x0201d;</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>Line 278: The line &#x0201c;partial immunity when individuals are susceptible&#x0201d; might need to be rephrased, this is not clear.</p><p>Response: In lines 286 &#x02013; 288, partial immunity (i.e. subsequent infection can still occur but at reduced rate) was explained</p><p>Edits to text (lines 288 &#x02013; 291): Another modeling study that predicted high vaccine coverage with biennial patterns assumed one-year duration of complete immunity after previous infection, then, individuals are susceptible to infection again with partial immunity</p><p>Line 311: The public health relevance of the additional 4 percent in reductions in severe rotavirus gastroenteritis when assuming assortative transmission by practitioner is unknown, and authors might want to acknowledge this, or translate to absolute numbers.</p><p>Response: Our raw data shows that an additional 7000 RVGE cases are averted when assuming assortative mixing patterns compared to random mixing patterns in Improved FP. </p><p>Edits to text (lines 233 -235): Since there is no improved vaccine coverage in the PE population in Improved FP, this additional 4% of severe cases (7000 cases lower) averted in PE population are indirect benefits of improved vaccine coverage from FP population. </p><p>Line 320: If the intensity in the year to year variability of the biennial patterns were not captured, then the authors might want to acknowledge that other factors might be at play, or hypothesize which ones.</p><p>Response: We rephrased our statement: Our model did capture the intensity in the year to year variability in the present biennial epidemic patterns, however, the actual RVGE cases in even year rotavirus season were much lower than the value predicted by our model (Aliabadi 2015; Getachew 2018). </p><p>Edits to text (lines 333 &#x02013; 336): Second, relatedly, our model did capture the intensity in the year to year variability in the present biennial epidemic patterns, however, the actual RVGE cases in even year rotavirus season were much lower than the value predicted by our model.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The authors focus on an important aspect of mechanisms which may influence the effectiveness of vaccines in general and in the particular setting of RV vaccination. To estimate the reduction of RVGE incidence by efforts to improve vaccination rates by FP by applying a deterministic age-structured dynamic model is a feasible approach. Overall, this is a well-written manuscript with sound results.</p><p>However, I have some comments to deal with:</p><p>I doubt whether the biennial pattern of RVGE in U.S. may be explained only by incomplete vaccine coverage.

Authors should comment why they took this choice and did not perform a systematic review approach previous to the modeling procedure. Authors should state why the articles by Velazquez or Heymann are prior to others if there are any on these parameters.</p><p>Response: Thank you for your comments and suggestions </p><p>Response to biennial patterns:</p><p>In general, biennial patterns of RVGE could be caused by(a combination of) vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy, and birth rate (Pitzer 2009; Pitzer 2011). Since birth rates in the U.S have been low and fairly stable through the pre and post &#x02013; vaccine era, and previous studies have indicated that incomplete vaccine coverage can drive biennial patterns, we considered vaccine coverage as the main factor in our model driving biennial patterns in the U.S. Note that these patterns do not occur in most other high-income countries with rotavirus immunization. We incorporated a detailed explanation of this rationale in the text (lines 83-89). Additionally, we also mentioned the disappearance of biennial patterns due to increasing of vaccine coverage predicted in the Weidemann 2014 modeling study in the text (lines 288 &#x02013; 289)</p><p>Edits to text (lines 83 &#x02013; 89): </p><p>In general, biennial patterns of disease could be caused by a combination of vaccine coverage rates, vaccine efficacy, and birth rate, such that susceptibles are accumulated at a certain rate (Pitzer 2009; Pitzer 2011, Shah 2018). In one study, a RVGE transmission model predicted that biennial patterns of RVGE after introduction of vaccine when birth rates are lower while an annual pattern of RVGE was predicted when birth rates are high (Pitzer 2011). In the U.S, birth rates have remained fairly stable0 in the pre and post-vaccine era. Thus, birth rate is likely not a significant driver of the biennial pattern of RVGE in the U.S. </p><p>Response to parameters selection:</p><p>We used data from the Velazquez 1996 study to inform the proportions of infection, symptomatic infection and severe disease and relative infectiousness of non-primary infections because of its rigorous study design and study population. Velazquez 1996 was a birth cohort study conducted in Mexico quantifying risk reduction after infection by collecting stool weekly from 200 infants from birth to 2-year-old. There are three birth cohort studies conducted in Mexican, Indian and African birth cohorts that quantify the reduced risk of subsequent infections. As there are no published birth cohort studies conducted in the U.S., we selected the Velazquez study of the Mexican birth cohort which would have more similar demographic characteristics to the U.S. than the birth cohorts from India and Africa. Moreover, the data from the Velazquez study has been used to parameterize many other rotavirus transmission models (Pitzer 2012; Atchison 2010; Atkins 2012).</p><p>The work by Prelog et al (Jid 2018) is an important paper showing the range of indirect effects of rotavirus immunization in Australia, but does not provide parameter input for our model. </p><p>The Hymann 2015 study provides data on the natural history of rotavirus such as daily rate of loss of maternal immunity and daily rate of loss infection. These data have been used to inform parameters in several transmission model (Atchison 2010, Atkins 2012).</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0228942.s002"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers_ChinEn Ai.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0228942.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0228942.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0228942.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Siettos</surname><given-names>Constantinos I.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Constantinos I.
