  <title>Multi-state model to assess LTFU.</title>
  <p>State definitions: (1) 
   <italic>HIV state</italic>–started at the earliest recorded date of contact with the clinic for HIV testing, HIV test confirmation, or baseline interview; (2) 
   <italic>ART state</italic>–started on the recorded ART start date or–when this information is missing–the earliest date in the pharmacy record of medicine pick-up. Individuals who received ART on the day they entered the clinic were modeled as starting directly in the ART state; (3) 
   <italic>Death state</italic>–patients entered this state if their status is ‘Dead’ and the date of transition is the recorded date of death; (4) 
   <italic>LTFU state</italic>–patients entered this state if the status is neither ‘Dead’ nor ‘Transferred.’ For patients who transitioned to LTFU from the HIV state, the date of LTFU is calculated as 90 days after the day the patient is expected to come back, i.e. 6 months or 183 days after the last recorded visit, so the date of LTFU is the date of the last recorded visit plus 273. For patients who transitioned to LTFU from the ART state, the date of LTFU is calculated as 60 days after the day the patient is expected to come back, i.e. 30 days after the last recorded visit (the LTFU date is the date of the last recorded visit plus 90 days); in cases where patients experienced multiple interruptions of 180 days or more, the date of LTFU is the date of the first interruption plus 90 days.
