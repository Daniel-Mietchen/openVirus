<p>This study showed a poor pre- and post-ART retention and sex differences that could be explained by sociocultural and clinical characteristics of HIV-patients accessing HIV care and treatment in Indonesia. Efforts should be made to improve retention among patients with lower education levels. However, other aspects of HIV care continuum such as patient retention after treatment initiation remains a challenge.
