<p>Indonesia has one of the most rapidly growing HIV epidemics in Southeast Asia with an estimated 690,000 people living with HIV in 2015 [

 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In subsequent years, HIV incidence increased among key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and female partners of infected males [
