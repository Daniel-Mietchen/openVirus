<p>Treatment retention can be studied by measuring LTFU, which in most observational studies is treated as a competing risk to survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Because retention is generally lower before than after ART initiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we decided to investigate LTFU in both pre- and on-ART stages using multistate model [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This allowed stage-based effects in disease progression and treatment to be accounted for [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This model can be applied to the stages in the HIV care continuum from diagnosis, linkage to care, retention in care, receipt of ART, and viral suppression [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and has been used to model longitudinal data with unobservable features [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], including in HIV chronicity [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Looking at the outcomes of each step in the HIV “care cascade” [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] can inform ‘Test and Treat’ and similar strategies to improve retention. In this study, we compared the rates of LTFU and mortality between females and males in a prospective cohort of HIV patients in Bandung, Indonesia.
