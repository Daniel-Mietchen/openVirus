<p>Existing evidence on the difference of HIV survival and disease progression between males and females is inconsistent [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A poorer overall survival in males compared to females has been established in a systematic review and meta analysis of 31 studies [
