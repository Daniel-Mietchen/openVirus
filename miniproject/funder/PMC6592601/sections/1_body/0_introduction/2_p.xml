<p>Retention in care, crucial for HIV treatment success [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], remains a major challenge globally. Both worldwide and in Asia about 50% of HIV-infected people received sustained ART in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while Indonesia has a much lower proportion of 14% in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent study found only 76% of HIV-infected key populations who received ART in four cities in Indonesia retained in treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In other settings, lower treatment retention has been associated with clinical determinants such as lower CD4 count and TB co-infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], health facility and structural-level determinants [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and social determinants such as lack of a support group [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], IDU [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], imprisonment [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], younger age at ART initiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and lack of occupation or education [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. At the personal level, disease and associated perceived stigma, physical impairments, and general health-seeking behavior influenced retention in care [
