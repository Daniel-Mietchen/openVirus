<p>One-year retention in care in this cohort (73% in females and 77% in males) was lower than in the Asia-Pacific region in 2016 (86%) [

A study of HIV-infected key populations in four cities in Indonesia found being diagnosed at a facility that provided both testing and treatment services increased treatment initiation [

Analysis of Indonesian MSM and transgender subsample from an Asia Pacific AIDS Positive Network (APN+) study showed an improved retention in care among patients who started ART, had medical insurance, and used the Internet to find HIV-related information [

Being older and having a higher education were correlated with ART initiation, while unemployed patients less likely to initiate ART. ART initiation was also associated with having a lower CD4 and ongoing treatment for TB. Similar to a study in Rwanda, ART initiation among patients with better clinical presentation seemed to be delayed [
