<p>There is little published data on HIV treatment outcomes in Indonesia. In this cohort of long term treatment in all HIV-infected patients we found low uptake of ART with many patients failing to start or restart ART and low retention in care (both before and after ART start). The retention and survival patterns were similar in females and males, with females having slightly poorer retention and better survival. ART uptake, retention, and survival with and without ART were influenced by different sociodemographic and clinical variables.</p>
