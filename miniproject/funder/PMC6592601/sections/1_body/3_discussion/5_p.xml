<p>This study has some limitations. We could not account for the probability of dying among LTFU patients due to lack of confirmation of patient deceased status. The effect of low CD4 on pre-ART LTFU supported the hypothesis that some of the patients categorized as LTFU might have died [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. We included patients who were ART-naïve at entry and those with ART history prior to entry. It is plausible that some patients with ART history have been LTFU prior to entry and they entered this clinic due to symptoms, but our analysis could not account for this possible hidden heterogeneity. There is no standardized definition of LTFU; different definitions yield estimates that vary more than mortality estimates and that are less robust for long-term follow-up [

 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. We used competing risk analysis to reduce bias of the competing risk of death in analyzing LTFU [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] in a multi-state model investigating each stage of transition [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and Cox regression to test the multiple factors influencing them [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. We could not measure treatment failure as an outcome of interest due to lack of CD4 cell plasma HIV-RNA monitoring during treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. According to the national guideline, patients receiving ART should have a 6-monthly CD4 count and annual HIV-RNA viral load measurements to evaluate treatment response, but while patients can get ART drugs for free, they have to pay for these tests, hence socioeconomic gaps between people with and without lab test data is plausible. We did not account for treatment interruptions, a relatively common occurrence among HIV patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] experienced by 97% of patients on ART in this population. Treatment interruption could correlate with treatment failure and retention in care [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In this cohort we had to censor 473 patients (15%) due to transfer because treatment data between facilities are not linked. Even though censoring transferred patients did not bias mortality estimates in another study [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], a better linkage between various testing and treatment facilities would reduce the need to censor transferred individuals and increase the accuracy of retention estimates [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. We used education level, home address, and occupation–the covariates available in the database as measures of socioeconomic status–but some findings are difficult to interpret. A more in-depth study exploring the relationship between treatment outcomes and socioeconomic status using specific variables would give a better picture [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Sex is only one aspect of gender issues influencing health systems but the nature of the study did not allow analysis of gender frameworks and gender power relations in HIV care in this setting [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Some baseline patient characteristics in this study have lots of missing data. Patients with missing data on baseline laboratory indicators (CD4 level, hemoglobin, and HCV co-infection) were more likely to not start ART and to be LTFU, and missing information on the history of tuberculosis treatment was significantly related to not starting ART. In this study we used information on TB treatment because information on actual TB diagnosis was not available; hence TB co-infection might be underestimated (an individual with no history of TB treatment may actually have TB). Despite the high occurrence of missing data, we used multiple imputations to yield correctly estimated standard errors and confidence intervals [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In our study we also present retention data beyond two-year follow-up, for which there is very little published data [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].
