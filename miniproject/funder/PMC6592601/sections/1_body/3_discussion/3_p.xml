<p>Pre-ART survival was poorer for patients who were older, had lower CD4, and had anemia; on-ART survival was poorer for patients living outside the city and who had anemia (

The correlation between unemployment and pre-ART survival diminished in the model that adjusted for clinical variables, suggesting a possible interaction between unemployment and poorer clinical presentation. Other studies have linked unemployment with long-term (more than 4 years) mortality during ART [
