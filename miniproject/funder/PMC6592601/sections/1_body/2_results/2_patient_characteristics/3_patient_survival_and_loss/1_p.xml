Of all patients on ART (n = 1900), 177 patients (9%) had treatment interruption episodes of 180 days or more (the longest interruption at 1507 days or more than four years); even though they eventually reengaged in care, these patients were treated as LTFU in this analysis. Pre-ART mortality was 4% and pre-ART LTFU was 30%, while in patients receiving ART, mortality was 6% and LTFU 38%. A total of 1059 (56%) patients on ART were retained at the end of the study period.
