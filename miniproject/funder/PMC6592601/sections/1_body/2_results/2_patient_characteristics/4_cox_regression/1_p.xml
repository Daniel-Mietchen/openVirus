<p>We applied Cox regression to adjust for the associations between sex and the five possible patient transitions between states; i.e., transition from HIV to ART, HIV to Death, HIV to LTFU, ART to Death, and ART to LTFU (

When adjusting for age, females had a significantly higher hazard ratio to transition from HIV to LTFU (aHR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.05–1.39). When adjusting for clinical variables, females had a lower hazard ratio to transition from ART to Death (aHR = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.35–0.99) but this effect was gone after also adjusting for demographic variables (aHR = 1.03; 95%CI = 0.89 = 1.21). We found no other significant difference between females and males in other transitions across all models. All outcomes from the models can be found in
