<p>Among 3263 patients included, 1900 (58%) presented with newly diagnosed HIV infection, 530 (16%) were referred from other clinics for ART continuation, and 212 (6.5%) were referred with a history of prior ART at some point including for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). We further excluded 48 (1.5%) patients because their censored date was &lt;180 days before the clinic administrative censoring date, and 51 (1.6%) patients because of missing sex data. We included the first CD4 count on record, which was taken within 90 days of first contact with the HIV clinic in 68% of patients who never received ART and was taken before or at ART start in 67% of patients who received ART. In 6% of patients receiving ART, the first recorded CD4 count was taken after ART start, while for the rest of the patients (12%) CD4 count data was not available. 
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides summary statistics of the study population, comparing 1069 females (34%) and 2095 males (66%). Females were slightly younger, more often widowed, divorced, or separated, and more likely to be unemployed. More males had received ART and fewer females had been treated for TB prior to entry. Fewer females had first CD4 count â‰¤ 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and hepatitis C co-infection. All differences were consistent when we only compared patients who received ART at the clinic, and all differences were statistically significant (p &lt;0.05).
