<p>A total of 3215 patients were included in follow-up. ART was initiated in 1900 (59%) patients. Among 1868 ART-na√Øve patients, 608 (33%) never started ART, mostly because they either did not return (n = 540) or died (n = 68). Among 696 ART-experienced patients, 133 (19%) did not continue or re-initiate ART. The total follow-up amounted to 8430 person-years and total follow-up on-ART was 4632 person-years. Throughout the study period, 473 patients (15%) were transferred to another facility and thus censored.</p>
