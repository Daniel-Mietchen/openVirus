<p>We applied multiple Cox regression to adjust for sociodemographic and clinical variables that influenced treatment outcomes according to the literature [

 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. All variables were made categorical. The sociodemographic variables considered were age (15–24; 25–39; 40–69), marital status at baseline (single; married; divorced/widowed/separated), home address (Bandung; Greater Bandung; other), education (non-completed basic = finishing only 6 years of schooling or no schooling; basic = finishing 9 years of schooling at elementary and junior secondary schools; secondary = 12 years of schooling up to high school; tertiary = any education beyond high school [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]), and occupation (any type of work; home maker or student; none). The clinical variables considered were ART prior to entry (yes; no), first recorded CD4 count (&gt; 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; &lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection (no; yes), TB treatment history (never had TB treatment; ongoing; past treatment–completed; past treatment–incomplete), anemia (no; yes). All the blood sample measurement results taken for this analysis were the earliest one on record. Anemia was included as a proxy measure for overall health [

We ran four different models: Model 1 included sex and age as covariates; Model 2 included all sociodemographic variables; Model 3 included sex and clinical variables; and Model 4 included all variables. Regressions were done after imputing missing data with multiple imputation using the R mice (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) package [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In all four models we performed 1000 imputations with 20 iterations for each imputation and set the seed to provide reproducible results with a random number generated using
