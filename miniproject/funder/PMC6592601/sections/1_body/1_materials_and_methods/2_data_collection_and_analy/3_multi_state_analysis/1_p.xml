 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218781.g001">Fig 1</xref> summarizes the multi-state model used in this analysis. All patients started in either the 
 <italic>HIV</italic> state (i.e., clinical enrollment with HIV but not on ART) or directly in the ART state. From the 
 <italic>HIV</italic> state, individuals can move to 
 <italic>ART</italic>, 
 <italic>LTFU</italic>, or 
 <italic>Death</italic> states. 
 <italic>LTFU</italic> and 
 <italic>Death</italic> are absorbing states (i.e., final states). There are five possible transitions, each with a distinct hazard function that must be modeled. We used a competing hazards model since more than one transition can occur out of the 
 <italic>HIV</italic> and 
 <italic>ART</italic> states. Confirmation of death was obtained from family or community organization reports or by telephone calls conducted by the clinic [
 <xref rid="pone.0218781.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Patients were censored at their end date provided in the clinic’s Access database if their associated last state was ‘Transferred’ or if they had not reached an absorbing state at the administrative censoring date. For the multi-state analysis, we further censored patients who (a) had a final status that was neither ‘Dead’ nor ‘Transferred’ and (b) had a final status date less than 180 days before the administrative censoring date. The latter censoring was conducted in order to count the hazard ratio only of patients whose probability for LTFU was observable in the analysis based on our definition of LTFU.
