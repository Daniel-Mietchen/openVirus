<p>As per routine care, the clinic collects a set of baseline data at the time of enrollment that includes information on health status, HIV transmission risk behavior, and socioeconomic indicators. Regardless of ART status, regular follow-up interviews on risk behavior and reassessment of ART eligibility in patients not yet on ART are planned at 6-month intervals following baseline data collection. Patients receiving ART are expected to come every 30 days to collect their medication, unless they have a special agreement with the attending physician as explained below. Informed consent for research was obtained from patients at the baseline interview and for patients under 18 years of age, with written assent from a parent/guardian.</p>
