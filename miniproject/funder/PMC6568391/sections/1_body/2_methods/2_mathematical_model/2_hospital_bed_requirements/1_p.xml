<p>We estimate the number of hospital beds in Sydney using data published for 2015–2016 in NSW [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In NSW for 2015–2016 there were 21152 beds available from public hospitals (2.78 per 1000 population) and 8184 beds available from private hospitals (1.07 per 1000 population). This was resized for the Sydney population. The number of hospital beds needed for case isolation was then modelled under different scenarios based on variation of response time (T), the percentage of infected cases isolated each day and how many contacts were traced. We tested if the number of available hospital beds in Sydney will be enough to isolate up to 95% of all new infected cases every day, under different scenarios.
