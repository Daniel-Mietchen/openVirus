<p>The clinical health workforce was estimated by the number of HCWs in Sydney for 2016/2017, including Aboriginal and TSI health practitioners, Chinese medicine practitioners, dental practitioners, medical practitioners, radiation therapists, nurses and midwives, occupational therapists, pharmacists and ambulance services workers [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The total estimated health workforce number was 147997 for NSW, with a total population of 7.7 million in 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We applied the same percentage adjusted for the Sydney population from the same year, 5.25 million [

 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We estimated, based on epidemic size and duration, the amount of respiratory PPE (N95 respirators) required for Sydney clinical HCWs assuming two respirators per shift per HCW. This is based on recommendations that disposable respirators should not be re-used, and the fact that a standard shift for a HCW would include at least one break, after which a new respirator would need to be used.
