<p>In the base case, we assumed 90% of contacts would be traced and 95% infectious people would be isolated. We used age specific contacts rates, with an average of 11 contacts per case based on European social mixing data [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We estimated the number of public health workers required to conduct contact tracing under different scenarios. Given contact tracing may require complex communications and travel over large geographic distances, we assumed one public health officer could trace 10 contacts per day. Australian guidelines for management of smallpox state that isolation is needed for non-immune Category A (high risk) contacts, in individual rooms with supervision by vaccinated staff [

 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] as well as estimated social contact matrices suggest one person [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], on average, has 9–11 contacts at reasonable risk of infection. The closest of these contacts would include household contacts (about 3–4 people), plus 1–2 others in work or friendship circles. This would be about half of the 9–11 contacts. The number of contacts needed to be traced and managed was estimated based on attack size, time to response (T) and the percentage of infected cases isolated each day. A contact tracing day was defined as one day entirely spent tracing contacts per public health worker.
