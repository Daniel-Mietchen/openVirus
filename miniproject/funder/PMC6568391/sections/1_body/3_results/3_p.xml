<p>The higher the initial number infected, the more rapid and severe the epidemic. Without intervention, the death rate will reach an incidence (number of new infected people per day) rate of 8 deaths per 1000 population per day. The overall reproductive number was estimated to be 4.6. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217704.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the influence on infections and deaths by varying time to response and case isolation rates. Both timing and isolation rates of infected cases are highly influential in outbreak control. With 100 infected initially, when isolation decreases, the deaths increase from a maximum of 2, 4 and 9 per day in the best scenario with 95% isolation (for T = 15,20 and 30 respectively), to 3.5, 5.5 and 12 per day with only 50% of cases isolated (
