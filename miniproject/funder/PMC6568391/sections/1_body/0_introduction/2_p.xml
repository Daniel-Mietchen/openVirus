<p>The requirements for physical isolation space and surge capacity, as well as clinical health care workers (HCWs) to treat patients, must be considered in planning. In addition, an often-overlooked consideration is public health workers [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], who are required to conduct contact tracing and vaccination and monitor high and lower risk primary contacts to prevent secondary cases. Health systems capacity depends on both clinical acute care and public health personnel, hospital bed capacity, as well as protection of HCWs, who are often at high risk of nosocomial infections during serious epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies of smallpox re-emergence often assume health systems to be functioning and investigate only the role of vaccination on epidemic control [

 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is a need to determine requirements for surge capacity within health systems in the event of re-emergent smallpox.
