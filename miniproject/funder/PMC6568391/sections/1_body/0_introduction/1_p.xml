 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and is a high-consequence event for which preparedness planning is needed [
 <xref rid="pone.0217704.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Due to ageing, advances in medical therapies, transplantation and people living with immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV, the immunological status of the population has also changed dramatically since eradication of smallpox, with almost one in five people living with immunosuppression in Sydney, Australia [
