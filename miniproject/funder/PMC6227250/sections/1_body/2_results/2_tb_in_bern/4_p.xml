<p id="par0085">Assuming a model without an exposed phase (BDSKY) we estimate an initial high effective reproduction number R
 <sub>e</sub> of 4.9 (median, 95% HPD: 2.6–8.1). Around 1991, it declined drastically, staying below the epidemic threshold 1 for the rest of the sampling period (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The recovery rate δ is estimated to be 0.2 (median), suggesting an infected period of 5 years. The sampling proportion does not deviate from its prior distribution and is hence estimated at 90%. We estimate that the data set contains one sampled ancestor (95% HPD, 0–4), with infected individuals being removed upon sampling with 98% probability (95% HPD, 90–100%). The mean substitution rate is estimated to be 0.55 SNPs per genome per year (95% HPD, 0.32-0.86).
