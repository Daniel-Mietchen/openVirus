<p id="par0020">Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of clinical 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> isolates is performed retrospectively and allows to confirm/refute suspected epidemiological links to identify individuals contributing to transmission, and explore drug-resistance and/or compensatory mechanisms which emerged during anti-tuberculosis treatment (

Although WGS analysis has the potential to reveal more complex epidemiological dynamics such as how long the outbreak was not controlled, the time patients are infectious for, the proportion of sampled cases, and the transmission potential of different strains, these epidemiological parameters are rarely estimated for slowly evolving bacterial pathogens such as 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (
