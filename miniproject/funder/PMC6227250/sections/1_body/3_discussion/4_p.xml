<p id="par0125">There is much uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters estimated from the WTK outbreak. The WTK data set has roughly half the number of samples and a much lower sampling proportion of 9% (median estimate). Furthermore, although the outbreak started in Thailand, our WTK data set consists entirely of cases imported into California. This sparse outbreak sample does not contain much information regarding the age of the outbreak, resulting in much uncertainty in the epidemiological estimates. Previous studies focussing on viral phylodynamics have shown that robust phylodynamic reconstruction is possible even when sampling proportions are low (
