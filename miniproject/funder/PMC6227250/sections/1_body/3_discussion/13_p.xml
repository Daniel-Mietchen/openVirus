<p id="par0170">Our study shows that phylodynamic analysis of WGS data can shed light on the temporal dynamics of tuberculosis outbreaks. Analysis of the Bernese outbreak has revealed that even when there is little temporal signal, we can robustly estimate epidemiological parameters if the sampling proportion is large. Conversely, in the WTK outbreak there is much uncertainty in the epidemiological parameter estimates despite a moderate temporal signal. This may be due to a difference in transmission dynamics in Thailand versus California as well as the fact that the epidemic peak likely occurred before the first samples were taken.</p>
