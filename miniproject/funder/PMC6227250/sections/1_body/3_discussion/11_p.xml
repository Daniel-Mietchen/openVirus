<p id="par0160">Hence, this difference in the estimated infectious period for the Bernese outbreak and the WTK outbreak is expected and supports our phylodynamic approach. More generally, a long infectious period is characteristic for a chronic disease like tuberculosis, particularly considering the difficulties in diagnosing the disease and the long delays in health seeking and treatment initiation (
