  <p>Putative phenotypic effects of phase-variable changes in the pilin glycosylation module. The longitudinal changes in the proportions of carriage isolates associated with the putative glycan structures of each phasotype are shown. The four-gene phasotype represents the expression states of the 
   <italic>pglA</italic>, 
   <italic>pglI</italic>, 
   <italic>pglE</italic>, and 
   <italic>pglH</italic> genes, the products of which are responsible for the addition of the first galactose, an acetyl group, a second galactose, and a glucose moiety, respectively, to the basal sugar. Addition of the second galactose by PglE requires prior addition of the first galactose by PglA, while PglH competes with PglA for addition of glucose to the same acceptor position. The basal sugar, GATDH or DATDH, is determined by PglB2 or PglB, respectively, and differs among clonal complexes. The percentage values were calculated by determining the number of isolates across multiple carriers with a specific phasotype and dividing by the total number of analyzed isolates for each time point. Boxes are colored according to the heat map shown by the bar between the lower panels and ranges from white (0% of isolates) to bright red (100% of isolates). Note that the cc60 and cc32 meningococci lacked the 
   <italic>pglH</italic> gene, resulting in a three-gene phasotype for these lineages. The total numbers of isolates analyzed for each clonal complex for the four time points were as follows: cc174 (48, 40, 37, 24); cc167 (14, 14, 18, 6); cc23 (6, 24, 18, 18); cc60 (30, 30, 12, 6); and cc32 (6, 6, 6, 1).
