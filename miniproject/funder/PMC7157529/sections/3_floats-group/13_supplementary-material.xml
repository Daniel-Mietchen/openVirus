 <p>Western blot to determine the expression states of a subset of persistent carriage isolates. Whole-cell lysates were prepared from 15 meningococcal isolates obtained as part of this study. Lysates were subject to separation on a PAGE gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. These membranes were probed with monoclonal antibodies specific for a range of different glycan extensions. Download
