  <p>High-level temporal and spatial allelic variation in the meningococcal PilE protein deduced from 
   <italic>pilE</italic> genes. An alignment of the amino acid sequences of the PilE protein for 24 isolates from carrier V222 are shown. Sequences were derived by Sanger sequencing of PCR products spanning the 
   <italic>pilE</italic> gene. Isolates were derived from four different time points representing up to 6 months of carriage, with 6 isolates per time point (
