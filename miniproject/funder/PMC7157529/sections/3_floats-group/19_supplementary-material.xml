 <p>This file contains lists of the phase variation and GeneScan data for all isolates for pilin modulation, pilin glycosylation, restriction modification, and Opa modules of phase-variable genes. The following information is listed for every gene for each isolate: size of PCR product as determined by GeneScan, derived repeat number (as determined from GeneScan relative to a product of known repeat number), and derived expression state (as determined from a bioinformatics analysis of the open reading frame or relative to other isolates of known expression state). Two additional items of information are provided for the Opa genes: size of G tract and size of A tract (these two tracts are adjacent to the repetitive sequence and influence the expression state).
