 <p>Allelic variation in the derived PilE amino acid sequences of multiple meningococcal isolates from a single carrier. The 
  <italic>pilE</italic> gene was amplified from 19 meningococcal carriage isolates obtained from volunteer V117. The isolates were obtained at the first (2, N117), second (6, N284), third (5, N332), and fourth (6, N417) time points and represent initial, 1, 3, and 6 months persistent carriage. Gene sequences were translated and aligned using Clustal Omega. Download
