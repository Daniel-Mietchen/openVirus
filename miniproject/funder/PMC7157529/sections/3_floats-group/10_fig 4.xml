  <p>Combinatorial changes in PV modules during persistent meningococcal carriage. Repeat numbers were derived for each phase-variable gene by fragment analysis of PCR products spanning the relevant repeat tract. Expression states were derived from the repeat numbers and associations between repeat number and translational state (“on” and “off” coded as 1 and 0, respectively). Individual phasotypic scores for the initial and final point of observed carriage for each carrier were derived from analysis of ∼6 isolates per time point. Average phasotypic scores and standard deviations were derived from the following numbers of carriers for each clonal complex: 8, cc174; 3, cc167: 4, cc23; 5, cc60; and 1, cc32. Statistical differences between the initial and final times were determined using a Wilcoxon rank sum test in Prism. The PV modules consisted of the following genes: (A) pilin modulation, 
   <italic>pilC1</italic> and 
   <italic>pilC2</italic>; (B) pilin glycosylation, 
   <italic>pglA</italic>, 
   <italic>pglE</italic>, 
   <italic>pglH</italic>, and 
   <italic>pglI</italic>; (C) LOS, 
   <italic>lgtG</italic> and 
   <italic>NMB1255</italic>; (D) restriction modification, 
   <italic>modA</italic> and 
   <italic>modB</italic>. Note that the maximum phasotypic score occurs when all genes within a module are in an “on” state (thus a module of four phase-variable genes has a maximum score of 4).
