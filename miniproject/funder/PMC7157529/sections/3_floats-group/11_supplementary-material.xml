 <p>Phasotypes for the pilin modulation module. (A) Proportions of isolates containing different combinations of expression of the 
  <italic>pilC1</italic> and 
  <italic>pilC2</italic> phase-variable genes (1 and 0 indicate “on” and “off” states, respectively). Percentages were calculated from total number of isolates analyzed at each time point: cc174, 47, 39, 37, 23; cc167, 14, 18, 18, 6; cc23, 6, 24, 18, 18; cc60, 30, 30, 12, 6; cc32, 6, 6, 6, 6. (B) Change in expression for 
  <italic>pilC1</italic> and 
  <italic>pilC2</italic> in each carrier between the initial and final time point. Values of 1 and 0, all observed isolates in “on” or “off” state, respectively. (C) Shannon diversity scores. Diversity scores were calculated from the combined expression scores of the 
  <italic>pilC1</italic> and 
  <italic>pilC2</italic> genes for multiple isolates per time point; 1, all isolates were different from each other; 0, all isolates had the same score. Download
