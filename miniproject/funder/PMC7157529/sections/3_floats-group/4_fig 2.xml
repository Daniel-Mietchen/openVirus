  <p>Whole-genome variation during persistent carriage. Allelic variation in coding regions was derived from the whole-genome sequences of 12 to 39 isolates per carrier for six carriers. The distribution of the allelic variation and relatedness of isolates was visualized using GrapeTree and manual manipulation of branch positions. Isolates are color coded for time point of isolation (

The clonal complexes of isolates were either cc174 (V51 and V59) or cc23 (V69, V93, V96, and V222).
