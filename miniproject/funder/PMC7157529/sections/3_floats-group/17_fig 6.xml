  <p>Directional and opposing PV of Opa proteins during longitudinal meningococcal carriage. The expression states of the Opa proteins were derived from analyses of gene sequences and pentanucleotide repeat numbers for all four loci of each isolate. (A) Percentages of 392 isolates from 19 carriers that had an “on” expression state in none (“off”) to one or more loci. (B) Average phasotypic scores for the Opa module for the initial and final time points of observed carriage for these carriers (note that the maximum score is 4; error bars are standard deviations). (C) Change in phasotypic scores for individual 
   <italic>opa</italic> genes across multiple carriers for loci starting with a high level of isolates in either an “on” or “off” state. Loci were split by the overall expression state in the initial time point for each carrier into three categories: (i) 50% or more of isolates in the “on” state (Opa-high, 24 loci) (top); (ii) &lt;50% of isolates in the “on” state (Opa-low, black line/open circles, 52 loci) (bottom); (iii) &lt;50% of isolates in the “on” state but excluding carriers where there was no change in expression between the initial and final time points (Opa-low, dotted line/open squares, 21 loci). (D and E) Changes in expression of individual Opa loci for multiple time points of two carriers. Phasotypic scores are the averages from multiple isolates per time point. Blue line, OpaA; orange line, OpaB; green line, OpaD; yellow line, OpaJ.
