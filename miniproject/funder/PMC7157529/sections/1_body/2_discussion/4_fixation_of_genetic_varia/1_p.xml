<p>Fixed genetic variation is an indicator of selection. We estimated the extent of fixed functional variation during persistent carriage by focusing on nonsynonymous genic variation and PV. Events classified as putative or potential fixation (see Results for a definition) from this study were combined with those of Alamro et al. on scOMP PV (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We detected a total of 140 fixed events for the 19 carriers wherein all four modes of genetic variation were examined (71 PVs, 11 antigenic PilE variations, 7 indels, 29 single-nucleotide variants, 22 HGTs). All PV data were derived from analyses of multiple colonies while only 53% (31/58) of the indel/mutation/HGT class and 18% of the PilE variation was from multiple colonies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> shows the distribution of genetic events across these 19 carriers plus 6 carriers where only mutation and HGT were examined. Nine carriers exhibited ≤4 events, while the maximum is 23 (4 PVs and 19 HGTs) for V54 (where fixation has not been thoroughly tested) or 12 (5 LHs, 1 indel, and 6 mutations) for V96 and 12 (4 LHs, 3 HGTs) for V222 (where fixation was examined in detail). Overall, we detected an average of 7 genetic events/carrier (note that one recombination event affects multiple genes) with no difference between long- and short-term carriage. These results indicate that meningococcal populations can persist in their hosts with a minimal amount of adaption and that host persistence
