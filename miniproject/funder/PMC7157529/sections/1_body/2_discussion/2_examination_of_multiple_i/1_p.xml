<p>Meningococcal epidemiology has focused on measuring genetic variation over periods of months and years. However, this variation arises from processes occurring in individual carriers, which is poorly characterized. Recent studies by Pandey et al. (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and Borud et al. (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) detected evidence of transient and fixed genetic variants during persistent neisserial carriage but were limited by having only one isolate per time point. Using samples from a 2008–2009 meningococcal carriage study wherein nasopharyngeal swabs were deliberately plated to yield multiple single colonies (see Alamro et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]), we performed both WGS and allele-specific PCR on 6 to 10 isolates/time point from multiple sequential time points from several volunteers. We found that genetic variants can be classified into one of four classes (sporadic, transient, putative fixation, and potential fixation) and that WGS of four isolates/time point differentiates sporadic from transient/fixed variants. Furthermore, transient variants were separable from fixed variants with three time points, while detection of fixation was enhanced by four time points. Thus, we recommend collection of ≥4 isolates for each of ≥4 time points for future longitudinal carriage studies.
