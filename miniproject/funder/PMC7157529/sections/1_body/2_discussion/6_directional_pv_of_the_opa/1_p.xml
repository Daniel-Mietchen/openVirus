<p>A key observation was for switching between antigenically divergent Opa alleles during persistent carriage combined with continuous expression of one or more Opa proteins. This result indicates that both maintenance of Opa adhesive functions and antigenic variation are required for persistence on mucosal surfaces. Previously, high turnover of gonococcal Opa variants was observed in experimental human challenge experiments, but without clear evidence of directional switching other than selection against Opa variants with specificity for CEACAM3, the neutrophil decoy receptor (

Our findings suggest that variant-specific antibody responses are frequently elicited during carriage and drive PV-mediated loss of expression of initially dominant Opa variants. Similarly, the PilC proteins modulate meningococcal adhesive properties, with evidence for differential binding of PilC1- and PilC2-expressing variants to different eukaryotic cell types (

Our finding of frequent switches from PilC1 to PilC2 expression during persistent carriage suggests that the tissue tropism alters during persistent carriage. This process may be driven by immune responses to PilC1 or adaptation to other alterations in the microenvironment. Finally, we observed limited PV of the RM systems, suggesting that selection for alterations in expression of phasevarions, as controlled by PV of RM-mediated methylation (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), is infrequent during persistent carriage. These observations are consistent with the idea that PV acts to maintain a range of adhesive functions while enabling frequent antigenic variation and hence a high potential for evasion of antigen-specific antibody responses.
