<p>While meningococcal mutation rates are low, high rates of turnover of colonizing populations are expected to provide ample time for mutation. Excluding SSR, our WGS analysis indicated an average of 1.02 mutations/genome/month of carriage (i.e., 6.1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> mutations/site/year). Comparable rates were obtained by Lamelas et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) for serogroup A meningococci (3.1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> substitutions/site/year), from analysis of 100 isolates representing an 8-year study in a single Ghanaian district, and Pandey et al. (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) for 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Neisseria lactamica</named-content> (2.2 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>; 27 volunteers) and 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> (9.3 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup>; 7 volunteers), using longitudinal isolates from a volunteer study. Meningococcal mutation rates for rifampin resistance are 2.6 × 10
 <sup>−9</sup> mutations/division (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), equivalent to 2.2 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mutations/site/year. The 4-fold differences between these rates suggests that stabilizing selection limits mutation accumulation. However, we observed that nonsynonymous mutations exceeded synonymous mutations. This indicates that stabilizing selection is weak over short periods of persistent carriage and that nonselective bottlenecks, due to expansion after nonspecific physical reductions in population size, could be a key factor in limiting accumulation of variation.
