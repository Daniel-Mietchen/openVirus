<p>HGT is a major driver of genetic variation in meningococcal populations. We found HGT in 16% of carriers, with 36 recombination events encompassing 51% of all nonhypermutable variable genes. This observation provides definitive evidence from individual infections that natural transformation between two phylogenetically divergent strains generates a high proportion of genetic variation in this bacterial species. This estimate of HGT may be low, as we avoided the 36% of carriers from the 2008â€“2009 study in which sequential carriage of divergent isolates was detected (
