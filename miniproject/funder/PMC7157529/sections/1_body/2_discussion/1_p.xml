<p>Mutators, genetic exchange, and LH have evolved in several bacterial species in response to specific pressures encountered during persistence in or transmission between host organisms (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). To examine the relative contributions of different mutational processes to asymptomatic carriage, we analyzed genetic variation in multiple meningococcal isolates obtained from persistently colonized asymptomatic carriers. Samples were from a University of Nottingham carriage study and hence are representative of natural carriage of this species in the age group that is associated with the highest rates of asymptomatic carriage. Our sampling was performed ∼6 weeks after the start of the university term, such that most of the carriers were likely to have acquired carriage within that time period (note that carriers V69, V93, and V96 were negative for carriage at time point one) and have developed or were developing an immune response to surface antigens (see Alamro et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for data on the immune responses and further discussion of acquisition times). Thus, our study is likely to be representative of the adaptive events that occur a few days after initial colonization of carriers by meningococci and, more importantly, when these organisms are subject to adaptive immune responses.
