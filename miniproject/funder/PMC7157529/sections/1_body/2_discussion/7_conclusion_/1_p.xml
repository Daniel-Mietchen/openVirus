<p>We have demonstrated that HGT and LH are the major drivers of within-host adaptive evolution during natural carriage of a bacterial organism. Conversely 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutations were infrequent and may only contribute significant effects on longer evolutionary timescales. Future studies are required to ascertain the phenotypic effects of observed genetic variation and to correlate these effects with variations in the host niche, including antigen-specific antibody responses. Our study provides a strong baseline for understanding how within-host genetic variation contributes to the evolution of a bacterial commensal pathogen and to the selective pressures driving evolution of HGT and LH.
