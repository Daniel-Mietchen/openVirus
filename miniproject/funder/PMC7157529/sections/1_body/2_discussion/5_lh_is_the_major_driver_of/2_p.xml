<p>Another important observation is that 69% of fixed events (96/140; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001 assuming 8.5% [180] genes in a genome of 2,127 genes affect the outer membrane) affect the outer membrane, with 6 carriers having fixed variation only in outer membrane-associated genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). While PV was the major driver of this variation, high variability in OMPs was also observed for non-PV indels and HGT, suggesting that the strong diversifying selection acting on these surface antigens requires significant alterations to an epitope as opposed to single amino acid alterations. Comparable hot spots of recombination and variation in capsule biosynthesis, pilin-associated,
