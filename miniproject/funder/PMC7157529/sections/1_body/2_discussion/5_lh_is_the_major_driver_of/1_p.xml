 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">FigureÂ 7</xref> also depicts the relative contributions of the four mechanisms to within-host fixed genetic variation. Seven carriers exhibited variation only by LH or an indel. The average contribution of LH (i.e., PV plus PilE antigenic variation) to fixed genetic variation in each of the 19 carriers was 69% and across all carriers was 59% (82/140;

These results highlight the critical contribution of LH to within host adaptation.
