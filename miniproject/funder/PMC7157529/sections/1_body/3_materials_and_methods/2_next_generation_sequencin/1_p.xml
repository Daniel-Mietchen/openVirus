<p>Genomic DNA was extracted according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions with either the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) or the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit (Promega). Index-tagged Illumina sequencing libraries were generated, multiplexed, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 machines to generate paired end sequences. Short sequence reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic v0.32 (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) and assembled with SPAdes v3.9.0 (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).
