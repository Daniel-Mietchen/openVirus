<p>The

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) was used to analyze 1,605 loci for allelic variation. After removal of incomplete loci, phylogenetic networks were derived from allelic variation and visualized using GrapeTree (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Variable loci were also aligned with Clustal Omega (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and compared manually. Variability was classified as follows: point mutation, a single nucleotide substitution in a gene; indel, presence or absence of a single or contiguous base pairs within a gene; recombination (either gene conversion or HGT), multiple substitutions (&gt;1) or indels within a gene. Recombination patches were detected by extracting and aligning recombinant allelic sequences for a specific gene of a pair of isolates along with the flanking sequences using tools within BIGSdb. A BLAST analysis was performed with the recombinant allele against subsets of isolates in BIGSdb (e.g., other isolates from the same carrier, all isolates collected in the 2008â€“2009 carriage study or all UK isolates of the same clonal complex with similar isolation times). The gene and flanking sequences were extracted from the genomes of putative donor isolates with the highest match (usually between 95% and 100% similarity). The contiguous sequences of each pair of recombinant alleles and, where possible, the donor genomes were aligned in order to detect the putative start and end points for intergenic recombination. This process was iterative, with flanking sequences being extracted and aligned until the donor sequence no longer matched the recombinant sequence.
