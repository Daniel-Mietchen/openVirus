<p>Meningococcal isolates were grown overnight on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar with 5% horse blood at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Lysates were prepared from colonies by heating suspensions at 65°C for 15 min in SDS sample loading buffer. Gel electrophoresis of bacterial cell lysates (50 μg) was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels before transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Glycan-specific monoclonal antibodies (npg1, npg2, and npg3) or a polyclonal antiserum (pDAb2) followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody or an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) lectin were used to detect specific protein glycosylation states (
