<p>Each SSR was subject to PCR amplification and sequencing using specific primers. Amplicons produced using fluorescently labeled primers were subject to GeneScan fragment size analysis on an ABI3730 autosequencer and compared to either GeneScan 500LIZ or GeneScan 600LIZ size standards (Applied Biosystems). Product sizes were analyzed using PeakScanner v1.0 (Applied Biosystems) and compared to controls of known size. A subset of SSRs were analyzed by dideoxy sequencing and alignment with BioEdit (v7.2.5) to confirm repeat numbers. Two or more labeled products were produced when SSRs contained ≥9 mononucleotide repeats due to slippage during PCR amplification. If the ratio of the areas of the primary and secondary peaks was ≥1.2, then repeat number was determined from the primary peak; if &lt;1.2, then the sample was either reported as mixed or, when occurring across multiple samples, the larger peak was selected as the determinant of repeat number.</p>
