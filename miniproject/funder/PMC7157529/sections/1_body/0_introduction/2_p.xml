<p>Multiple repetitive sequences and high levels of genetic variability are notable attributes of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Neisseria meningitidis</named-content> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In many high-income countries, asymptomatic carriage of this species in the upper respiratory tract is prevalent in adolescents, with a peak at 19 years of age and rates of 30% to 60% in some subpopulations (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Disease rates are low (∼1 case/100,000), with infections mainly occurring in infants, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where attack rates during epidemics can reach 1 case/1,000. Lengths of host persistence of particular meningococcal clones range from a few weeks to &gt;12 months (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Natural transformation, facilitated by a 
 <italic>Neisseria</italic>-specific 12-mer DNA uptake sequence (DUS), is the major determinant of interlocus or genome variation by HGT and is estimated to exceed 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation by ∼10-fold (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The ∼2-Mbp genomes of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> contain ∼1 DUS/1,000 nucleotides but are also replete with other repetitive elements and multicopy genes (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The latter includes four 
 <italic>opa</italic> genes that are dispersed around the genome and loci containing arrays of complete and partial 
 <italic>maf</italic> genes. The type IV pilus exemplifies a recombinatorial mechanism of LH with a G quadraduplex initiating high frequencies of recombination (gene conversion) between 
 <italic>pilE</italic>, the expression locus for the major pilin, and multiple silent 
 <italic>pilS</italic> genes encoding partial copies of this protein (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Simple sequence repeats (SSR) are also highly prevalent in meningococcal genomes, with an average of 45 tracts per genome (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). These tracts are hypermutable due to a high propensity for slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication and mediate changes in gene expression due to the SSRs being located in the reading frames or promoters of genes (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This process, referred to as phase variation (PV), can generate high levels of genetic variation through combinatorial switches in the expression of multiple genes. Thus, 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> has multiple mechanisms for rapid generation of genetic variation that are thought to support the adaptation and evolution of meningococci during within-host persistence of individual clones.
