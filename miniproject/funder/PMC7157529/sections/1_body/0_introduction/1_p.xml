<p>Persistence of colonizing organisms for extended periods in individual hosts perpetuates transmission and contributes to the spread of a diverse spectrum of protozoan, prokaryotic, and viral pathogens and commensals (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Persistence is antagonized by innate and adaptive immune responses of the host, causing frequent reductions in population size of the persisting population, and can lead to evasion of immune responses by rapid evolution of adaptive variants (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Reductions in population size due to nonselective bottlenecks or selection of fitness variants depletes the persisting population of genetic variation and reduces the capacity to respond to further selective pressures. This restricted genetic diversity is counteracted by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and localized hypermutation (LH), a descriptor of evolved mechanisms for rapid generation of genetic variation such as site-specific recombination, homologous recombination between multicopy allelic sequences, and simple sequence repeats (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Understanding the relative contributions of these processes to “within-host” evolution is important for discerning the key host-pathogen interactions that facilitate host persistence of bacterial pathogens and immune evasion.
