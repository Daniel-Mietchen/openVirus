<p>Herd immunity increases the protection and cost effectiveness of meningococcal immunization programs by reducing circulation of disease-causing strains. Recent introduction of a conjugate MenACWY vaccine into UK teenagers and university entrants aims at reducing infections by cutting circulation of hyperinvasive MenW strains (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). To investigate the potential for within-host strain evolution, we have studied 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation, recombination (gene conversion and HGT), and LH of meningococci during persistent meningococcal carriage in university students. This exploration of natural carriage provides the first comprehensive evidence that LH is the major driver of within-host evolution of this bacterial species and that directional genetic variation is biased toward genes affecting surface antigens.
