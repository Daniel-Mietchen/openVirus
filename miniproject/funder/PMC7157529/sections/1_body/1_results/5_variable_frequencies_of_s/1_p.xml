<p>Previous analyses had detected frequent PV of eight single-copy (sc) phase-variable OMPs (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). These studies were extended to another 14 phase-variable genes in five PV modules whose PV is controlled by SSRs located within the reading frame (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">TableÂ 4</xref>). These phase-variable genes were selected as major components of the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> core phasome (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and as genes with a known or high propensity to undergo PV (i.e., we excluded genes with only 3 to 4 repeats). The colocated 
 <italic>lgt</italic> genes (e.g., 
 <italic>lgtA</italic>, 
 <italic>lgtB</italic>, etc. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) were not analyzed due to problems with designing repeat-specific primers for these highly homologous genes.
