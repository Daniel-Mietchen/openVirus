<p>For the LOS PV module, we focused on two genes, 
 <italic>lgtG</italic> and 
 <italic>NMB1255</italic>. Repeat tracts ranged between 7 and 16 for these genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data File S1</xref>). The cc23 and cc60 isolates exhibited higher levels of “on” expression states than other isolates (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref>). A significant decrease in “on” expression states of these genes in cc174 and cc60 carriers is indicative of selection against certain immunotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). PV of 
 <italic>NMB1255</italic> was higher than for 
 <italic>lgtG</italic>, while diversity within time points was generally low, suggesting that these LOS epitopes are subject to infrequent but strongly selective shifts in expression (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6">Fig. S6</xref>).
