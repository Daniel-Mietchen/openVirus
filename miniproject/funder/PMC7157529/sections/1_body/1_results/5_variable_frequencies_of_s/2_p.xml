<p>The pilin modulation module consists of two highly homologous 
 <italic>pilC</italic> genes whose PV is mediated by poly(C) tracts located close to the ATG initiation codon (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and encode large 110-kDa proteins that modulate type IV pilus surface expression (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Using unique PCR primers for each 
 <italic>pilC</italic> gene, repeat numbers were found to range from 8 to 15 with a modular length of 10 for both genes (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data File S1</xref>), while the average mutation rate was 0.085 mutations/gene/month. Unexpectedly, some cc174 strains had a second poly(C) tract of 10 to 14 repeats located in the central portion of 
 <italic>pilC1</italic>. Following conversion of repeat numbers into predicted expression states, we observed that 62% and 24% of isolates express one or two PilC proteins, respectively, with a significant increase in expression during persistent carriage in cc174 isolates but stable or decreasing expression in other ccs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). An important trend was for switching toward PilC2-only expression states in four of the lineages as a function of persistent carriage (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). Notably, five carriers exhibited some degree of opposing switching of the two 
 <italic>pilC</italic> genes, while there was an overall switching rate of 31% for this module (i.e., 13/42 
 <italic>pilC</italic> genes exhibited an 80% to 100% switch in expression state) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>). Variation within many of the time points, as measured using a Shannon factor-based diversity score, was between 0.2 and 0.7, suggesting that these changes are due to a mix of random drift and selection (
