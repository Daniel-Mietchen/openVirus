<p>For the pilin glycosylation module, we analyzed four phase-variable genes (
 <italic>pglA</italic>, 
 <italic>pglE</italic>, 
 <italic>pglI</italic>, and 
 <italic>pglH</italic>) whose products vary glycans on the type IV pilus and other surface proteins between three different glycan extensions with and without acetylation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Initiating glycan residues were predicted to vary, as isolates have either a 
 <italic>pglB</italic> or 
 <italic>pglB2</italic> gene (see reference 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). PV is controlled by a heptanucleotide repeat in 
 <italic>pglE</italic> and by poly(G) tracts in the other genes. Phasotypes and linked phenotypes, derived from analysis of expression states, were confirmed for a subset of isolates by immunoblotting with glycan-specific antibodies (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). Comparative analyses indicated that all 16 possible phasotypes were detected in the eight carriers of cc174 isolates but only 2 to 7 phasotypes for the 13 carriers of cc23, cc167, cc60, and cc32 isolates, with the 1-1-0-0 and 1-1-0-1 phasotypes dominating in the early time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). This diversity in cc174 isolates was due to differences between carriers and time points, as diversity within individual time points was low (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref>). Persistent carriage was associated with differential patterns of behavior; combinatorial 
 <italic>pgl</italic> phasotypic scores exhibited significant increases in cc174 isolates but decreases in cc23 and cc60 isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). The cc174 phenotypic pattern was complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>); thus, Gal-Gal-containing phasotypes rose over the first 3 months from 12% to 42% before falling back to 8% after a further 3 months of carriage. This fall coincided with a switch to glycoforms lacking Gal moieties (0-1-0-0; 46% isolates) or having a Glu extension (0-1-1-1 and 0-1-0-1; 24%). An explanation of this pattern is that the diGal motif initially masks an antigenic epitope and then becomes the main antigenic target within this clonal complex. Notably, the Gal-Gal extension produced by the combined action of 
 <italic>pglA</italic> and 
 <italic>pglE</italic> (phasotypes 1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-0, 1-0-1-1, and 1-0-1-0) was rarely observed, occurring in 0% to 6% of isolates across the four time points for the cc167/cc23/cc60/cc32 isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). These findings suggest that there is selection against this extended glycan form in most carriers.
