<p>An unexpected finding for PV was of phase-variable restriction modification (RM) systems (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The cc174 isolates contained phase-variable 
 <italic>modA</italic> and 
 <italic>modB</italic> genes, while only the 
 <italic>modA</italic> gene of cc167 and cc23 isolates contained an SSR. Both tetra- and pentanucleotide SSRs were present and contained 3 to 37 repeats (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="dataS1">Data File S1</xref>). Phase-variable 
 <italic>mod</italic> genes were in “off” states in most isolates, with only cc174 isolates exhibiting a significant shift in expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, a complete shift in expression of four 
 <italic>mod</italic> genes (4/31 [13%]) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref>) is suggestive of strong but infrequent selection for switches in expression of these genes. Conversely, high levels of heterogeneity in expression states (i.e., a Shannon diversity score of &gt;0.4) were observed at multiple time points for several carriers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7">Fig. S7</xref>). Heterogeneity may arise due to selection for mixed populations or as result of high mutability in SSRs combined with nonspecific bottlenecks or mutational drift.
