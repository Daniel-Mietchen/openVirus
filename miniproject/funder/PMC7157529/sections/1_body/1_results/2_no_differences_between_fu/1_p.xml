<p>No significant differences were detected in nucleotide diversity for variable genes with nonsynonymous allelic variation among five broad functional groups (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material). There was a significant deviation in the numbers of variable membrane-associated genes for all carriers and for mutation-only carriers (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that the mutations were occurring by chance within genes of greater than the average length for this functional group. There was also a lower level of significance for mutation only for genes involved in DNA metabolism. A statistically significant association was detected for indels in genes with membrane-associated functions (8/17; 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.0001) with three carriers having identical 15-nucleotide deletions in 
 <italic>porB</italic>, encoding a major outer membrane protein (OMP). Many indels were large (9 to 33 bp), suggestive of evolved indel-susceptible sequences in these genes. No significant differences were detected in genic variability between short (1 to 3 months) versus long (&gt;3 months) persistent carriage; however, there was a significant difference for the four isolate pairs with putative HGT versus the other 21 strain pairs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref>), indicating that within-host HGT, but not host persistence 
 <italic>per se</italic>, is the main driver of allelic variation. A high proportion (39% [14/36]) of the HGT events were associated with allelic variation in genes encoding an OMP or a surface-modifying enzyme (e.g., pilin glycosyl transferase), indicating a bias in selection for fixation of HGT events involving modifiers of surface-exposed molecules.
