<p>WGS on multiple colonies for five other carriers detected similar levels of allelic variation, with two showing stable persistence of an identical core-genome genotype for 5 to 6 months of carriage and transient appearance of variants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). Two carriers (V96 and V222) exhibited evidence of directional changes in multiple genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">F</xref>). For V96, there was deletion of two genes (
 <italic>NEIS1464</italic> and 
 <italic>NEIS1469</italic>) encoding the lactoferrin binding protein combined with allelic changes in 
 <italic>pilF</italic>, followed by subsequent, concomitant single-nucleotide changes in five other genes with a variety of functions. In V222, there were three HGT events involving multiple genes, of which two were linked to variations in OMPs (i.e., OpaJ and TbpB, part of the transferrin binding protein). Allele-specific PCR on a further 12 variable genes for eight carriers (see

 <italic>n</italic> = 6) for either an intermediate or final time point. Examination of five putative HGT events in V128 indicated that only three were associated with sweeps for all isolates of the final time point. Finally, the 15-bp deletion in PorB produced near complete sweeps in all three carriers where this mutation was observed after 3 months of persistent carriage.
