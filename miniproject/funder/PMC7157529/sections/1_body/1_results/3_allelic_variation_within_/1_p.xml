<p>To examine within-time-point allelic variation, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 9 to 10 isolates/time point for carrier V59. Allelic variation was detected in 16 genes, of which seven occurred in only one isolate (see

A network diagram shows how partial sweeps of 90% (i.e., 9/10 colonies) were observed for variants in two genes (

 <italic>mutS</italic>) in the fourth time point and sweeps of 60 to 70% for three other genes in the third and fourth time points, while one genotype, or near-identical variant thereof, persisted across all 6 months of carriage (
