<p>These results indicated that allelic variation was split into four forms (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>): (i) sporadic, i.e., occurring in only 1 tested isolate of 6 or more, 43% (35/82 variable genes); (ii) transient, i.e., occurring at an intermediate time point or only in a subset of isolates, 17% (14/82); (iii) putative fixation, i.e., occurring in all isolates of the final observed time point, 27% (22/82); and (iv) potential fixation, i.e., the majority of isolates of the final two time points, 13% (11/82). Of the latter category, three encode OMPs (PorB, LbpA, and LbpB), four are on a recombination fragment associated with allelic variation of an Opa protein in strain V222, and another encodes a pilin modifier (PilF); thus, 73% (8/11) of the “fixed” variation causes alterations in surface molecules, suggesting that adaptive variation is focused on surface structures during persistent meningococcal carriage.
