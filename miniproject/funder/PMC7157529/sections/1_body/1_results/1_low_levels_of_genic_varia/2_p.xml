<p>We also observed a relatively high occurrence of HGT with three carriers (V82, V128, and V222) containing 93% (40/43) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of the variable genes with &gt;1 difference per coding region, suggesting that HGT between meningococci of different clonal complexes (ccs) occurred in 12% of carriers (3/25). The putative number of HGT events/carrier for V82, V128, and V222 ranges between 3 and 10 with an average recombination patch size of 2,905 bp (see

Another strain (N292.1, ST823, cc198) was isolated at an intermediate time point from carrier V128 and shown to be the donor for HGT into the cc167 isolates (N128.1 and N420.1) from this carrier (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60</ext-link>). For V82, all recombination fragments had 100% homology to sequences from N64.1 (present in carrier V64), indicating that a cocolonizing cc167 strain was the most likely donor strain to the cc1157/MenE strains of this carrier (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60</ext-link>). For V222, the recombination fragment carrying 
 <italic>tbp</italic> sequences had very high homology to sequences from cc23 isolates obtained from carriers in 2015 and 2016 or patients in 2011 and 2012 (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), whereas homologous sequences in other strains could not be found for the other fragments (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60</ext-link>). The average synonymous-to-nonsynonymous mutation (dS/dN) ratio for the genes with multiple allelic differences was 10.1, indicating that sequences transferred by HGT have been subject to purifying selection in the donor genomes.
