<p>Although asymptomatic carriage is the natural state for 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content>, there is a limited understanding of the levels of genetic variation associated with persistence in individual carriers. High-coverage genome sequences were generated using Illumina HiSeq for two isolates of the same strain from each of 25 carriers and representing 1 to 6 months asymptomatic carriage of a range of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">N. meningitidis</named-content> clonal complexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Allelic variation within the coding regions of single-copy genes was detected in an average of five variable genes per carrier with an average genic variation rate per month of carriage of 7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> (i.e., a meningococcus of ∼2,000 genes will accumulate 1.4 variable genes for each month of carriage) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only one difference (single nucleotide or indel) was detected in the majority of variable genes (69% [95/138]), suggestive of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the two isolates from carrier V54 contained one nucleotide allelic differences in 24 genes, indicative of multiple recombination events (estimated to between 19 and 24) with a highly homologous meningococcus. If carrier V54 is excluded, then the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> mutation rate is 1.02 mutations/genome/month of carriage, of which 19% was due to indels (18/94). These single nucleotide changes exhibited a 3:1 bias toward nonsynonymous changes, suggestive of either diversifying selection or insufficient time for purifying selection to remove mutations with reduced fitness.
