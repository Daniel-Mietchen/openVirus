<p>Intragenomic recombination in the multicopy 
 <italic>opa</italic> genes is presumed to occur by RecA-mediated recombination (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Genomic sequences were utilized to locate and derive specific primers for each 
 <italic>opa</italic> gene. Four Opa-containing loci (termed 
 <italic>opaA</italic>, 
 <italic>opaB</italic>, 
 <italic>opaD</italic>, and 
 <italic>opaJ</italic>, herein) (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">TableÂ 4</xref>) were found in every isolate, with multiple isolates having one or more identical Opa alleles (A. A. Al-Rubaiawi, unpublished data). Only one pair of 
 <italic>opa</italic> loci in one isolate had undergone intragenomic recombination (A. A. Al-Rubaiawi, unpublished), while another had undergone gene conversion (V222) (A. A. Al-Rubaiawi, unpublished).
