<p>Variation in the hypervariable 
 <italic>pilE</italic> gene was examined for multiple carriers by either bioinformatic comparisons of WGS data or sequencing of PCR products encompassing the 
 <italic>pilE</italic> gene. No allelic variation was observed in 
 <italic>pilE</italic> of cc174 isolates due to separation of the 
 <italic>pilE</italic> gene and G quartet into different genomic regions. All other strains exhibited allelic variation in 
 <italic>pilE</italic>, even after only 1 month of carriage (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of multiple isolates per time point from two carriers (V117 and V222) indicated that every time point contained multiple PilE alleles and that complete switches in the PilE type between two time points were frequent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2</xref>). These data clearly demonstrate that allelic variation of PilE occurs at very high frequencies during persistent meningococcal carriage, as previously observed for gonococcal infections (
