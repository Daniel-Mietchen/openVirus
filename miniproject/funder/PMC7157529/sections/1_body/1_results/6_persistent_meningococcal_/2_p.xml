<p>Genome sequence analysis and resequencing of each SSR/flanking sequence enabled association of repeat number to expression state and derivation of four-gene Opa phasotypes (see 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://leicester.figshare.com/s/24e2782f537d2c77af60</ext-link>). Variable patterns were detected between Opa alleles in a run of C and T residues located between the ATG and SSR plus insertion/deletion of a codon on either side of the repeat tract. Expression states for the phasotypes were confirmed by Western blotting using an Opa antiserum specific for a conserved domain (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8">Fig. S8</xref>). The phasotypes and individual gene expression states were examined for carriage-associated patterns. Expression of a single Opa was the dominant pattern occurring in 66% (260/392) of isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Contrastingly, only 16% of isolates did not express any Opa proteins, and no isolates exhibited expression of all four Opa proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>). Examination of phasotypic scores for four-gene Opa phasotypes indicated that expression of a single gene was maintained during persistent carriage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, there was significant switching from low to high and high to low average Opa expression states (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Furthermore, opposing switches in expression of individual Opa genes (i.e., “on” to “off” in one locus and “off” to “on” in another locus) were observed in 63% (12/19) of carriers. Two examples of opposing switching are for V222 wherein OpaJ switches “on” while OpaB switches “off” over 6 months carriage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>), whereas in V51 OpaA and OpaJ switch “off” while OpaB switches “on” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6E</xref>). These overall and individual PV patterns are indicative of immune selection against an Opa variant(s) expressed by initial colonizing isolates accompanied by selection for expression of alternate functionally equivalent Opa alleles in order to maintain an adhesion phenotype.
