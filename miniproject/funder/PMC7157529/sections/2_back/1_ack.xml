 <p>The work was conceived and planned by C.D.B., L.R.G., N.J.O., D.P.J.T., and M.C.J.M. Genome sequencing was facilitated by O.B.H. and M.C.J.M. Experimental work was performed by L.R.G. and A.A.A.-R. Bioinformatics was performed by M.A.R.M.A.-M., O.B.H., M.B., L.R.G., and C.D.B. The manuscript was written by C.D.B. and L.R.G. All authors commented on the final draft.</p>
