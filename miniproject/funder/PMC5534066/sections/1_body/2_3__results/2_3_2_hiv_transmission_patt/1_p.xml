<p>The phylodynamic analysis revealed strong evidence for asymmetric transmission rates between MSM and reproductive-aged females. In 2014, we estimate that 9.1% (95%CI, 3.8–18.6) of new infections in females are attributable to epidemiological interactions with the MSM group (Blue line). In the same year, only 0.2% (95%CI, 0.06–0.3) of new infections in MSM are attributable to females (Red line). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vex014-F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the estimated trends in the population attributable fraction of transmission between MSM and females in the general population.
