<p>There is currently no reliable incidence estimate in Nigeria or its trend over time. We applied phylodynamic analysis to estimate incidence rates for the MSM and reproductive-aged populations as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vex014-F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S5</xref>. The incidence rate continues to increase among MSM from the 1980s to 2014 in contrast to the reproductive-aged population where we estimate that incidence is in decline. In 2014, the phylodynamic analysis yields estimates of incidence in MSM of 7.9% per susceptible person-years (95%CI, 7.0–10.4). The phylodynamic estimates substantially refine imprecise estimates obtained directly from follow-up in the 
 <italic>TRUST</italic> Cohort (green error bar) with incidence rate 13.9 per 100 person-years (95%CI, 7.0–27.8).
