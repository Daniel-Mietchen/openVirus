<p>With the World Health Organization (WHO) call on the need to re-energize HIV programs for key populations (

 <xref rid="vex014-B38" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization 2016</xref>), we sought to evaluate the impact of a universal test-and-treat on the modeled HIV transmission dynamics. Universal coverage of ART (UCT) leads to a large reduction in cumulative infections; 26.6% (95% CI, 23.7–29.2%) of infections are averted over five years and 55.4% (95% CI, 53.4–59.2%) of infections are averted over 20 years. Specific treatment approaches for all MSM living with HIV averts approximately half as many infections over 20 years (27.4%, 95% CI, 11.5–43.9%), but at greatly reduced cost. We predict that over five years (2016–2021), the cost of averting a single infection with targeted test-and-treat is $2,929 USD (95%CI, 2,229–3,737), and the same cost for universal test-and-treat is $7,569 USD (95%CI, 5,266–10,766). Over 20 years, the average cost per infection averted comes down to $1,662 USD (95% CI, 1017–2193) for targeted test-and-treat, but is only modestly reduced for universal test-and-treat ($7,343 USD).
