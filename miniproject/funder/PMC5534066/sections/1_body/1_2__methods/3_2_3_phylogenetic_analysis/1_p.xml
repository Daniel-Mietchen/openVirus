<p>Assignment of subtype or circulating recombinant form (CRF) was performed combining tree-phylogenies, sliding-window BLAST, and jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (

The overall genetic diversity in the data set was assessed by nucleotide sequence analysis using the Kimura 2-parameter/neighbor-joining method implemented in MEGA (
