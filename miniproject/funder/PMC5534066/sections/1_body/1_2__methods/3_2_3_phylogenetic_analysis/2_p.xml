<p>A molecular clock analysis was used to produce dated phylogenies (with calendar time to common ancestry) using BEAST 1.8 (
 <xref rid="vex014-B11" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>). Codons where primary antiretroviral drug resistance mutations were detected (i.e. codons 30, 32, 33, 46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 76, 82, 84, 88 and 90 in protease, and codons 41, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 100, 101, 103, 106, 115, 138, 151, 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215, 219 and 230 in RT) were first removed from the alignments. Separate phylogenetic analyses were conducted for sequences of subtypes CRF02_AG and G which together comprised the majority of sequences. We used a GTR substitution model with discrete gamma heterogeneity of rates between sites, and a relaxed uncorrelated molecular clock and a Bayesian skyline demographic prior. BEAST Markov chains were run for 300 million iterations. Only data from the TRUST and the NeuroAIDS studies were used for the molecular clock analysis and the phylodynamic analysis. For subsequent phylodynamic analysis, a random sample of 20 trees was drawn from the posterior distributions for subtypes G and CRF02_AG and then combined with a common ancestor in the distant past (code to perform this operation is available at
