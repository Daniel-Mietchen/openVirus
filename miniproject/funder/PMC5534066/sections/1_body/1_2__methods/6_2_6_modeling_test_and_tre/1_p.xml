<p>To evaluate the impact of targeting interventions on key populations such as MSM, we simulated the fitted phylodynamic model for an extended time horizon 2016–2036. We modeled a five-year expansion (2016–2021) in diagnosis, treatment, and retention-in-care rates, such that by 2021 (1) 90% of people living with HIV are diagnosed, (2) 90% of treated individuals are retained in care and virally suppressed after one year of follow-up, and (3) 90% of diagnosed individuals receive ARV irrespective of CD4. We further compared scenarios such that the intervention was targeted to MSM only versus the entire population. Diagnosis, treatment, and retention-in-care rates increased linearly from the 2016 baseline (based on fitted models) to values giving the 90/90/90 diagnosis, treatment, and retention targets.</p>
