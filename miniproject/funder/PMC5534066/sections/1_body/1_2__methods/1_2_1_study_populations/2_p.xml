<p>The 
 <italic>TRUST</italic> Cohort consisted of 806 MSM clients enrolled between March 2013 and December 2014 in a community-based trusted venue in Abuja. At the time of this analysis, the HIV population prevalence in MSM was 45% (10 times that of the general population) and HIV incidence rate was 13.9 per 100 person-years (95%CI, 4.7–33.3) based on detection of incident infections in the longitudinal cohort follow-up. The purpose of the study was to engage and retain MSM in HIV care, treatment, and prevention services and to gain an understanding of social and behavioral approaches that prevent HIV transmission. The median age of the participants was 23 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7). Sixty-six percentage of HIV-infected participants were not on ART at the time of enrollment and the median CD4 count was 318 cells (IQR, 137).
