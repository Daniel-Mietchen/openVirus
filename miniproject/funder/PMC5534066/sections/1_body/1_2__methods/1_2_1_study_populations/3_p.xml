<p>The 
 <italic>NeuroAIDS</italic> Cohort (
 <xref rid="vex014-B1" ref-type="bibr">Akolo et al. 2014</xref>) consisted of 77 HIV-infected men and 139 HIV-infected women enrolled between April 2011 and September 2013 from two tertiary facilities in Abuja (University of Abuja Teaching Hospital [UATH] and National Hospital [NHA]). The purpose of the study was to characterize prevalence and incidence of neurocognitive impairment among treatment naïve HIV-infected adults enrolled in HIV care and treatment programs. Individuals were enrolled in an unselected fashion (i.e. not selected a priori because of suspected neurocognitive impairment). Over 90% were ART naïve at enrollment with a median CD4 count of 335 cells (IQR 249) and median log viral load of 4.5 (IQR 1.2). Around 84% were asymptomatic (WHO stage 1). The median age of the participants was 34 years (IQR 11), with 52% married and 15% unemployed (77% female).
