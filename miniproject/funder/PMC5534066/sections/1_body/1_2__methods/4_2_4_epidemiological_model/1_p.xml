<p>Epidemiological dynamics were based on standard mathematical models that have previously been fitted to non-genetic surveillance data (

 <xref rid="vex014-B12" ref-type="bibr">Eaton et al. 2012</xref>). The structured coalescent models account for incomplete sampling and differential sampling rates of MSM and the general population. Transmission rates vary depending on stage of infection, sex, risk group, diagnosis status, and treatment status. Patients were classified into five stages of infection based on CD4 including a one-year early HIV infection period (EHI). Stage of infection of each patient at the time of sampling was based on recent testing history (last negative date) and CD4 count. The models account for secular trends in the force of infection, which has generally decreased through time due to behavioral change and increased diagnosis and treatment. The models account for change in diagnosis and treatment rates through time, and separate effects of diagnosis and treatment on reducing transmission rates and on improving longevity. Models of HIV epidemiological dynamics were developed using systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with compartments corresponding to different risk groups, stages of infection, diagnosis and treatment status, and different types of susceptible individuals.
