The treatment rate depended on CD4-stage of infection based on prevailing guidelines in force in Nigeria which changed through time. Between 2004 and 2011, patients with CD4 &lt; 200 were treated at a constant rate. After 2011, patients with CD4 &lt; 300 were treated at a constant rate. Patients failed treatment at a fixed rate based on WHO surveillance (one per 4.02 person-years). Transmission rates were assumed to be reduced by 87% for patients on treatment.</p>
