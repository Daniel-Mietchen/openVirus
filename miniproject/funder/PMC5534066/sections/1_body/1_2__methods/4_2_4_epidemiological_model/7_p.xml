<p>The number of compartments for infected individuals was 45 = (five stages of infection) × (undiagnosed+ diagnosed+ treated) × (M + F+MSM). Additionally, there were three compartments for the number susceptible M, F, and MSM and a compartment for the size of the Source population. Results presented in the main text were based on a mathematical model with the following characteristic: An individual was characterized by
