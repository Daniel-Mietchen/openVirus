<p>Three risk groups were included in the models: heterosexual males (M), heterosexual females (F), and men who have sex with men (MSM). Transmissions were modeled between M and F, between MSM and other MSM, and between MSM and F. The transmission rates between MSM and F were controlled using two ‘assortativity’ parameters
