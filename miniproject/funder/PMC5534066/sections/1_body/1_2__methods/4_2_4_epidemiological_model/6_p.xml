<p>Based on national census data, the population of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria, which includes Abuja and its metropolitan area was 1,405,201 in 2006. We modeled the population size of Abuja through time using an exponential function with growth rate based on census reports (2.53%/year). Phylodynamic estimation also required a compartment for the HIV infected population size outside of the Abuja region, as well as a specification of the rate that lineages are imported from outside of the Abuja region into the Abuja region. This compartment is termed the ‘Source’, since there is a source–sink relationship between the much larger global population of circulating HIV lineages and what was sampled in Abuja. We modeled the size of the source population using an exponential function (estimated rate
