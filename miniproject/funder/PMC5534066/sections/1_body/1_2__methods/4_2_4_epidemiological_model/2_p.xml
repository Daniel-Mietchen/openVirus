<p>Stage of infection was modeled using the CD4-staging formalism developed by 
 <xref rid="vex014-B9" ref-type="bibr">Cori et al. (2015)</xref>. This includes four CD4-stage categories including AIDS, defined as patients with CD4 &lt; 200. The staging system was modified to include a 1-year early infection (EHI) period instead of a 3-month acute infection period because previous work has shown the former system is more robust to phylodynamic estimation in the presence of phylogenetic error (Volz, et al. 2013a). The model allowed transmission rates to differ between EHI, chronic stages 2-4, and AIDS stage 5. This was parameterized with two parameters
