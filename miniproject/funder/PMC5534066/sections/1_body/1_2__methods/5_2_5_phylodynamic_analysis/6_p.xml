<p>Models were fitted using a recently developed parallel Bayesian Metropolis-Hastings (pBMH) algorithm (
 <xref rid="vex014-B5" ref-type="bibr">Calderhead, 2014</xref>). This algorithm is a modification of traditional MH which makes multiple proposals in parallel and computes the likelihood of each in parallel. Fitting infectious disease models is challenging when the models are complex and likelihood calculations are slow. This approach has the advantage of efficiently utilizing high performance computing clusters when likelihood computations are slow. When computing the likelihood of a new proposal, a phylogeny was sampled uniformly at random from the posterior distribution estimated in BEAST. A Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM) algorithm was used to compute the acceptance probability for each proposal. The pBMH algorithm utilized multivariate normal proposal distributions with variance equal to 0.1% the variance of the prior distributions.
