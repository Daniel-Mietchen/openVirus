<p>Simulation priors were also used to constrain epidemic trajectories within plausible ranges based on WHO surveillance data. Prevalence of infection in the general population was constrained to fall within two standard errors of the estimated means of 0.035 in 2001 and 0.031 in 2012 based on WHO surveillance. Simulated trajectories were docked to the number of patients receiving ARV treatment in 2012 based on UNAIDS data: 491,021 in Nigeria, and estimated 4,706 in Abuja. Similarly, testing rates from simulations were docked to UNAIDS data for 2008 (6.6% per susceptible person year). Diagnosis and treatment rates in MSM were constrained to lie within two standard errors of the estimated values from the Bridging Trust study in 2012 (33% diagnosed, 31% of diagnosed were on treatment). Prevalence of infection in MSM at the end of 2010 and 2014 was constrained to lie within two standard errors of values estimated in the Bridging Trust study (34.9% and 44.5%). Incidence of infection in MSM was constrained to lie within two standard errors of values estimated in the Bridging Trust study in 2014 (13.9% per susceptible person year).</p>
