 <underline>/</underline>) which was used to compute the likelihood of epidemiological parameters given time-scaled HIV phylogenies and the states of sampled individuals. The sample states were based on observed risk group (M, F, MSM, Source) as well as observed CD4 counts at the time of diagnosis where such data were available. Missing data were imputed on the basis of population frequencies of each CD4 stage at the time of sampling of each patient.
