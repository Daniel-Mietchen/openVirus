<p>To assess goodness of fit, we carried out a posterior predictive model simulation procedure (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Simulated lineages through time were compared to estimated lineages through time, showing good agreement.
