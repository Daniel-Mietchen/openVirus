<p>Structured coalescent models (
 <xref rid="vex014-B32" ref-type="bibr">Volz 2012</xref>) were used to infer demographic history and transmission rates in MSM and the general population. Recently, model-based phylogenetic inference has been used to characterize HIV transmission patterns by linking standard mathematical models for HIV epidemic dynamics with population genetic models. An advantage of model-based phylodynamic inference is that a wealth of non-genetic epidemiological surveillance data can be harnessed to calibrate mathematical models and refine parameter estimates. Furthermore, model development can draw on a wealth of expert knowledge that has developed over decades of modeling the HIV epidemic and statistical knowledge gained from fitting similar models to non-genetic surveillance data. Finally, the same models that are used for estimating HIV transmission patterns can be easily adapted for the purpose of predicting epidemic dynamics and to explore the likely impact and cost-effectiveness of different public health interventions.
