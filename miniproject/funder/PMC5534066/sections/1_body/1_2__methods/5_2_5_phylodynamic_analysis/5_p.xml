<p>Likelihoods of epidemiological parameters were computed using a random sample of 20 phylogenies from the BEAST posterior. The likelihoods were based on combined G and CRF02_AG trees, since both clades have grown in tandem and viral lineages from both clades are in competition for susceptibles. Because coalescent analyses are based on a small sample of trees, we ensured that the particular selection of 20 trees was representative of the posterior by comparing the distribution of distances among and between trees using the metric developed by Kendall and Colijn (
