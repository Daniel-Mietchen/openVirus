<p>In order to reduce the amount of computation required to fit each model, the dimension of the compartmental model was reduced after simulating each trajectory and prior to computing likelihoods with the 
 <italic>rcolgem</italic> package. This was accomplished by combining chronic stages 2â€“4, and by combining diagnosed and treated compartments. This reduced the dimension of the system from 46 compartments to 19.
