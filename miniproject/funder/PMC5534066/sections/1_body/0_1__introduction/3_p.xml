<p>Most attempts to characterize HIV transmission using HIV sequence data have focused on identifying closely related subsets of sequences or ‘clusters’ in high income countries with high quality molecular surveillance due to routine resistance testing (

 <xref rid="vex014-B24" ref-type="bibr">Ratmann et al. 2016</xref>). Such clustering may indicate an epidemiological relationship, however, rates of clustering are known to be confounded by incomplete sampling, loss to follow-up, and variables correlated with recency of infection (

Even when a sample contains no transmission pairs, a wealth of epidemiological information may be inferred from HIV sequence data, since changes in transmission and migration of lineages over long time scales influence HIV genetic diversity and phylogenetic patterns(
