<p>In countries with hyper-endemic HIV epidemics (e.g. South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland), the most efficient allocation of prevention activities may be to target all reproductive aged adults, often referred to as the general population in the context of HIV epidemiology. In most of West Africa, such as Nigeria, the opposite may be true. The majority of the HIV epidemics in this region are mixed (

The study reported here employs phylodynamic analysis to more precisely inform the contribution of one key population (KP), men who have sex with men (MSM), to the larger Nigerian epidemic and to model the cost-effectiveness of targeted antiretroviral (ART)-based intervention.
