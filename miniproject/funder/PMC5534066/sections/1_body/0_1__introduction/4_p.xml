<p>Here, we utilized HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequence data from several populations in Nigeria, a West African country with the second highest absolute HIV burden in the world (
 <xref rid="vex014-B31" ref-type="bibr">UNGASS 2014</xref>), to inform our understanding of the phylodynamics of HIV transmission and the potential bridging of infection between concentrated epidemic among MSM and a representative sample of newly enrolled treatment-na√Øve HIV-positive reproductive-aged adults (i.e. the general population). This report characterizes transmission patterns within the MSM population in Abuja, Nigeria and transmission between risk groups. In addition, HIV test-and-treat as a prevention strategy and its cost-effectiveness in disrupting HIV transmission dynamics is investigated.
