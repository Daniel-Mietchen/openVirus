<p>It is difficult to ascertain HIV transmission patterns between different risk groups using observational data. Pathogen genomes from random samples of infected hosts provide one of the few sources of observational data that can inform precise estimates of transmission dynamics. Recent epidemiological history shapes the genetic diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens like HIV, which has spawned new approaches towards phylodynamic inference with the aim of harnessing pathogen genetic diversity to estimate epidemiological dynamics (
