<p>The genetic data reveal strong population structure and assortativity within risk-behavior groups. These observations are highly robust to the particular statistical methods used (

Of twelve pairs from subtypes G and CRF02 with evolutionary distance less than 1%, eleven were observed between MSM, and one was observed between MSM and general population. Higher clustering within MSM likely reflects much higher sampling effort in that risk group, and such small numbers of clusters do not allow inference of relative transmission rates between risk groups. Many factors may confound the inference of transmission rates between risk groups, including unequal sampling in different risk groups and changing transmission rates and population sizes through time. The model-based phylodynamic inference is robust to these sources of bias (
