<p>These analyses have demonstrated the great potential for phylodynamic surveillance of infectious diseases to elucidate hidden transmission patterns which cannot be ascertained from standard surveillance data. As the quality and quantity of HIV sequence data improves, these analyses may be extended to gain a more fine-grained picture of transmission patterns and sexual network structure, as well as the role of other Key Populations and transmission hotspots to provide reliable estimates to guide high impact treatment and prevention interventions.</p>
