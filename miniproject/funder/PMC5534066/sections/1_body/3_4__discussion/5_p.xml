<p>Our findings should be interpreted with several caveats: The structured coalescent methods are premised on simple random sampling of infected hosts, however MSM patients were enrolled using RDS which yields correlated samples. We examined the data for evidence of correlation between HIV phylogenies and RDS recruitment trees, and we did not find any significant relationships (

Second, the phylodynamic estimates depend on the accuracy of time-scaled phylogenies estimated using Bayesian relaxed-clock methods, and will be susceptible to factors that would bias such phylogenies, such as recombination or heterotachy. We examined our sequences for evidence of recombination events, and removed any sequences with low quality or evidence of recombination. Third, estimates are based only on sequences of subtypes G and CRF02_AG, and if epidemic dynamics differ substantially for other subtypes, our results may lack representativeness. Fourth, the phylodynamic estimates rely on the approximation that times of common ancestry between lineages correspond to the time of transmission events between hosts, which does not account for within-host evolution of the virus (

Finally, it is possible that our model-based estimates would be biased by unmodeled heterogeneities that may influence HIV genetic diversity. While we examine a large range of models and accounted for many variables that may influence transmission rates, it is possible that failure to account for detailed sexual network structure in the epidemiological models may bias results.
