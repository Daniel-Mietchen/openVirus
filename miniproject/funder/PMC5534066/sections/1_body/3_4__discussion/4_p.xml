<p>Due to increasing incidence and prevalence trends in MSM, the predicted impact of targeted test-and-treat averts many more infections per unit cost than UCT. We previously demonstrated effective implementation of test-and-treat strategy (
 <xref rid="vex014-B6" ref-type="bibr">Charurat et al. 2015</xref>) with a program attrition of 10% among individuals engaged in HIV treatment. We show that the gains of this intervention are not limited to MSM, since chains of HIV transmission cross back and forth between the general population and high-risk groups. Based on the estimated transmission rates between risk groups, we have predicted that over twenty years, a targeted test-and-treat strategy would avert about half as many infections as universal test-and-treat, but we estimate that the cost of targeted test-and-treat to only be about 16% of the cost of universal test-and-treat over 20 years. Fear of criminal sanctions as well as of discriminatory or stigmatizing health service provision may preclude the level of ‘test and treat’ services assumed in our model. In cases such as this, comprehensive HIV services should be understood to include legal and other support to MSM organizations to strengthen their capacity to advocate for access to services and changes in discriminatory laws and policies and support for human rights organizations and other allies that can assist MSM organizations in that effort.
