  <title>CTV traits.</title>
  <p>(A) A field citrus tree showing decline. (B) CTV virion. Image was captured by transmission electron microscopy. White arrowheads point to the virion. Bar, 200 nm. (C) Schematic diagram of the CTV genome organization. The open boxes represent ORFs and their translation products. (D) RNA species produced upon replication and expression of the CTV genome. Black and grey lines indicate positive-stranded and negative-stranded genomic and sg RNAs, respectively. (E) GFP-tagged p33 expressed in 
   <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> cells forms punctate spots at plasmodesmata (top image, white arrowheads) and exhibits the ability to form extracellular tubules (bottom image). Images show confocal projection (top image) and a confocal single section (bottom image) of a 
   <italic>N</italic>. 
   <italic>benthamiana</italic> cell (top image) or protoplast (bottom image), which were visualized along with the autofluorescence of the chloroplasts (purple color). Images were taken at 4 days after the introduction of the corresponding expression cassettes. Scale bars, 20 μm. (F) Observation of fluorescence in phloem-associated cells on the internal surface of bark from a citrus seedling infected with the GFP-tagged CTV at 3 months after inoculation. Images were taken using a dissecting fluorescence microscope (top image on the right) and a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope (bottom image). Bars, 0.5 mm and 20 μm, respectively. (G) Observation of fluorescence in phloem-associated cells of a citrus tree superinfected with two nonexcluding CTV variants, each expressing an extra gene of GFP or of a red fluorescent protein. Yellow cell is coinfected with both variants. Image was taken at 12 weeks after challenge inoculation using a confocal fluorescence microscope. Bar, 20 μm. (H) Tissue distribution and symptoms produced by the GFP-tagged CTV WT or a p33 deletion mutant (CTV:Δp33) in a citrus tree at 12 months after inoculation. Images on the left were taken using stem cross-sections and a dissecting fluorescence microscope. Red color in the left images results from chlorophyll autofluorescence. CP, major coat protein; CPm, minor coat protein; CTV, citrus tristeza virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEL, helicase-like domain; HSP70h, HSP70 homolog; L1, L2, papain-like leader protease domains; LMT1, low-molecular-weight tristeza RNA 1; LMT2, low-molecular-weight tristeza RNA 2; MT, methyltransferase-like domain; ORF, open reading frame; RdRp, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; sg, subgenomic; SIE, superinfection exclusion; WT, wild type.
