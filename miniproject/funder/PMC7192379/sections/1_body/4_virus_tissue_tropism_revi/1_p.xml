<p>Traditionally, CTV has been considered as a phloem-limited virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, a recent study examining a virus mutant lacking the p33 protein demonstrated that the mutant can be often found replicating in the immature xylem tracheid cells. Spread of the p33 deletion variant beyond phloem and its invasion into the xylem correlated, on one hand, with a weaker host response compared with that to the full-length wild-type virus and, on the other hand, with abnormal vascular tissue differentiation and the development of stem pits [

The findings of this study suggested that phloem restriction of CTV results from the outcome of the CTV-plant host arms race and could be influenced by factors modulating the host immune response. It appears, though, that keeping the virus within the phloem is beneficial for both sides as it allows accumulation and long-lasting persistence of the virus without the detrimental damage to the host.
