<p>The explanation for coexistence of multiple strains of CTV in a host came from research on CTV SIE. SIE, a phenomenon in which a primary virus infection prevents a secondary infection with the same or closely related virus, has been observed with viruses in various systems, including important pathogens of humans, animals, and plants. With CTV, SIE only occurs between virus variants of the same strain, while variants belonging to different strains do not exclude each other, permitting formation of multistrain populations in the same host [

With variants of the same strain, SIE functions as a powerful mechanism that completely prevents superinfection of the host plant by another variant. Furthermore, the phenomenon could not be explained by the mechanisms described previously for other viruses. It is operated at two different levels—the whole organism and the cellular level—and is mediated by multiple viral factors: the viral p33 protein and a factor(s) encoded in the 5’-terminal part of the CTV genome, which is still under investigation [
