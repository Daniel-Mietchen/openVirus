<p>Knowledge obtained from the research on CTV SIE can be translated into practical applications that would allow protection of citrus trees in the field from aggressive CTV variants. One such application is crossprotection or preimmunization, a purposeful inoculation of trees with mild virus variants. This strategy has been widely practiced in many citrus-growing regions, yet with low success due to the lack of understanding of the mechanisms behind a mild variant-mediated protection [
