<p id="Par32">Case-control studies conducted within a well-defined, longitudinal cohort, can yield incidence of the outcome(s) under study and allow evaluation of risk factor data from the overall cohort. In a nested case-control study, not only is it possible to calculate incidence rates of ILI and SARI in which influenza virus is detectable, but by making comparisons to appropriately selected controls within the cohort, the proportions of such illnesses attributable to influenza may be calculated. However, appropriately apportioning cases when multiple possible etiologic agents are present remains a challenge.</p>
