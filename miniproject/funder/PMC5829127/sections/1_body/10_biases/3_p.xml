<p id="Par21">Potentially the most problematic information bias in studies of the burden of illness attributable to influenza is misclassification of individuals regarding the etiologic role of influenza virus in the outcome. Depending on the timing and types(s) of specimens obtained and the laboratory methods applied, studies may underestimate or overestimate the number, proportion, and rate of respiratory illnesses caused by influenza viruses. While RT-PCR testing of respiratory specimens is now the “gold standard” for confirming the presence of influenza virus, the test results may still lead to misclassification of the etiology of illness, depending on when the specimen is obtained during the illness. Serologic testing of acute and convalescent samples is necessary to identify additional infections. Conversely, without information on the prevalence of influenza virus infection among appropriately selected, contemporaneous controls, illnesses might be attributed to influenza virus when it is an “innocent bystander” and not the cause of the illness.</p>
