<p id="Par20">More important in studies attempting to measure the burden of disease attributable to influenza are selection and information biases. Facility-based studies that assess which etiologic agents are present in ill individuals rely on individuals to seek care at facilities where surveillance is in place; such individuals are only a subset of people in the community with the same illness, and many factors influence care-seeking behavior. Thus, those coming to sites with ILI and SARI surveillance may not be representative of those in the community with the same clinical manifestations. This is likely to be less of a problem for severe clinical illnesses (e.g., SARI) than for milder illnesses (e.g., ILI), but the availability of alternative healthcare facilities and the extent to which traditional healers are utilized may influence the amount of selection bias that results. If a specimen requires uncomfortable or invasive collection methods, those agreeing to specimen collection may differ from those who refuse, possibly introducing additional selection bias, as might other factors that influence whether eligible study subjects agree to provide specimens or information. In addition, in the hospital setting, specimens may not be obtained from the sickest patients, who often are not enrolled in studies or selected for surveillance.</p>
