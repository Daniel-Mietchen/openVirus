<p id="Par22">Other biases can occur in ecologic studies of the burden of illness attributable to influenza. Such studies examine trends in mortality from or hospitalizations for selected health outcomes, irrespective of whether cases are tested for influenza. These studies attempt to estimate the numbers or rates of excess illnesses, hospitalizations, or deaths when influenza viruses are circulating, in categories such as “pneumonia and influenza” and “underlying respiratory and circulatory.” Calculations can be made for a given country or region, age group, or year/influenza season, and for when a given influenza virus type or strain predominates. Depending on the health outcomes, these calculations yield either a lower or an upper bound on the impact of influenza-related illness or death. These studies use statistical approaches to control for the effects of other factors that might influence rates of illness, hospitalization, or death (e.g., circulation of other infectious agents) but remain susceptible to the biases that can affect any ecologic study.</p>
