<p id="Par5">When individuals are followed over time in either a clinical trial or a cohort study, it is possible to calculate the incidence of acute respiratory illness (ARI), ILI, pneumonia, SARI, and SARI-associated deaths, although large numbers of individuals must be followed to produce reliable estimates of the incidence of SARI, and even larger numbers to produce reliable estimates of SARI-specific mortality. Testing individuals for influenza virus can help determine the incidence of influenza-associated illness and mortality, although attributing an illness or death to influenza virus based on test results may be challenging. Without denominators and ascertainment of all episodes of illness, ILI and SARI surveillance programs can produce information regarding the proportions of such medically attended illnesses in which there is evidence of influenza virus infection but cannot produce accurate incidence rates. Additionally, such surveillance systems do not detect presentations of influenza virus infection that do not meet the surveillance definition (e.g., afebrile).</p>
