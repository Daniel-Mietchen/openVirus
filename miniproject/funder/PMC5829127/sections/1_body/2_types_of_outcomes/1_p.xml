<p id="Par4">Overwhelming evidence indicates that influenza viruses cause acute infection in the lower and upper respiratory tracts. Often, such illnesses are subdivided for surveillance and disease burden estimation into influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs). Much of the effort to assess the burden of illness attributable to influenza has relied on surveillance and testing of specimens from patients with ILI, pneumonia, or SARI or from individuals dying of an acute respiratory infection. Other types of studies (e.g., ecologic, modeling) often use “pneumonia and influenza” cases or deaths or all-cause mortality as outcomes.</p>
