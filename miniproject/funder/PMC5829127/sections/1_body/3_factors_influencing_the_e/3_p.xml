<p id="Par9">Also important is which influenza virus type (A vs. B) and subtype (H1N1 vs H3H2) or lineage (Yamagata vs. Victoria) is circulating/predominates in a given year and the distribution in the population of immunity to those strains, as a result of prior infection or recent vaccination with an antigenically similar strain. Other factors likely to influence risk of a severe or fatal outcome are the availability of medical care, (e.g., oxygen, ventilatory support), the prompt use of anti-viral drugs, and the use of antimicrobials to treat concurrent or resultant bacterial infections. Also relevant is the use and coverage with vaccines to prevent bacterial infections, (e.g.,
