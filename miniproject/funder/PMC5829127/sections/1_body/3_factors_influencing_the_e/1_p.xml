<p id="Par7">Because the burden of illness attributable to influenza in a population depends on who is acquiring it, it is important to consider variations in the descriptive epidemiologic features of influenza. Excluding pandemic influenza, for which the descriptive epidemiologic features of both morbidity and mortality patterns differ, young children experience the highest rates of influenza virus infection and illness and play a central role in transmission of the virus, while it is older adults and young infants who experience a disproportionate risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The presence of underlying chronic conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular disease, immunosuppressive medications, and immunodeficiency) increases the risk of severe influenza, so the prevalence of these conditions can influence the proportion of influenza illnesses that are severe or fatal [
