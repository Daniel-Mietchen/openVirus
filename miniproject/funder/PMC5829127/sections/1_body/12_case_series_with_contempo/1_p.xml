<p id="Par28">Case series may incorrectly attribute an episode of ILI or SARI to a microorganism that, while present in the respiratory tract, is not the cause of the illness. To further investigate the etiologic role of viruses detected in patients with respiratory illness, case-control studies that compare the prevalences of various viruses in cases with the prevalences in controls have been conducted. Studies may report simple prevalences of a given virus, calculate odds or risk ratios, or assert a more causal interpretation by presenting the attributable proportion total or the attributable proportion exposed. Because these studies have generally found very low prevalences of influenza viruses among controls, the odds or risk ratios reported have been high, the “adjusted prevalences” of influenza viruses among cases have been only marginally lower than the unadjusted prevalences, and the attributable fraction has been high (e.g., 80–90%) [
