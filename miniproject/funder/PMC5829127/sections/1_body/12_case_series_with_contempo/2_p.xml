Most studies have limited controls to individuals who were asymptomatic for the 14Â days prior to enrollment and sampling. Few studies have followed up controls to assure they remain asymptomatic. It is unclear whether these approaches to identifying controls, often from individuals coming to healthcare facilities, produce controls representative of the source population of the cases.</p>
