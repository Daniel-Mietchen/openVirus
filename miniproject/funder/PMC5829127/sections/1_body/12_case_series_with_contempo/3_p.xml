<p id="Par30">The optimal criteria for selecting control subjects remain the subject of debate, and many case-control studies have enrolled convenience samples as controls. “Pathogen load,” as determined by quantitative PCR, might be useful to measure and compare between cases and controls, although this approach is likely to be informative only if influenza virus is detected in a non-negligible proportion of controls. In a recent study of the association of cycle threshold (CT) values with upper respiratory infection, outpatients and inpatients both had lower CT values (i.e., a higher viral load) than influenza-positive asymptomatic controls. However, there was no clear relationship with disease severity; outpatients had, on average, lower influenza CT values than did inpatients [
