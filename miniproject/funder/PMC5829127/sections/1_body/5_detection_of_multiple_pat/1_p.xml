<p id="Par11">The use of multiplex panels to test respiratory samples for multiple pathogens has illuminated the difficulty of assessing the etiology of respiratory infections. When multiple pathogens are detected, it is unclear if one pathogen is causing the illness or if collectively they are responsible for the illness. Viruses detected may be the immediate cause (e.g., primary viral pneumonia), on the causal pathway or non-causal (e.g., prolonged viral shedding or incidental infection). While many respiratory viruses, including influenza, have been found in asymptomatic individuals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], the prevalence of influenza virus is typically higher in cases than controls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, analyzing a single specimen may still not identify an agent involved either earlier or later in the disease process. Studies that test for a single virus or fail to include community controls are likely to misattribute (and possibly overestimate) the number or incidence of illnesses caused by that virus.
