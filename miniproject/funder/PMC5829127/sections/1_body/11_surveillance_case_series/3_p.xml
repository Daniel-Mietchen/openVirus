<p id="Par26">Studies and surveillance systems that report only the proportion of cases with laboratory evidence of influenza virus yield limited information on the burden of illness, although they play an important role in annual influenza vaccine strain selection. It is possible to calculate incidence (often age-specific) of medically attended illnesses or deaths with laboratory evidence of influenza when the data generated are population-based, the population size is known, and information is available on care-seeking behaviors by ill individuals in the community. The latter is particularly needed when the outcome is mild (e.g., ILI) or when those with severe illness may not have access to or seek care from western-style providers. Adjustment for potential confounding factors (e.g., travel time to a healthcare provider) can improve the accuracy of such calculations.</p>
