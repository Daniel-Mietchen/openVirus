<p id="Par24">The most common approach to assessing the role of influenza viruses in acute illnesses has been facility-based surveillance in the outpatient or hospital setting. Depending on the outcome of interest (ILI, SARI, or pneumonia), surveillance may occur at a number of sentinel sites or at all clinical sites serving the population. Clinical and demographic data are collected, including outcome, and specimens are obtained from all or a sample of those seen who meet the case definition(s). The proportions of illnesses/syndromes in which there is evidence of influenza virus infection, either as the only etiologic agent or in combination with other agents, are calculated. These same surveillance systems can help monitor circulating influenza strains and serve as sources of cases (and often influenza-negative controls) for studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness or risk factors.</p>
