<p id="Par39">However, given the variation in the effectiveness of influenza vaccines, as well as recent evidence that live-attenuated influenza vaccines have substantially lower efficacy than initially demonstrated, issues related to influenza vaccine probe studies require careful consideration. Such studies will have to be of adequate size to produce useful estimates of the amount of vaccine-preventable illness (and possibly deaths), include nested studies of vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza infections, and be carried out in multiple settings and across multiple influenza seasons. Such studies will be large, complex, and expensive. Given the unpredictability of influenza, even large and expensive studies of this type may fail to provide robust estimates of the burden of illness attributable to influenza, and these estimates may or may not be applicable in other settings, seasons, and patient populations.</p>
