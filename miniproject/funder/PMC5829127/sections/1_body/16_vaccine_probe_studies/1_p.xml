<p id="Par38">Given a vaccine of known efficacy against illness caused by the specific etiologic agent, a vaccine probe study allows the calculation of the proportion of such illnesses caused by that etiologic agent (i.e., etiologic fraction), as well as the difference in the incidence of the illness between vaccinated and unvaccinated people (i.e., vaccine-preventable disease incidence) [

If the efficacy of the vaccine against illness caused by the etiologic agent is not well-defined, a nested study within the vaccine probe study is needed to generate that information. Vaccine probe studies have proven to be very informative with regard to estimation of the proportion of pneumonias attributable to bacterial pathogens (e.g., 
 <italic>Hib</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumonia</italic>) and how much illness and death can be prevented with these bacterial conjugate vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Vaccine probe studies have been used rarely to investigate influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Influenza vaccine probe studies are a potentially attractive approach to estimating what proportions of various health outcomes are attributable to influenza and how many illnesses (and possibly deaths) can be prevented by influenza vaccines.
