These efforts focused on estimating burden of influenza-related pneumonia/lower respiratory infections but made no attempt to estimate the burden of illness or death attributable to influenza in other disease outcomes. As with any modeling effort, the model output is dramatically affected by the model and the inputs used, as demonstrated by the substantial difference in the estimated annual numbers of deaths in children &lt; 5 resulting from a change in the modeling approach used to produce GBD estimates between 2010 and 2015(119,000 in GBD2010, but only 10,200 in GBD2015) [
