<p id="Par37">Various other modeling approaches used to estimate the amount of mortality or excess mortality “attributable” to influenza virus do not require testing specimens from patients with the diverse other medical conditions plausibly caused or exacerbated by influenza. When carefully and thoughtfully designed, analyzed, and interpreted, such studies can add to what is known about the health impacts of influenza, at least with regard to mortality and hospitalizations. However, a number of cautions are warranted. The paucity of reliable data from some regions (e.g., Africa and South Asia) limits the ability to make reliable local estimates. Second, because many recent modeling efforts have focused on the 2009 pandemic, the results may not be applicable in the context of annual influenza epidemics, or even to future pandemics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Annual influenza epidemics have age-specific morbidity and mortality patterns that are markedly different from those seen in influenza pandemics, and future pandemics are likely to be caused by a different influenza virus, as well as occur in a different setting with regard to the distribution in the population of pre-existing immunity to the influenza virus causing the pandemic. Finally, studies of mortality or excess mortality, while capturing an important component of the burden of influenza-associated illness clearly do not capture morbidity.
