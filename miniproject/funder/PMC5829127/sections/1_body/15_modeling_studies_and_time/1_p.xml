<p id="Par33">The previous study designs all involve testing specimens from patients with evidence of a respiratory infection for influenza virus. As discussed earlier, such illnesses comprise only a fraction of the sequelae likely attributable to influenza. However, other sequelae, such as COPD exacerbation and myocardial infarction, can have other etiologies, and testing for influenza virus is rarely undertaken in such cases. Consequently, other techniques can be used to estimate overall influenza-associated morbidity or mortality.</p>
