<p id="Par34">One approach uses statistical models to estimate excess deaths or hospitalizations when influenza virus(es) are circulating, compared to periods with no circulating influenza. Such studies have usually been done for high-income countries but can be performed for any region where the circulation of influenza viruses has a defined seasonality or virological results are available to inform models [

Models are more difficult to construct for populations in which influenza viruses circulate throughout the year or if the seasonality is poorly characterized or unpredictable. These models require reasonably reliable population-level vital statistics data, including information on at least broad categories of primary and underlying causes of death, lacking in many countries. Two categories of underlying causes of death are generally examined, “pneumonia and influenza” and “respiratory and circulatory”; the former estimates a lower bound and the latter an upper bound on the number or rate of influenza-associated deaths or hospitalizations. These data, stratified by age, can estimate years of life lost attributable to influenza-associated mortality, including by different influenza virus types or strains [
