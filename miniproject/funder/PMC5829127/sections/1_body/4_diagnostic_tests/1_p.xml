<p id="Par10">While some approaches to estimating the burden of influenza-associated illness and mortality do not rely on the use of diagnostic tests, studies of ILI, SARI, and pneumonia almost invariably collect and test specimens. Many older testing methods lacked sensitivity and/or specificity or were difficult to perform. Use of acute and convalescent sera to detect rising antibody titers has always been limited by the difficulty of obtaining these samples, particularly in infants and children. The widespread use of RT-PCR-based and rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests has revolutionized the study of the role of influenza virus in respiratory infections. While rapid, point-of-care diagnostic tests certainly have their uses, it is important to note that they are generally less sensitive then molecular diagnostic methods [

Although RT-PCR has become the standard method used in such studies, studies that have also incorporated serologic testing of patients hospitalized with pneumonia have shown that substantial proportions of influenza-associated cases were detected only by serologic testing [
