<p id="Par40">With finite resources to devote to health promotion and disease prevention, one reason to establish the magnitude of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality is to quantify the proportion of such outcomes potentially preventable through immunization. In low- and middle-income countries, annual influenza immunization has not been considered a high priority, although the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic fostered new interest in this area. Much of the subsequent research and surveillance activity has focused on ILI and SARI, two well-established outcomes of influenza infection. As alluded to above, however, substantial evidence suggests that influenza can produce a diversity of acute adverse health outcomes and longer-term effects. Other than modeling/time series studies and vaccine probe studies, research on the role of influenza virus as an etiologic agent answers a narrow question concerning respiratory illnesses and typically cannot, by design, provide information on its possible role in other illnesses.</p>
