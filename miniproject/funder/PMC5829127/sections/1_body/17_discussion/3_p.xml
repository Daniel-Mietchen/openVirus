<p id="Par42">Also important in summarizing what is known about the burden of illness attributable to influenza virus is the variability in that burden. Unlike some infectious diseases, the burden of influenza-associated illness and death is highly variable, by geographic region and over time. There is substantial variation in the overall and the age-specific burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality, depending on which influenza virus(es) predominate. Not only are severity of illness and the age groups at greatest risk of severe illness and death different in the context of pandemic vs. annual epidemic influenza but they also differ, depending on the type or subtype of influenza that predominates. Thus, the findings concerning the burden of illness vary by year and by season, at least in temperate climates, where influenza shows marked seasonal peaks. Thus, data collected over multiple years and across all seasons need to be collected and compiled for studies of influenza-associated illness to be most useful.</p>
