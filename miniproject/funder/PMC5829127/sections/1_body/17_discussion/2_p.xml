<p id="Par41">The design and the interpretation of the results of studies of the etiologic agents responsible for cases of respiratory illness are complicated, and generalizing their results to larger populations or to other time periods is fraught with challenges related to choice of diagnostic technology, case definition and control selection, and analytic model. Attributing a given illness to influenza virus when multiple microorganisms are detected in a single specimen remains a challenge. To calculate accurate incidence rates of influenza-associated ARI, ILI, pneumonia, or SARI, approaches that take into account care-seeking behaviors and the factors that influence such behaviors, together with accurate information concerning the size and composition of the source population, are needed.</p>
