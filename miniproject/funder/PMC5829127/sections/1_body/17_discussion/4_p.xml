<p id="Par43">Other factors are likely to influence the amount of influenza-related morbidity and mortality and its distribution within a population. In countries administering influenza vaccines to a sizeable proportion of the population, influenza vaccine coverage and vaccine effectiveness against predominant strains, both of which can vary substantially, will influence the findings of studies of influenza burden of disease. Use of other vaccines, particularly Hib and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines, is likely to have an impact on the burden of disease attributable to influenza, to the extent that a preceding or concurrent influenza virus infection predisposes to bacterial pneumonia. The prevalences of diverse chronic conditions, particularly untreated HIV infection, but also such conditions as obesity and malnutrition, are likely to influence the severity of and risk of dying associated with influenza virus infection. And demographic factors are plausible modifiers of the distribution of influenza infection and influenza-related illness in the community. To be most informative, studies must not only cover multiple seasons/years but represent a number of different geographic settings and epidemiological situations.
