<p id="Par3">Determining the burden of morbidity and mortality (and resultant economic impacts) attributable to influenza viruses is critical to informing decisions regarding control programs. Particularly in poor countries, where immunization programs are regularly urged to improve coverage of current vaccines while adding new vaccines, decisions concerning the use of influenza vaccines in the absence of a pandemic would benefit from accurate information on the burden of influenza-associated illness and death. Because available influenza vaccines must be formulated and administered annually, their addition to immunization programs in low and even middle-income countries is all the more burdensome, and their value for preventing morbidity, mortality, and economic loss is critical to establish. Here, we review the challenges to estimating the burden of influenza-associated morbidity and mortality. The focus of this review is on illness and death caused by influenza viruses readily transmissible between humans, despite the fact that transmission of avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5N1, H7N9, etc.) to humans can occur and produce life-threatening illness.</p>
