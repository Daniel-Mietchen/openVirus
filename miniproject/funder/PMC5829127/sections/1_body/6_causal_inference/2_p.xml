<p id="Par13">Many microorganisms, including diverse viruses and bacteria, can be present in the respiratory tract without any discernible effects on health. Regardless of the duration of such infections, that such microorganisms can be present in the respiratory tracts of asymptomatic individuals complicates the causal interpretation of detecting these agents in respiratory specimens from symptomatic individuals. Even specimens from the lower respiratory tract can contain microorganisms that are not harmful. One approach to this problem is to test specimens from non-ill individuals (i.e., controls) enrolled contemporaneously, which can provide useful information on the prevalence of asymptomatic respiratory infection with various microorganisms. The selection of controls, however, has to be carefully planned and executed to avoid selection biases.</p>
