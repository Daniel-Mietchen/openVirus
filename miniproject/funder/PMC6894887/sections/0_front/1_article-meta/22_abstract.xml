 <p>Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are leading causes of viral infection in the world and hence it is important to develop accurate methods for forecasting their incidence. We use Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio method, which is a computationally efficient implementation of the variable selection method, in order to obtain a sparse (non-lasso) representation of time series, Google Trends and electronic health records (for ILI) data. This method is used to forecast dengue incidence in five countries/states and ILI incidence in USA. We show that this method outperforms existing time series methods in forecasting these diseases. The method is general and can also be used to forecast other diseases.</p>
