<p>We describe different methods that can be used to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. For our method, we first describe the general method applicable to any time series data. Subsequently, we detail the additional preprocessing steps required to process the dengue and ILI data. The other methods that are described include ARGO, Glmnet lasso, Kalman filtering, ensemble, and the naive method.</p>
