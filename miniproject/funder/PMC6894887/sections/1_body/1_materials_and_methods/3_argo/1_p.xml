<p>ARGO [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] is a multivariate linear regression model, which consists of an autoregressive (AR) process coupled with certain exogenous variables derived from Google search queries. The Google search queries used here are those related to either dengue or ILI depending on the disease that is being forecast. The method utilises the lasso technique (described earlier) in order to obtain a sparse representation [
