<p>We use a 4-year training window for our method since deseasoning is carried out by directly analyzing the time series data and a longer time window leads to a better estimate of the seasonality component that is to be removed. In ARGO and Glmnet lasso, seasonality is captured by using appropriate lags in the AR model. The choice that is made is 
 <italic>M</italic> = {1, 2, â€¦, 12, 24} months prior to estimation [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This is based on the hypothesis that the previous 12 months, i.e. short term influences, as well as the long term seasonal influence at 24 months which has been reported to be important for dengue prediction, are required for accurate estimation of dengue case counts. Since the lags are fixed, increasing the training window to 4 years to match with that used by ARLR method is not expected to lead to any significant changes in the results. We have verified this for the Glmnet lasso method that is a slight variant of the ARGO method. For ARGO method we have reproduced the results reported in the paper [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which uses a 2-year training window. For Glmnet lasso, Kalman and ensemble methods, a 4-year training window was used. Since the naive method uses the observed incidence value at time 
 <italic>t</italic> as the predicted incidence value at time 
 <italic>t</italic>+ 1, no training period is required.
