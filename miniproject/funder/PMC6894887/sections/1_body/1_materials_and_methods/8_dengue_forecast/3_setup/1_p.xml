 <italic>t</italic>. For our method, a 4-year sliding window immediately prior to the forecast month was used for training whereas for the ARGO method a 2-year sliding window immediately prior to the forecast month was used for training, as specified in the original paper [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The allowed autoregressive lags used used for ARLR were months 1 to 4 and month 12.
