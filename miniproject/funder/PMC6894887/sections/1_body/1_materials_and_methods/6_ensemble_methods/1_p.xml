<p>Ensemble methods [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] combine weighted forecasts from a set of models to come up with the final forecast. In our case, we use the additive Holt-Winters seasonal model [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] as the base model and vary different input parameters to generate multiple distinct Holt-Winters models. This is one strategy that can be used in ensemble methods. One could also use disparate models as constituent models or combine both approaches [
