<p>As mentioned above, we have implemented the variable selection method in a computationally efficient manner described in the Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We call this the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated using time complexity calculations in the Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We also use an alternative stopping criterion given by the 
 <italic>AICC</italic> (corrected AIC) criterion [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Both these factors enable this method to effectively handle thousands of variables. The computationally efficient method is general and is applicable beyond disease forecasting.
