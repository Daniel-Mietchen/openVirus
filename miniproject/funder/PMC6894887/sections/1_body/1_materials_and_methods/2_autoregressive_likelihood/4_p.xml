<p>In this paper, we use an alternative sparse modelling method, a variable selection method, that is already known [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Variable selection method, however, is computationally inefficient. We have devised a computationally efficient process for variable selection. Variable selection is based on comparing the relative likelihoods of candidate solutions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Instead of including, at one go, all variables at all possible lags as predictors for each of the response variables, each variable at each individual lag is included (removed) as a predictor, one at a time, based on the size of the observed error in the response variable(s) before and after the inclusion (removal). A detailed description of the method is given in the Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>). To briefly summarize, starting from a suitable initial VAR model (typically the trivial model), lagged predictor variables are added or removed depending on whether their inclusion (exclusion) significantly increases (decreases) the likelihood that the data is explained by the model, respectively. This process is continued until no further variables can be added or removed.
