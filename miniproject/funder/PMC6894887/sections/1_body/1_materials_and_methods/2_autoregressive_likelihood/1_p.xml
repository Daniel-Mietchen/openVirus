<p>As mentioned in the introduction, it is important to develop sparse models to represent the data given the large number of data sources (such as dengue or ILI case counts and frequency of multiple Internet search queries from Google Trends) and the limited amount of data available from each source (especially dengue and ILI case counts) for training the model. In this section, we describe a computationally efficient method for obtaining sparse vector autoregressive models from multivariate time series data.</p>
