<p>For our method and for the Kalman and ensemble methods, we took

 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>

 <sub>1,

 <italic>Z</italic>
 <sub>2,

 <italic>Z</italic>
 <sub>3,
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> are the logit transformation of weekly proportion of flu visit, ILI visit, and unspecified viral or ILI visit obtained from athenahealth data. For all methods, we took the log-transformed Google Trends data. The training periods used for each method were identical to that specified above in the case of dengue. To quantify the accuracy of the forecast, for each method we compute the standard error measures described earlier.
