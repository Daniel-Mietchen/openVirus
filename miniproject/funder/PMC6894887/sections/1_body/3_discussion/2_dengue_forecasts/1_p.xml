<p>From the figures, it is clear that ARLR method does a good job of forecasting the dengue and ILI incidences. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g003">Fig 3</xref> we observe, as expected, that the forecast error increases as the forecast horizon increases. A quantitative measure of its performance is seen from the Tables. It is clearly seen that ARLR outperforms the other methods for both dengue and ILI and for all countries/states except for one (realtime dengue incidence forecast errors for Brazil). In this context it should be pointed that ARGO method (which performs better than ours in the case of Brazil) tunes the structure of the regularization parameters to optimize the results for each country/state (see the supplementary information in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). Our method does not require such tuning. The Glmnet lasso method is essentially identical to ARGO except that no such tuning is done. Our method does perform better than Glmnet lasso even for Brazil. Further, in all cases, ARLR forecast error is always better than the forecast error for the baseline naive method whereas this is not true for the other methods. Compared to ARGO (the next best performing method), our method (ARLR) achieves a 26% average reduction in RMSE for realtime forecast when averaged across all countries/states; a 21% reduction in MAE; and a 6% reduction in MAPE. The overall average reduction across all error measures for realtime forecast is 18% compared to the ARGO method. It should be noted that even if we use a log transformation of dengue case counts for Taiwan (as for the other countries), our method still outperforms ARGO method, but to a lesser extent. Similarly, for predicting peak value, our method achieves a 43% reduction in errors over the Glmnet lasso method when averaged across all countries/states. Predictions of peak times are also a bit better.
