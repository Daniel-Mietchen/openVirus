<p>Using ILI incidence data, the forecast skill for the nowcast averaged across all forecast windows is found to be 0.98 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The best possible forecast skill is 1. If we use the historical ILI incidence data without backfill, we get a forecast skill of 0.95. We see that forecast skill when using backfill data can be substantially better than forecast skill obtained using realtime data (without correcting for backfill). Similar improvements are also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007518.g004">Fig 4</xref> for two-week, three-week, and four-week ahead forecasts. Such improvements are to be expected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
