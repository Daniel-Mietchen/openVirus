  <p>We use unweighted ILI incidence in order to facilitate comparison with ARGO results. On the other hand, CDC’s flu prediction challenge [

   <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] uses weighted ILI incidence (where the ILI incidences are weighted with the region’s population) as the forecast target. Note that weighted ILI incidences are not simple scaled versions of the unweighted ILI incidences. In fact, weighted ILI incidence and unweighted ILI incidence can often exhibit different trends. Therefore, weighted and unweighted ILI incidences are two different forecasting targets and the corresponding forecasting errors can also be different. If we use the historical weighted ILI incidence data, we get a forecast skill of 0.90 for nowcast. This value is similar to the value reported in [

  <p>We predict the ILI incidence at a national scale whereas the CDC flu prediction challenge also involves prediction at a regional scale. National scale predictions are typically better than regional scale predictions.</p>
