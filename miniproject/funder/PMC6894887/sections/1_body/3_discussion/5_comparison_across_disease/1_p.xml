<p>It is observed that the real-time forecast errors for ILI are smaller than those for dengue. One reason for this is the additional data source (electronic health records) that was available for forecasting ILI incidence. Across geographies, there is again variation in the errors in forecasting dengue. There could be several reasons for this such as poorer quality of the dengue incidence data collection and less widespread usage of internet.</p>
