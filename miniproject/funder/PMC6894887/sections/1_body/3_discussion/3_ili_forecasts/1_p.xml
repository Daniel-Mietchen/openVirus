<p>For realtime (one-week ahead) ILI forecasts, ARLR method achieves a 17% reduction in RMSE, a 15% reduction in MAE, and a 3.5% reduction in MAPE as compared to ARGO. For two-week, three-week and four-week ahead ILI incidence forecasts, our method (ARLR) achieves a 19% average reduction in RMSE compared to ARGO. The substantial improvements seen using our method result from an efficient sparse representation of the time series using the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio method and proper deseasoning of the raw time series.</p>
