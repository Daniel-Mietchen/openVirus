<p>In this paper, we have presented ARLR method for estimating a sparse autoregressive model from observations using a likelihood ratio approach. Using monthly dengue case counts and Google search term frequency data from 5 countries/states, and weekly ILI case counts, Google search term frequency data and electronic health records from USA we fitted a sparse autoregressive model (with exogenous terms) to these data using the ARLR method and obtained forecasts for dengue and ILI case counts. It was shown that the forecast error measures are, on the average, substantially lower for our method when compared to existing methods like ARGO, Glmnet lasso, Kalman filter, and ensemble method.</p>
