<p>Our method would be most useful in cases where we need to forecast using data from multiple sources, the effect of each of which is modelled using one or more unknown parameters. In such cases, the training window immediately preceding the forecast time point has to be necessarily short since data from beyond a certain short time in the past does not contribute to the predictive ability. In summary, a large number of parameters need to be estimated using a short training window with a limited number of data points. In such cases, sparse models like ARLR become essential to obtain robust parameter estimates which then lead to more accurate forecasts. Our method could also be used to forecast incidence of other diseases.</p>
