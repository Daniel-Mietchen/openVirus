  <p>Google Trend queries would be related to disease incidence in countries where a substantial proportion of the population uses internet. In developing countries with poor internet usage, such methods might not perform as well.</p>

  <p>Our analysis was at a national level. The data at regional scale might be statistically inferior leading to lower forecast skill.</p>

  <p>Our forecast skill values for ILI forecasts cannot be compared with the corresponding values obtained in the realtime CDC flu prediction challenge [

   <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] since we use unweighted ILI incidence data whereas CDC challenge uses weighted ILI incidence data.

  <p>A recent paper [

  <p>We have not used external factors such as urbanization and environmental factors such as humidity [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and ambient temperature [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] that could play an important role.
