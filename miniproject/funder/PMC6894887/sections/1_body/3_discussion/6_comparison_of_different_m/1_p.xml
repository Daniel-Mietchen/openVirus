<p>Our model differs from the ARGO model in two significant ways. The ARLR method estimates the parameters using the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio algorithm. In ARGO, the lasso method is used to estimate the parameters. The improved performance of ARLR method in forecasting dengue and ILI incidences can therefore be explained based on the comparison in the Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007518.s001">S1 Text</xref>) between the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio and lasso algorithms. In our model, the removal of the seasonal effect is carried out through a systematic process. In ARGO, this is achieved in an ad-hoc manner by incorporating lags at months 12 and 24 in the autoregressive model. Further, in ARGO, the regularization parameter is estimated using a cross-validation process. Since this is a random process, the values of the regularization parameter obtained each time are different. Hence the forecast values and the forecast error measures can differ from run to run. This drawback is absent in our method.
