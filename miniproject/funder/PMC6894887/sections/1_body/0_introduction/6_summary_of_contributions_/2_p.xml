<p>We apply the method for fitting a sparse vector autoregressive model to dengue and ILI case counts time series data. Further, we adopt a comprehensive method to remove the seasonal component before applying the regression model. For both dengue and ILI, we use exactly the same data as was used for investigating the ARGO method [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This data has been made publicly available by authors of the ARGO method and this facilitates direct comparison of our method with the ARGO and other methods.
