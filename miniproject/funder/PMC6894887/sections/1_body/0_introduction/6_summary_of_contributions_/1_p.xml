<p>In this paper, we focus on a time series modelling approach to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. The standard time series methods for fitting models such as autoregressive models yield dense models. In other words, most of the regressor coefficients (model parameters) are non-zero. However, in the context of forecasting dengue and ILI incidences, it is important to have sparse models representing the data. There are several reasons for this. Using only the past incidence data to forecast future values may not be adequate since the forecast accuracies may not be high [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It should be added that this need not always be the case [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In general, one hopes [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to improve forecast accuracies by including additional sources of data such as frequencies of search terms from Google Trends data (

Each such additional source of data leads to additional parameters that need to be estimated from the data. However, the amount of data available is typically insufficient to robustly estimate the required parameter values. Hence we need to represent this data using sparse models. A standard method for obtaining sparse models is the lasso method [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The lasso method has been implemented in the ARGO method [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. We implement a computationally efficient method for variable selection, in order to obtain sparse representations of the data, that outperforms the lasso method. This is demonstrated by fitting autoregressive models using both the lasso method and our method to synthetic time series data generated from sparse models. We find that our method recovers the underlying sparse model with much greater accuracy than the lasso method.
