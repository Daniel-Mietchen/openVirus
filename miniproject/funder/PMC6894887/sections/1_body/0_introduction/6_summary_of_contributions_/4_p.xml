<p>The combination of the sparse representation technique and multiple data sources that we use yields a forecasting method that outperforms other competing methods in terms of forecast error measures. More specifically, our method achieves an average of 18% reduction in the forecast error over the ARGO method which is a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. Our method is general and could also be used to forecast other disease outbreaks.</p>
