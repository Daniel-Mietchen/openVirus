<p>We quantify the uncertainties in our nowcast estimates of ILI incidence. In particular, we investigate the effect of “backfill” [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on the forecasting accuracy. ILI incidence values are subject to backfill [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] which corresponds to a retroactive revision of ILI data as better and additional data becomes available later. In particular, the initial ILI estimates can be revised by up to ±25%. These revisions can continue for as long as 40 weeks after the publication of the initial estimates before they stabilize [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
