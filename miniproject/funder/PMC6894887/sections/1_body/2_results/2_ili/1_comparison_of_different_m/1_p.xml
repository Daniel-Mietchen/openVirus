<p>The standard forecast error measures defined above are computed for all the methods. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. As before, rather than displaying the actual error, the ratio of the error for a given method to the error for the naive method is shown. The actual error values are given in parenthesis only for the naive method. The smaller the ratio, the better the performance of corresponding method. Results for RMS errors in predicting peak value and peak time for each season are shown in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. The naive method is not included for the reasons stated earlier. As before, it should be noted that we do not predict the peak values and peak times at the start of the season but obtain them in a post-facto manner after we have the forecast values for the entire season. The same procedure is followed for all the methods. Finally the RMS errors for two-week, three-week, and four-week ahead forecasts for the top two methods (ARLR and ARGO) are compared with those for the naive method in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>. As usual, the ratio of the RMS error for a given method to the RMS error for the naive method is shown. The results for other error measures (MAE and MAPE) are similar.
