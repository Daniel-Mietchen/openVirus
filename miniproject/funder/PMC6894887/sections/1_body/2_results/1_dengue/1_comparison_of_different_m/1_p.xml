<p>The standard forecast error measures defined above are computed for all the methods and for each country/state. The results are summarized in Tables 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Rather than displaying the actual error, the ratio of the error for a given method to the error for the naive method is shown for each country. The actual error values are given in parenthesis only for the naive method. The smaller the ratio, the better the performance of corresponding method.
