<p>In addition to the forecast errors studied above, one could also consider errors in predicting other relevant epidemic features like peak value and peak time for each season [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Results for RMS errors in predicting these two quantities are shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007518.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>. The naive method is not included since the naive method forecast is just a one time-point offset of the observational time series. Hence, for the naive method the peak value matches exactly with that of observations. Further, the peak time error for the naive method is always 1 month due to the offset. It should be noted that we do not predict the peak values and peak times at the start of the season but obtain them in a post-facto manner after we have the forecast values for the entire season. The same procedure is followed for all the methods.
