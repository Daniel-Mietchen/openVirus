<p>â€¢ Open water is classified as areas in which any aquatic vegetation is submerged, as opposed to woody or herbaceous wetlands. This is not likely to be stagnant water of the type used by Culex mosquitoes for breeding. Therefore, the negative association between proportion of open water and WNV cases is most likely due to the fact that open water, as defined, does not favor the mosquito population. We have noted this in the discussion (434-438).</p>
