<p>Using MIR calculations from all traps, we developed continuous surface maps for MIR for each week and year using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation technique in ArcGIS 10.1. From this interpolated surface map for each year and week, the average, minimum, and maximum MIR for each hexagon was calculated using the zonal statistics as table function in ArcGIS 10.1. A model builder platform using iteration features in ArcGIS 10.1 was used to run these processes.</p>
