<p>Mosquito testing data from 2005 to 2016 were obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) through a user agreement. The IDPH collates the data from local public health agencies and mosquito abatement districts across Illinois and maintains a statewide database for the results from WNV mosquito testing. The IDPH developed a mosquito surveillance protocol that local health and mosquito abatement districts are expected to follow in order to standardize the mosquito collection and testing across the state. In general, the local agencies collect vector mosquitoes with gravid traps, identify the sex and species of the mosquitoes, and make pools of up to 50 mosquitoes of a single species from those captured in each trap to test for the presence of WNV infection. When fewer then 50 mosquitoes are captured, a pool will consist of fewer than 50 mosquitoes. During the study period, the common tests used to identify WNV in mosquitoes included antigen assays, VecTest or the Rapid Analyte Measurement Platform (RAMP) test. Some pools were also tested by Real Time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In instances when a pool was tested using more than one type of test, only the RT-PCR results were used in the analysis. Our analysis used only the test results from pools of female 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Not all mosquitoes were identified to species prior to testing; however, the majority of 
 <italic>Culex</italic> collected in this region belong to the species 
 <italic>Cx</italic>.
