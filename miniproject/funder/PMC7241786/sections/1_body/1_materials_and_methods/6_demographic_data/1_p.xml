<p>The demographic variables included were total population, racial composition, housing age, and income level. The total population and racial composition included the number of White, African American, Asian, and Hispanic people at the census block level, as reported in the 2010 U.S. Census. The racial population data was converted to the percentage of White, African American, Asian, and Hispanic people in each hexagon. The income data for the block group level were obtained from the 2015 American Community Survey. Housing age was included as the proportions of housing built in different time periods, which was obtained at the block group level from the 2015 American Community Survey. We divided housing age into four different time-periods: pre-World War II houses (built before 1939), post-World War II houses (built between 1940 and 1969), houses built between 1970 and 1989, and houses built after 1990. These demographic data were processed in ArcGIS using the intersection tool to calculate a parameter for each hexagon.</p>
