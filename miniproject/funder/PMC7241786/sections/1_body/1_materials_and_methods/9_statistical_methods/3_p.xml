<p>For the spatiotemporal statistical model, the outcome variable was the presence/ absence of a human WNV case in each hexagon for each year and week. The predictors included 32 variables related to weather, land cover, mosquito infection and demography (

The land cover variables include 15 categories, the proportion for each hexagon of: developed open space; developed low, medium, and high intensity urban areas; deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests; barren land; shrubs; grassland; pasture; cultivated crops; woody wetlands; herbaceous wetlands; and open water. The mosquito infection data included the average MIR with lags of one to four weeks for each hexagon for each year and week. Demographic variables for each hexagon included the proportion of White, African American, Asian, and Hispanic population and the average median household income. In total, there were 1.44 million rows of data (5017 hexagons * 12 years * 24 weeks). A correlation matrix among all variables was created to evaluate multicollinearity before running the model. As our response variable was binary (presence or absence of WNV human cases), we used mixed effects multiple logistic regression with stepwise selection for the statistical analysis, with hexagons as a random variable. We used the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in the SAS statistical software. An Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to choose the best model [
