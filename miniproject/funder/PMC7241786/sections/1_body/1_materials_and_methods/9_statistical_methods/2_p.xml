<p>To visualize the spatial patterns of human illness over time, we first developed choropleth maps of WNV cases. Then, we used local Moranâ€™s I method using an inclusive second order queen contiguity weight matrix in the spatial analysis software GeoDa to further identify the spatial clusters of cumulative human WNV cases from 2005 to 2016. We also examined differences in results using neighboring cells and rook contiguity weight matrix, but the results did not vary.</p>
