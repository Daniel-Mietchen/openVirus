<p>We also found increased MIR up to four weeks earlier will increase the probability of an area being positive for a WNV human case. The temporal association between lagged MIR and human WNV cases is relatively well established [

In our current analysis, we found that areas with a higher percentage of white population had a higher probability of being positive for WNV, which has also been observed in a previous study of this [
