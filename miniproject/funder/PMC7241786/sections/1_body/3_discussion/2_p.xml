<p>The temporal variation in the weekly human WNV cases was strongly correlated with MIR of one to four weeks earlier, with a correlation of one week earlier being the strongest. This finding was similar to our earlier model based on Illinois climate divisions, in which Division 2 includes our current study area [

The similarity in the correlation may be due to the fact that the data for Climate Division 2 were dominated by the data from Cook and DuPage, as these counties have more intensive surveillance compared to other Illinois counties. However, similar observations were also found in Ontario, Canada, where MIR of one week earlier was most strongly correlated with the weekly variation in human WNV cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study, we also found that the correlations between weekly MIR and human cases increased in high WNV years, which was also observed in a study conducted in Long Island, New York [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This is understandable, as stochastic variability decreases with increased numbers of cases, allowing for more precise estimation.
