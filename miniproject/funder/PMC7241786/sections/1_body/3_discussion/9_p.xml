<p>In conclusion, our analysis helped to better understand the fine-scale dynamic drivers of WNV transmission in an urban environment. The dynamic interplay between temperature and precipitation, mosquito infection, land cover, and demographic characteristics determine the probability of an area having a WNV case or not. Additionally, we established an important temporal relationship between cumulative mosquito positive pools and mid-summer average MIR with the total annual human WNV cases. This information can be used as a guideline to develop a threshold for public health intervention.</p>
