<p>We identified important fine-scale drivers of spatiotemporal variability in the human WNV cases in Chicago region, Illinois, an area of ongoing WNV transmission. Our analysis used long-term data on human illness, mosquito surveillance, weather, landscape, and demographic data. We found significant spatial clusters of human WNV cases within this urban environment. We also found a strong correlation between the weekly MIR of earlier weeks and weekly human WNV cases, and further developed predictive temporal models using mid-summer average MIR and cumulative positive mosquito pools which can be used to estimate the total annual human WNV cases.</p>
