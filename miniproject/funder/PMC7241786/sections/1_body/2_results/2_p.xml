<p>We found a strong temporal relationship between the MIR of previous weeks and human WNV cases in the study region (
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227160.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The strongest correlation (r = 0.837) was with MIR at a one-week lag (
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The strength of the correlation was stronger (r = 0.884) in the subset of high infection years (2005, 2006, 2012, and 2016) and relatively lower (r = 0.737) in low years (
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). When evaluated for only 2012, when case counts were highest, the correlation between MIR and human WNV cases was also the highest (r = 0.899). In both high and low years, the strength of the correlation gradually declined with the number of weeks lagged and there was almost no correlation with MIR after lags of four weeks.
