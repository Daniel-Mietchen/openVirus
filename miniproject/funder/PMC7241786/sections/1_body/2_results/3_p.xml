<p>We found that the MIR of mid-summer (weeks 28â€“33) was able to explain 93% of the variability in total annual human cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227160.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The model predicted 44.8 human cases for 2015, compared to 35 actual cases, and 142.7 human cases for 2016 compared to 108 actual cases. Likewise, the cumulative number of positive pools also strongly explained and predicted the total annual human cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227160.g003">Fig 3</xref>); the cumulative number of positive mosquito pools by week 31 explained 93% of the variability in total annual human cases, similar to that explained by mid-summer MIR (
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The model using cumulative positive pools by week 31 predicted 35.1 human cases (vs. 35 actual cases) for 2015 and 102.8 human cases (vs. 108 actual cases) for 2016. The cumulative mosquito positive pools by week 31 thus better predicted the annual human cases than the mid-summer MIR.
