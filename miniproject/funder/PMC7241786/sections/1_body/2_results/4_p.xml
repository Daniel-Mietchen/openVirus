<p>The spatial pattern of human WNV cases in Cook and DuPage counties showed that cases were distributed throughout most areas of the study region at some point during the study period, with some pockets of higher numbers of cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0227160.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Out of the total 5,345 hexagons in the study area, 750 hexagons had experienced at least one case of human WNV case during the years 2005 to 2016. Cumulatively, 123 hexagons had more than one human WNV case, with the maximum number of cases in a hexagon being five (
