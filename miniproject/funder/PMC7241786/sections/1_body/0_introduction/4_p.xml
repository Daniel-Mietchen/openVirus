<p>Weather factors are important drivers of WNV transmission due to their direct effect in mosquito biology. When compared with human WNV cases, higher than normal average annual temperatures are associated with an increased likelihood of higher WNV disease incidence, nationally and in most regions in the United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This relationship was true in Europe, too, where abnormally high July temperature was associated with higher incidence of human WNV cases [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The role of precipitation is often controversial and varies by study regions. For example, higher than normal precipitation was positively associated with higher human WNV cases in the eastern region of the United States, but this relationship was reversed for the western region [

 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], irrigated and agricultural rural areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], urban areas characterized by higher impervious surfaces and storm sewer systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0227160.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and inner suburbs characterized by older houses, moderate vegetation and moderate population [
