<p>Several earlier studies have identified some of the important drivers of WNV transmission in humans. These factors include prior weather conditions and landscape structure that affect the mosquito’s biological responses, the abundance and infection status of the vector mosquitoes, demographic and social characteristic of population, individual human behavior, and the level of public awareness [

For example, an analysis of 12 years of mosquito testing and human illness data in Ontario, Canada showed that, while the mosquito infection rate of one week earlier was the strongest temporal predictor of human risk of WNV, an epidemic threshold based on the cumulative positive
