<p>Instead, it is supposed that high rainfall and high percentage of water bodies in an area may favor mosquito population by increasing their breeding sites, and therefore may lead to increased WNV cases in humans. Hence, a positive correlation between precipitation and water bodies with WNV cases in humans is anticipated. Please comment.</p>
