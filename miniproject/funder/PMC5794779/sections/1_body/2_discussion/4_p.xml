<p id="Par22">The antiviral activity of MxA appears to rely particularly on the presence of IGFBP3 and IFITM2. IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3) binds insulin-like growth factors IGF-1 and IGF-2 circulating in the plasma and modulates their growth-promoting effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, IGFBP3 can interact with the IGFBP-3R receptor thereby acting as tumor suppressor
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>
 </sup> and it can be internalized resulting in alterations of cell signaling
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>
 </sup>. It is unclear how IGFBP3 could increase MxA activity and further studies will be required to determine whether it acts as an ISG, as some of our data suggest. IFITM2 belongs to a protein family, the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein family, which is known for its importance in IAV restriction. IFITM proteins are type-I and type-II IFN-inducible cell-intrinsic restriction factors and were first described to have antiviral functions in 1996 by Alber 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>. More recently their significance in IAV restriction was discovered in a genome-wide siRNA screen
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. However, IFITMs are also active against many other enveloped RNA viruses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>
 </sup>. In humans three IFITMs are IFN-inducible and display antiviral properties, namely IFITM1, 2 and 3
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>
 </sup>. IAV restriction is mainly mediated by IFITM3, which has similar potency to MxA
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>, while IFITM2 shows an intermediate phenotype and IFITM1 only demonstrates minor effects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>
 </sup>. For CCR5-tropic HIV-1 and HCV restriction, however, IFITM1 plays the dominant role which is at least in part due to its localization to the plasma membrane
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. In the case of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 it is believed that IFITM-1 counteracts viral fusion at the plasma membrane to restrict access to the cytosol
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly IFITM3 and IFITM2, which only differ by 12 amino acids, are thought to block fusion of IAV with the endosomal membrane
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore the main mechanism of restriction by IFITMs is by preventing fusion of viral membranes with cellular lipid bilayers, although other mechanisms have also been proposed
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>
 </sup>. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of MxA, IFITM2 is the major IFITM member required for IAV restriction. Interestingly, both IFITM2 and MxA are thought to restrict IAV at similar stages of the virus life cycle, with IFITM2 described to act in the late endosome and MxA directly after release of vRNPs from the late endosome
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, MxA has been shown to associate with membranes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>
 </sup>, therefore it is conceivable that IFITM2 and MxA act in a coordinated sequential fashion in a similar manner as was recently proposed by Narayana 
 <italic>et al</italic>. for IFITM1, 2 and 3
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. This study proposed that IFITMs would trap the virus in the endocytic pathway and eventually redirect it to lysosomal degradation. We propose that MxA might cooperate to a small extent with IFITM3 at the early endosome and more strongly with IFITM2 at the late endosome shortly before vRNP release. Intriguingly, Narayana and colleagues already hypothesized that IFITM2 may associate with unknown host factors to restrict viral replication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>. Apart from IFITM2 and IGFBP3, several other factors were also found to show stronger antiviral effects in the presence of MxA. It is therefore possible that to achieve full viral inhibition all, or several, of the identified factors may have to act in concert with each other, as well as with MxA. Further studies will be required to investigate the individual contribution of these factors and whether a certain combination is needed to fully support the antiviral activity of MxA.
