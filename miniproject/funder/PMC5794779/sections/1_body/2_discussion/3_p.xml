<p id="Par21">A transcriptome analysis on IAV-infected SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified 140 genes that strongly depend on the presence of SMARCA2. By far the most significantly enriched gene category was interferon-α response-associated genes, further validating the importance of SMARCA2 to ISG expression, even in the absence of SMARCA4. Cui and colleagues demonstrated that SMARCA4 in HeLa cells constitutively binds to the promoters of the ISGs IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 resulting in basal level expression and rapid and strong induction upon IFN-α stimulation

 </sup>. We show that the same genes are regulated by SMARCA2 in A549 cells. Finally, we determined that 9 of these SMARCA2-regulated factors are required for full antiviral activity of MxA: ARHGEF10L, IFITM2, IFITM3, IGFBP3, KCNK3, PARP10, RARRES3, SAMD9L and UBE2L6. The application of low levels of IFN-α in these experiments allowed for a larger assay window when detecting ISGs, and this may account for why we failed to detect these factors in the primary RNAi screen. Intriguingly 6 of the 9 host cell factors are ISGs

 </sup> and 2 factors, KCNK3 and IGFBP3, are induced in response to IFN in virus infected cells, so may be either IFN- or virus-inducible. As expected some factors display antiviral activity in the absence of MxA too (e.g. IFITM3, IGFBP3, IFITM2) but others seem to strictly depend on the presence of MxA, such as KCNK3, PARP10 and UBE2L6. Nonetheless, in all cases, the IAV restriction potency of these factors is increased in A549-MxA cells.
