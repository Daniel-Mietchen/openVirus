<p id="Par19">The MxA GTPase is a potent IFN-inducible restriction factor, inhibiting early steps of the influenza A virus (IAV) replication cycle. In the absence of MxA the ribonucleoprotein-organized viral genome is rapidly transported to the nucleus where viral transcription and genome replication takes place, but this is blocked in the presence of MxA. Although postulated

 </sup>, it remains to be shown whether other cellular factors are involved in mediating the antiviral effects of MxA. We therefore conducted parallel RNAi and protein interaction screens to identify potential MxA cofactors and identified a network of 13 factors supported by both screens. We focused on one particular factor, SMARCA2, which was validated as being required for efficient MxA restriction of both H5N1 and H7N7 IAVs.
