<p id="Par31">The results from both genomic and proteomic screens were combined and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®, Qiagen) to look at the gene ontology, canonical pathways, regulators and protein-protein interaction enrichment. Considering all terms with p-value &lt; 0.01, we identified 13 factors present in all enrichment categories. A protein-protein interaction network showing the physical interactions within these 13 factors was also generated using IPA® (Qiagen).</p>
