<p id="Par30">Digested peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an Easy-nLC 1000 coupled to a dual-pressure linear ion trap (Velos Pro) Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Online LC separation was performed using a 75 µm × 25 cm fused silica IntegraFrit capillary packed with 1.9 µm Reprosil-Pur C18 AQ reversed-phase resin (Dr. Maisch-GmbH). Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 5% to 30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid in 110 minutes delivered at a flow rate of 300 nL/minute. For each cycle, one full MS scan (150–1500 m/z, resolution of 120,000) in the Orbitrap was followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans fragmented by normalized collision energy (setting of 35%) and acquired in the linear ion trap. Target ions already acquired in MS/MS scans were dynamically excluded for 20 seconds. Raw MS files were analyzed by MaxQuant

Multiplicity was set to 1 and a false discovery rate of 0.01 imposed for peptide and protein identification. Normalization of raw peptide intensities and protein level abundance inference were calculated using the linear mixed-effects model built into the MSstats R package version 3.3.10
