 </sup>. Briefly, the splice donor and splice acceptor sites in the NS gene-encoding sequence were silenced. The overlapping NS1 and the NEP open reading frames were separated and the Renilla luciferase-encoding sequence was introduced in between. To obtain 3 separated gene products porcine teschovirus-1 2A peptide-encoding sequences were introduced in between the 3 ORFs (for a more detailed description also see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>). The same procedure was applied to generate the H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) Renilla luciferase virus. However, in this case a virus encoding a monobasic HA cleavage site was generated by altering the cleavage site as described previously

 </sup>. All recombinant viruses were plaque purified on MDCKII cells. Virus stocks were either prepared on MDCKII cells or in 8 days old embryonated chicken eggs and titers were determined by plaque assay.
