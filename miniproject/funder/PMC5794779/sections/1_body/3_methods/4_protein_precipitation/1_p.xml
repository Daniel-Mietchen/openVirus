<p id="Par27">A549-Strep-MxA and A549-Strep-GFP cells were seeded in 15 cm dishes and treated with doxycycline (1 μg/mL) for 24 h before infection with the H5N1 Renilla luciferase virus (MOI of 8). 24 h later, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1 mL cold lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (EDTA-free, Roche), 1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosStop, Roche)]. To assist with lysis of the nuclear compartment, the lysates were frozen at −80 °C and thawed prior to immunoprecipitation.</p>
