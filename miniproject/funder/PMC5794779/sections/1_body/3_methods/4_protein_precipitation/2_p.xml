<p id="Par28">Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 3500 × g for 20 min. 50 µL of cleared supernatant was retained as an ‘Input’ sample. The remaining 950 µL was added to 550 µL IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) containing 20 µL equivalent bead volume of Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences). Affinity tag binding proceeded with rotation at 4 °C for 2 hours. Beads were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 minutes. 50 µL of cleared supernatant was retained as an ‘Unbound Flow Through’ sample, and the remaining supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed twice in IP buffer containing 0.05% NP-40 and twice in IP buffer with no detergent.</p>
