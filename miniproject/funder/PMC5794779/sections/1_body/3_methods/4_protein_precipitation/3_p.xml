<p id="Par29">Streptactin-purified proteins were reduced and alkylated on beads with 20 µL reduction-alkylation buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 2 M Urea, 1 mM DTT, 3 mM iodoacetamide] and incubated in the dark for 45 minutes with gentle shaking. An additional 3 mM DTT was added to quench the reaction, and proteins were digested with 0.75 µg trypsin (Invitrogen) overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the beads were centrifuged at 300 × g for 3 minutes. The peptide-containing supernatant was collected and formic acid was added to a final concentration of 1% to acidify the peptides. Peptides were desalted using Agilent OMIX C18 10 µL tips according to the manufacturer’s protocol with the following modifications. Briefly, tips were conditioned with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and then equilibrated by two rinses with 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were bound by repeated pipetting, rinsed twice in 0.1% formic acid, and eluted in 50% acetonitrile. A second elution in 90% acetonitrile was used to ensure complete recovery. Peptides were dried under vacuum centrifugation and suspended in 12 µL of 3.0% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.</p>
