<p id="Par34">Illumina HiSeq. 50â€‰bp single-end reads from RNA-Seq libraries were first adaptor trimmed and then analyzed using the TopHat and Cufflinks software. TopHat (v2.0.13) was utilized for alignment of short reads to the reference genome. To analyze gene expression, Cufflinks (v2.2.1) was utilized for transcript assembly and differential expression, and cummeRbund (v2.0.0) for visualization of differential analysis. Default parameters were used.</p>
