<p id="Par26">A primary genome-wide screen assessing the role of 18119 genes was performed using siRNA pools of 4 siRNAs transfected into A549-MxA. A non-targeting siRNA (GE Dharmacon D-001810-10) and an MxA-targeting siRNA (Qiagen SI05459538) served as negative and positive control, respectively. The cells were seeded in 384-well plates (2800 cells/well) and reverse transfected with siRNAs (final concentration 10 nM) using DharmaFECT4 transfection reagent (0.125 µL/well). Each 384-well plate was run in triplicate. After 72 hours, the cells were infected with the H5N1 Renilla luciferase reporter virus at an MOI of 8 for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was analyzed by adding Renilla luciferase substrate (5 µl, Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and read using the Envision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer). A secondary screen was performed on 276 genes by individually transfecting the 4 siRNAs from the pool used in the primary screen. The rest of the procedure was performed as described above. The siRNAs library plates were provided by GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc. (human siGENOME SMARTpool library G-005005) and siRNAs were resuspended at a concentration of 2 μM. A non-targeting siRNA (NT, GE Dharmacon, D-001810-10) and an siRNA targeting MxA (MX1 gene) (Qiagen, SI0559538) were used as negative and positive controls respectively.</p>
