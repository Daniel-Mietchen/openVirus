<p id="Par32">A549-MxA cells were seeded in 96-well plates (7600 cells/well) and reverse transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (0.2 μL/well) at a final siRNA concentration of 30 nM. 72 hours after transfection cells were infected with the H5N1 Renilla luciferase reporter virus at an MOI of 8 for 24 hours. Luciferase activity was analyzed by adding 20 µl luciferase substrate (Renilla-Glo Luciferase Assay System, Promega) per well and read using the Glomax multiplus plate reader (Promega) or the Infinite M200 Microplate reader (Tecan). All experiments were performed at least in technical triplicates.</p>
