 <sup>5</sup> A549-MxA cells were transfected with a non-targeting control siRNA or a SMARCA2-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon D-017253-01) in triplicate. 72 h after transfection cells were infected with H5N1 wild type virus (A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004) at an MOI of 1 for 24 h. Cells were harvested in DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, cat. #R1100-50) and total RNA was extracted using Quick-RNA Miniprep Plus Kit from Zymo Research (cat. #R1057). 3 µg total RNA from each sample was treated with the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic Gold Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) from Illumina (cat. #MRZG126) and libraries were prepared from rRNA depleted samples using ScriptSeq™ v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit from Illumina (Cat. #SSV21106). RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq to a sequencing depth of 40–50 million reads (50 bp single-read).
