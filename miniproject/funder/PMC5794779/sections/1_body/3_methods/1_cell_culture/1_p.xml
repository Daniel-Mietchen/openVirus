 </sup> (kindly provided by Richard E. Randall, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK), and A549 cells stably expressing streptavidin-tagged MxA (A549-Strep-MxA) or streptavidin-tagged GFP (A549-Strep-GFP) were generated as described below and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM medium with FBS (10%) and penicillin-streptomycin (1%). Canine MDCKII cells used for virus titration were cultured under the same conditions.
