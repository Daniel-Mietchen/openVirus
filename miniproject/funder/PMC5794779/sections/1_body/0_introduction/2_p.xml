<p id="Par3">Influenza A viruses have a segmented RNA genome of negative polarity with each genomic segment organized as a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) consisting of the viral RNA, the three polymerase subunits, PB2, PB1 and PA, and the viral nucleoprotein (NP) which is required for encapsidation of the viral RNA

 </sup>. Following virus entry, the viral NP mediates rapid nuclear translocation of vRNPs, a property enabling IAV to evade cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and granting access to the nuclear splicing machinery required for the expression of certain viral genes

 </sup>. Initially, the IAV polymerase synthesizes mRNA transcripts which are translated into viral proteins at cytosolic ribosomes. Once a sufficient amount of newly synthesized viral protein (in particular PB2, PB1, PA and NP) has been made and imported into the nucleus, the viral polymerase switches to synthesis of complementary RNA which is encapsidated into complementary RNPs (cRNPs) during this process. These cRNPs in turn serve as intermediates for synthesis of new vRNPs which are finally exported from the nucleus to be packaged into new viral particles at the plasma membrane
