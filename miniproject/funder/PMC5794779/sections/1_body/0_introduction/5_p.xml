<p id="Par6">Avian influenza viruses, including the subtypes H5N1 and H7N7, are highly sensitive to MxA, but the finding that human-adapted IAV are able to partially escape the antiviral effect of MxA through mutations in NP suggested that restriction might be mediated through direct physical binding of IAV NP to MxA
