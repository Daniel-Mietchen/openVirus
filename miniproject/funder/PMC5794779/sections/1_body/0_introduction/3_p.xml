<p id="Par4">An intact innate immune response is critical for restriction of viral replication and survival, as exemplified not only in animal experiments but also by more severe disease progression seen in young children with mutations in crucial innate immune genes

 </sup>. After recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA, the cell responds by secreting type I and III interferons. These interferons bind to their respective receptors leading to JAK-STAT signaling and eventually to induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), of which some have direct effector activity against particular viruses

 </sup>. The speed of the antiviral response is critical to prevent further virus spread. Therefore, most ISG promoters, which would otherwise be covered by nucleosomes and not be available for immediate access, are “primed” for rapid transcriptional activation through the bound SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex)

 </sup>. The promotor-bound BAF complex not only facilitates rapid induction but also basal level expression and, upon stimulation, induction of ISGs to a higher extent.
