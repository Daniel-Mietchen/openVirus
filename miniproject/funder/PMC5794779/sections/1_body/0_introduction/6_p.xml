 </sup>. However, their experimental setup required IFN pretreatment in addition to MxA overexpression, suggesting that additional ISGs are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses. In line with that, the related human paralog of MxA, MxB, similarly depends on host cell factors for its anti-HIV-1 activity, as it loses its ability to prevent viral DNA from entering the nucleus and integrating into the genome in the absence of cyclophilin A
