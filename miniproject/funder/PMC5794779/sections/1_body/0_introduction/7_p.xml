<p id="Par8">Here, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen and a proteomic screen to identify potential MxA cofactors required for the antiviral activity of human MxA, and we identified SMARCA2 as essential for the antiviral effect of MxA against H5N1 and H7N7 viruses. SMARCA2 is the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex), the complex known to reside on promoters of many ISGs thereby facilitating their induction. Our data show that SMARCA2 is required for the induction of an antiviral state in IFN-treated cells but that induction of MxA 
 <italic>per se</italic> is not affected by the absence of SMARCA2. A transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a large number of SMARCA2-regulated genes, of which many are ISGs. Several of these factors, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3, were required for efficient inhibition of viral replication in A549-MxA cells. Therefore, our data demonstrate that several SMARCA2-dependent ISGs act in concert to facilitate the antiviral activity of MxA against influenza A viruses.
