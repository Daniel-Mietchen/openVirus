<p id="Par13">ZC3HAV1 is a restriction factor with a broad antiviral spectrum. However, its activity against IAV is only modest

 </sup> and there is no information about its relevance to MxA restriction. Similarly, for CASP9, an initiator caspase required for the apoptotic pathway, neither association with MxA nor IAV has been shown. SMARCA2 is an ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, a complex required for the induction of many genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with anti-IAV activity

 </sup>. To verify that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for the antiviral activity of MxA, but do not act as MxA-independent restriction factors, we made use of A549 wild type cells (A549-wt) and the established cell line A549-shMxA which stably overexpresses a short hairpin RNA targeting MxA (shMxA)

 </sup>. Due to the stable expression of shMxA even MxA induced by viral infection is expected to be immediately silenced. Upon infection with H5N1-RL or a Renilla-expressing reporter virus based on the MxA-sensitive IAV strain A/seal/Massachusetts/1/1980

 </sup> (H7N7-RL), high reporter activity was observed in A549-wt and A549-shMxA cells but replication was considerably reduced in A549-MxA cells due to the presence of MxA (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5a</xref>). siRNA knockdown of MxA (MX1), CASP9 and SMARCA2 increased reporter activity of both viruses by up to ~6-fold and at least 2-fold in A549-MxA cells (2 out of 4 siRNAs increasing reporter activity) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b</xref>). On the other hand, in A549-shMxA and A549-wt cells such an increase was not observed upon RNAi-mediated depletion. These data suggest that MxA requires the presence of SMARCA2 and CASP9 to efficiently restrict influenza A viruses and in the absence of MxA, SMARCA2 and CASP9 do not display antiviral properties.
