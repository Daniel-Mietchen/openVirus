<p id="Par12">In the genomic and proteomic screens, we identified 41 and 15 host cell factors, respectively. Although comparison of the resulting hits shows no direct overlap, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®, Qiagen) we were able to identify a network of 13 host cell factors (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), including MxA, that are significantly enriched amongst the dataset when analyzed for representation in canonical pathways, upstream regulators and protein-protein interaction networks (p-value &lt; 0.05, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c,d</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4a</xref>). Within this network of 13 factors, 7 (including MxA) were identified in the siRNA screen and 6 in the proteomic screen. To validate the requirement of these 13 factors for MxA antiviral activity, we transfected A549-MxA cells with siRNAs targeting the respective gene (4 siRNAs per gene). Following infection with H5N1-RL, luciferase activity was measured to assess the antiviral effect. We considered a factor to be validated if at least 2 out of 4 siRNAs significantly increased virus replication by 90% (Log2FC ≥ 0.93, p-value &lt; 0.05) compared to a non-targeting (NT) control siRNA (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4b</xref>). Those criteria were only met by SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 (also known as ZAP) and CASP9. As these data were generated in the presence of MxA they suggest that SMARCA2, ZC3HAV1 and CASP9 are required for efficient MxA restriction of H5N1, however, they may also have an antiviral effect independent of MxA.
