<p id="Par11">In parallel with the RNAi-mediated approach of identifying host factors required for MxA activity we employed a second strategy aimed at identifying host cell factors that interact with MxA. Experimental conditions were largely maintained to allow a combined bioinformatic analysis of siRNA screening and proteomic screening data at a later step. The antiviral activity of Mx proteins is not affected by the addition of amino-terminal tags

 </sup>. Therefore A549 cells expressing amino-terminally streptavidin-tagged MxA (Strep-MxA) under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter were generated alongside control cells expressing Strep-GFP. Strep-MxA and Strep-GFP were induced with doxycycline for 24 hours and the cells were then either infected with H5N1-RL or mock infected in triplicate. 24 hours post infection, cells were lysed and the Strep-tagged proteins precipitated by affinity purification with Strep-Tactin sepharose beads. Precipitated proteins were digested and identified by mass (Fig.

 </sup>. None of the factors were virus-encoded. 15 host cell factors qualified as high-confidence hits based on enrichment with the MxA bait vs. the GFP bait during H5N1-RL infection (Log2FC &gt; 2; p-value &lt; 0.05 under statistical conditions to minimize false negatives or Log2FC &gt; 2; p-value &lt; 0.1 under statistical conditions to minimize false positives) (Supplementary Table
