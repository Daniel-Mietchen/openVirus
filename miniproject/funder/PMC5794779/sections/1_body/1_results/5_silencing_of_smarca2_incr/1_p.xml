<p id="Par14">To provide evidence that SMARCA2 is required for the antiviral activity of MxA not only in the context of a reporter virus but also with wild type virus infection, we performed siRNA knockdown as before and infected A549-MxA cells and A549-shMxA cells with the MxA-sensitive H5N1 strain A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004 at an MOI of 0.001

 </sup>. 36 hours post infection viral titers were measured by plaque assay and knockdown efficiency was determined by western blot analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Silencing of MxA (MX1) in A549-MxA cells elevated the virus titer by approximately 3 log
 <sub>10</sub> compared to cells treated with the non-targeting control siRNA (NT), in which the virus was restricted to ~5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mL due to MxA overexpression. Knockdown of SMARCA2 using the most efficient siRNA (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b,d</xref>) resulted in &gt;1 log
 <sub>10</sub> increase in viral titer relative to siNT in A549-MxA cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The combination of SMARCA2 and MxA knockdown did not result in a further increase of viral titer over the level of siMxA alone, which is similar to that observed with both wild-type and reporter viruses in siSMARCA2-treated A549-shMxA cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e,f</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5b</xref>). In summary these data confirm that SMARCA2 is required for efficient antiviral activity of MxA in the context of an H5N1 wild type virus infection.
