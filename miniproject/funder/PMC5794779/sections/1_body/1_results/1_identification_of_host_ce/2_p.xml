<p id="Par10">An arrayed genome-wide siRNA library of siRNA pools (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting a total of 18119 human genes was transfected into A549-MxA cells in triplicate. 72 hours post transfection cells were infected with the H5N1-RL reporter virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 8, and 24 h later luciferase activity was determined utilizing Renilla-Glo (Promega) substrate (Fig.

 </sup> and hits were selected based on an average Z-score &gt;2 across triplicates (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b,c</xref>). This resulted in the identification of 276 primary hits (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To exclude off-target effects those hits were further validated in a secondary siRNA screen by individually transfecting the 4 siRNAs from each pool (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>). The SSMD was used to validate each plate and the results were analyzed using Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) statistical analysis

 </sup> which assigns a p-value to each gene based on the effect of its four siRNAs. Hits were selected based on a p-value &lt; 0.05. Using these methods, we identified 41 genes, including the MxA-encoding gene MX1, whose knockdown led to a significant (p-value &lt; 0.05) increase in virus growth in A549-MxA cells (Supplementary Table
