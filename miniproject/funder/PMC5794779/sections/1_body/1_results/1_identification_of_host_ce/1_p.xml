<p id="Par9">To identify factors required for the antiviral activity of MxA, we developed a genome-wide siRNA screening assay on a well-established A549 human lung epithelial cell line stably over-expressing human MxA (A549-MxA)

 </sup>. Furthermore, to allow utilization of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions several positively charged amino acids were removed from the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site to render it monobasic, and thus classifying the virus as a low pathogenic avian virus (Supplementary Figure

 </sup>. In the presence of MxA, virus replication is inhibited resulting in low levels of RL activity, but upon transfection of an siRNA targeting MxA (silencing the MxA-encoding gene MX1), virus replication is restored and an increase in RL activity is observed (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). The goal of the siRNA screen was to identify siRNAs that restore virus replication in the presence of MxA, so siMX1 served as the positive control and a non-targeting (NT) siRNA as the negative control. The assay was miniaturized to 384-well format and the quality was assessed by measuring the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD)

 </sup>, which accounts for the assay window and variability. The SSMD was calculated as 9.4, confirming a high quality assay suitable for high-throughput screening (Supplementary Figure
