<p id="Par15">SMARCA2 is the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. This complex has been shown to have chromatin remodeling activity either in conjunction with SMARCA2 or another ATPase subunit, SMARCA4, depending on the development stage and cell type investigated

 </sup>. In HeLa cells the SMARCA4-containing BAF complex was shown to be required for induction of 90% of type-I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)

 </sup>), so we aimed to investigate whether SMARCA2 is involved in ISG expression in these cells. A549-wt cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting MxA, JAK1, or SMARCA2 and then treated, or not, with 1000 U/mL IFN-α 48 h after siRNA transfection. 24 h after IFN treatment, the cells were challenged with H7N7-RL. In the absence of IFN no enhancement of viral replication was observed relative to the non-targeting (NT) control siRNA (Fig.

 </sup> and required for the IFN-mediated induction of all ISGs, led to a significant increase in viral replication (~15-fold), while knockdown of the single ISG, MxA, elevated viral replication by about 2-fold (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Intriguingly, knockdown of SMARCA2 resulted in a ~10-fold increase in virus replication, suggesting that SMARCA2 is indeed required for the establishment of an IFN-inducible antiviral state in A549 cells.
