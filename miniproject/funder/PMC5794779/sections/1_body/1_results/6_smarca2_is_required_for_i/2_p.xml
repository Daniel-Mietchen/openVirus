<p id="Par16">One explanation may be that, as for JAK1, SMARCA2 is required for MxA expression along with other ISGs. Indeed, in the case of JAK1 knockdown, MxA expression is substantially diminished as determined by western blot analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). But surprisingly SMARCA2 depletion does not alter MxA induction by IFN. This finding leads us to conclude that SMARCA2 is required for robust induction of ISG(s) other than MxA which in turn support the antiviral activity of MxA. Thus, in the absence of SMARCA2, cells expressing MxA should show increased susceptibility to IAV infection. Analysis of SMARCA2-silenced A549-wt cells pretreated with 1000 U/mL IFN-α 24 h prior to H7N7-RL infection revealed that in fact 8.6% of cells were positive for both MxA and viral nucleoprotein (NP), compared to 0.1% in the non-targeting (NT) control knockdown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6b</xref>). Based on these findings we hypothesize that SMARCA2 facilitates the induction of one or several ISG(s) which in turn support the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV.
