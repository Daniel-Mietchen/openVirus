<p id="Par18">A total of 144 genes were selected for validation based on the extent of their downregulation after SMARCA2 depletion (top 104 genes with Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &lt; −3.57, corresponding to &gt;12-fold downregulation) and their identification as ISGs (interferome.org) in A549 cells (50 genes with Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &lt; −2) as well as other cell lines (48 genes with Log
 <sub>2</sub>FC &lt; −3.5). Another 15 handpicked genes were added, including controls such as SMARCA2, and finally, pseudogenes were filtered out. To investigate which of the SMARCA2-regulated factors are required for the antiviral activity of MxA, siRNA pools were used to silence each gene in A549-MxA cells which were subsequently infected with H7N7-RL. To ensure sufficient induction of the selected factors (and thus allow for knockdown) the cells received 25 U/mL IFN-α 6 h prior to infection, which was the minimal amount found to reduce viral reporter activity (indicative of ISG induction) without diminishing it completely (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7a</xref>). None of the siRNAs had cytotoxic effects (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7b</xref>). The effect of each siRNA pool on virus replication +/− IFN was determined and ranked according to the strongest increase in viral replication (green) in the absence of IFN (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7b</xref>). As expected, although the general pattern was similar, greater effects were observed in the presence of IFN, with MxA depletion enhancing replication by 5.9-fold and knockdown of SMARCA2 by 11.2-fold. Several factors displayed clear effects, such as IGFBP3, which increased viral replication by 8-fold upon silencing. Most prominently however, knockdown of the ISG IFITM2 resulted in a 9.5-fold increase in viral replication. Knockdown of IFITM3, on the other hand, which is a relative of IFITM2 and known to be a potent IAV restriction factor

 </sup>, showed only a 3.3-fold increase in virus replication under MxA overexpression conditions. In the absence of MxA (A549-shMxA cells) the antiviral effect of IFITM3 is more visible, and stronger than that of IFITM2, when cells are pre-stimulated with IFN (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Generally, the replication-enhancing effects upon knockdown of the most potent SMARCA2-regulated factors appear to depend on the presence of MxA for full effect, as no, or only minor, increases in H7N7-RL reporter activity were observed in A549-shMxA cells, e.g. 2.5-fold with IFITM2 and 3.7-fold with IGFBP3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). To more easily assess whether factors depend on MxA we calculated the ratio of the relative reporter activity between A549-MxA and A549-shMxA cells either with or without IFN-pretreatment and considered all factors with a ratio &gt;2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). The factors with the strongest evidence for being MxA co-factors are: ARHGEF10L, IFITM2, IFITM3, IGFBP3, KCNK3, PARP10, RARRES3, SAMD9L and UBE2L6. In summary these data identify several factors, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3, as SMARCA2-regulated, virus-inducible factors required for IAV restriction by MxA.
