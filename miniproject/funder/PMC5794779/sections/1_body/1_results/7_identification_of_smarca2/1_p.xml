<p id="Par17">To identify SMARCA2-regulated ISGs we performed a transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells. Either siSMARCA2- or siNT-treated A549-MxA cells were infected with wild type H5N1 virus (A/Thailand/1(KAN-1)/2004) at an MOI of 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). 24 h post infection cells were harvested, RNA was extracted and after rRNA depletion subjected to mRNA sequencing. 140 host mRNAs were identified as being downregulated by at least 10-fold and as much as 126-fold in siSMARCA2-treated A549-MxA cells (Supplementary Table

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) which is in line with our previous finding that SMARCA2 is required for establishment of an antiviral state (Fig.
