To date the mechanism for how MxA exerts its antiviral activity is unclear, however, additional cellular factors are believed to be essential for this activity. To identify MxA cofactors we performed a genome-wide siRNA-based screen in human airway epithelial cells (A549) constitutively expressing MxA using an H5N1 reporter virus. These data were complemented with a proteomic screen to identify MxA-interacting proteins. The combined data identified SMARCA2, the ATPase subunit of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, as a crucial factor required for the antiviral activity of MxA against IAV. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that although SMARCA2 is essential for expression of some IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the establishment of an antiviral state, it is not required for expression of MxA, suggesting an indirect effect on MxA activity. Transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a small set of SMARCA2-regulated factors required for activity of MxA, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3. These findings reveal that several virus-inducible factors work in concert to enable MxA restriction of IAV.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Influenza A viruses (IAV) are severe human pathogens all originating from their avian reservoir. Human-adapted IAV are the cause of annual epidemics but rarely also cause pandemics with millions of people succumbing to infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The recent emergence of &#x0201c;bird flu&#x0201d; viruses of the H5N1 and H7N9 subtype, with fatality rates among humans ranging up to ~50%, raises concern that these avian viruses might acquire the ability to transmit from human-to-human and initiate the next pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Influenza A viruses have a segmented RNA genome of negative polarity with each genomic segment organized as a viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) consisting of the viral RNA, the three polymerase subunits, PB2, PB1 and PA, and the viral nucleoprotein (NP) which is required for encapsidation of the viral RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Following virus entry, the viral NP mediates rapid nuclear translocation of vRNPs, a property enabling IAV to evade cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and granting access to the nuclear splicing machinery required for the expression of certain viral genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Initially, the IAV polymerase synthesizes mRNA transcripts which are translated into viral proteins at cytosolic ribosomes. Once a sufficient amount of newly synthesized viral protein (in particular PB2, PB1, PA and NP) has been made and imported into the nucleus, the viral polymerase switches to synthesis of complementary RNA which is encapsidated into complementary RNPs (cRNPs) during this process. These cRNPs in turn serve as intermediates for synthesis of new vRNPs which are finally exported from the nucleus to be packaged into new viral particles at the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">An intact innate immune response is critical for restriction of viral replication and survival, as exemplified not only in animal experiments but also by more severe disease progression seen in young children with mutations in crucial innate immune genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. After recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as viral RNA, the cell responds by secreting type I and III interferons. These interferons bind to their respective receptors leading to JAK-STAT signaling and eventually to induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), of which some have direct effector activity against particular viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The speed of the antiviral response is critical to prevent further virus spread. Therefore, most ISG promoters, which would otherwise be covered by nucleosomes and not be available for immediate access, are &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; for rapid transcriptional activation through the bound SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The promotor-bound BAF complex not only facilitates rapid induction but also basal level expression and, upon stimulation, induction of ISGs to a higher extent.</p><p id="Par5">Among many other ISGs, human MxA has been shown to be particularly potent in inhibiting IAV replication <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Its importance is further emphasized by the fact that all human-adapted IAVs, including all pandemic viruses, have evolved partial resistance towards MxA antiviral activity through mutations in their NP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. MxA belongs to the family of large dynamin-like GTPases and localizes to the cytoplasm, in contrast to IAV replication which occurs in the nucleus. To date, the mechanism by which MxA inhibits IAV replication is still unclear and somewhat controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, there is general agreement that a very early step of the IAV replication cycle is affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Avian influenza viruses, including the subtypes H5N1 and H7N7, are highly sensitive to MxA, but the finding that human-adapted IAV are able to partially escape the antiviral effect of MxA through mutations in NP suggested that restriction might be mediated through direct physical binding of IAV NP to MxA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, while NP of the closely related Thogoto virus (THOV) can be co-precipitated with MxA, similar approaches with IAV NP have failed to show a convincing interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the IAV NP-MxA interaction is of low affinity and may require the presence of additional host cell factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">THOV replication was shown to be inhibited by MxA through a block in nuclear translocation of incoming vRNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and Xiao and colleagues recently demonstrated that a similar mode of action might apply to IAV vRNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, their experimental setup required IFN pretreatment in addition to MxA overexpression, suggesting that additional ISGs are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses. In line with that, the related human paralog of MxA, MxB, similarly depends on host cell factors for its anti-HIV-1 activity, as it loses its ability to prevent viral DNA from entering the nucleus and integrating into the genome in the absence of cyclophilin A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Here, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen and a proteomic screen to identify potential MxA cofactors required for the antiviral activity of human MxA, and we identified SMARCA2 as essential for the antiviral effect of MxA against H5N1 and H7N7 viruses. SMARCA2 is the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex (BAF complex), the complex known to reside on promoters of many ISGs thereby facilitating their induction. Our data show that SMARCA2 is required for the induction of an antiviral state in IFN-treated cells but that induction of MxA <italic>per se</italic> is not affected by the absence of SMARCA2. A transcriptome analysis of SMARCA2-depleted A549-MxA cells identified a large number of SMARCA2-regulated genes, of which many are ISGs. Several of these factors, in particular IFITM2 and IGFBP3, were required for efficient inhibition of viral replication in A549-MxA cells. Therefore, our data demonstrate that several SMARCA2-dependent ISGs act in concert to facilitate the antiviral activity of MxA against influenza A viruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Identification of host cell factors required for the antiviral activity of MxA</title><p id="Par9">To identify factors required for the antiviral activity of MxA, we developed a genome-wide siRNA screening assay on a well-established A549 human lung epithelial cell line stably over-expressing human MxA (A549-MxA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. To easily monitor virus replication a reporter virus was generated based on the highly MxA-sensitive influenza A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> by incorporating a Renilla (RL) luciferase reporter construct into the NS segment (H5N1-RL) as previously described by Reuther and colleagues (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, to allow utilization of this highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions several positively charged amino acids were removed from the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site to render it monobasic, and thus classifying the virus as a low pathogenic avian virus (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In the presence of MxA, virus replication is inhibited resulting in low levels of RL activity, but upon transfection of an siRNA targeting MxA (silencing the MxA-encoding gene MX1), virus replication is restored and an increase in RL activity is observed (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>). The goal of the siRNA screen was to identify siRNAs that restore virus replication in the presence of MxA, so siMX1 served as the positive control and a non-targeting (NT) siRNA as the negative control. The assay was miniaturized to 384-well format and the quality was assessed by measuring the strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, which accounts for the assay window and variability. The SSMD was calculated as 9.4, confirming a high quality assay suitable for high-throughput screening (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2a</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">An arrayed genome-wide siRNA library of siRNA pools (4 siRNAs per gene) targeting a total of 18119 human genes was transfected into A549-MxA cells in triplicate. 72&#x02009;hours post transfection cells were infected with the H5N1-RL reporter virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 8, and 24&#x02009;h later luciferase activity was determined utilizing Renilla-Glo (Promega) substrate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The SSMD was used to validate the quality of each plate (SSMD&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and hits were selected based on an average Z-score&#x02009;&#x0003e;2 across triplicates (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b,c</xref>). This resulted in the identification of 276 primary hits (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To exclude off-target effects those hits were further validated in a secondary siRNA screen by individually transfecting the 4 siRNAs from each pool (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2b</xref>). The SSMD was used to validate each plate and the results were analyzed using Redundant siRNA Activity (RSA) statistical analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> which assigns a p-value to each gene based on the effect of its four siRNAs.

Using these methods, we identified 41 genes, including the MxA-encoding gene MX1, whose knockdown led to a significant (p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) increase in virus growth in A549-MxA cells (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>RNAi and proteomic screens identify SMARCA2 as potential MxA co-factor.

To ensure sufficient induction of the selected factors (and thus allow for knockdown) the cells received 25&#x02009;U/mL IFN-&#x003b1; 6&#x02009;h prior to infection, which was the minimal amount found to reduce viral reporter activity (indicative of ISG induction) without diminishing it completely (Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7a</xref>).

As expected, although the general pattern was similar, greater effects were observed in the presence of IFN, with MxA depletion enhancing replication by 5.9-fold and knockdown of SMARCA2 by 11.2-fold. Several factors displayed clear effects, such as IGFBP3, which increased viral replication by 8-fold upon silencing. Most prominently however, knockdown of the ISG IFITM2 resulted in a 9.5-fold increase in viral replication. Knockdown of IFITM3, on the other hand, which is a relative of IFITM2 and known to be a potent IAV restriction factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, showed only a 3.3-fold increase in virus replication under MxA overexpression conditions. In the absence of MxA (A549-shMxA cells) the antiviral effect of IFITM3 is more visible, and stronger than that of IFITM2, when cells are pre-stimulated with IFN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Generally, the replication-enhancing effects upon knockdown of the most potent SMARCA2-regulated factors appear to depend on the presence of MxA for full effect, as no, or only minor, increases in H7N7-RL reporter activity were observed in A549-shMxA cells, e.g. 2.5-fold with IFITM2 and 3.7-fold with IGFBP3 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).

Surprisingly, however, MxA expression is unaffected by SMARCA2 depletion, suggesting that reduced MxA antiviral function is due to the absence of one or more SMARCA2-regulated factors. Flow cytometry experiments support this by demonstrating that SMARCA2 depletion leads to an elevated number of cells positive for both viral antigen (NP) and MxA in IFN-pretreated A549 cells. These results also provide strong support to the findings of Xiao and colleagues that additional ISGs are required for full MxA activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and further show that these ISGs are probably regulated by SMARCA2. Alternatively MxA may interact with SMARCA2, although this is unlikely as neither SMARCA2 nor any other BAF component was identified as an MxA-interacting candidate in our mass spectrometry analysis.

The application of low levels of IFN-&#x003b1; in these experiments allowed for a larger assay window when detecting ISGs, and this may account for why we failed to detect these factors in the primary RNAi screen.

In the case of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 it is believed that IFITM-1 counteracts viral fusion at the plasma membrane to restrict access to the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Similarly IFITM3 and IFITM2, which only differ by 12 amino acids, are thought to block fusion of IAV with the endosomal membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Therefore the main mechanism of restriction by IFITMs is by preventing fusion of viral membranes with cellular lipid bilayers, although other mechanisms have also been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of MxA, IFITM2 is the major IFITM member required for IAV restriction. Interestingly, both IFITM2 and MxA are thought to restrict IAV at similar stages of the virus life cycle, with IFITM2 described to act in the late endosome and MxA directly after release of vRNPs from the late endosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Furthermore, MxA has been shown to associate with membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>, therefore it is conceivable that IFITM2 and MxA act in a coordinated sequential fashion in a similar manner as was recently proposed by Narayana <italic>et al</italic>. for IFITM1, 2 and 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. This study proposed that IFITMs would trap the virus in the endocytic pathway and eventually redirect it to lysosomal degradation. We propose that MxA might cooperate to a small extent with IFITM3 at the early endosome and more strongly with IFITM2 at the late endosome shortly before vRNP release. Intriguingly, Narayana and colleagues already hypothesized that IFITM2 may associate with unknown host factors to restrict viral replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Apart from IFITM2 and IGFBP3, several other factors were also found to show stronger antiviral effects in the presence of MxA. It is therefore possible that to achieve full viral inhibition all, or several, of the identified factors may have to act in concert with each other, as well as with MxA. Further studies will be required to investigate the individual contribution of these factors and whether a certain combination is needed to fully support the antiviral activity of MxA.</p><p id="Par23">In summary this study not only identifies IFITM2, IGFBP3 and some other IFN- or virus-inducible host factors as being required for the full antiviral activity of MxA, but also further emphasizes the critical role of chromatin remodeling complexes in antiviral immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par24">Wild type A549 human cells from lung carcinoma (ATCC&#x000ae; CCL-185&#x02122;), A549 cells stably overexpressing MxA (A549-MxA), A549 cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA targeting MxA (A549-shMxA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (kindly provided by Richard E.
