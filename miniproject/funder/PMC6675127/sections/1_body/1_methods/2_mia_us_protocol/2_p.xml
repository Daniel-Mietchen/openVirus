<p>All US examinations were performed by interventional radiology physicians, who were trained to perform gray-scale post-mortem US during a period of 8 weeks. In total, fifteen exams were necessary in order to achieve thorough ultrasound imaging and good quality biopsy samples. We used a SonoSite M-Turbo portable ultrasound (Fujifilm, Bothell, WA, USA) with broadband and multifrequency transducers: C60x (5–2 MHz Curved) and HFL38X (13–6 MHz Linear) and DICOM medical images.</p>
