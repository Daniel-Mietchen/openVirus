<p>The autopsies were performed following the Letulle technique, where all the organs are removed

 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Tissue samples were collected from all body systems. Both biopsy and autopsy samples were submitted for routine histological examination, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E). Brown-Brenn, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Grocott stains were used to detect bacteria, acid-fast bacilli, and fungi, respectively, when required.
