<p>Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) has been proposed as an alternative to conventional autopsy, conceived as targeting small diagnostic biopsies by needle puncture of key organs, with or without the guidance of any imaging technique. The use of computed tomography (CT) and CT-angiography, associated with needle biopsy, has been proposed as feasible for diagnosis of common causes of death [
