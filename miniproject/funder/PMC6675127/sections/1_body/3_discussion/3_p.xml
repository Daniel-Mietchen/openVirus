<p>Our results are in concert with those of other researchers [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the series by Fariña et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], there was an 83% diagnostic concordance between MIA-US and CA. Castilho et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported a success rate of 83% for the determination of cause of death by MIA-US in a study of 30 patients with a predominance of infectious diseases. Recently, Martinez et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] compared MIA-US and CA in 30 patients and obtained an 89.5% concordance for the detection of an infectious agent directly involved in the cause of death. Conversely, Cox et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found a 57% concordance between MIA-US and CA for infectious major diagnoses, mainly present in the lungs (63%), liver (44%), and spleen (34%). Result differences among studies possibly relate to different patient populations and different causal mixes.
