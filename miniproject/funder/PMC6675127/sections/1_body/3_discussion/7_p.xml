<p>In the past years, we have been globally identifying an unprecedented number of emerging infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This phenomenon is probably associated with a complex interaction of factors such as human behavior, environmental changes and vector proliferation worldwide [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Precise post-mortem diagnosis during the first periods of an emerging epidemic would represent an improvement in identifying the specific etiologic agent, with substantial impact in disease monitoring. For instance, it is quite plausible that if post-mortem brain sampling had been performed in the early cases of microcephaly in Northeastern Brazil, the identification of Zika virus infection could have been made earlier [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007625.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, protective measures could have been taken more effectively. However, such measures are hindered by the lack of autopsies in areas prone to be affected by emerging infectious agents. In addition, because of its minimal invasiveness, MIA-US may represent a safer procedure to health authorities who investigate the emerging infectious diseases of high (Ebola, for instance) or unknown lethality.
