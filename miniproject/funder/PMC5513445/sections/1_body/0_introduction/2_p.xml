<p>To assess the extent of cross-reactivity of antibody responses to historic influenza viruses in the human population we analyze cross-sectional serological survey data from the Netherlands obtained before and after the A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The samples had been tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test using pandemic A/2009 (H1N1) virus as antigen, and by hemagglutinin subunit 1 (HA1) protein microarray. While HI responses are directed mostly to the major antibody epitopes on the globular head of HA (i.e. the HA1 subunit), responses of the microarray are also directed to stalk of HA, which is composed of portions of HA1 and all of HA2. We analyze sera using HA1 antigens from human H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, and avian H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Earlier analyses focused on A/1918 (H1N1) and A/2009 (H1N1) HA1 antigens to investigate diagnostic characteristics of the new tests to distinguish persons infected during the pandemic of 2009 from those with pre-existing immunity [
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and to estimate infection attack rates and population levels of pre-existing immunity [
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The previous studies reveal that a strong correlation exists between the hemagglutination inhibition test and the HA1 microarray when using pandemic A/2009 (H1N1) virus as antigen, especially in samples of persons that were likely infected with the pandemic virus. Moreover, the microarray offers a sensitive and specific test to distinguish recently infected persons from those with pre-existing immunity. Here we take into account full response to 12 antigens in 357 persons, including those to HA1 antigens from avian H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 viruses. We focus on correlations that must be caused by cross-reactive responses and cannot be caused by associations in infection histories, e.g., responses to avian influenza viruses, and responses against HA1 of A/1957 (H2N2) virus in persons born after 1968, i.e. who are too young to have been infected naturally.
