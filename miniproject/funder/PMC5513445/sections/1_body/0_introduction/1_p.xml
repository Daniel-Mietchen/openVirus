<p>Yearly epidemics of influenza A in temperate regions are notoriously variable in duration, size, and age distribution of cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This appears to be true for influenza pandemics caused by novel or reappearing subtypes as well [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, while mortality rates of 0.5%-1.0% have been reported for the 1918 pandemic, causing 20–100 million deaths worldwide, the recent 2009 pandemic was relatively mild, with an estimated overall attack rate of 24% and estimated mortality rate remaining below 0.01% [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Varying levels of pre-existing immunity for the strain that is seeding the pandemic or yearly epidemic are driving the observed differences [

Protection to influenza A infection and severity is mediated by cellular and humoral immune responses, with cellular responses being relatively conserved across viruses and in time, and antibody responses being more specific and variable [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recent studies, however, show that antibody-mediated immune responses, especially those directed against the stalk of the hemagglutinin protein (HA), are more cross-reactive than previously believed [
