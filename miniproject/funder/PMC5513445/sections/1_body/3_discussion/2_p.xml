<p>Our analyses have uncovered 1) that HA1 antibodies that react to avian H7N7 and H9N2 viruses are present in a significant part of the Dutch population, 2) that infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus often induces measurable antibodies to HA1 of H2 and H9 viruses, and 3) that seroprevalence to H7 virus is high in persons born between 1954 and 1969. Our results are in line with earlier finding of ‘original antigenic sin’ and ‘antigenic seniority’, i.e. antibody responses are generally strongest to those viruses encountered early in life, and with the related recent concept of ‘antigenic landscapes’, i.e. antibody responses after primary infection extending beyond the extent of intrinsic cross-reactivity [
