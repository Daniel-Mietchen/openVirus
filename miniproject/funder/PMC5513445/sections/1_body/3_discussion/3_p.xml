<p>All results reported here are based on a protein microarray test based on the HA1 subunit of the hemagglutinin. As with the hemagglutination inhibition assay, measurements based on this test are not necessarily protective. It is known, however, that responses in the microarray correlate well with corresponding HI titers [

If the above reasoning would prove true, one could argue that A/2009 (H1N1) microarray titer of 80 or more is expected to be protective in 50% of persons. Supporting this line of reasoning is provided by the observation that the HA1 subunit includes the immunodominant globular head of the hemagglutinin, which contains the four (or five) main antibody epitopes that are traditionally believed to provide sterilizing immunity.
