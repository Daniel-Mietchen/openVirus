<p>Correlations in the antibody responses to different influenza viruses may arise by cross-reactivity of responses after infection by one virus, or by associations in infection histories (e.g., it is more likely that you are infected with virus Y if you have been infected with virus X). In general, it is difficult to distinguish between the two explanations. In some cases, however, antibody response associations can only be the result of cross-reactivity, either because the virus of interest has not circulated in the human population, or because the virus has not been in circulation in certain age strata (H2N2 in persons born after 1968, A/2009 (H1N1) in the pre-pandemic serological survey). Here we have exploited these observations to explore cross-reactivity of antibody responses to influenza A viruses in a (structured) random sample from the Dutch population.</p>
