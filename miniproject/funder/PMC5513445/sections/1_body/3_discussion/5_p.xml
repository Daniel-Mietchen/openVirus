<p>Finally, our results shed some light on recent studies on broadly reactive and broadly neutralizing antibodies on the hemagglutinin protein, in particular on HA2 but to a lesser extent also on HA1 [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These studies have mostly used animal models and laboratory experiments to study heterosubtypic antibody responses. Here we have added that these findings are not only found in animals in the laboratory and selected populations (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]), but that cross-reactivity can be estimated quantitatively in the human population. Our data thus lend additional evidence to the hypothesis that as humans age and accumulate infections, antibody responses become increasingly directed to more conserved parts of the hemagglutinin, and thereby more cross-reactive [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This may or may not translate to reduction in infection attack rates in elderly, but does not generally translates to decreasing rates of disease probably because of declining overall health in the elderly.
