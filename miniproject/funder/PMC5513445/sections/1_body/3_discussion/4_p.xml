<p>We included three avian influenza viruses in this study that belong to nonhuman subtypes (H5N1, H7N7, H9N2). These viruses have caused numerous human infections, and might develop into fully human transmissible viruses. It may seem plausible that there will be little antibody-mediated pre-existing immunity in the population to these viruses (but see e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). If one would extend the above lines of reasoning for A/2009 (H1N1) to other antigens, one could argue that there would indeed be limited immunity to H7 viruses in the Dutch population, as only a handful of participants have a microarray titer ≥80, mainly in the persons born between 1954 and 1969 (

For H9, on the other hand, a substantial fraction (30/357≈8.4%) of the population has high microarray titers of ≥80, which could translate into protective immunity. For H5, seroprevalence is very low (5.1% at a microarray titer threshold of 20), and modulated by seasonal vaccination. Interestingly, however, the correlation of H5N1 in older persons (over 44 years) is strongest with the A/1918 (H1N1) and the A/1933 (H1N1) antigens, with Kendall correlations of tau = 0.33 and tau = 0.46, respectively. Together, these finding support the recent observation that the incidence of severe H5N1 and H7N9 infections is lower than expected in age groups that had their first infections with viruses from the same antigenic family (i.e. H1/H2 in case of H5N1 and H3 in case of H7N9) [
