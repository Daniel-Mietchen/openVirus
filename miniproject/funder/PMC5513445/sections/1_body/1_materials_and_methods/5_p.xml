<p>Estimates of seroprevalence in the population are based on seropositivity of the test at the 1/20 or 1/40 dilution. In order to calculate population prevalence, weights are assigned to the individual sera to scale the data back to the population census and the population size of the HI strata. Confidence intervals for interval estimates of seroprevalence are calculated by the exact Clopper-Pearson binomial method. Smoothed antibody concentrations and smoothed seroprevalences are estimated with generalized additive models, using the gamlss procedure of the gamlss package. Pairwise associations of antibody responses are based on Kendall’s tau, a non-parametric correlation coefficient. For two measurements in two random subjects Kendall tau has a straightforward interpretation as the difference between the probability for the measurements to be in the same order and the probability of the measurements being in a different order. This implies that, for example, a value of tau = 0.8 translates to a probability of (1–0.8)/2 = 0.1 that two measurements in two samples are in different order. Finally, linear regression analyses are performed using the statistical programming language R.</p>
