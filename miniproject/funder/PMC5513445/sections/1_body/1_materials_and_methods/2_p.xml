<p>We draw an age stratified random subset of these surveys (167 pre-pandemic samples and 190 post-pandemic samples), oversampling sera with high A/2009 (H1N1) HI titers [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, antibody titers are calculated from the inflection point of twofold serial dilution series, with lower and upper dilutions of 1/20 and 1/2560, respectively. Throughout, a sample is said to be seropositive if it has a positive response in the first 1/20 dilution. Samples that are negative in the first 1/20 dilution are said to be seronegative. In the figures, these samples are assigned a titer value of 20, and in the statistical analyses these samples are considered to be left-censored.
