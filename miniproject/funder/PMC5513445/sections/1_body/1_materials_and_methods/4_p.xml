<p>Samples are analyzed with nine representative antigens from human viruses and three avian isolates of main subtypes that are considered a risk of forward human transmission (H5N1, H7N7, H9N2). Specifically, we include five human H1N1 viruses (A/South Carolina/1/1918, A/WS/1933, A/New Caledonia/20/1999, A/Brisbane/59/2007, and the pandemic A/California/06/2009), one H2N2 virus (A/Canada/720/2005, a 1957-like virus), and three H3N2 viruses (A/Aichi/2/1968, A/Wyoming/2/2003, A/Brisbane/10/2007). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181093.t001">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the antigens included.
