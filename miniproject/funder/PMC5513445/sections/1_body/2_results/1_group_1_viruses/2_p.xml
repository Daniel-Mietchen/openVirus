 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181093.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows antibody cross-correlations between 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, the Asian flu (H2N2), and the avian H9N2 virus in different age groups. Antibody responses against H2N2 and H9N2 viruses are strongly correlated in both surveys, especially in persons under 45 years (tau = 0.75 for both surveys, p&lt;10
 <sup>−4</sup> for both surveys). As these persons cannot have been infected naturally, these responses must result from a correlated response after infection with another virus. It is tempting to speculate that this is the pandemic H1N1 virus, as seropositivity against H2N2 or H9N2 in all but a handful of sera also implies seropositivity to the H1N1 virus. In young children (5–9 years) these patterns are even more pronounced. In this age group, all sera are seronegative (i.e. have no measurable antibodies) to the H1N1, H2N2, and H9N2 viruses in the pre-pandemic survey (n = 15 samples), and 17 of 26 samples (65%) is seropositive in the post-pandemic survey. Of these, 6 are also positive for the H2N2 and H9N2 viruses. Similar results are observed in older children (10–19 years). In adults over 45 years who are likely to have experienced a natural H2N2 infection, the correlation between H2N2 and H9N2 is less pronounced, with low correlation coefficients of 0.18 and 0.24. In these persons, the H2 response is usually substantially higher than the H9 response.
