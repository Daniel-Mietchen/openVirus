<p>Within group 1 influenza A viruses (H1, H2, H5, and H9), seroprevalence for the similar A/1918 (H1N1) and A/2009 (H1N1) hemagglutinins are high in both the pre- and post-pandemic surveys in persons 20 years and older (

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In persons under 20 years, seroprevalence is also high in the post-pandemic survey but not the pre-pandemic survey, an observation that has been exploited earlier to estimate infection attack rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Seroprevalence for A/2007 (H1N1) is also high across all ages, and does not seem to differ between the pre- and post-pandemic surveys. Highest seroprevalence to A/2007 (H1N1) and highest antibody concentration measurements are observed in children who were 10–20 year old in 2009. These children likely had their first influenza infection(s) with A/2007 (H1N1)-like viruses. Seroprevalence and antibody titers to A/1957 (H2N2) virus (the Asian flu), which circulated from 1957-1968, are low in persons born after 1965 (who are unlikely to have been infected with H2N2), and much higher in persons born before 1965 [

Seropositivity of H9N2 is substantial across persons older than 10 years, and peaks in persons 40–60 years with estimated prevalence exceeding 50% when using a microarray titer cutoff of 20. Seropositivity of H9N2 is lower when using a higher microarray titer cutoff of 40, but remains high, especially in persons 40–60 years (&gt;30%). Antibody responses to H5N1 virus are low overall (5.1%, 95%CI: 3.1%-7.9%), and are affected by history of seasonal influenza vaccinations (see below).
