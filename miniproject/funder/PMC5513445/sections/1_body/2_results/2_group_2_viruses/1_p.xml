<p>For group 2 influenza viruses (H3, H7), seroprevalence against H3N2 viruses is high across all age groups, reaching 100% in many age strata (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181093.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Seronegative persons are only found in children (&lt;20 years) with regard to their A/1968 (H3N2) response, and in adults over 40 years with regard to young H3N2 (2003, 2007) viruses. Antibody titers against A/1968 (H3N2) peak in persons born between 1954 and 1969. As children in the Netherlands contract their first influenza infection between 1 and 7 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], it is likely that a large fraction of persons born between 1954 and 1969 (and especially those born between 1961 and 1967) had their first influenza A infection(s) with 1968 H3N2-like viruses. The same holds for H3N2 (2003) virus, for which antibody titers are highest in persons born between 1989 and 1999. These persons likely had their first influenza infection with 2003 H3N2-like virus. Remarkably, seroprevalence against the avian H7N7 virus, albeit lower than against H9N2 virus, is substantial overall (population estimate: 10%, 95CI: 7.2%-14%%), and peaks in persons born between 1954 and 1969 (20%, 95%CI: 13%-28%). The peak coincides with the peak in A/1968 (H3N2) antibody titers.
