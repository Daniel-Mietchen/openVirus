 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181093.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows correlations of antibody responses to avian viruses (H5N1, H7N7, H9N2). Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the H9N2 and H7N7 responses, especially in older persons, even though these viruses belong to different influenza A subtype groups (group 1 versus group 2). Seropositivity to H5N1 is low overall, as only a handful of samples (n = 21) have measurable antibody titers to this virus. There is no noticeable correlation between H5N1 and H9N2, or between H5N1 and H9N2. Analysis of the data by vaccination status in the preceding five years shows that seasonal influenza vaccination has an impact on H5N1 antibody titers. In fact, a linear regression model explaining H5N1 antibody titers by age and number of seasonal vaccinations received in the preceding five years shows that vaccinated persons have significantly higher H5N1 antibody titer than unvaccinated persons (p&lt;0.001). No such dependencies on vaccination history are found for the avian H7N7 (p = 0.29) and H9N2 (p = 0.45) strains.
