  <title>Age-specific antibody titers to group 1 influenza A viruses.</title>
  <p>Pre- and post-pandemic samples are represented by triangles and circles, respectively. Red dots indicate that H9N2 titer was â‰¥40. Solid and dotted lines show weighted seroprevalence estimates and associated 95% confidence ranges, estimated with a logistic generalized additive model (right axis). Seroprevalence estimates are weighted by their contribution to the population census [

   <xref rid="pone.0181093.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For clarity, only pooled pre- and post-pandemic prevalence estimates are presented. Antigens (HA1) included are from viruses A/South Carolina/1/1918 (H1N1), A/Canada/720/2005 (H2N2) (1957-like H2N2), A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1), A/California/6/2009 (H1N1), A/Guinea fowl/Hong Kong/WF/10/1999 (H9N2).
