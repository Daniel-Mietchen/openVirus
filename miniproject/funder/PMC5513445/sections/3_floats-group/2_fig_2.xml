  <title>Correlations of antibody responses to group 1 influenza viruses.</title>
  <p>Results are given for age groups 5-44 years (above the diagonal) and 45+ years (below the diagonal). Black dots: pre-pandemic survey; red dots: post-pandemic survey. In each panel, Kendallâ€™s tau is given for the pre- and post-pandemics surveys (black and red). Notice the strong positive correlation between H2N2 and H9N2 antibody titers in persons up to 45 years, i.e. persons who are unlikely to have experienced a natural H2N2 infection. Positive antibody titers to H2N2 and H9N2 are found almost exclusively in persons with positive A/2009 (H1N1) response, suggesting that A/2009 (H1N1) infection yields a response that is cross-reactive with both H2N2 and H9N2.</p>
