  <title>Socio-environmental and measurement factors associated with the epidemic intensity surveillance model.</title>
  <p>For the total population multi-season epidemic intensity models, these are the means and 95% credible intervals for the posterior distributions of the A) socio-environmental coefficients and B) measurement-related coefficients. Distributions indicated in green were statistically significant (95% credible interval deviated from zero). Coefficients are reported according to their effect on log epidemic intensity.</p>
