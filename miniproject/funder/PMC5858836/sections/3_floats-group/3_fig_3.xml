  <title>Discrepancies between state and county surveillance models for epidemic intensity.</title>
  <p>A) Comparison of state and county surveillance models (left and right columns, respectively) for log epidemic intensity for states with overestimation and underestimation with the state surveillance model â€”Montana (top row) and South Carolina (bottom row), respectively. B) Aggregation bias between county and state epidemic intensity surveillance models for the 2006-2007 influenza season, where error is defined as the difference between fitted values for county and state log epidemic intensity. Negative error (blue) indicates that the state-level surveillance model underestimated risk relative to the county-level surveillance model, and vice versa.</p>
