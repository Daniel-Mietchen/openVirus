 <p>Influenza contributes substantially to global morbidity and mortality each year, and epidemiological surveillance for influenza is typically conducted by sentinel physicians and health care providers recruited to report cases of influenza-like illness. While population coverage and representativeness, and geographic distribution are considered during sentinel provider recruitment, systems cannot always achieve these standards due to the administrative burdens of data collection. We present spatial estimates of influenza disease burden across United States counties by leveraging the volume and fine spatial resolution of medical claims data, and existing socio-environmental hypotheses about the determinants of influenza disease disease burden. Using medical claims as a testbed, this study adds to literature on the optimization of surveillance system design by considering conditions of limited reporting and spatial aggregation. We highlight the importance of considering sampling biases and reporting locations when interpreting surveillance data, and suggest that local mobility and regional policies may be critical to understanding the spatial distribution of reported influenza-like illness.</p>
