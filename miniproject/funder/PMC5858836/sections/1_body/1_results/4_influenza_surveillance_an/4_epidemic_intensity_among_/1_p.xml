<p>We examined the spatial trends for models of ILI epidemic intensity among children and adults as representations of school-based and workplace-based models of ILI surveillance (Fig AJ and Fig AK in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Similar to the total population epidemic intensity models, several South Atlantic states like Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia had relatively greater risk across both children and adults than other states in the study period (Fig AL and Fig AM in
