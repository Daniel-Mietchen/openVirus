<p>Group (random) effects were used to identify consistent spatial or temporal patterns across locations and study years. We found that the 2004-2005 flu season had greater intensity (estimate of 0.14 translates into

For the epidemic intensity model, no single region had a significant group effect, although several South Atlantic states like Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia had relatively greater risk than other states across the study period (on average, ≈1.79 greater risk than other states), while several Plains and Rocky Mountain states like Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, and Utah had relatively lower risk (on average, ≈0.62 lower risk than other states) (
