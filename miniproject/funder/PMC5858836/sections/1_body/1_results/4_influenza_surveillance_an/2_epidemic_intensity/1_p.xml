<p>We found that county spatial dependence (i.e., neighborhood structure) and state group effects captured most of the variability in the total population epidemic intensity observations, when comparing the estimated precision terms across the various group effects in our model. The variability explained by these two terms was followed by the terms for region, season, observation error, and county, respectively (Table A in
