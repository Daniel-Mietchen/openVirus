<p>Leveraging the large volume and spatial resolution of our data, we sought to examine the robustness of our model predictions and inference in order to assess their suitability for disease surveillance and prediction. First, we compared our estimation of epidemic intensity when using analogous models at the county and state spatial units of analysis. These comparisons recall hypothetical scenarios where inference from state-level surveillance data might inform county-level decision making in the absence of resolved county-level data. Next, two model sequences were designed to simulate different flu sentinel surveillance systems â€”
 <italic>fixed-location sentinels</italic>, where the same sentinel locations reported data every year, and 
 <italic>moving-location sentinels</italic>, where new sentinel locations are recruited each year. A third model sequence considered the specificity of inference and model predictions to certain 
 <italic>inclusion of historical data</italic>, thus providing insight into the generalization of our model to epidemic forecasting. We examine these applications for the total population epidemic intensity model, and ten replicates were performed for each model with missingness to generalize findings beyond that of random chance.
