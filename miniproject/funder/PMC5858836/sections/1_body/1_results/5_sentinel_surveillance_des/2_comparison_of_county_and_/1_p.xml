<p>We compared analogous state-level and county-level epidemic intensity model outputs to examine the added value of county-level information on ILI surveillance (

 <sup>1</sup> ≈2.72 of the county model risk. The state-level surveillance model captured high risk areas like the South Atlantic quite well, with some underestimation of ILI risk relative to the county-level surveillance model. Plains and Rocky Mountain states, typically low risk areas, were overestimated substantially in the state surveillance model relative to that of the county. States with a larger absolute discrepancy between county and state surveillance model fits (labeled here as “aggregation bias”) have greater within-state heterogeneity in epidemic intensity (Fig Q in
