<p>In this sequence of seven models, we removed 20, 40, 60, 80, 90, 95, and 97.5% of randomly selected county observations across all years. There was a strong linear relationship between true observed and fitted values when using these model replicates for out-of-sample validation (Pearson’s R = 0.56), and observations with poor fits seemed isolated to a few counties across all levels of missingness (Fig W in

We also found that the effect sizes of determinants were pulled towards zero as fewer sentinel counties reported ILI epidemic intensity, but the primary conclusions remained robust. We noted that the positive effect of care-seeking increased across most model replicates as fewer sentinels reported data (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006020.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Match percentage increased and match percentage variance declined as the volume of contributing visits increased. The volume of visits captured by CDC’s ILINet represents roughly 5% of the medical claims database and remains in the high variance range for county match.
