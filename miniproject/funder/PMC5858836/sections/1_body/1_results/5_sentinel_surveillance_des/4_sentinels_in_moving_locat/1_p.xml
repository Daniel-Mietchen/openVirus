<p>In this sequence of four models, 20, 40, 60, and 80% of randomly chosen seasonally-stratified observations were removed. Similar to the fixed-location sequence, there was a strong linear relationship between true observed and fitted values when using these model replicates for out-of-sample validation (Pearsonâ€™s R = 0.81), and observations with poor fits seemed isolated to a few counties (Fig X in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Predictor effects were pulled towards zero as fewer sentinel counties reported ILI, the effects with the smallest means were pulled towards zero and predictors with no effect in the complete model were found to be significant (Fig S and Fig T in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Model predictions had good agreement with the complete model up to a threshold between 60 and 80% missingness, where the model no longer provided reasonable fits.
