<p>In this sequence of models, one, three, and five out of seven flu seasons in the study period were completely removed. While there was a moderately strong linear relationship in out-of-sample validation (Pearsonâ€™s R = 0.62), many observations in the 2005-2006 seemed to be overestimated in the model (Fig Y in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The effect of determinants changed substantially when more than one season was removed, particularly when they had small effect sizes in the complete model (Fig U and Fig V in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Notably, medical claims coverage and care-seeking were two of three predictors that remained consistent in the magnitude and direction of inference across all model replicates. Model predictions were robust relative to the complete model only when one season was removed. Beyond that, many seasonal fitted values were poor, particularly for some seasons where data had been removed.
