<p>Our study considered six disease burden response variables: two measures of influenza disease burden (epidemic intensity and epidemic duration) in three populations (total population, children 5-19 years old, and adults 20-69 years old) across multiple seasons. We define 
 <italic>epidemic intensity</italic> as a relative risk measure of population-normalized and detrended ILI activity above an epidemic baseline (details in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>: ‘Defining influenza disease burden’). We define 
 <italic>epidemic duration</italic> to be the number of weeks of ILI activity above an epidemic baseline. While total population models represent broad surveillance efforts to capture ILI activity in the community, the child and adult models may represent networks of school- or workplace-based surveillance systems. There were 13 county-level, 2 state-level and 4 HHS region-level predictors in the complete model (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>: ‘Predictor data collection and variable selection’). Analogous models considered influenza disease burden solely during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. All model estimates of disease burden are openly available on GitHub at
