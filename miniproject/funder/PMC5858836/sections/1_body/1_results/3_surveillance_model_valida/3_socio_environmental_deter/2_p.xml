<p>Epidemic intensity had positive associations with average household size, prior immunity (a proxy calculated from intensity in the previous influenza season, influenza type and subtype distribution, and membership in the same antigenic cluster or lineage), and the adult:%H3 and child:%B interaction terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006020.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). There were negative associations with adult and child population sizes, specific humidity, poverty, single person households, and toddler vaccination coverage. A coefficient mean of -0.65 for humidity means that for every unit increase in specific humidity, on average, there is a 47.8% decrease in epidemic intensity (a -0.65 change in log epidemic intensity) if all other predictors remain constant (N.B., A unit is a standard deviation in the original scale of the predictor, given that predictors are centered and standardized).
