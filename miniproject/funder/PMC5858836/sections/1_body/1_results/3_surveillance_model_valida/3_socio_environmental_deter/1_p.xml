<p>Here, we report the association between two measures of disease burden, epidemic intensity and epidemic duration, and the transmission, environmental, influenza-specific, and socioeconomic determinants of disease risk. Our work is one of the first large-scale studies to examine wide-ranging hypotheses on the effect of these factors on influenza rates, and our results are consistent with previous evidence related to specific humidity, household contact, and age and subtype interactions, which serve to validate our model [
