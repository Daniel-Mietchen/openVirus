<p>We compared epidemic intensity surveillance model fits to CDC surveillance for ILI (
 <italic>ILINet</italic>) and laboratory-confirmed influenza (
 <italic>NREVSS</italic>) across HHS regions for all seven seasonal influenza seasons in our study period. There was a moderate linear correlation between total population model fits and positive laboratory confirmation numbers from 
 <italic>NREVSS</italic>. Additionally, we found a moderate linear correlation between total, children, and adult model fits and the percentage of patients (in the appropriate age group) observed with ILI from 
 <italic>ILINet</italic>. Supplementary details on the results and methodology may be found in Section 2.4 in
