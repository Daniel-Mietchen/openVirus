<p>Using medical claims data representing 2.5 billion visits from upwards of 120,000 health care providers each year (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>: ‘Medical claims data’), we modeled influenza disease burden across U.S. counties for flu seasons from 2002-2003 through 2008-2009 and the 2009 pandemic using a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>: ‘Model structure’ and ‘Statistical analysis’). Our goal is to use this approach to simultaneously validate our surveillance data source and provide improved spatial surveillance of influenza burden based on socio-environmental and health behavior predictors. With these Bayesian models, we then study the impact of common surveillance limitations.
