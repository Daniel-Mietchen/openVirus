<p>Surveillance system design may also contribute to the biased observation of ILI disease burden [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Current national sentinel systems in Australia, China, the United States, and Europe capture patients seen by 5% to less than 1% of active physicians in a given population, and while these systems strive to represent population demography, spatial distributions, and patient volume as accurately as possible, this is not always possible [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Theoretical work suggests influenza disease burden detection could be optimized if population coverage, care-seeking rates, and geographic access to care are considered in sentinel site choice [

Non-traditional data with surveillance potential such as medical claims may enhance the estimation of attack rates through improved population coverage, better discriminate the duration of heightened epidemic activity and public health need through its real-time reporting, and improve our prediction of surge capacity needs with finer spatial resolution data. We note, however, that consideration of measurement biases is even more important as these digital data streams are opportunistic; they have greater volume and coverage in the population, but their measurement biases are less well studied [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Fortunately, non-traditional systems are often accompanied with metadata that provides context about the data coverage and user demographics, thus enabling explicit treatment of these potential flaws.
