<p>In this study, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical influenza surveillance model that accounts for transmission, environmental, influenza-specific, and socioeconomic factors, as well as measurement processes underlying spatial heterogeneity in reported influenza-like illness across counties in the United States. This model leveraged a large-scale and highly-resolved dataset of passive ILI surveillance from medical claims, and we validated the model results using ILI sentinel surveillance from CDC. Next, we probed the robustness of this ecological inference under limited data availability in order to mimic the potential conditions of real-world sentinel surveillance systems and to improve one primary goal of surveillance â€”the end-of-season estimation of disease burden. Our results highlight the relative contributions of surveillance data collection and socio-environmental processes to disease reporting, and emphasize the importance of considering surveillance system design and measurement biases when using surveillance data for epidemiological inference and prediction.</p>
