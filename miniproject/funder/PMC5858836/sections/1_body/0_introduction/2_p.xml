<p>Sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) is one such system that passively estimates influenza morbidity. Select general practitioners or health care facilities (“sentinels”) report aggregate counts of ILI to a centralized public health agency as an efficient means of collecting high quality data by focusing resources on a few population-representative sites [

The European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN) collates sentinel ILI data from over 30 European countries, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) ILINet surveillance system recruits roughly 2,000 sentinel physicians to submit reports on the percentage of patient visits with ILI weekly throughout the year [

While such sentinel surveillance systems are sufficient to provide situational awareness of national-level influenza activity, the coarseness of such data limit its use in local decision-making. Additionally, WHO recommends that choice in sentinel sites should consider population representativeness, geographical representation, patient volume, feasibility, and the data needs and goals of the surveillance system [

However, few ILI surveillance systems meet these criteria as they are limited by few incentives (e.g., data feedback from higher-level agencies, additional support for laboratory testing) and hampered by the administrative burden of data collection. Indeed, past studies have identified discrepancies across surveillance systems [
