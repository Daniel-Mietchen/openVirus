<p>Seasonal influenza represents an important public health burden worldwide, and even within a single year, there is substantial variation in disease burden across populations [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On the other hand, pandemic influenza, which has the potential to cause millions of fatalities, is characterized by even more uncertainty in spatio-temporal risk. Traditional influenza surveillance is guided by the World Health Organization’s global standards for the collection of virological and epidemiological influenza surveillance data [

Epidemiological surveillance systems play an important role in our understanding of influenza dynamics and are used to identify seasonal influenza disease burden, severity, epidemic onset and seasonality, but they often suffer from reporting delays and limited, opportunistic sampling of the population.
