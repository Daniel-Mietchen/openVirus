<p>We cannot, however, rely solely on the volume and resolution of big data to address surveillance data gaps; statistical models for ILI surveillance should also utilize information from known factors of spatial heterogeneity in influenza transmission and disease burden. Many studies have examined the relationship of environmental factors [

In addition, it is important to consider the possibility that individual patient behavior may bias the reporting of ILI disease burden, thus driving observed spatial heterogeneity.
