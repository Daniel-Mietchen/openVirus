<p>Medical claims represent an alternative potential source of passive ILI surveillance data with larger volume, fewer reporting delays, and finer spatio-temporal resolution than many traditional surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, medical claims data do not require additional administrative burden or voluntary reporting to a surveillance agency. We acknowledge that it may not be possible to combine these medical data streams directly into public health systems without further consideration of the ethical and privacy concerns of integrating health data at fine spatial resolutions [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the meantime, however, we can leverage these features of medical claims and combine them with statistical models to explore the most informative design of passive surveillance systems and to test the robustness of ecological inference from opportunistic samples of health-associated big data.
