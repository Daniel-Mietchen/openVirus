<p>Our work uniquely captures factors of the measurement process, highlighting biases and disparities in healthcare-based influenza surveillance. We found that locations with greater poverty had lower influenza disease burden, in contrast to previous evidence for heightened rates of influenza-related hospitalizations, influenza-like illness, respiratory illness, neglected chronic diseases, and other measures of poor health among populations with greater material deprivation [

Material deprivation and lack of social cohesion have also been implicated in lower rates of health care utilization for ILI, which would reduce the observation of influenza disease burden in our medical claims data among the poorest populations [

When we artificially removed counties from our model (fixed-location sentinels) or subset our data into age groups, measurement factors associated with health care-seeking behavior more strongly explained the variation in epidemic intensity among the remaining observations (

These two results together suggest that statistical inference from opportunistic data samples may avoid some types of reporting biases when the coverage or volume of data achieves a minimum threshold, in response to concerns posed in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Increases to claims database coverage or care-seeking behavior may reduce reporting biases by increasing the representativeness of a given location’s sample, thus highlighting the importance of collecting and using metadata from opportunistic sources of epidemiological data.
