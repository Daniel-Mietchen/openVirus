<p>While statistical results may be neither interpreted as causative evidence nor are free from the possibility of spurious associations, future validations of our findings on influenza epidemiology will become more possible as high volume data sources achieve wider availability and tests of multiple hypotheses become more prevalent [

From the perspective of surveillance operations, we acknowledge the limitations of including many predictors with disparate data sources in our model; nevertheless, we gained additional epidemiological knowledge from the multiple predictor comparisons and note that all of the data we used were publicly available annually and at the county scale. In the future, comparisons of inference between models may enable us to posit new hypotheses for epidemiological study (e.g., vaccination of the elderly provides a protective effect among more susceptible and highly connected populations like children) (Fig AI in
