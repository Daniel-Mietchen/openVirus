<p>Equipped with our model, we investigated the impact of surveillance system structure. We present the concept of a network of 
 <italic>sentinel locations</italic>, in contrast to sentinel physicians or hospitals, which may be composed of administrative units (e.g., counties) that are chosen for either their representativeness of the larger population or their status as an outlier (e.g., match or failure to match locations in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006020.g004">Fig 4</xref>, respectively). The ability for our model to estimate relatively accurate estimates of influenza burden across increasingly missing data suggests that routine sentinel surveillance in fixed locations may be more accurate for interpolating ILI disease burden among uncovered areas than surveillance across changing locations, even when fewer locations may be surveyed. Our framework enables sentinel counties to have flexible physician recruitment strategies, provided that county health departments can achieve target population coverage levels. Moreover, the improved performance of fixed-location surveillance systems is operationally ideal; as counties and physicians are retained as sentinels over long periods of time, we may expect the quality and consistency of reporting to improve. The accuracy of our surveillance model broke down at roughly 70% missingness among sentinels in fixed locations, which translates to fewer than 950 sentinel counties reporting data. While there are fewer sentinel counties than sentinel physicians in ILINet (approximately 2,000), we note that our county data represents aggregate reports from many healthcare providers. Indeed, the volume of visits captured by ILINet corresponded roughly to 5% of reporting counties in our medical claims data, and this level of missingness provided poor disease burden estimates for approximately 10-30% of counties in the best-case sentinel design (i.e., fixed-locations).
