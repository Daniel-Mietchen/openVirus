<p>Reliable surveillance systems are at the heart of public health preparedness, mitigation and response. In this study, we opportunistically use an administrative data source to inform influenza spatio-temporal patterns and surveillance design. Our medical claims data represented an average of 24% of all U.S. health care visits to approximately 37% of all health care providers across 95% of U.S. counties during flu season months in our study period (increasing to 38%, 70% and 96%, respectively, by 2009). We pair these data with a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach which enables “borrowing information”, the efficient incorporation of spatial dependence and group indicators for spatial and temporal random effects. The high resolution and coverage of our data combined with this spatial statistical approach allowed us to contribute to influenza surveillance in three ways: (a) enhance fine-grain mapping of disease burden from influenza-like illness to guide local influenza preparedness and control; (b) inform the future treatment of digital data streams as a measurement process for infectious disease surveillance; and (c) systematically explore surveillance design choices. Moreover, our surveillance model enables the generation of synthetic datasets that capture realistic spatial distributions of ILI, which can be used in models to inform the design of control strategies and surveillance systems.</p>
