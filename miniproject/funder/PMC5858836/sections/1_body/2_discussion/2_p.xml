<p>In the process of our model validation, we also consider the relative importance of 16 environmental, demographic, or socio-economic factors in predicting influenza spatial heterogeneity. This makes ours the first large-scale influenza study to simultaneously consider multiple hypotheses across spatial scales (with the exception of work in review by Chattopadhyay et al [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]), and generates a new set of hypotheses on drivers of influenza spread. Our results strengthen the epidemiological link between humidity and influenza transmission and survival in temperate regions by finding strong negative associations between absolute humidity and both epidemic intensity and duration [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These associations were not simply influenced by the strong spatial dependence of humidity —the relative effect of this predictor remained consistent when we removed the model’s spatial dependence term (Section 2.3 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) and considered humidity as the sole model predictor (Fig AO in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Charu et al. suggests that humidity may not provide additional information beyond a well-calibrated model of human mobility [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and our work suggests that humidity among other factors is necessary to capture the end-of-season spatial heterogeneity in influenza disease burden. We also observed that higher estimated prior immunity was associated with greater epidemic intensity and longer epidemic durations. As larger epidemics induce more antigenic drift in subsequent seasons, we suggest that this drift renews population susceptibility every season, even on small spatial scales [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Finally, while higher vaccination coverage among toddlers was associated with lower epidemic intensity, we were surprised to note that higher vaccination coverage among elderly was associated with longer epidemics.
