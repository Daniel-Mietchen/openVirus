<p>Our work contributes to our understanding of optimal population capture through surveillance by suggesting a framework that best maintains surveillance system design over multiple flu seasons [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous work acknowledges that spatial scales of aggregation alter statistical inference and statistically-identified drivers of disease distributions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Our aggregated state surveillance models adequately captured the high epidemic intensity risk among counties in the South Atlantic, similar to other studies of spatial scale [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], but they over-estimated epidemic intensity among low-risk states, thus suggesting that these types of surveillance models may be useful for public health preparedness but less optimal for the allocation of limited resources. Nevertheless, we observed that larger discrepancies between state- and county-level surveillance models were associated with greater within-state heterogeneity in disease burden, suggesting perhaps that the spatial aggregation of data may have minimal effects on epidemiological inference and policy-making if populations and socio-environmental determinants are relatively homogeneous within a given spatial unit (Fig Q in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Overall, state surveillance models seemed more prone to over-estimate than under-estimate county-level disease burden, suggesting that inference from state surveillance data is best limited to populous counties in a given state (Fig P in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Future work is needed to better understand surveillance-associated aggregation biases in order to expand the utility of aggregate scale surveillance data in local contexts.
