<p>The goals of our modeling approach were to i) estimate the contribution of each predictor to influenza disease burden, ii) predict disease burden in locations with missing data, and iii) improve mapping of influenza disease burden. We performed approximate Bayesian inference using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) with the R-INLA package (

INLA has demonstrated computational efficiency for latent Gaussian models, produced similar estimates for fixed parameters as established implementations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian inference, and been applied to disease mapping and spatial ecology questions [
