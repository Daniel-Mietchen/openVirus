<p>Log epidemic intensity was modeled with a normal distribution, and log epidemic duration was modeled with a normal distribution without the offset term in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006020.e002">Eq 2</xref>. Consequently, we note that all epidemic intensity models examine the relative risk of disease burden, while epidemic duration models examine the duration in weeks. Multi-season models included all terms in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006020.e002">Eq 2</xref>. Model coefficients were interpreted as statistically significant if the 95% credible interval for a parameterâ€™s posterior distribution failed to include zero.
