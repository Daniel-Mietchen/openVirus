<p>We selected one predictor to represent each hypothesis according to the following criteria, in order: i) Select for the finest spatial resolution; ii) Select for the greatest temporal coverage for years in the study period; iii) Select for limited multicollinearity with predictors representing the other hypotheses, as indicated by the magnitude of Spearman rank cross-correlation coefficients between predictor pairs. We also compared the results of single predictor models and our final multi-predictor models as another check of multicollinearity (Section 6 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). For the modeling analysis, if a predictor had missing data at all locations for an entire year, data from the subsequent or closest other survey year were replicated to fill in that year. If a predictor data source was available only at the state or region-level, all inclusive counties were assigned the corresponding state or region-level predictor value (e.g., assign estimated percentage of flu vaccination coverage for state of California to all counties in California). Predictors were centered and standardized prior to all exploratory analyses and modeling, as appropriate. Interaction terms comprised the product of their component centered and standardized predictors. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis were conducted primarily in R [
