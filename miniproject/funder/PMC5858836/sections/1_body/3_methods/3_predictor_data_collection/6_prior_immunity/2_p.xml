<p>Using these data, we calculated a proxy of prior immunity that captures “the proportion of individuals infected in the previous flu season that would have protection during the current flu season, accounting for the distribution of circulating flu strains” (Section 7 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). For each flu category among A/H3, A/H1, and B, we calculated the product of the previous and cxurrent year’s proportion of total circulation and a binary value to indicate if previous and current strains were from the same antigenic cluster or lineage (1 = same cluster/lineage, 0 = different cluster/lineage). For a given county, these products were summed across A/H3, A/H1, and B, and multiplied by the previous year’s epidemic intensity.
