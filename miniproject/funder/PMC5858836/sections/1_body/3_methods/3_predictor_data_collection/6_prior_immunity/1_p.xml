<p>For a given county, a proxy for prior immunity was derived from the following data: 1) the previous flu season’s total population epidemic intensity; the proportion of positive flu strains identified as A/H3, A/H1, and B in the broader HHS region during 2) the previous flu season and 3) the current flu season; 4) the most prominently circulating flu strain for each category (A/H3, A/H1, or B) for each flu season; 5) antigenic clusters for A/H3 and A/H1 strains as identified in [

Data for items 1-3 are described above in “Defining influenza disease burden” and “Flu-specific data.” We obtained the antigenic characterizations for circulating strains (item 4) from CDC influenza season summaries, which are available at
