<p>We also obtained database metadata from IMS Health on the percentage of reporting physicians and the estimated effective physician coverage by visit volume; these data were used to generate “measurement” predictors (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006020.t001">Table 1</xref>). ILI reports and measurement factors at the zip3-level were redistributed to the county-level according to population weights derived from the 2010 US Census ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) to county relationship file, assuming that ZCTAs that shared the first three digits belonged to the same zip3. These metadata indicated that our medical claims database represented roughly 24% of visits for any diagnosis from approximately 37% of all health care providers across 95% of U.S. counties during influenza season months, averaged over the years in our study period.
