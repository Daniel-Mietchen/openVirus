<p>Two measures of influenza disease burden were defined for each county. For a given season and county: We define attack rate as the sum of population-normalized and detrended ILI during the epidemic period found above (and shifted by one to accommodate the likelihood distribution). Our 
 <italic>epidemic intensity</italic> measure is defined as the standardized ratio of this attack rate and the expected attack rate. The expected attack rate is calculated as the population-weighted mean of the observed attack rates, and is a model offset described under ‘Model structure’. 
 <italic>Epidemic duration</italic> was defined as the number of weeks in the epidemic period and counties without epidemics were assigned the value zero.
