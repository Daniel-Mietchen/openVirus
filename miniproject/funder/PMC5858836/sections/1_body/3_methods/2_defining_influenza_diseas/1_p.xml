<p>We performed the following data processing steps for each county-level time series of ILI per population (Section 7 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>): i) Fit a LOESS curve to non-flu period weeks (flu period defined as November through March each year) to capture moderate-scale time trends (span = 0.4, degree = 2); ii) Subtract LOESS predictions from original data to detrend the entire time series; iii) Fit a linear regression model with annual harmonic terms and a time trend to non-flu period weeks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006020.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The epidemic period was the maximum length consecutive period where detrended ILI exceeded the epidemic threshold during the flu period. The epidemic threshold was the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the linear model prediction. Counties with a greater number of consecutive weeks above the epidemic threshold during the non-flu period than during the flu period were removed from the analysis; v) Disease burden metrics were calculated for counties with epidemics.
