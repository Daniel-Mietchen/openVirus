<p>We examined the added value of county-level information relative to state-level information by comparing the aggregation bias between county and state surveillance models. Here, we defined aggregation bias as the difference between fitted log epidemic intensity from state and county surveillance models. Positive values mean that the state model overestimates risk relative to the county model, and vice versa.</p>
