<p>We assessed the contribution of each set of group effects (i.e., season, region, state, county, county spatial dependence, observation error) to model fit by comparing the mean precision estimates for the terms, where precision is the inverse of variance. Effects with a smaller precision captured a greater magnitude of variability in the data.</p>
