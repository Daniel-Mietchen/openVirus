<p>To assess model fit, we examined scatterplots and Pearson’s cross-correlation coefficients between observed and fitted values for the epidemic intensity and epidemic duration total population surveillance models. The epidemic intensity model fit the data well and the Pearson’s cross-correlation coefficient between the observed and fitted mean relative epidemic intensity was 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.86 (Section 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). The epidemic duration model fit relatively well, and the Pearson’s cross-correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted mean number of epidemic weeks was 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.94 (Section 4 in
