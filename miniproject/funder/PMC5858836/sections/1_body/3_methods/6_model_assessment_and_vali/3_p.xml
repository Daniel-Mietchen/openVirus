<p>For each disease burden measure, we compared models with no spatial dependence, county-level dependence only, state-level dependence only, and both county and state-level dependence. The goal of the county-level dependence was to capture local population flows, while state-level dependence attempted to capture state-level flight passenger flows (details in Section 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006020.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). We determined that models with only county-level spatial neighborhood structure best fit the data after examining the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) values and spatial dependence coefficients of the four model structures, further supporting evidence in [
