<p id="Par43">We will develop a data extraction sheet to guide data collection. This sheet will direct collection of the definition and methods for each step of the cascade, the results of estimations or calculations and sources of data. The sheet will be pilot-tested by two reviewers (AG, CM) on a random sample of 10 articles and revised as needed. Two reviewers will independently read each article and extract the relevant data. Both sets of data will be entered into Epidata version 3.1 (EpiData Association, Denmark). Any discrepancies in the extracted data will be resolved by consensus, in discussion with a third reviewer (CM or ME) if necessary. We will contact study authors to resolve any information that is not clear.</p>
