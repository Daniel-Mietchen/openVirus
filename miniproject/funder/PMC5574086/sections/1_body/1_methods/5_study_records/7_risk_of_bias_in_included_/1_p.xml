<p id="Par53">Two pairs of reviewers (AG and CM) will assess included studies using ROBINS-I, a tool for assessing risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions for observational studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The tool will be adapted to the context of this systematic review, and to cross-sectional studies. ROBINS-I contains 34 questions from seven different bias domains. For each study, relevant domains of risk of bias will be graded as low, moderate, serious, critical or no information for risk of bias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Publication bias will be assessed by visually inspecting funnel plot asymmetry and by including study size in the logistic model. The quality assessment will be cross-checked, and any disagreement will be resolved within the review team.
