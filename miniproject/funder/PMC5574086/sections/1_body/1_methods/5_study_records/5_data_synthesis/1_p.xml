<p id="Par51">The main characteristics of included studies will first be narratively synthesized. Summary statistics will be used to describe study characteristics, including means (standard deviations) or medians (interquartile ranges), and frequencies (percentages). For each step of the cascade, we will calculate proportions with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and present these in forest plots. We will calculate the between-study variance (tau-squared) and 
 <italic>p</italic> values from tests of between-study heterogeneity. We expect substantial between-study heterogeneity, and the focus of the subsequent analyses will therefore be on the identification and exploration of sources of heterogeneity. We will explore associations between proportions at each step and country, setting (e.g. urban, periurban, rural; health care level, public or private setting) and study characteristics (e.g. study size, sampling frame) using random intercept logistic meta-regression (Binomial-Normal) models. These models avoid the biases that arise when Normal-Normal models (which model the within study variability via normal approximations) are applied to logit or arcsine-square root transformed proportions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Where appropriate, we will use the same models to calculate combined estimates of proportions. All analyses will be done in R version 3.2.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
