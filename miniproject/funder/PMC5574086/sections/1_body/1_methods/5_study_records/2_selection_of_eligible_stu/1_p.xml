<p id="Par42">Two reviewers will independently screen studies in two stages: title/abstract screening, followed by full text screening. A checklist with the eligibility criteria will be developed and pilot-tested on a random sample of 20 studies. Titles and abstracts will then be reviewed against the eligibility criteria by AG and FV. We will obtain full texts of all potentially eligible articles. Two reviewers will independently apply inclusion criteria (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>) to the full texts. At both screening steps, we will resolve disagreements by consensus, if necessary through discussion with a third reviewer (CM or ME). We will record all discrepancies on Excel spreadsheets, with reasons for inclusion or exclusion. The PRISMA study flow diagram will reflect this process and detail the reasons for exclusion of studies.
