<p id="Par29">We will include studies of the general population living with HIV. This will encompass male and female participants living with HIV-1 aged 15Â years or older. We will exclude studies of patients with specific co-morbidities such as tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. Studies in patients with HIV-2 will also be excluded. If the HIV type is not specified, HIV-1 will be assumed. We will exclude studies of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) as the PMTCT care cascade differs substantially from the general HIV care cascade [
