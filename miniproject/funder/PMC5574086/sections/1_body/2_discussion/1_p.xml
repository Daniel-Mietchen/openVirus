<p id="Par54">This systematic review and meta-analysis will contribute to a better understanding of the different methodological approaches used in sub-Saharan African countries to define the steps in the HIV care cascade and to estimate the numbers or percentages of people retained at each step of the cascade. We will identify gaps in the cascade and areas for further research. Our results will be useful for the design of strategies for improving the care and treatment of people living with HIV and for reducing HIV transmission. This review will thus be highly relevant to inform health systems interventions and HIV prevention and treatment strategies in sub-Saharan Africa, and low- and middle-income countries in general.</p>
