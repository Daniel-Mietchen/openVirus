<p id="Par24">The cascade can be used to evaluate HIV programme performance and serve as a monitoring tool to identify gaps and opportunities for specific interventions to improve outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and elsewhere, significant gaps remain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and retention along the HIV care cascade remains a major problem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, studies analysing the HIV care cascade use different methodologies and calculations to construct the cascade. For each element in the cascade, either measured or estimated, definitions vary and methods are often not well described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The use of different measures, for example how retention in HIV care is defined or the threshold for viral suppression, to estimate the cascade stages may affect the results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is therefore difficult to compare published cascades across regions and calendar periods.
