<p id="Par25">Few studies have evaluated the methods used to define the HIV care cascade in low- and middle-income countries, or in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A previous systematic review from 2014 looking at the whole cascade from HIV testing to viral suppression failed to identify any eligible studies from low-income countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A more recent review evaluated the cascade based on national estimates but did not include smaller in-depth studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In SSA, surveys conducted between 2007 and 2011 found that 36% of people in the region had never been tested for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and less than 50% of HIV-positive persons knew their HIV status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Focusing on SSA, we aim to perform a systematic review and meta-regression analysis to assess the different methodological approaches used to define the steps in the HIV care cascade and to estimate the numbers or proportion of people retained in each cascade step.
