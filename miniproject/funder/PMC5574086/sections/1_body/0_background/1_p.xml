<p id="Par23">In 2014, UNAIDS proposed the 90-90-90 Fast-Track treatment targets to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These targets stipulate that, by 2020, 90% of people living with HIV worldwide should know their diagnosis, 90% of these people should be on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 90% of these persons (i.e., 73% of all people living with HIV) should be virally suppressed [
