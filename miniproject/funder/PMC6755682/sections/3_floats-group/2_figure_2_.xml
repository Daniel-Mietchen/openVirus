  <p>Various phylogenetic trees of PVY ORF sequences: (a) ML tree of 460 sequences; phylogroup clusters are marked, the numbers and positions of South American isolates are circled [this project] or boxed [from GenBank]; (b) SplitsTree phylogenies of the same 460 sequence alignment; (c) all 237 N, C, and O phylogroup sequences among the 460; (d) the 190 non-recombinant sequences among the 237; and (d) the 162 of the 190 ORFs that were used for dating analyses as their collection dates were known and they did not contribute large ‘residual’ variances to TempEst analyses.</p>
