 <xref rid="vez037-B4" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al. 1990</xref>) were used with sequences representing the N and C phylogroups, which are the most distantly related PVYs. Sequences were tested for recombinants using the full suite of options in Recombination Detection Program 4 (RDP4) with default parameters (
