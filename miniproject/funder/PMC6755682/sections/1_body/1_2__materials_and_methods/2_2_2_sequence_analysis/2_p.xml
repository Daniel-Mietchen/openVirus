<p>As recombinants are only generated when a host plant is simultaneously infected with both ‘parents’, recombinants may give useful information of when and where particular isolates or lineages were geographically co-located, and the most recently divergent of the two ‘parental’ lineages gives the maximum date of the recombinant event. These events and dates were obtained by separating the recombinant-containing alignment into two parts; one part containing the sequence of only one parent, and the other part containing the sequence of only the other parent. Trees calculated from these subalignments were then compared using Figtree (
