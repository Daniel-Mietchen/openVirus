<p>Total RNA was extracted from each sample using Trizol as instructed by the manufacturer. The large RNA fraction was precipitated by adding 1 volume of 4 M LiCl4 at ∼4 °C (on ice) overnight, followed by centrifugation. The remaining small RNA fraction was subsequently precipitated by adding 1 volume of isopropanol followed by centrifugation. Small RNAs were separated on 3.5 per cent agarose gels and bands corresponding to ∼20–25 nts excised and purified using quantum prep freeze and squeeze columns (Bio-Rad). Small RNA libraries were prepared using the protocol of

 <xref rid="vez037-B113" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al. 2017</xref>) v1.6 to identify all viruses infecting the plants, and samples in which PVY was identified were selected for further analysis. We specifically selected samples that showed no signs of possible mixed infections with other isolates and each was double checked by re-aligning of sRNA reads to the consensus using Geneious software, in all cases, and the majority consensus sequence was saved. It has previously been shown that sRNA sequences truthfully represent the viral sequence and its variants in PVY (
