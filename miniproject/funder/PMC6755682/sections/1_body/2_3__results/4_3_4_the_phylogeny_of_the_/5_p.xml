<p>Since their appearance in Europe in the 1980s, the R1 and R2 phylogroup populations have become as widespread as those of the O phylogroup in most world regions although apparently not in the Andean region. As described above their ORF sequences have three distinct regions with different ancestry, and their core region (nts 2,605–5,502) is always closest to the same region of O phylogroup ORFs. Thus, this region is potentially able to provide comparative phylogenetic information for all PVY isolates, both n-rec and recombinant. However, when that region of all 460 ORFs (i.e. all phylogroups) was analyzed it was found to be much less phylogenetically informative than the 190 full-length ORFs as judged by SH values. Thus, it was not possible to unequivocally identify the earliest R1 or R2 sequences, or their dates, or their likely parents; as was similarly reported for a smaller number of sequences by
