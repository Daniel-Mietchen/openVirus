<p>The other basal branch of the PVY phylogeny in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F3">Fig. 3</xref> is more complex in that its first branch is to the Chile 3 ORF (FJ214726), and later it diverges to the O and C phylogroup clusters. The Chile 3 isolate is basal and is known from one complete sequence (FJ214726; 
 <xref rid="vez037-B81" ref-type="bibr">Moury 2010</xref>) and partial sequences from three other isolates also from peppers in Chile (
 <xref rid="vez037-B105" ref-type="bibr">Sudarsono et al. 1993</xref>); parts of the genomes of these four isolates differ from one another by 1–6 per cent ID indicating that they represent a significantly variable population. All came from 
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> 
 <italic>baccatum</italic>; the Chile 3 isolate came from a pool of market fruits of unknown provenance (B. Moury, pers. comm.). The next most distal divergence produced the monophyletic and large O phylogroup; its O1 and O2 clusters are of 135 closely related isolates, and few from South America.
