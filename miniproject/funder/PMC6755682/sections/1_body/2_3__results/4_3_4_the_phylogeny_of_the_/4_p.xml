<p>The interpretation of the other parts of the C and O lineage is less certain as it depends on whether one interprets the cluster of seven isolates called O3 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F3">Fig. 3</xref> as the sister group of the O1 and O2 clusters, or as the basal branches of the C phylogroup. We propose that the first possibility is correct because, in TempEst analyses described below, the O3 sequences had ‘residual variances’ similar to those of the N, O1, and O2 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>) in correlations between tree positions and date of collection, whereas all C phylogroup isolates gave much larger residuals. Furthermore, the host from which each isolate was obtained gave similar groupings; the O1, O2, and O3 isolates were all from 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> or potato hybrids except two from tobacco. In contrast, only one of thirteen hosts of the C phylogroup was 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> Only eleven O phylogroup isolates were from South America (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>), seven in the O1 cluster were from Peru, and formed a cluster with one from Brazil (JQ924285) and isolates from China, UK, and USA. All were distal to isolates not collected in South America suggesting that they might be ‘remigrants’; they could have escaped in new cultivars released in the 1960s and 1970s, before rigorous virus testing of all releases was instigated. The remaining three from Peru are in a sister clade to two from the UK and one from France within the O3 cluster, but with more basal branches to an isolate from ‘fingerling’ potato cv. Kipfler from Australia, and the O1 and O2 clade. Despite the small number of isolates involved this may indicate that the Peruvian O3s are remigrants; remigration is possible as over the last 70 years a large number of 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> plants have been imported to Peru as tubers for breeding purposes, and would not have been tested rigorously for virus infection, before or after importation to Peru, until comprehensive regular virus testing was started in the 1980s, after 
 <italic>Potato spindle tuber viroid</italic> was found in potato breeding lines from Peru in the late 1970s.
