<p>In all PVY phylogenetic trees, the N phylogroup is one of the basal sister lineages, and is the simplest of the two to interpret. The basal two-thirds of this lineage is represented by a single branch which dichotomized to form three major clusters of closely related sequences labeled N1, N2, and N3 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F3">Fig.Â 3</xref>. Twenty three N isolates were South American, and only eleven from elsewhere. All except four came from 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> or from potato hybrids; three of the exceptions were from other 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> spp., and a fourth from tobacco. Divergence of the N lineage gave the N1 cluster, all the isolates of which came from Peru. Its sister lineage split into the N2 and N3 clusters. The N2 cluster contains isolates from Peru and Colombia, and only the N3 cluster includes any isolates from overseas, all of them closely related to others from South America. This clear pattern may be safely interpreted to indicate that the N phylogroup is widespread in the Andean region of South America, and that it has spread overseas only recently.
