<p>BLASTn and BLASTp searches using representative sequences from non-recombinant N and O phylogroup sequences found the most closely related genomic sequences to be those of pepper severe mosaic virus (PSMV) (AM181350; 
 <xref rid="vez037-B3" ref-type="bibr">Ahn 2006</xref>) isolated from 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> crops in the San Juan province of Argentina (
 <xref rid="vez037-B24" ref-type="bibr">Feldman and Gracia 1977</xref>), and then sunflower chlorotic mottle virus (JN863233) and bidens mosaic virus (KF649336); all 69–72 per cent identical in nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequences. The outgroup root for either the 190 n-rec ORFs or their encoded amino acid sequences were on the same ‘edge’ of their phylogenies, at the base of the N phylogroup and close to the divergence between the Chile 3 (FJ214726) sequence and the remainder of the C phylogroup. These root positions were also close to the midpoint roots calculated from ML trees of ORF sequences by Figtree and TempEst.
