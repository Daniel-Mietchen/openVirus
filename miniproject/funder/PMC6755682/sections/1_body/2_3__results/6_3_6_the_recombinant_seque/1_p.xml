<p>About half the 460 PVY genomes are R1 and R2 recombinants with an O phylogroup core region (nts 2,605–5,505) and one or both terminal regions from an N phylogroup ‘parent’. The core region has few recombinants; one certain (KY848014) and three possible recombinants (AJ889868, AJ890343, and KY848014) among all 460. The core region, despite being almost one-third of the ORF in length, provided unreliable phylogenetic and dating information; well-supported clusters obtained with the complete ORFs overlapped when calculated from the core sequences as had been reported by
