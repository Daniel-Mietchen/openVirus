<p>The six N and O phylogroup recombinants are actually records of only two isolates. One includes the PVY GenBank Reference Sequence 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NC_001616" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">NC_001616</ext-link>, which is an OxN recombinant (i.e. O major, N minor), and was derived, 
 <italic>in silico</italic>, from three earlier GenBank submissions, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="A08776" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A08776</ext-link>, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="D00441" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">D00441</ext-link>, and 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="X12456" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">X12456</ext-link>. All four group on a single elongated branch in NJ and ML trees (recD in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2a</xref>). The virus was first isolated from 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> in France in the 1980s by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B93" ref-type="bibr">Robaglia et al. (1989)</xref>. An identical sequence is recorded, probably incorrectly, as AF522296 from Egypt (
 <xref rid="vez037-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abdel El-Mohsen 2003</xref>). The minor recombinant region of this sequence, nts 7,722–8,150, is most closely related to the homologous region of AJ890346 from 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> reported from Germany in 2003, and also four isolates (MH795846, MH795847, MH795848, and MH795863) of the N3 sublineage found in 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> × 
 <italic>S.t.a.</italic> crosses in Peru (i.e. this study). The major portion of the ORF is most closely related to KY848012 and other O phylogroup isolates collected in the USA, UK, and Australia from 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> from 2003 to 2016. Patristic distance comparisons indicate that the node linking the major region of the recombinant’s ORF to its nearest relative formed in 1923 CE, but that joining the minor recombinant region to its relatives was no earlier than 1969. Thus, it is most likely that this recombinant was generated in Europe no earlier than 1969.
