<p>The CxO recombinant KR528584 (recB in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) is a PVY metagenome found in the publicly available transcriptome of a plant of 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> clone ‘Tannat’ growing in Uruguay (
 <xref rid="vez037-B15" ref-type="bibr">Da Silva et al. 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez037-B51" ref-type="bibr">Jo et al. 2015</xref>). The major ‘parental region’ of the ORF (nts 509–9,210) grouped closely with the C phylogroup genome EU482153, which was isolated from 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> 
 <italic>lycopersicum</italic> in Italy. Its minor O phylogroup region (nts 1–508) is most closely related to the homologous region of KP691319, which was collected from a 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> plant in the UK in 1984. Patristic distance comparisons show that the node linking the minor recombinant region and its nearest relative was dated around 1945 CE. None of the nearest relatives of either the major or minor recombinant regions of KR528584 were collected in South America. Thus we conclude, that this recombinant, and the grapevine stock in which it was found, was a ‘remigrant’ recently imported into Uruguay from Europe, and not from the original Tannat stock carried to Uruguay from the Basque region by settlers in the 19th century (
