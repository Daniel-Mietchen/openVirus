<p>Recombinants may also give an indication of relative node datings, and this is clearest when the parents are from different phylogroups, rather than when they are from the same phylogroup. Such information can be obtained for each recombinant by separating the alignment which contains it into two subalignments; one containing the parts of the alignment that include the ORF sequence of one ‘parent’ and the other containing the ORF sequence of the other ‘parent’. Trees calculated from the subalignments are then compared. The 237 N, C, and O phylogroup genomes included three CxO recombinants (n.b. major parent first), five OxN and one NxO, and, of course, no CxN recombinants, as expected as they mostly infected different host species.</p>
