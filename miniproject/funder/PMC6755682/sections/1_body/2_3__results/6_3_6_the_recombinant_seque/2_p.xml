<p>Recombinants may, however, also provide information about when and where their parental populations co-infected a host. Phylogenies calculated separately from the 5′ terminal (nts 1–2,604) and 3′ terminal (nts 5,506–9,201) regions of R1 and R2 phylogroup sequences both found that the N3, but not the N1 and N2, sequences were a sister cluster closest to the terminal regions of R1 and R2 sequences (SH support 1.0). N1 and N2 isolates have only been found in South America, whereas N3 isolates have also been found outside South America, and thus these relationships indicate that the recombination event(s) that produced the PTNRD-causing isolates of the R2 phylogroup likely occurred outside South America. However, 
 <xref rid="vez037-B98" ref-type="bibr">Salazar (2006)</xref> suggests that isolates causing tuber necrosis may have ‘always been present in the Andes’ and ‘found in native potato cultivars in remote locations in the Andes that were never planted together or close to modern cultivars’, and ‘were probably spread with all the potato viruses when the crop was introduced to Europe in the XVI century’. Doubt remains as ‘The symptoms observed in the native cultivars under field conditions are not the same as those reported elsewhere. The symptoms in the Andean potatoes resemble more the russeting symptoms (reticulate surface cracking) that are observed with infections by some fungi and Streptomyces that are sometimes associated with mild to severe cracks on the tubers’.
