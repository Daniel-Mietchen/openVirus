 <xref rid="vez037-B48" ref-type="bibr">Jakab et al. 1997</xref>). ML trees of the separated regions confirmed that the closest isolate to its minor recombinant region is in the sequences AJ585195 and KP691326 which were both isolated from S.t.t. in the UK in 2003 and 1984, respectively. Its minor recombinant region is nts 7,748–8,150, which is almost the same region as in the reciprocal OxN recombinants discussed above. The possible reason for the unlikely occurrence of ‘reciprocal recombinants’ in a single region is that this region encodes two important and adjacent core motifs of the potyvirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases; the -GNNSGQP- motif (
