<p>The CxO recombinant AF237963 (recA in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) is the ‘pepper veinal necrosis’ strain-nnp found in Italy and isolated from 
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> 
 <italic>annum</italic> (
 <xref rid="vez037-B23" ref-type="bibr">Fanigliulo et al. 2005</xref>). In an ML phylogeny, its full ORF sequence forms a long basal branch among C phylogroup ORFs, but, in an RDP analysis, its 5′ terminal 375 nts region (4.1% of the ORF) was found by six methods to group with the homologous region of O phylogroup sequences with probabilities of random similarity of 10
 <sup>−35</sup> to 10
 <sup>−10</sup>. Most of the ORF of AF237963 (nts 376–9,210) is most closely related to the homologous region of a C phylogroup isolate EU563512 collected from a 
 <italic>S. t.t</italic> plant in the Netherlands in 1938, whereas the sequence of nts 1–375 is most closely related to that region of an O phylogroup isolate KY847936 collected from a 
 <italic>S. t.t</italic> plant in the USA in 2005 (
 <xref rid="vez037-B37" ref-type="bibr">Green et al. 2017</xref>). Patristic distance comparisons using the dates in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F4">Fig. 4</xref> indicate that the node linking the AF237963 and EU563512 lineages diverged about a century ago. The minor recombinant region grouped most closely with the isolate KY847936, whose ten closest relatives were also from 
 <italic>S. t.t</italic> plants collected between 2000 and 2006 CE in the USA. Patristic distance comparisons, using 1868 CE as the date of the basal node of the O phylogroup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F4">Fig. 4</xref>), indicated that the node linking the minor recombinant region and its nearest relatives formed in 1980.5 CE, namely just before AF237963 was collected in Italy. So, in summary, AF237963 most likely came from a doubly infected 
 <italic>S.t.t.</italic> plant growing after 1981 in Europe or North America but not South America.
