<p>The layered pattern of branches in the ML phylogeny (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2a</xref>) indicated that there were a large number of recombinants in the data, and this was confirmed by a SplitsTree analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2b;</xref>
 <xref rid="vez037-B47" ref-type="bibr">Huson and Bryant 2006</xref>). The latter showed many parallel links within and between the major phylogroups; the NJ tree of the same data was closely similar in topology. When the 103 R1 and 120 R2 phylogroup sequences were removed, the remaining 237 O, C, and N phylogroup ORFs gave a much simpler SplitsTree diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). These were then examined for additional phylogenetic anomalies using RDP4. Forty seven recombinant sequences were found, thirty-eight were intra-phylogroup recombinants, and only nine were inter-phylogroup recombinants. The remaining 190 non-recombinant (n-rec) sequences gave a much simpler SplitsTree diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2d</xref>).
