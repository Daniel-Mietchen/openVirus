<p>The ‘collection dates’ of 180 of the 190 n-rec N, C, and O phylogroup ORFs are known (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>); they range from 1938 to 2016 CE (15% are pre-2000 CE). However, several of the dated sequences, mostly from non-potato hosts and in the C phylogroup, behaved anomalously in TempEst analyses (see below), and so were removed to give the 162 ORF alignment used for Bayesian dating analyses. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2e</xref> is the SplitsTree diagram of the 162 ORFs alignment.
