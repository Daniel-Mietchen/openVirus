<p>The 32 new PVY sequences, all from Peru, together with 428 PVY sequences downloaded from GenBank in January 2018 gave a dataset of 460 genomic sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref>). The principal ORFs from these genomic sequences produced an alignment 9,201 nts long. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2a</xref> shows the branch pattern of the maximum likelihood (ML) tree calculated from this alignment. It closely resembles in all major features the trees calculated earlier from smaller sets of PVY sequences published by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B58" ref-type="bibr">Kehoe and Jones (2016</xref>; 73 sequences) and 
 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017</xref>; 240 sequences). The ML tree shows the same five major phylogroups, O, C, N, R1, and R2, reported by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017)</xref>. It included the thirty-two new Peruvian sequences (
