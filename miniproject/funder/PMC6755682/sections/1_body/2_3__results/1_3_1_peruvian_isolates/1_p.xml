<p>In 2016, leaf samples were collected from 552 potato plants showing symptoms of mosaic, leaf deformation and/or stunting growing in fields at altitudes of 2,443–3,916 masl in four departments in the northern (Cajamarca), central (Huanuco, Junin), and southern (Cusco) Andean highlands of Peru (

 <italic>phureja, Solanum</italic> 
 <italic>stenotomum</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>goniocalyx, S. × chaucha</italic> using the former species nomenclature). Viruses infecting them were identified by small RNA sequencing and their ‘viromes’ (

A number of viruses, with customary acronyms PVX, PVY, PVS, PVB, PVV, APMoV, PLRV, PVA, PMTV, PYV, APLV, and APMMV (listed in order of frequency), were identified in the study, but this paper will consider only one PVY. It was the second most common virus after PVX and detected in 235 (∼43%) of the samples, but many of these could not be resolved into individual or high quality complete sequences, due to mixed infection with multiple genotypes or gaps in the genome coverage by the RNA data respectively. Thirty-two samples were selected for analysis in this study as they yielded (near) complete genomic sequences and were only infected by a single PVY genotype, which was confirmed to be present in them by RT-PCR testing (

 <italic>S.t.a.</italic> crosses. These cultivars were sampled in the following departments: Cajamarca (Perricholi), Huanuco (Canchan, Capiro, Yungay) Junin (Perricholi, Yungay), and Cusco (Canchan, Cica). There were also four samples of the native potato land race 
 <italic>S.t.a. cv</italic> Ccompis, all from the Anta province in the Cusco department.
