<p>To assess the variation of PVY sequences found in the 203 remaining samples, we selected all samples yielding assembled contigs with a minimum of 850 nts covering the coat protein region and aligned them to representative sequences of phylogroups O1–3, N1–3, and R1 &amp; R2. These corresponded to 121 samples, of which 65 included significantly differing contigs covering similar genomic regions, indicating mixed infections. Of those, 17 contained the 850 nts fragment used in our analysis and all represented combinations of isolates from the same phylogroups. Based on coat protein alignment 114 sequences belonged to N1 (from Cusco, Junin, and Cajamarca), 5 to N3 (from Cusco), and 1 each to O3 (Cajamarca) and O1/O2 (Cusco). Thus the thirty-two genome sequences utilized in this study represented well the variability found among the remaining PVY positive samples from the survey.</p>
