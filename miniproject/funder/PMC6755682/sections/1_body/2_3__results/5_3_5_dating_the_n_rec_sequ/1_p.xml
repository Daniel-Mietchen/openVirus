<p>TempEst analyses of both NJ and ML trees of the 190 sequence dataset gave invalid TMRCA estimates; in the future, not in the past! Also, it was notable that all of the ORFs of the C phylogroup sequences, produced large residuals in the TempEst regression analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Indeed, given the well-established root of the phylogeny, this indicates that the C phylogroup ORFs had evolved around 2.5 times as fast as the N and O phylogroup ORFs (nucleotide diversity π  =  0.1124 for C phylogroup sequences compared with π  =  0.027 for O phylogroup sequences;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F3">Fig. 3</xref>, which was drawn with the midpoint root positioned so that the major O and N phylogroup clusters fell on the same region of the 
 <italic>X</italic>-axis, thereby accentuating the difference in branch length (i.e. evolutionary rate) between the C phylogroup and the O and N phylogroups. We therefore tested the effect of sequentially removing the ORFs with the largest residuals, namely all the C phylogroup sequences and a few others, and obtained more sensible TMRCA estimates. Some of the 180 dated sequences lacked their full 5′ termini, so the shortest sequences were removed, and then the 5′ terminal 240 nts of all remaining ORFs were removed to decrease potential phylogenetic error arising from gaps. This resulted in an alignment of 162 almost-complete ORF sequences, 8,925 nts long, for dating analysis, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F2">Fig. 2d</xref> confirmed that the SplitsTree branching pattern for this dataset was recombinant-free.
