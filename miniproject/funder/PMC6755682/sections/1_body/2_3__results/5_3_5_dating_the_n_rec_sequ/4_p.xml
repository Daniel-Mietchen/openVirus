<p>The mean TMRCA of PVY found by the Bayesian analyses was used as a datum to interpolate the dates of other nodes in the 162 ORF ML tree using patristic distances (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vez037-F4">Fig.Â 4</xref> shows the nodes that were significantly supported (&gt;0.99 SH), and their dates as calculated arithmetically from the TMRCA; relative dates were obtained from the ratios of the mean pairwise patristic distances of all sequences (i.e. tips) connected through individual nodes.
