<p>TempEst analyses of the 162 ORF dataset gave TMRCAs of 485 BCE for the NJ tree (correlation coefficient 0.139, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0394) and 1,278 BCE for the ML tree (correlation coefficient, 0.129, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0508). LSD analyses of the same data also gave sensible TMRCAs; NJ tree, 1344 BCE and ML tree 3383 BCE, but with large 95 per cent confidence intervals (CIs). These results indicated that, when the ORFs with noticeably faster evolutionary rates (i.e. C phylogroup) were removed, there was a negative linear correlation between collection date and phylogenetic position in both NJ and ML trees. Therefore, a Bayesian MCMC analysis of the 162 ORFs was done using the BEAST program.
