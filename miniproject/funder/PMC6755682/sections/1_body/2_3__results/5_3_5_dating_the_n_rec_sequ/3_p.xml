<p>Bayes factors were calculated for the dated, trimmed 162 ORFs, using twelve combinations of substitution models (

 <xref rid="vez037-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results (
 <xref rid="vez037-T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed that the ‘relaxed uncorrelated lognormal’ clock with ‘expansion growth’ or ‘Bayesian skyline plot’ models gave adequate effective sample sizes with the largest Bayes factors calculated by either ‘path sampling’ or ‘stepping-stone’ sampling (
 <xref rid="vez037-B6" ref-type="bibr">Baele et al. 2012</xref>). The resulting TMRCA estimates are of 1841 and 1879 years before 2016; mean 1860 YBP or 156 CE. These TMRCAs were outside the range obtained from ten independently date-randomized replicates (
 <xref rid="vez037-B91" ref-type="bibr">Ramsden, Holmes, and Charleston 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vez037-B21" ref-type="bibr">Duchêne et al. 2015</xref>), confirming that the temporal signal in the data was adequate for BEAST dating. The TMRCA of 1860 YBP had 95 per cent confidence intervals of 1174.5–2640.5 YBP, which gives a ‘coefficient of variation’ (i.e. 95% CI range/TMRCA as %) of 78.8 per cent, whereas the earlier estimate reported by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017)</xref> had a TMRCA of 3,603 (1,411–6,566) YBP, so was within the same range, but had a coefficient of variation of 151.4 per cent. The evolutionary rate of the C phylogroup could not be determined directly as too few dated sequences were available.
