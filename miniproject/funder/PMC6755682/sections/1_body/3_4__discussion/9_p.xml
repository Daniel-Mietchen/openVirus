<p>There is still much to learn about the evolution of PVY. More will undoubtably be learned from the genomic sequences of more isolates from the Andean center of potato domestication, also the Chiloe region, especially ones from potato land races, wild potato species and other solanaceous crops. Likewise, sequencing of PVY isolates from the islands visited by the early trans-Atlantic traders, and the remnant stocks of early European potatoes, such as the ‘fingerling’ types, might also provide further intriguing information.</p>
