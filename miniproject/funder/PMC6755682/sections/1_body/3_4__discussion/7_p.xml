<p>‘Potato degeneration’, summarized by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B95" ref-type="bibr">Salaman (1925)</xref>, was caused by a complex of virus diseases that was recognized in the early days of the European crop especially when potatoes were propagated by tuber from year to year rather than being grown from seed. One form of degeneration called ‘The Curl’ in the UK was clearly caused by virus infection and first described in the 1770s. The dominant cause was probably potato leaf roll virus, but one or more mosaic-causing viruses also fit some of the contemporary descriptions (

Selection of new cultivars from naturally formed potato seedlings, and only much later through controlled crossing, resulted in a plethora of cultivars. The earliest potato breeding programs of any size began in 1810, but the practice did not become widespread until the second half of the 19th century. It was stimulated by the disastrous epidemics of potato blight disease caused by the oomycete

This appeared in the middle of the 19th century, ruined the crop, and eliminated almost all cultivars as they were so inbred and susceptible. Breeding among blight survivors, together with new introductions from South America, led to many new cultivars being grown by early 20th century (

Thus although the initial divergence of the O lineage was well before the Inca era, most major divergences occurred after the potato crop was established in Europe. Likewise although the N phylogroup lineage first diverged in the early 16th century, most of its radiation occurred after 1899 CE (
