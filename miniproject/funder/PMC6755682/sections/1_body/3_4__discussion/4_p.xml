<p>These conclusions allow us to draft a credible history of PVY from when it diverged from PSMV possibly around 8,000 YBP, which is soon after humankind reached South America and started domesticating potatoes. Humans first spread throughout the Americas, from Beringia, at least 13,000–14,500 YBP (

 <xref rid="vez037-B109" ref-type="bibr">Wade 2018</xref>), and probably earlier. Amerindians colonized the Altiplano region around Lake Titicaca around 9,000 YBP. They domesticated potatoes by selecting and hybridizing from the diverse local tuber-bearing

 <xref rid="vez037-B72" ref-type="bibr">Lindo et al. 2018</xref>) to be genetically related to past inhabitants of the region for 4,000, and probably 7,000 years. Furthermore, all were found to have enzymic adaptations to high altitude life and a high starch diet that are not found in present day Amerindians in coastal south Chile from whom they split around 8,750 years ago. The initial populations of

 <xref rid="vez037-B63" ref-type="bibr">Kloosterman et al. 2013</xref>) in the Lake Titicaca region, or by the altitudinal and climatic barriers along the length of the high Andes (
 <xref rid="vez037-B44" ref-type="bibr">Hazzi et al. 2018</xref>), although they were eaten in coastal northern Peru, and stylized in the pottery of the Moche culture of that region (
 <xref rid="vez037-B22" ref-type="bibr">Duke et al. 2018</xref>), but seem not to have been taken further north than this. This restricted range, until the European invasion, is in contrast to the spread of maize over the same time period from its site of domestication in Mesoamerica, especially Mexico, to establish a secondary center of maize diversity in central South America (
