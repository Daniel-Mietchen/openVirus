<p>PVY is the best studied member of the PVY lineage of potyviruses (
 <xref rid="vez037-B20" ref-type="bibr">Duarte et al. 2014</xref>), of which there are twenty-seven known members all except two of them isolated in the Americas, and seventeen of them having never been found anywhere else. They have a distinctive host range; most of the hosts are dicotyledonous asterids (

 <xref rid="vez037-B114" ref-type="bibr">Zimmer and Wen 2013</xref>), none are rosids, and Solanaceae are not their only asterid hosts, as four are from Asteraceae. The PVY lineage arose in the Americas after diverging from the basal viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Potyvirus</italic>, which probably originated in Western Europe or north-west Africa (
 <xref rid="vez037-B29" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs and Ohshima 2010</xref>). As mentioned above, the potyvirus closest to PVY is PSMV, and judging from patristic distances in a protein sequence ML tree of known PVY lineage viruses (
 <xref rid="vez037-B26" ref-type="bibr">Fribourg et al. 2019</xref>) PVY and PSMV may have diverged around 8,000 YBP (i.e. four times the TMRCA of PVY).
