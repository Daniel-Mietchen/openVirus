<p>In summary, our analyses of the PVY sequences provide evidence that: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Phylogeny:</p>
   <list list-type="simple">
    <list-item>
     <p>a. The phylogeny of complete non-recombinant PVY ORF sequences has a basal divergence that produces an N phylogroup lineage and a sister lineage that has a basal branch to the Chile 3 isolate from the pepper (
      <italic>C. baccatum</italic>) and a major lineage to the C and O phylogroups;
     </p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>b. The N phylogroup is predominantly and indigenously Andean, and only isolates from its N3 cluster have been found in plants growing outside South America (see also N3 recombinants below);</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>c. O phylogroup isolates were mostly from plants growing outside South America. The few from South America are all phylogenetically distal to isolates from elsewhere, so they may be ‘remigrants’, rather than being related to a South American PVY population only via indigenous intermediate infections.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>d. The C phylogroup lineage is a monophyletic branch of the O phylogroup. No C phylogroup isolates are from South America;</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>e. N and O phylogroup populations were mostly isolated from potatoes, and their ‘temporal structure’ is indistinguishable, whereas the C phylogroup isolates came from a wide range of solanaceous plants, rarely potatoes, and have evolved at least 2.5 times faster than N and O populations;</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>f. Half the sequenced genomes (460—Jan 2018) are NxO recombinants, which form two phylogroups (R1 and R2). Their N phylogroup terminal regions are most closely related to those of N3 genomes rather than to either N1 or N2 genomes, and there is no evidence from these recombinants that pairs of N, C, and O isolates co-infected plants when within South America.</p>
    </list-item>
    <list-item>
     <p>g. The site of the original N population is clearly the Andes, but that of the O population is unknown, and maybe the southern Chilean 
      <italic>S.t.t.</italic> population (Isle of Chiloe), which is known to be infected with PVY of which the phylogroup status is unknown.

     <list-item>
      <p>a. The TMRCA of the non-recombinant dated world PVY population (&lt;January 2018) is 1860 YBP or 156 CE;</p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <p>b. The dated phylogeny of PVY corresponds well with the history of the potato crop. Only the most basal divergences of the O and N phylogroups occurred before transatlantic marine trade started in the 16th century. O phylogroup isolates probably came to Europe from a South American site, that has not been identified, in the earliest transported potatoes. N phylogroup isolates came more recently and probably from the Andes, and the NxO recombination event(s) that produced the PTNRD-causing R1 and R2 recombinants occurred in the 20th century outside South America, probably in Europe;</p>
     </list-item>
     <list-item>
      <p>c. The major radiations of PVY populations probably occurred immediately after the famine-producing epidemics of late blight (
       <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic>) in European potato crops in the mid-19th century. Subsequent potato breeding and trade probably drove virus spread and divergence.
