<p>Two recent papers on potato virus S (PVS), a carlavirus, reported phylogenies with the same topology as that of PVY, namely a South American origin and a recent major European divergence, which was dated 1837 CE by LSD analysis of 35 ORF sequences (
 <xref rid="vez037-B100" ref-type="bibr">Santillan et al. 2018</xref>) and 1859 CE by BEAST analysis of 103 CP sequences (
 <xref rid="vez037-B19" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al. 2018</xref>). Thus the date for the divergence of PVS and PVY in the European potato crop is, in essence, the same, and is around or soon after the Great Potato Famine. Why the LSD dating method worked for PVS, but not PVY, is not known but may be because the host range of PVS is much more limited than that of PVY (
 <xref rid="vez037-B12" ref-type="bibr">Brunt et al. 1996</xref>), and therefore, in the wild, they probably differ in their ability to infect, and gain greater genetic diversity in, novel hosts.
