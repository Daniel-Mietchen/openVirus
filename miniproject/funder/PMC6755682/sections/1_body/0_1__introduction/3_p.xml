 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017)</xref> found that all PVY isolates for which complete genome sequences were then known fall into five distinct phylogroups (N, C, O, R1, and R2). Half of all the isolates form the N, C, and O phylogroups, most isolates of which are non-recombinant, whereas the R1 and R2 phylogroups are all recombinants with two underlying patterns of recombination; both have genomes with a 5′-terminal region from a N phylogroup parent (1–2,604 of the 9,201 nucleotides, nts) and an O group core region (2,605–5,505 nts), but whereas the R1 isolates have a 3′-terminal region (5,506–9,201 nts) from the O phylogroup parent, those of the R2 isolates are from an N parent. The R1 and R2 isolates are of considerable economic importance as most, but not all, cause PTNRD, although not all PTNRD is caused by R1 and R2 isolates. Thus the two nomenclatural systems, host genetics versus virus genetics, mostly coincide, but not always. For example, PVY

 <sup>z</sup> isolates to phylogroup O (

 <sup>z</sup> isolates to R2 (
