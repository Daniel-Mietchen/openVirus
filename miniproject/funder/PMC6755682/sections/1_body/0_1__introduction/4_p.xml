<p>The PVY sequences reported to GenBank come from all continents except Antarctica. However, in January 2018, none had been reported from the Andean region of Bolivia and Peru, which is where potatoes were originally domesticated, and where the greatest genetic diversity of cultivated and wild potato species occurs (

 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> is the only potato species widely cultivated outside this region whereas additional cultivated potato species and a large number of land races are widely grown there. Although they were originally grouped as nine species, they were recently rearranged into four (

 <xref rid="vez037-B10" ref-type="bibr">Brown 1993</xref>). As the greatest diversity of cultivated and wild potato species occurs in the Andean region, it is important to know whether PVY is similarly diverse in the same region as this could imply that they had co-evolved there. Moreover, this has already been reported to be so for two other common potato viruses, 
 <italic>Potato virus S</italic> (PVS; genus 
 <italic>Carlavirus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Potato virus X</italic> (PVX, genus 
 <italic>Potexvirus)</italic> (

 <xref rid="vez037-B100" ref-type="bibr">Santillan et al. 2018</xref>). In the Andean region, PVY infection is common in potato plantings at altitudes below 3,000 masl (meters above sea level) but not above. This apparently reflects the greater abundance of its aphid vectors below this level, whereas the colder higher altitudes do not limit spread of contact-transmitted viruses PVS and PVX.
