<p>In this paper, we report thirty-two additional isolates of PVY from the Peruvian region of the Andes, and the genomic sequences obtained from them. These, together with a further eight from the Colombian region published recently in GenBank, have allowed much more informative dating analyses to be done. The analyses indicate that the TMRCA of the world PVY population is earlier than previously proposed, and we interpret the historical events that the virus and its hosts have possibly shared since then.</p>
