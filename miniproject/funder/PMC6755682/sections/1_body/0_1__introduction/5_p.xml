<p>An understanding of the factors that produced the demography of the present PVY population requires knowledge of the history of both the virus and its hosts. There is a well recorded history of the potato and its wild relatives (

 <xref rid="vez037-B108" ref-type="bibr">Visser, Bellstedt, and Pirie (2012)</xref> concluded that the ‘time to most recent common ancestor’ (TMRCA) of the extant population was around the time when potatoes were first introduced from South America to Europe (i.e. the 16th century). A similar study with more sequences by 
 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017)</xref> inferred that the TMRCA of the virus was earlier, around 1,000 CE. However, the confidence limits of both estimates were large and overlapping. 
 <xref rid="vez037-B31" ref-type="bibr">Gibbs et al. (2017)</xref> concluded that isolates obtained from the Andean center of potato domestication would probably be more temporally informative and therefore essential for successful dating.
