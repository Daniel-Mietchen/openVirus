<p>The potato is now one of the most important food crops globally (

 <italic>Potato virus Y</italic> (PVY; genus

 <xref rid="vez037-B66" ref-type="bibr">Kus 1992</xref>) appeared and proved difficult to control in seed potato crops. PVY is carried in infected tubers, is transmitted locally non-persistently by aphids and is occasionally transmitted by plant-to-plant contact. In addition to diminishing tuber quality through PTNRD, it decreases tuber yields by up to 80 per cent (
