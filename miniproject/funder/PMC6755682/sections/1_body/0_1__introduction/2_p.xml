<p>Several biological strain groups (i.e. pathotypes) and phylogroups of PVY have been distinguished using biological and gene sequence differences, respectively. Biological strain groups from potato are recognized firstly by the necrotic phenotypes that develop when inoculated to potato cultivar ‘differentials’ carrying strain-specific hypersensitivity genes, and then by whether they cause systemic veinal necrosis symptoms in tobacco. Thus, PVY
