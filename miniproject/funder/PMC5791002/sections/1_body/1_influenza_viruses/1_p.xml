<p>Influenza is caused by influenza viruses that circulate worldwide and that can be spread from person to person through airborne droplets or contact. Influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family and have a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with helical symmetry and different sizes of ribonucleoproteins. The influenza virus genus is divided into three types—A, B, and C—as defined by the antigenicity of the nucleoproteins and matrix proteins in the viral core

 </sup>. Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes according to the antigenic properties of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Eighteen antigenically different hemagglutinins (H1–18) and eleven different neuraminidases (N1–11) have been identified and their combination designates the virus subtype. Currently, H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A are endemic in humans. Circulating influenza B viruses are classified into two groups: Yamagata-like or Victoria-like lineages

 </sup>. Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics, and current vaccines are designed to target these viruses. Influenza type C viruses are detected much less frequently and cause mild infections, which do not present significant public health concerns. Influenza types differ in the range of animal hosts that they can infect: humans are the only known reservoir of influenza B and C, whereas influenza A is also found in other animals

 </sup>. Given the multiple subtypes, higher mutation rates, and diverse hosts, influenza A poses the greatest pandemic threat. People are susceptible to influenza throughout their lives because of the ability of the virus to continually mutate by antigenic drift and antigenic shift (only influenza A viruses) mechanisms
