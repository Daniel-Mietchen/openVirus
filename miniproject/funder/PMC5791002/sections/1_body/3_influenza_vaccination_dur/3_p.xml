<p>The timing of vaccination during pregnancy influences the quantity of antibodies transferred to the fetus. Transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies begins during the second pregnancy trimester (around 17 weeks of gestation) and peaks towards the end of pregnancy when the expression of FcRn increases

 </sup>; therefore, antibody concentrations are generally lower in premature than in full-term newborns

 </sup>. Nevertheless, a study in Switzerland has shown that receipt of IIV at any time during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, but at least 2 weeks before delivery, increased the influenza-specific hemagglutinin antibodies in the newborns

 </sup>. Similarly, a large IIV clinical trial in pregnant women in South Africa showed that higher transplacental antibody transfer was associated with longer periods of time between vaccination and delivery

 </sup>. Although the transfer of antibodies is highest later in pregnancy, these results suggest a cumulative transfer and consequently that pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as IIV is available at any time during pregnancy, not only to protect themselves as early as possible during the influenza season but also to increase the level of antibodies transferred to the fetus.
