<p>Maternal antibodies against several antigens, from natural infections or vaccination, are selectively transported across the placenta to the fetal circulation

 </sup>. This vertical antibody transfer is restricted to immunoglobulin G (IgG), and different IgG subclasses are transported with differing efficiency: IgG1 is the most efficiently transported and IgG2 is the least

The passage of IgGs from the circulation of the mother to the fetus is a selective, cumulative, intracellular process mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and probably other receptors still to be identified in the syncytiotrophoblast cells in the chorionic villi and subsequent release into the fetal circulation
