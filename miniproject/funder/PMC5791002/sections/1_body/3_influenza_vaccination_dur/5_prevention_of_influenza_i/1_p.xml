 </sup> have demonstrated the efficacy of seasonal IIV vaccination during pregnancy in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants younger than 6 months old. In the first trial, conducted in Bangladesh from 2004 through 2005, 340 pregnant women received either pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or IIV during their third trimester. In that study, vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the infants was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5%, 85%); in addition, there was a significant reduction in respiratory illnesses with fever in the infants, and vaccine efficacy was 29% (95% CI 7%, 46%)

 </sup>. The South African trial included 2,116 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected pregnant women in the second or third trimester who were randomly assigned to IIV or placebo in 2011 or 2012. During the total follow-up period (until the infants reached 24 weeks of age), vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the infants was 49% (95% CI 12%, 70%)

 </sup>. In Mali, 4,193 third-trimester pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive IIV or quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine from 2011 to 2013. During the entire study period, an overall vaccine efficacy of 33% (95% CI 4%, 54%) was demonstrated in infants younger than 6 months old

 </sup>. The placebo randomized controlled trial in Nepal enrolled 3,693 pregnant women (17–34 weeks’ gestation) from 2011 through 2013, and infant vaccine efficacy was 30% (95% CI 5%, 48%)

 </sup>. In a recent meta-analysis of the four trials, we calculated that the pooled efficacy of maternal IIV vaccination in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants younger than 6 months old was 36% (95% CI 22%, 48%)
