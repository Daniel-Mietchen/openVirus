These studies reported a significant protective effect that was generally higher than reported in the clinical trials (71% to 41% reduction in the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza for infants born to vaccinated women). The pooled effect of all clinical trials and observational studies was 48% (95% CI 33%, 59%) against influenza-confirmed infection among infants whose mothers were vaccinated during pregnancy
