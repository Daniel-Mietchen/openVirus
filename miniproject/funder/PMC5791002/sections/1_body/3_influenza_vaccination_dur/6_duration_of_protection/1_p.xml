<p>The duration of passive protection in the infant conferred by vaccination during pregnancy depends on the levels of antibodies achieved by vaccination, which are contingent on the efficiency of the transport across the placenta and how quickly the passively acquired antibodies wane. Half-lives of 42â€“50 days have been described in South Africa
