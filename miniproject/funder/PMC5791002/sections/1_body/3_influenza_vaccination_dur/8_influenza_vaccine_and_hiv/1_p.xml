<p>Infants born to HIV-infected mothers, even if themselves not HIV infected (HIV exposed, uninfected infants), have an increased risk of hospitalization and death from respiratory virus-associated LRTI, including influenza virus

 </sup>. In South Africa during 2011, a smaller immunogenicity trial was performed in 194 HIV-infected pregnant women. Women were randomly assigned to receive IIV or placebo, and their infants were followed for laboratory-confirmed influenza until 6 months of age

 </sup>. The transplacental antibody transfer was similar in the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected cohorts for two of the three vaccine strains, but owing to the lower antibody levels post-vaccination among the HIV-infected women, their newborns had lower antibodies at birth than those born to HIV-uninfected women

 </sup>. The study in HIV-infected women was not powered to detect vaccine efficacy in the HIV-exposed infants, and a similar influenza attack rate was detected in infants born to mothers who received IIV during pregnancy (5%) and those born to placebo recipients (6.8%; vaccine efficacy: 26.7%, 95% CI âˆ’132, 77). However, these rates were higher than those detected in HIV-unexposed infants (1.6% in the IIV group versus 3.6% in the placebo group)

 </sup>. To date, no other study has explored the benefit of maternal influenza vaccination in HIV-exposed infants in protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza.
