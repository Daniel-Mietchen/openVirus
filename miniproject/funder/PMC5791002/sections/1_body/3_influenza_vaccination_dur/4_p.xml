<p>As shown in the Swiss study and previous studies, vaccination during pregnancy results in a detectable rise in the infant’s antibody levels to the vaccine antigens starting approximately 2 weeks after vaccination

 </sup>. Owing to the active transport process, fetal hemagglutinin antibody concentrations can equal that of the mother and in some cases exceed maternal levels at term. A wide range of ratios of antibodies in infant at birth to mother at delivery have been reported after influenza vaccination during pregnancy
