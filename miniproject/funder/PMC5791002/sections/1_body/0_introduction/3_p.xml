<p>There is currently no influenza vaccine approved by regulators and recommended in any country for use in infants younger than 6 months old, even if they have high-risk conditions for which influenza vaccination is recommended among older children.

 </sup>. Therefore, efforts have turned to active vaccination during pregnancy as a means to provide neonates and young infants with passive immunity to influenza. Based on the substantial risk of severe disease in young infants and the safety of influenza vaccine during pregnancy, the WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other national public health organizations recommend that pregnant women be vaccinated at any stage during pregnancy and be given high priority for influenza vaccination
