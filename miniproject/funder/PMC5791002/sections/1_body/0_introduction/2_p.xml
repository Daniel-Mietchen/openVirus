<p>Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza illness. Safe and effective vaccines are available and have been used for more than 70 years in the general population

Nonetheless, efforts to protect infants from influenza infection during the first 6 months of life through direct vaccination have been unsuccessful with the available influenza vaccine formulations. Although safety was not a concern in the four published studies on inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) in infants younger than 6 months old
