<p>The majority of influenza virus infections are self-limited, and the common symptoms are fever, chills, sore throat, myalgia, headache, coughing, and general discomfort. Most people recover within a week without requiring medical attention

  <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
 </sup>. The presentation of unspecific clinical signs renders surveillance difficult; thus, the real burden of influenza infections among the younger population is challenging to estimate. Another challenge to truly describing the overall burden of influenza-related severe disease is that severe complications from influenza virus infection, such as pneumonia, may occur days after the primary viral infection, when current diagnostics are less sensitive to detect low viral load by the time of hospitalization and testing 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, the estimated rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza are likely to be an underestimation of the true burden of influenza disease
