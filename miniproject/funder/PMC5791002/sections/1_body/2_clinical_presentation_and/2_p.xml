<p>In the USA, during some winters, up to 10% of all infants are brought in for medical care for influenza-associated illness, including hospitalization

 </sup>. Data are more sparse from low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), but a recent systematic analysis on the burden of influenza in pediatric respiratory hospitalizations worldwide estimated that influenza causes approximately 870,000 hospitalizations per year in children younger than 5 years old (135/100,000 children per year), including 374,000 hospitalizations per year in infants younger than 1 year old (284/100,000 infants per year), 228,000 of which occur in infants younger than 6 months old

In a previous population-based study in the USA during the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 influenza seasons, the average annual influenza-associated hospitalization rate among infants younger than 6 months old was 450/100,000 infants compared with 90/100,000 among children 6–23 months old and 30/100,000 in the 24–59-month age group
