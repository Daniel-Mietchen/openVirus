<p>Although influenza-associated hospitalizations are important, outpatient visits are far more frequent in all age groups. In infants, influenza infection tends to be more severe and more often requires hospitalization compared with older patients. Annual influenza-attributable outpatient visit rates in the USA in comparable age groups were approximately 10-, 100-, and 250-fold higher than hospitalization rates for children younger than 6 months, 6–23 months of age, and 24–59 months of age, respectively, in 2002–2004
