 </sup>. Furthermore, it has been estimated that, in 2008, 28,000–111,500 deaths in children younger than 5 years old were due to influenza-associated acute lower respiratory infections, 99% of which occurred in LMICs

Moreover, since 2004, when influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a notifiable condition in the USA, the total number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths per season has ranged from 37 to 171, excluding during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (358 pediatric deaths were reported from April 2009 to October 2010)
