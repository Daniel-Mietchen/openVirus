<p>Since influenza vaccination during pregnancy was demonstrated to confer some protection to both mothers (not discussed in this review

  <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </sup>) and young infants against influenza infection, this strategy should be used as the first line of protection. Nonetheless, there are still some considerations and open questions for future research in this field. These include the need for more immunogenic influenza vaccines for pregnant women to increase the concentration of the antibodies transferred transplacentally, which would last for a longer period in the infants. Infant passive protection beyond the first 2–4 months of life is desirable, as only after 6 months of age are infants eligible to receive influenza vaccine. More immunogenic vaccines could probably be achieved with higher antigen concentrations or the use of adjuvants. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, newer formulations of inactivated antigens administered with adjuvants were found to enhance the immune responses compared with non-adjuvanted vaccines

 </sup>. Based on the immunogenicity data from the two South African trials, despite vaccine efficacy observed in HIV-infected mothers (which was similar to HIV-uninfected women, not discussed in this review), alternate strategies to protect the HIV-exposed infants need to be considered

 </sup>. Whilst vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity might play a role in adults, protection in the infants will be mediated only by the presence of antibodies; hence, again, higher antibody concentrations need to be elicited in the women to prevent disease in their HIV-exposed infants.
