 </sup>. The different clinical trials on maternal influenza vaccination also reported rates of adverse events balanced between IIV and control groups. Recent systematic reviews of vaccine safety studies support the conclusions that there is no increased risk in the evaluated adverse outcomes in the mother, the fetus, and the newborn associated with influenza vaccination during pregnancy

 </sup>. Most of the data, however, were obtained from studies with vaccination in the second and third trimesters. Pharmacovigilance programs need to continue monitoring the safety of maternal vaccination at any stage during pregnancy and, if possible, the impact of vaccination on the long-term development of the children.
