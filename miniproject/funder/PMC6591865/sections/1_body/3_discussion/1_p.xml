<p id="Par33">We report a novel astrovirus, discovered in association with a case of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in a captive muskox that was euthanized in 1982 because of neurological signs. After initial immunohistochemical reactivity for two neurotropic astroviruses previously reported in cattle and sheep, contradictory outcomes of additional investigations prompted us to submit an RNA extract from FFPE brain tissue of the animal to NGS. We thus obtained the full-length sequence of an astrovirus, which we tentatively name muskox astrovirus CH18 (MOxAstV-CH18), and whose closest relative is an ovine enteric astrovirus, OvAstV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. According to current classification criteria, MOxAstV-CH18 belongs to the same genotype species as OvAstV-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].
