<p id="Par35">As we did not have other muskoxen cases with comparable disease in our archive, we could not investigate further whether MOxAstV-CH18 occurs regularly in such circumstances. Moreover, as we could not find specific reports about neuroinfectious diseases in muskoxen in the literature, astrovirus-associated encephalomyelitis is probably an exceptional finding in this species. Yet, in order to investigate whether MOxAstV-CH18 is a common enteric virus of muskoxen, we tested by RT-PCR several faecal samples obtained from the current herd of the animal park where muskox 15375 was kept, but all were negative. This inconclusive finding therefore leaves open all speculations about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the virus. Still, the fact that the closest relative of MOxAstV-CH18 is an astrovirus that was isolated from diarrheic lambs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] raises the question of inter-species transmission. Indeed, even though astroviruses are generally assumed to be host-specific, an increasing number of studies puts this assumption into question [

Sheep were already considered to be the most probable origin of two epizootics in Norwegian muskoxen: one of contagious ecthyma (orf) [
