<p id="Par37">Because of treatment with formalin, the integrity of nucleic acids extracted from FFPE tissues is generally assumed to be compromised, with fragmentation and cross-linking of molecules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In cancer research, however, FFPE tissue is increasingly considered a valuable source of nucleic acids to study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Conversely, the number of virological studies performed with such material is sparse, with relatively few of them using NGS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In that regard, the most prominent example is probably the determination, in one NGS run, of the full genome of the 1918 pandemic influenza strain that previously took 9 years to complete with traditional sequencing methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Yet, here we were able to recover the whole genome length of a novel astrovirus from FFPE brain tissue by NGS and de novo assembly. These results therefore demonstrate the power of this approach, also in such conditions, and support its use for viral discovery in archived material as well, highlighting the huge potential for retrospective investigations of unresolved cases or even epidemics.
