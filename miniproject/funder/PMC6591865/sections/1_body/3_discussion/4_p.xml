<p id="Par36">Recently, an astrovirus was described from the faeces of a Sichuan takin (
 <italic>Budorcas taxicolor</italic> ssp
 <italic>. tibetana</italic>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Takins belong to the subfamily 
 <italic>Caprinae</italic>, as muskoxen do. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis showed that MOxAstV-CH18 genetically cluster together with an ovine faecal astrovirus, in a clade distant from that of the takin astrovirus and bovine enteric counterparts. Differences in tropism might explain the genetic divergence of the viruses.
