<p id="Par34">Cross-reactivity in our IHC assays could be explained by some degree of antigenic similarity between MOxAstV-CH18 and bovine and ovine neurotropic astroviruses. Indeed, numerous stretches up to 37 amino acids in length are conserved among the capsid protein precursors of these viruses. For three of the polyclonal antisera we used in IHC, the viral antigens used to obtain them consisted of 313 to 373 amino acids; some of their epitopes are thus probably also present in the capsid protein of MOx-AstV-CH18. Conversely, the amino acid sequence corresponding to a 16 amino acid-long peptide used to obtain some BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1-specific antibodies (CH13-23917) that reacted negatively in IHC is not found in MOxAstV-CH18. Similarly, there is probably too much variation at nucleotide level for the dual ISH and both qRT-PCRs specific for BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 and BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16 to recognize MOxAstV-CH18 in brain tissue samples of animal 15375.</p>
