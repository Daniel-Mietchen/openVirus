<p id="Par22">Three or one μL RNA extract from FFPE midbrain tissue of muskox 15375 or frozen brain tissue of animals 26875 and 41669, respectively, were investigated for the presence of astrovirus sequences with the AgPath-ID RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer combination CH13-A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] (targeting ORF1a of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) served for the detection of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1, whereas BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16 was tested with the primer combination CH15 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] (targeting ORF2 of BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16). Both assays were run on a 7300 Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Singapore) with the following conditions: 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s.
