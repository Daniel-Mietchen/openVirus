<p id="Par26">RT-PCR primers were designed with Geneious 10.1.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] based on the novel astrovirus sequence, with forward primer MOxAstV_F: GGCGGGCCATAGGACTATTC and reverse primer MOxAstV_R: CTTTGGGCATGCTGGAGAGA. One or 4 μL RNA from FFPE midbrain of animal 15375 or muskoxen faecal samples, respectively, were tested using the OneTaq One-Step RT-PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) using the alternative protocol described by the manufacturer.
