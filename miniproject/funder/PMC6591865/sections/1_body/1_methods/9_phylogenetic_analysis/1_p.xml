<p id="Par25">Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein precursor (680–842 amino acids in length, all complete) of the novel virus and 44 representative members of the family 
 <italic>Astroviridae.</italic> For the phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural polyprotein nsp1ab amino acid sequences (1256–1369 amino acids in length, all complete), 9 representative members of the family 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic> were used in addition to the novel virus. All sequences were imported into MEGA (Ver. 7.0.26) and aligned using the built-in MUSCLE alignment tool. Maximum-likelihood trees were generated based on a matrix described by Le and Gascuel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
