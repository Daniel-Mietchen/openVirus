<p id="Par24">Raw reads were quality-trimmed using trimmomatic (Ver. 0.36). As no reference genome is available for muskoxen, quality-trimmed reads were assembled directly using SPAdes (Ver. 3.12.0). The generated contigs were aligned to viral databases with BLASTN (Ver. 2.7.1+, using viral sequences from GenBank and RefSeq downloaded on July 25, 2018) and DIAMOND (Ver. 0.9.18, using viral sequences from UniProt downloaded on June 13, 2018) on nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively.</p>
