<p id="Par21">RNA from FFPE material was extracted as described in a study of Delnatte and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Briefly, two 20 μm-thick sections of FFPE midbrain of muskox 15375 were deparaffinised with xylol and further processed with the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All assays described below for animal 15375 were performed with the same RNA extract. RNA from faeces was isolated using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Faecal samples were first diluted in phosphate buffered saline to a concentration of 20% v/v, centrifuged for 20 min at 4000×

The positive RNA controls used in this study were extracted with TRI Reagent (Sigma Life Science, St. Louis, MO) from frozen brain tissue of one BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1-(ID 26875) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and one OvAstV-CH16-case (ID 41669) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. All RNA extracts were stored at − 80 °C until further processing.
