<p id="Par23">Starting material for library preparation was 50 ng RNA extract from FFPE midbrain tissue of muskox 15375. cDNA synthesis was performed without fragmentation with the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2-Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA, Mountain View, CA), with repeated purifications with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Before single-end sequencing (100 bp) on half a lane with a HiSeq 3000 System (Illumina, San Diego, CA), the library quality was controlled on a Qubit Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR) and a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA) with the High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA).</p>
