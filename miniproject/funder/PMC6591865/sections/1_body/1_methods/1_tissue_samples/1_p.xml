<p id="Par17">FFPE central nervous system tissues (midbrain and thoracic spinal cord) of a muskox (ID 15375) were available from the archive of the Division of Experimental Clinical Research, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern (Bern, Switzerland). The animal was submitted to neuropathological investigation in 1982 after euthanasia because of progressive neurological disease unresponsive to therapy. Original tissues samples had to be re-embedded before further processing. Brain sections of two other muskoxen without neuropathological changes were also available from this archive.</p>
