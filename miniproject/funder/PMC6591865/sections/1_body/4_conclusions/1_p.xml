<p id="Par38">Our data indicate that MOxAstV-CH18 is a possible cause of nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in muskoxen. This warrants further investigation into the spectrum of diseases (in particular of the nervous system) affecting captive and wild muskoxen, as well as other ruminant species. We also show that NGS enables straightforward virus discovery also when applied to FFPE tissues. Finally, the close phylogenetic and antigenic relationships of MOxAstV-CH18 to other ruminant neurotropic astroviruses further question the concept of a strict host specificity for this virus family.</p>
