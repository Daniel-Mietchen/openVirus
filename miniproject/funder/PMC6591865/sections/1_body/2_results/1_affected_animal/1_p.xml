<p id="Par27">In January 1982, a 6-year old male muskox (animal ID 15375) kept at Bern Animal Park (Bern, Switzerland) suddenly showed weakness of the hind limbs, which rapidly progressed to tetraplegia. After 6 days of supportive care without clinical improvement, the animal was released from suffering by a chest hit. Central nervous system tissues were subsequently submitted to diagnostic neuropathological investigation. Histopathologically, all segments of the spinal cord examined as well as the midbrain displayed strong nonsuppurative lesions, particularly in the grey matter, with perivascular cuffs, neuronal degeneration and gliosis (Fig.Â
