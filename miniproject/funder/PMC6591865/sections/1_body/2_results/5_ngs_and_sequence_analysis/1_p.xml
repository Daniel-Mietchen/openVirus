<p id="Par31">Despite the inconclusive results obtained by qRT-PCR, we chose to submit the RNA extract from muskox 15375s midbrain to NGS. As RNA from FFPE tissue, especially if old, can be expected to be strongly fragmented, we sequenced 100 bp-long reads in single-end mode, and obtained 198,031,783 of them. After quality-trimming, 186,002,398 reads were used for assembly. Three contiguous sequences (contigs) ≥ 500 nt long and displaying a similarity to astroviruses on nucleotide and/or amino acid level were generated and finally reassembled. The complete sequence obtained (GenBank accession no. MK211323.1) was 6515 nt long, with a series of adenines at the 3′ end corresponding to the virus’s polyadenylated tail. No RACE was carried out to determine the exact ends of the viral genome. The genome contained three putative overlapping ORFs, with a characteristic ribosomal frameshifting signal at the ORF1a/ORF1b junction. The sequence translated from ORF1ab was 1351 and from ORF2 762 amino acids in length, respectively. ORF1ab displayed 87.8% (97.6%, resp.) and ORF2 70.5% (74.6%, resp.) nucleotide (amino acid, resp.) identity to their best hits, which were both on ovine astrovirus 1 (OvAstV-1, that was isolated from the faeces of diarrheic lambs [
