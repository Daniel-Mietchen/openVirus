<p id="Par28">Three decades later, we retrieved FFPE central nervous system samples (midbrain and spinal cord) of the animal from our archives. When testing this material for the presence of capsid antigen of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 and BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16 with a first hyperimmune serum each (CH13-ORF2-con [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and CH15-ORF2-var [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], respectively), positive staining was obtained for both viruses in all regions investigated (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). Subsequently, in an attempt to confirm our findings, we used a second hyperimmune serum for each virus (CH13-23917 and CH15-ORF2-con [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], respectively), and obtained discrepant results: negative staining for BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 (conversely, our index case for BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1, cow 45664 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], reacted positively), contrasting with a distinctly positive staining for BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d). Brain tissue sections of two other muskoxen without pathological changes were negative with all antibodies.
