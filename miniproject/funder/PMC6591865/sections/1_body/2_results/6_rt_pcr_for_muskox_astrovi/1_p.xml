<p id="Par32">We designed RT-PCR primers based on the sequence of the novel astrovirus obtained by NGS and our bioinformatics pipeline. The RNA extract from FFPE midbrain tissue of muskox 15375 used for NGS produced an amplicon of the expected size (108 bp). Besides, as most mamastroviruses are enteric viruses, we wondered whether the novel astrovirus is to be commonly found in muskoxen’s faeces. However, RNA extracted from faecal samples of the five current muskoxen herd members of the zoo where muskox 15375 was kept 30 years ago remained negative for the virus.</p>
