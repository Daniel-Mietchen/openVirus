<p id="Par15">In cattle, two genotype species were found in cases of nonsuppurative encephalitis: bovine astrovirus CH13/NeuroS1 (BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1) on the one hand and bovine astrovirus CH15/BH89-14 (BoAstV-CH15/BH89-14) on the other. BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was reported from the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Switzerland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and could be detected in around one quarter of the cases investigated in retrospective studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In contrast, BoAstV-CH15/BH89-14 was described in only three cattle up to date [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, viruses almost identical to this second astrovirus type were reported in several neurologically diseased sheep: they were denominated ovine astrovirus UK/2013/ewe/lib01454 and UK/2014/lamb/lib01455 in two sheep from the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and ovine astrovirus CH16 (OvAstV-CH16) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and CH17 (OvAstV-CH17) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in two Swiss cases. Being genetically highly similar to one another, these neurotropic astroviruses of cattle and sheep will be commonly referred to as BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16.
