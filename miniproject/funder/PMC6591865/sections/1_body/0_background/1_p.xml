 <italic>Caprinae</italic>. Although this species is not so common in captivity (115 animals registered in the General ZIMS database as of January 29, 2019 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]), small herds are kept in some animal parks. Over the last decades, substantial effort was put into the investigation of infectious diseases of free-ranging muskoxen. For instance, parasites infesting these animals were described in numerous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Finally, factors contributing to morbidity and mortality in a declining population of Alaskan muskoxen were investigated in a comprehensive manner [
