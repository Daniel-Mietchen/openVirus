<p id="Par16">Since their discovery, we developed several diagnostic tools in order to study these bovine and ovine neutropic astroviruses: in situ hybridization (ISH) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], immunohistochemistry (IHC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and qRT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Recently, we were told about a historical case of a captive muskox that was diagnosed with nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis in our division in 1982 (Prof. M. Vandevelde, personal communication), and were therefore curious whether astroviruses also played a role in this case. We retrieved formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) central nervous system tissue samples of this animal from our archive and investigated these by IHC and ISH for the presence of BoAstV-CH13/NeuroS1 and BoAstV-CH15/OvAstV-CH16. We then extracted RNA from the animalâ€™s brain tissue and performed qRT-PCR as well as next-generation sequencing (NGS) on it. This lead to the discovery of a novel astrovirus.
