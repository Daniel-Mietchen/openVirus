<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> and contains a single stranded tripartite genome of negative polarity. It consists of three segments that code for nucleocapsid protein (S-segment), two glycoproteins Gn, Gc (M-segment) and a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L-segment). In addition, two non-structural proteins are encoded by the S-segment (NSs) and M-segment (NSm), respectively [

 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex spp</italic>. have been associated with RVFV transmission, either by isolation of the virus from field-collected mosquitoes or by successful experimental transmission in laboratory setting [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].During inter-epizootic periods, the virus may persist by vertical transmission in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and the deposition of infected eggs. Subsequent heavy rainfalls and flooding lead to hatching of RVFV infected vectors causing epidemics. The virus emerged during the 1970ths and 1980ths throughout Africa and entered the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on this emergence and due to numerous susceptible mosquito species that are also found in Europe, there is a significant risk for introduction and subsequent dissemination of RVFV in Europe [
