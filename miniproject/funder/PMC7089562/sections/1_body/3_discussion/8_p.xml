<p>Detailed histopathological and immunohistological analyses elucidated specific differences during the course of RVFV infection. In acute cases, coalescing to diffuse RVFV antigen was detectable mainly in hepatocytes, but also in multifocal macrophages and follicular dendritic cells in the spleen. The livers displayed characteristic severe, acute, coalescing to diffuse necrotizing hepatitis, and many hepatocytes displayed morphological changes reminiscent of apoptotic cell death as well as intranuclear Cowdry type B inclusion bodies [

Furthermore, a moderate lymphoid depletion in the spleen was seen, which may lead to lymphopenia, and is probably part of a fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome as a consequence of fulminant hepatitis. Lymphocyte apoptosis in spleens of infected mice that had died 3 dpi was reported previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These findings, which mainly occurred in the PBS group, were confirmed by a strong positive correlation between lymphoid depletion and the incidence of hepatitis (Pearson product moment correlation, r = 0.922; p = 0.0258* (*significant p&lt;0.05)), RVFV-positive liver (r = 0.815; p = 0.0927) and cruor (r = 0.877; p = 0.0509).
