<p>MAbs Gn3 and Gn32 (as well as mixtures of both) showed high binding affinity to Gn in ELISA which are in the same EC
 <sub>50</sub> range as RVFV-neutralizing rabbit mAbs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, neutralizing activity exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of about 100μg/ml that are significantly lower compared to rabbit antibodies (~3.0μg/ml) and human antibodies which were effective in the nanogram range [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the values are only comparable to a limited extent, since different neutralization or alternative assays were used (SNT vs plaque reduction neutralization test vs FACS based assays). In both reported cases, single mAb application led to protection against RVFV infection similar to the combined mAb treatment outlined here. Interestingly, for an efficient neutralization of virulent challenge strain 35/74 a distinctly higher antibody concentration was needed compared to vaccine strain MP-12, although both strains exhibited only 4 amino acid differences within glycoprotein Gn sequence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These different amino acids are not located near the Gn32 derived epitope but three out of 4 amino acids induce slight modifications within the secondary structure of the strains, which could be responsible for the observed differences.
