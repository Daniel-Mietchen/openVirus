<p>In this study, RVF neutralizing mAb Gn3 in combination with Gn32 was applied in a mouse RVF infection model demonstrating complete protection against virus challenge. It is the first trial about 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protection of cooperative mouse monoclonal antibodies against RVF. Similar antibody prevention studies against RVF were carried out very recently by applying human [
