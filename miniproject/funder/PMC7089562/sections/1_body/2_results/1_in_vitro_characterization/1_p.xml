<p>The binding of both monoclonal antibodies Gn3 and Gn32 to recombinant RVFV Gn ectodomain was assessed in ELISA yielding EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of about 1.29 μg/ml and 0.38 μg/ml (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008143.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Co-incubation of both mAbs showed a shift to an increased binding activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.49 μg/ml) probably based on cooperative interactions. An epitope mapping study on mAbs Gn3 and Gn32 was performed using biotinylated oligopeptides with 20 amino acid (aa) length and 12 aa overlap covering the whole sequence of glycoprotein Gn ectodomain. Gn32 targeted two adjacent peptides at the outermost n-terminus of Gn protein (encompassing sequence: PGKGHNYIDGMT,
