<p>To determine whether mAbs Gn3 and Gn32 had therapeutic activity, BALB/c mice inoculated i.p. with RVFV strain 35/74, were subjected to different antibody treatments using applications 30 minutes before (T1 groups) or 30 minutes after (T2 groups) virus challenge studies were carried out each with Gn3 and Gn32 alone or in combination with both (combi groups). Unfortunately, one mouse of T2 combi group died during antibody application. Treatment with Gn32 alone (n = 12 in both groups) exhibited no effects (8% and 25% survival in T1 and T2 group respectively) and treatment with Gn3 in RVF infected mice (n = 12 in both T1/T2 groups) showed medium efficacy (about 58.3% survival in both applications). However, a combination therapy together with non-neutralizing mAb Gn32 demonstrated nearly complete protection (83.3% survival, T1 group) and a subsequent trial (application 30 min after virus challenge, T2 group) protected 100% of the animals from a lethal challenge dose (

In contrast, the PBS control group presented a survival rate of only 16.67%. Diseased mice showed typical signs like ruffled fur, lethargy and acute death around 3â€“6 days post inoculation (dpi) and signs of neurological infection on 8 dpi, when there was no effective antibody protection. Mean clinical score of corresponding groups is depicted in
