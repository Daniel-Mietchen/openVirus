<p>RNA was extracted from liver, brain and blood cruor with NucleoMag VET Kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL, Düren, Germany) and King Fisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA), according to the manufacturer´s instructions. As internal extraction as well as PCR control, MS2 bacteriophage was added to each sample to exclude false negative results [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Used primer (RVF-forv:5'-TGAAAATTCCTGAGACACATGG-3'; RVF-rev: 5'-ACTTCCT TGCATCATCTGATG-3') and probe (RVF-probe: 5'-FAM-CAATGTAAGGGGCC TGTGTGGACTTGTG-BHQ1-3’) target the L-segment of RVFV at nucleotide position 2912–3001. MS2 bacteriophage derived RNA was detected via primers MS2F (5’-CTCTGAGAGCGGCTCTATTGGT-3’), MS2R (5’-GTTCCCTACAACG AGCCTAAATTC-3’) and MS2probe (5’-HEX-TCAGACACGCGGTCCGCTATAACGA-BHQ1-3’). A synthetic RNA comprising the target region of the RT-qPCR was utilized as calibrator for quantification. The synthetic calibrator was generated by in-vitro transcription from corresponding DNA-sequence, which contains at 5’-end an additional T7 promotor sequence for in vitro transcription. [
