<p>BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 50 μg of recombinant purified Gn protein suspended in complete Freund’s adjuvant and repeated three times at intervals of about 4 weeks. This was followed by an immunization without adjuvant. Finally, mouse spleen cells were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells and resulting hybridoma cells were assessed for mAb against RVFV glycoprotein Gn using a Gn-based indirect IgG ELISA. Both mAb were reactive in ELISA, western blot and indirect immunofluorescence [
