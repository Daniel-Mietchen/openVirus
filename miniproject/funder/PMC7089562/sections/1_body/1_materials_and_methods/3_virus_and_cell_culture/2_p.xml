<p>Virus titration: Samples tested positive in quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) were used for virus isolation on BHK-21 cells. Corresponding homogenates were diluted from 10
 <sup>−1</sup>–10
 <sup>−8</sup> in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin and 2% fetal calf serum (FCS). 100μl of each dilution was added in quadruplicates on a 96 well cell plate seeded with a 90% confluent monolayer of BHK-21 cells. After incubation for 1h at 37°C, 5% CO2, each well was overlaid with 100μl medium, incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 days and subsequently fixed with neutral buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet.
