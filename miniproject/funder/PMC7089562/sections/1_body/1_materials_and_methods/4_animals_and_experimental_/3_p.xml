<p>Blood samples were taken daily by submandibular venipuncture from corresponding mice starting from 1 dpi till 13 dpi. Mice behavior and clinical anomalies were scored twice daily by a defined score sheet (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The animals were inspected for the presence of signs of disease including ruffled fur, lethargy, immobility and bleedings. Depending on the course of the disease, the listed symptoms can occur in individual degrees of severity. Corresponding values were added in an individual score sheet. The humane endpoint was defined as a cumulative score â‰¥8. Mice were euthanized with an overdose of Isofluran CP 1ml/ml (CP-Pharma, Burgdorf, Germany) followed by heart puncture at 13 dpi or when termination criteria from the score sheet were met earlier.
