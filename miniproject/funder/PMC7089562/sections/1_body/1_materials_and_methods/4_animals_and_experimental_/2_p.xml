<p>In total 102 mice were included in this study and allocated in 6 groups with equal proportion of male and female individuals. 96 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 200μl 10
 <sup>2.7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of RVFV strain 35/74. Six control animals were treated only with mAbs (mAb control group). From 96 infected mice, 24 individuals were treated with PBS (PBS group) and 72 individuals with different antibody regimen. Antibodies (200μg in 100μl PBS) were applied intravenously in the tail vein either 30 minutes before virus challenge (timepoint T1) or 30 min after virus challenge timepoint T2). Accordingly mice were treated at time point T1 with mAb Gn3 (n = 12, Gn3 _T1 group), at time point T2 (n = 12, Gn3_T2 group) as well as at time point T1 with mAb Gn32 (n = 12, Gn32 _T1 group) and at time point T2 (n = 12, Gn32_T2 group). In addition a simultaneous administration of mAb Gn3 and Gn32—again short before challenge (n = 12, Gn3+Gn32_T1 group) or after virus application (n = 12, Gn3+Gn32_T2 group), referred as “combi groups”.
