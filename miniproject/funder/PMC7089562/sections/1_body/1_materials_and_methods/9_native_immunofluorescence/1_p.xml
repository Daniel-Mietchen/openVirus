<p>For native IFA an in-house protocol was used as follows: Complete medium from MP-12 infected Vero 76 cells—grown on cover slips- was removed and cells were washed three times with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) including 1mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 0.5mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (PBS++). Subsequently cells were incubated with mAb Gn3 or Gn32 diluted 1:5 in 0.35% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS++ at 4°C for 60 minutes. After washing three times with ice cold PBS++ the secondary antibody (Cy3-labeld goat anti mouse, Jackson Immunoresearch, USA), diluted with 0.35% (BSA) in PBS++, was added (diluted 1:2500) for 45 minutes at 4°C. After washing three times with ice cold PBS++, cells were fixed with ice cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Following the third washing step (three times with ice cold PBS ++), staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Carl Roth, Germany)—diluted 1:20000 in PBS–was performed for 10 minutes at 37°C. The final washing step was carried out twice with ice cold PBS++ and a final washing step with pure water. Each cover slip was mounted on slides using elvanol (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Fluorescence staining was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Japan).
