 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Neutralizing activity of mAb Gn3 and mAb Gn3 in combination with Gn32 was determined in a serum neutralization assay (SNT) using RVF vaccine strain MP-12 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of MP-12 was added to duplicates of serial twofold diluted mAbs. Following an incubation of 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO2, 3 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> Vero 76 cells (Collection of Cell Lines in Veterinary Medicine, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Germany) were added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 6 days. Neutralizing doses of 50% (ND
 <sub>50</sub>) were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that still inhibited &gt; 50% of cytopathogenic effect. Furthermore, dilution series of mAbs and heat inactivated sera of heart puncture was tested in the same SNT protocol but using strain 35/74 on BHK-21 cells. As a positive control neutralizing serum of a cattle immunized with recombinant, bacterially (
