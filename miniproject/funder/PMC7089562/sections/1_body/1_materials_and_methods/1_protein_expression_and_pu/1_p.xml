<p>Both antibodies were generated by immunization of BALB/c mice with bacterial expressed glycoprotein Gn which encompasses 429 amino acids of the ectodomain (residues 154â€“582, UniProt accession no. P21401) fused to a N-terminal His-tag. For this purpose the RVFV MP-12 derived sequence was cloned into vector pET19b followed by expression in

 <italic>coli</italic> BL21 cells. Resulting inclusion bodies were lysed under denaturating conditions including 8M urea and purified over Nickel NTA chelating agarose columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Refolding of the protein was done by dialysis in 50 mM sodium carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH = 9.6). The resulting protein fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE [
