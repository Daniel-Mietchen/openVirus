<p>Immunohistology was performed with the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex method (ABC, Elite PK6100; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as chromogen and hematoxylin counterstain. The primary antibody used for the detection of RVFV nucleoprotein was a heat-inactivated serum of a sheep immunized with recombinant RVFV MP12-strain nucleoprotein (internal code: S24NP) in a dilution of 1:4000. As positive control, Vero 76 cells were infected with MP-12 strain, pelleted by centrifugation (1500 rpm, 20 min, 12°C) 24 h post infection, and processed and embedded in paraffin wax similar to the tissue samples. Negative controls consisted of uninfected Vero 76 cells and replacement of the primary antibody by sera of a non-immunized sheep on serial sections, respectively. The distribution of the RVFV antigen was semi-quantitatively assessed for each organ on a 0–3 scale as follows: 0 = no viral antigen, 1 = focal or oligofocal, 2 = multifocal, and 3 = confluent to diffuse immunoreactive cells. Pathological examination and immunohistochemistry of samples from the Gn32 (T1/T2) group was not performed.</p>
