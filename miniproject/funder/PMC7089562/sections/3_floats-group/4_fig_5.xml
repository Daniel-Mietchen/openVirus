  <title>PCR results of brain, liver and cruor and ELISA results of serum from heart blood of individual mice.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Virus loads were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with RVFV specific primers and quantified with a synthetic calibrator in samples from liver, brain and cruor. The results represent the virus loads [log10 copies (mg tissue)] of each group in a box blot diagram. Significance was analyzed by ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis H) test (*p&lt;0.05) 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Antibodies in mice serum samples at day of death were determined by a commercial competition ELISA kit targeting antibodies against nucleocapsid protein. Results are shown as sample-to-positive ratio for each individual mouse. Horizontal line marks ELISA cut off.
