  <title>Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings in different tissues of three individual mice.</title>
  <p>Light microscopy revealed three principally different patterns of lesions and antigen distribution in the livers (first row, A-F), brains (second row, G-L), spleens (third row, M-R), and lungs (fourth row, S-X) of mice which succumbed due to the infection within the first 6 days (left column: P18-865, mouse #25, 3 dpi, A, B, G, H, M, N, S, T) later in the time course of the disease (middle column: P18-870, mouse #30, 8 dpi, C, D, I, J, O, P, U, V) and those which survived until the end of the observation period (right column, P18-878, mouse #78, 13 dpi, E, F, K, L, W, X and P18-851, mouse #68, 13 dpi Q,R). A.) The mice dying until 6 dpi display mainly a severe, acute, diffuse, necrotizing hepatitis with Councilman corpuscles (arrows), suggestive of hepatocellular apoptosis. B.) These mice show coalescing to diffuse antigen within hepatocytes. M.) There are few apoptotic or necrotic lymphocytes in the white matter of the spleen (arrow). C.) The few mice dying later than 6 dpi display multifocal infiltrations of macrophages and lymphocytes (arrow) and hepatocellular vacuolar degeneration within the livers. D.) There is no antigen present within the liver. I.) There are oligofocal necrotic neurons and glia (arrows) within the brain, interpreted as necrotizing polioencephalitis. J.) There is multifocal, neuronal antigen accumulation. O.) There are many apoptotic or necrotic lymphocytes (arrow) leading to lymphatic depletion within the spleen. Q.) There is follicular hyperplasia with enlarged follicles with a pale lymphoblast-rich center and a darker peripheral zone of more differentiated lymphocytes. A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W.) hematoxylin-eosin. B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, V, X.) Immunohistochemistry employing the avidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex method for RVFV nucleoprotein with AEC as chromogen (red-brown) and hematoxylin counterstain (blue). A-X.) Bars = 50 Î¼m.</p>
