   <bold>(A)</bold> Efficacy of antibody protection was assessed by survival analysis. (A) Kaplan-Meier log rank test was performed; n.s. between mAb-Gn3-treated (T1/T2) and PBS control, p&lt;0.001 between mAb-Gn3-Gn32-treated (T1) and PBS control, p&lt;0.001 between mAb-Gn3-Gn32-treated (T2) and PBS control, n.s. between mAb-Gn3-Gn32-treated (T1/T2) and Gn3 (T1/T2).
