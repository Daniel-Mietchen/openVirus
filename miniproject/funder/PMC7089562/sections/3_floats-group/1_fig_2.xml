  <title>Detection of mAb using native indirect immunofluorescence assay and a 3D-model of Gn32 derived epitope.</title>
  <p>Binding of glycoprotein Gn by monoclonal antibodies Gn3 (A) and Gn32 (B) on surface of MP-12 infected cells was visualized with Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. Mock infected cells (C). Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (magnification 40x). 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Epitope of Gn32 (displayed in yellow) is located on the surface of glycoprotein Gn (PDB 5Y0Y) in a spacefill 3D-model (Geneious Prime, Auckland, New Zealand, Version 2019.2.3).
