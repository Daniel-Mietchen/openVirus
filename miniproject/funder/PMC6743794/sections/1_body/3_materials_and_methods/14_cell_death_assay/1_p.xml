<p>BMDMs were seeded overnight in 48-well plates (2x10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well), primed with 300 ng/mL of PAM(3)CSK(4) for 4 hours, and then infected for 24 hours with MAYV, CHIKV or ZIKV in RPMI1640 medium without phenol red, 15 mM HEPES and 2 g/l NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> supplemented with 2% FBS. At the end of the infection, supernatants were collected and assayed using the CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated with 9% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific) for 15 min as a positive control for complete cell lysis. The percentage of LDH release was calculated as (mean OD value of sample / mean OD value of Triton X-100 control sample) × 100, and is shown in the figures as the percentage of cell death compared to Triton X-100.
