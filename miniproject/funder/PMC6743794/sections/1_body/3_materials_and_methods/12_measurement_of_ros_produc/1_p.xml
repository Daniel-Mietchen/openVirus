<p>To detect intracellular and mitochondrial ROS production, we seeded 10
 <sup>6</sup> BMDMs in 12-well plates overnight. Cells were infected with MAYV (MOI of 5) or stimulated with PMA (200 ng/ml) or rotenone (50 μM) for 90 minutes. Next, H2DCFDA (10 μM) and MitoSOX Red dye (2.5 μM) were added to the cells for 30 min at 37°C, and then they were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were acquired on a FACS ACCURI C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star).
