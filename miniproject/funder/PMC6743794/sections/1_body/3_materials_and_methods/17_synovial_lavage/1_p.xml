<p>Knee cavities were surgically opened, and synovial lavage was obtained by flushing the joint cavity with 10μl. Cytospin preparations were acquired by Cytospin 4 (Thermo Scientific) with 70 μl of diluted joint lavage per slide and centrifugation at 200 r.p.m. for 7 min. The slides were air-dried and Giemsa-stained (Laborclin, Pinhais, Brazil) and counted under a light microscope with a 40X objective to determine the total numbers of cells in the lavage fluid.</p>
