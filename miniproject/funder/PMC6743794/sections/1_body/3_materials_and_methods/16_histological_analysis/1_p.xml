<p>After 6 days of infection, animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and perfused through the ascending aorta with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). After perfusion the mouse footpad tissue was immediately removed (skin and muscle). Pieces of the footpad tissue were post-fixed for 24 h in PFA and then replaced with 20% sucrose for 4 days. The tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound and sectioned at 15Î¼m thickness. The specimens were dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene and stained with Harris haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) for histopathology [

From each slide, twenty representative photographs were randomly taken (magnification 400x) for analysis of the histological changes. In each high-power field, the degree of tissue damage was determined by a modified score [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]: (1) tissue edema (2) infiltration or aggregation of inflammatory cells, and (3) muscle necrosis. Each item was graded according to the following five-point scale: 0, no damage; 1, minimal damage; 2, mild damage; 3, moderate damage; 4, severe damage. The degree of tissue disease was assessed by the sum of scores ranging from 0 to 12 for each high-power field. In addition, quantification of subcutaneous tissue thickness was performed by histomorphometric analysis using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, U.S.A.), and the total number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltrated into the tissues was counted.
