<p>To evaluate the mechanical nociceptive threshold, mice were placed on an elevated wire grid and the plantar surface of the ipsilateral hind paw was stimulated perpendicularly with a series of von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Chicago, IL, USA) with logarithmically increasing stiffness (0.008–2.0 g) and the basal mechanical withdrawal threshold was measured one day before infection. Each one of these filaments was applied for approximately 3–4 s to induce a paw-withdrawal reflex. The weakest filament able to elicit a response was taken to be the mechanical withdrawal threshold. The log stiffness of the filament is reported as log10 of the mass of the filament in mg and ranged from 0.903 (8 mg or 0.008 g) to 3.0 (1000 mg or 1 g) [
