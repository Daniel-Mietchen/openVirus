<p>At the times indicated after infection, mice were euthanized and perfused by intracardial injection with PBS. Tissues were dissected, weighed, and homogenized in sterile PBS using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen). The homogenized tissues were diluted 1:3 in serum-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded onto a monolayer of Vero cells in 24-well plates. The plaque assay was performed as described previously for the quantitation of viral stocks [

For viral RNA quantification, aliquots from the same samples used for plaque assay were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RT-qPCR was performed in one-step using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), following the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers and probe used were designed to detect a 99 bp region of MAYV Nsp2 gene (

 <italic>Nsp2</italic>Reverse: 5’-GGGAGTAGAACACGGCCATC-3’; Probe: FAM TACCCACAAAGGTCGTGCAGGGCGATACCAAG BHQ1). The reaction was performed in the QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Standard curves were generated using titrated virus stocks. qPCR results were normalized to the amount of virus in PFU. Each sample was assayed in duplicate.
