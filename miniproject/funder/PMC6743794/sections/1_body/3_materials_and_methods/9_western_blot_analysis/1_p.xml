 <sup>7</sup> BMDMs were seeded in 6-well plates overnight and then primed with 300 ng/ml PAM(3)CSK(4) (InvivoGen, tlrl-pms) for 4 hours prior to infection with MAYV or mock infection. After 24 hours the supernatants were harvested and proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid followed by acetone. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail (complete, Roche). Precleared lysates and supernatants were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred (Semidry Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad) to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.01% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. Rat monoclonal antibody to CASP1 p20 (1:250, Genentech, 4B4), goat antibody to IL-1β p-17 (1:200, Sigma Aldrich, I3767), mouse anti-β-Actin (1:1000, C4, Santa Cruz sc-47778) and specific horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies (1:3,000, KPL, 14-16-06 and 14-13-06) were diluted in blocking buffer for the incubations. Enhanced chemiluminescence luminol reagent (GE Healthcare) was used for antibody detection.
