<p>MAYV belongs to the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family and 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus, which consists of well-known pathogenic viruses, such as CHIKV, Ross River virus (RRV), Eastern (EEEV), Western (WEEV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) viruses [

 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes have been documented as the main vectors of MAYV, and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> has also been found to be a competent vector, a feature that has alerted authorities to the eminent possibility that MAYV emerge as a global pathogen [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. MAYV is the causative agent of Mayaro fever, a neglected endemic infection that is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as high fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia and headache. Similar to CHIKV infection, MAYV is associated with a prolonged arthralgia which can last for months or even years, possibly due to chronic inflammation [
