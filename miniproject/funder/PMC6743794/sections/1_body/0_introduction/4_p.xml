<p>Upon activation, NLRs trigger the assembly of cytosolic protein complexes called inflammasomes, which consists of a NLR protein, an adaptor protein, and caspase-1. This enzyme is capable of cleaving pro-IL-1β, producing its mature form (IL-1β), and inducing an inflammatory type of cell death called pyroptosis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although several inflammasomes have been described, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied. It is involved in a wide variety of diseases, such as autoimmunity, cancer and neurodegenerative and infectious diseases [

Arboviral infections, including ZIKV and CHIKV can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation in myeloid cells, such as macrophages, leading to an increased production of IL-1β, contributing to pathological inflammatory events that drive the development of both diseases [
