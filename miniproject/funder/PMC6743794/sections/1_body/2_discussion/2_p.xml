<p>Although the inflammasome is triggered by several viruses and plays an important role in the outcome of infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], our study is the first to identify the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation by an alphavirus. The finding that MAYV induces ROS production and potassium efflux, that are important to activate NLRP3, suggest that upon viral entry into the host cell, several PRRs may recognize the virus and affect cellular homeostasis, triggering mitochondrial and other organelle’s damage and inducing pore formation. IL-1β protein secretion was abrogated by inactivated MAYV, indicating that MAYV infection is required for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. MAYV infection increased the levels of inflammasome-related mRNAs, including 
 <italic>Aim2</italic>. However, infection did not activate the AIM2 inflammasome, since there was no alteration on secreted IL-1β levels using cells deficient in 
 <italic>Aim2</italic>. Although MAYV infection induced an increase in steady-state 
 <italic>Il1b</italic> transcript levels, priming with a TLR agonist prior to infection is needed for significant IL-1β secretion, in agreement with previously published literature with other viruses [
