<p>Mouse models of CHIKV infection are well established in the literature [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Of note, CHIKV injection into the footpad of mice induces acute inflammation, partially mimicking the pathogenesis of the disease in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Patients infected by MAYV develop symptoms very similar to CHIKV-infected individuals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Because of the similarity of clinical signs and previous reports showing that MAYV induce ankle or foot swelling in 4 weeks old C57BL/6 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or A129 mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], we tested whether MAYV was able to induce inflammation in the footpad of 6â€“8 weeks old WT C57BL/6 mice. We injected 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of MAYV into the footpad of C57BL/6 mice, and footpad thicknesses were measured through eight days of infection. Conditioned media was used in mock infections as a negative control and 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of CHIKV was used as a positive control. The magnitude of inflammation for both viruses was very similar, with the peak of MAYV-induced swelling at 5 to 6 days of infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). We also performed the von-Frey test, which measures the mechanical withdrawal threshold, to assay pain in mice infected with MAYV. The results show that mice felt pain after 1 day of infection, until the end of the experiment at day 8 post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). The kinetics of MAYV replication were also measured in the infected footpad, spleen and leg muscle. Although viral copies were considerably high at 1 day after infection in all tissues analyzed, the viral load dropped considerably in the footpad and muscle up to day 10 of infection but remained stable in the spleen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To evaluate the inflammatory infiltrate at the peak of infection, we infected WT mice with mock or MAYV and performed histological analyses of the footpads. Our results show that MAYV-induced footpad swelling was followed by a strong inflammatory infiltrate, composed primarily of myeloid cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Together, these results validate our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model for MAYV-induced acute inflammation. This model resembles the well standardized CHIKV model of infection in the footpad, which is known to mimic infections in patients [
