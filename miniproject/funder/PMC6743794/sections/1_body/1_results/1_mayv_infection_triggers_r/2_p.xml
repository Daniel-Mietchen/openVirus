<p>Activation and processing of caspase-1 is a key event during inflammasome activation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, we stained infected BMDMs with FAM-YVAD, a fluorescent dye that specifically binds to active Caspase-1 (CASP1). By FACS analysis, we gated in the FAM-YVAD+ population (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s001">S1G Fig</xref>) and found that MAYV induces robust CASP1 activation, as shown by the percentage of FAM-YVAD+ cells and the integrated mean of fluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1G–1I</xref>). We determined that approximately 25% of the BMDMs are infected by MAYV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s002">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) or and 10% with CHIKV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s002">S2D and S2E Fig</xref>). Interestingly, we found that approximately 50% of MAYV-infected BMDMs display active caspase-1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s002">S2C Fig</xref>), while 30% of CHIKV-infected BMDMs are FAM-YVAD+ (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007934.s002">S2F Fig</xref>). Corroborating these data, we performed western blotting and detected the cleaved form of CASP1 (p20) and IL-1β (p17) in the supernatants of MAYV-infected BMDMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). These data established that MAYV induces CASP1 activation and secretion of IL-1β in infected macrophages.
