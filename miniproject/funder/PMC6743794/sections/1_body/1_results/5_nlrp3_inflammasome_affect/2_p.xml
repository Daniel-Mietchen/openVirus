<p>Our data indicate that inflammasome signaling is involved with the pathogenesis of this acute model of MAYV infection. Thus, we tested whether the inflammasome plays a role in control of viral replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. To test this hypothesis, WT and 
 <italic>Nlrp3</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>–/–</italic>
 </sup>mice were injected with MAYV and euthanized at an early time point (1 day after infection) or at the peak of inflammation (6 days after infection), and virus RNA levels were measured by qPCR. NLRP3 deficiency did not alter viral loads in the footpad (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g005">Fig 5K</xref>). We next assessed whether activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> also occurs upon MAYV infection. We measured IL-1β and IL-18 levels in the supernatants obtained from footpad homogenates of Mock or MAYV-infected WT,

 </sup> and

 </sup> mice. These cytokines are produced upon infection in a NLRP3- and Caspase1/11-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007934.g005">Fig 5L and 5M</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation by MAYV impacts the pathogenesis of an acute
