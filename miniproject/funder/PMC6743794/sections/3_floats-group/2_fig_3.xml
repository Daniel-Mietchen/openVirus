  <title>Potassium efflux, ROS and cathepsin B are required for efficient inflammasome activation.</title>
  <p>(A-D) WT bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) at a MOI of 5 or MOCK infected for 90 minutes or treated with PMA or Rotenone (positive controls). Cells were stained for 30 minutes with, the fluorescent dyes H2DCFDA and MITOSOX, which stain total and mitochondrial ROS, respectively, harvested and analyzed by FACS. Representative histograms (A, C) and integrated mean of fluorescence (iMFI) data for each dye are shown (B, D). (E) After 2 hours of infection, BMDMs were incubated with APG-2 dye and the levels of intracellular potassium were determined as described in the methods. (F-I) Cells were left untreated or treated with apocynin (50 or 100 μM) for 1 hour and then infected with MAYV or treated with PMA (positive control). ROS production (F) was evaluated after treatment, and IL-1β levels (G) were assessed after 24 hours of infection by ELISA. BMDMs were primed with PAM(3)CSK(4) and incubated for 3 hours prior to infection with the indicated concentrations of NaCl (H) and KCl (I). After 24 hours, cell-free supernatants were collected and IL-1β levels were measured by ELISA. (J-O) MAYV RNA levels was determined by qPCR in Apocynin, KCl and NaCl-treated BMDMs after 1 (J-L) or 24 hours (M-O) of infection. Data shown are mean ± SD of quadruplicate samples and are representative of three independent experiments performed. Statistical analysis was performed by student’s
