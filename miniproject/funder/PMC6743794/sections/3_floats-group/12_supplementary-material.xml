  <title>Gating strategy used for immunophenotyping analysis of footpad.</title>
  <p>Representative contour plot showing the frequencies of different subsets of hematopoietic cells (CD45+) infiltrating the footpads of MAYV-infected mice. First, cells were gated to exclude doublets (FSC-A/FSC-H), then to exclude other debris (SSC-A/FSC-A). Live cells were selected and hematopoietic cells (CD45+) were gated. Then myeloid (CD11b+), NK (NK1.1+CD3-) and NKT cells (NK1.1+CD3+) and T and B cells (CD3+CD19+) were gated.</p>
