<p>Even though it is not the main focus of this note, the spatial and temporal origin of lineage IV estimated in our analysis is consistent with results obtained by other groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. According to our calculations, this lineage probably arose in Puerto Rico in middle 1989 (95% HPD = 1985–1993) and became the dominant lineage in South and Central America from the early/middle 2000s onwards. The subclade that spread through the southeast pathway, probably arose with the introduction of a virus from Puerto Rico (PSP = 0.67) into the northeast region of Brazil around 2003 (95% HPD = 2001–2004), moving then to the state of Rio de Janeiro (PSP = 0.65) in 2005 (95% HPD = 2004–2006), and spreading thereafter through the southeast region. This northeast passage, however, presented a low probability (PSP = 0.3). Drumond and collaborators discussed in their work this possible migration pathway through the north as well. Nevertheless, their observation was statistically unsupported [

For Mir and collaborators, however, the circulation of this Southeast subclade, named in their work IV-SA4, started after the introduction of the virus from the Great Antilles directly into the southeast Brazilian region in 2004, moving then to the northeastern region, as well as to other countries in South America [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The similarities detected between our work and those already mentioned, give extra credibility to the estimates made about this new viral strain detected in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
