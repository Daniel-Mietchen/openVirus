<p>On the other hand, our results regarding DENV-2 population dynamic of lineage IV showed a clear drop in population size between 2005 and 2010, and remained steady until this year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225879.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This analysis is representing the lineage IV as a whole, including not only the Brazilian strains but the remaining from Latin America too. The dropping and posterior steady demographic behavior of lineage IV could be consistent with the fact that other DENV serotypes and arboviruses like ZIKV and CHIKV have been responsible for the main epidemics of these last years in the American continent [

 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, the four DENV serotypes are circulating in the Americas, and have been circulating simultaneously in several countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Even though it may be difficult to trace the exact history of each DENV serotype in the whole Latin America, it is visible that more than 55% of the total dengue cases notified by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) belonged to Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This means that in a certain way, Latin American DENV history is capturing the Brazilian one. In this regard, and combined with epidemiological data [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], it can be suspected that beyond particular places, DENV-2 lineage IV has not been predominant in the Americas since around 2000, which potentially reflects on its demographic reconstruction dynamics.
