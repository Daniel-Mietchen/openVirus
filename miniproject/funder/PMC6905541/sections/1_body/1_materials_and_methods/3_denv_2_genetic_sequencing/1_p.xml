<p>Viral strain sequencing was performed by the Regional Reference Flavivirus Laboratory at Instituto Oswaldo Cruz/FIOCRUZ in Rio de Janeiro. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 140 ul of serum samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA-EUA), followed by a RT-PCR to amplify a small portion of 1639 nucleotides entailing the Envelope (ENV)/NS1 region (1467–3106 according to AF489932 reference sequence) of the viral genome, employing primers pair 3A-4B, described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For this purpose we used the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, CA-EUA) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and. Thermocycling conditions consisted of a single step of 50°C for 30 minutes for reverse transcription and 95°C for 15 minutes for reverse transcriptase inactivation, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C (30 seconds), annealing at 63°C (60 seconds), extension at 72°C (2 minutes) and a final extension at 72°C (10 minutes). PCR products were confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen) and visualized under blue light. Subsequently, PCR specific bands were sliced from the gel and purified with the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, CA-EUA), following manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of DNA amplicons was carried on with Qubit
 <sup>®</sup> fluorometer (Life Technologies) and finally sequenced by Sanger-based technique employing fluorescent dideoxynucleotides at the DNA sequencing Platform at Fiocruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro.
