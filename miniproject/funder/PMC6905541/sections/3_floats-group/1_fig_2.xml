  <title>Time-scaled Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree corresponding to the lineage IV of As/Am genotype.</title>
  <p>Two major highly supported subclades are identified: southeast and southwest. Brazilian sequences are all included in the southeast subclade, and isolates under study are highlighted with an asterisk (*). Branches are colored according to the most probable location (legend shown on the left side) of their parental node inferred by discrete phylogeographical analysis. Location at key nodes involved in the introduction of subclade southeast into Brazil are highlighted. Posterior state probability values higher than 0.7 at key nodes are represented by a dot. All horizontal branch lengths are drawn to a scale of years. Time scale can be observed in the x‚Äêaxis. The tree is automatically rooted under the assumption of a relaxed molecular clock. In the color-legend, Caribbean Islands includes the countries of Jamaica, Cuba, Virgin Islands, Martinique and Saint Kitts and Nevis.</p>
