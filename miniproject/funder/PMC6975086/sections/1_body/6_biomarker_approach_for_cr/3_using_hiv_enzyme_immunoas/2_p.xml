<p>The window period using the sensitive/less sensitive assay testing algorithm is longer (i.e., 129 days) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. However, the algorithm does not perform well in populations infected with non-B HIV-1 subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Parekh et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] proposed a subtype-independent assay called BED capture EIA (BED-CEIA; named after HIV subtypes B, E, and D), which can be used for detecting recent infections in populations infected by multiple HIV-1 subtypes. The mean BED window period is 156 days. Using the BED assay, Karon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] further proposed a method which can take into account information on history of HIV testing. Here, testing history refers both to whether an individual has undertaken HIV testing prior to HIV infection as well as the testing frequency. Since the antibody avidity index is always low during early infection, another method for estimation of recent infections based on the avidity index was proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Genetic diversity of HIV has also been used as a biomarker to estimate HIV incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], since it changes as the disease progresses. Other published studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] identified recent HIV-1 infections based on data from traditional or next-generation DNA sequencing. Another research team [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] developed a method based on a high-resolution melting (HRM) diversity assay to determine HIV diversity without sequencing.
