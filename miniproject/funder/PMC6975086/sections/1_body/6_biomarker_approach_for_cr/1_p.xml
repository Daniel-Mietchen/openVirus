<p>It is widely recognized that recent infection rates are difficult to estimate using the back-calculation method owing to the long incubation period of AIDS, while cohort studies have difficulty following a sufficient number of high-risk uninfected persons. To complicate these issues, ART can considerably extend the incubation period, adding complexity to the majority of estimation methods mentioned above. As a possible alternative, a biomarker-based approach using cross-sectional incidence estimation was proposed and has clear advantages in estimation of recent infections [
