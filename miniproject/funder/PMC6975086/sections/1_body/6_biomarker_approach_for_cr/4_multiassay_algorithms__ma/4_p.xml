<p>Cousins et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] proposed a new MAA in which a HRM diversity assay is used in place of CD4+ T-cell count data, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. The mean window period and shadow for the HRM-based MAA are 154 days (95% CI 128, 180 days) and 179 days (95% CI 135, 243 days), respectively. The performance of the HRM-based MAA was shown to be nearly identical to that of the MAA including CD4+ T-cell count data.
