<p>All biomarker approaches estimate incidence at a time prior to sample collection, and the concept of the shadow describes the lag-time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Shadow and mean window period are two distinct but important concepts for evaluating the statistical accuracy of current HIV incidence estimates. Estimation approaches with large mean window periods will have smaller standard errors, and those with small shadows can better estimate more recent incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Thus, estimation approaches involving a larger mean window period and a smaller shadow are desirable.
