<p>Several narrative reviews have been published describing incidence estimation approaches that use biomarker data [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. Technical challenges of biomarker approach include misclassification of chronic infections as recent infections and a large variation in testing results between individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although the accuracy of recent infection estimate has been markedly improved by using MAAs. As reviewed by Murphy et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], biomarker-based incidence could achieve high precision if false recency ratio is sufficiently close to zero. Moreover, as the biomarker approaches include a variety of biomarkers, the complexity to identify recent infections has become more and more complex over time, which may sometimes even require specialized equipments. Early treatment and the use of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis also bring new challenges to the biomarker approaches. In recent years, the incidence in some populations or sub-populations have been estimated by using biomarker approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], and sometimes the biomarker method was combined with other existing modelling approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Because of financial constraints, insufficient coordinated action among funding bodies, governments and developers could also act as a hazard for propagating this approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], frequently involving problems in purchasing agreement and limited financial support for quality control and training.
