<p>The difference between the MAAs proposed by Laeyendecker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] and Brookmeyer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] is that they use different cut-offs for CD4+ T-cell counts, BED-CEIAs, avidity and viral loads. Thus, the two algorithms have different mean window periods (141 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) (94, 150) vs. 159 days, 95% CI (134, 186), respectively) and shadows (128 days vs. 184 days, respectively). As Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b show, both of these algorithms require CD4+ T-cell counts, which are difficult to obtain in some settings. Thus, Laeyendecker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] developed another MAA using only three biomarkers (BED, avidity, and viral load) as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c. This three-biomarker-assay does not require CD4+ T-cell count data, and thus is less expensive. However, the mean window period for the three-biomarker-assay is 58 days shorter than that of the four-biomarker-assay. Hence, to achieve the same incidence standard error, the three-biomarker-assay requires a sample size about 57% larger.
