<p>The above serological assays have limitations because of their low accuracy in distinguishing recent from chronic infections. Some chronic infections may be misclassified as recent infection, and thus these methods may overestimate HIV incidence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Laeyendecker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] demonstrated that factors such as low viral loads, low CD4+ T-cell counts, and &gt;2 years of ART were associated with misclassification by the BED-CEIA. Avidity assays, which identify recent infections by studying the maturity of the antibody response against HIV, also have difficulties in distinguishing recent infections for HIV-1 incidence estimation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Laeyendecker et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] and Brookmeyer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] developed a MAA to estimate HIV incidence. The MAA integrates data from BED-CEIAs, antibody avidity assays, HIV viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts. These algorithms are described in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b, respectively.
