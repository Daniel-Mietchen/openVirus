<p>Another strategy for estimation of HIV incidence is to use cohort studies of uninfected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Since it is difficult to follow sufficient individuals at the national level, a cohort study design is employed for estimating incidence among subpopulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This method enables researchers to directly measure HIV incidence in the sample population, but biases are introduced when estimating incidence by cohort. These biases are mainly caused by two sources of error [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. First, individuals who receive follow-up visits may not be representative of the population. Second, individuals who adhere to the follow-up visits may obtain counseling repeatedly, and thus, their knowledge of HIV may improve over time which could affect risk of acquiring HIV.
