<p>In addition to AIDS incidence, the frequency of diagnosed HIV infections has become available as part of epidemiological surveillance data, greatly assisting researchers to extend the back-calculation method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Early studies used only HIV diagnoses of individuals who later progressed to AIDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Subsequently, several other methods were proposed to incorporate all HIV diagnoses, including infected individuals who have not yet developed AIDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Yan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] proposed an approach which uses the number of new HIV diagnoses to back-calculate historical HIV incidence, partially aided by supplementary data from the old AIDS case surveillance system in populations where there were such system in the 1980s. The estimate is also calibrated with supplementary data based on “recent infections”, that is, the proportion among newly diagnosed HIV that is recently infected according to enhanced surveillance or laboratory assays. This method was used to estimate HIV incidence among men who have sex with men in Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Adding information on HIV diagnoses to the back-calculation method enables estimation of HIV incidence in recent years and reduces the uncertainty associated with this estimate to some degree. Moreover, the method enables joint estimation of HIV diagnosis rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, challenges associated with estimating or assuming a time from infection to HIV diagnosis remain.
