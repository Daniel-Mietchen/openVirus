<p>It should be noted that for models involving spline and step functions, another weakness is the potential of overfitting and the ill-posed inverse problem. Overfitting arises when too many knots in the spline are applied. The ill-posed problem arises when the step function is too discrete and when the estimated HIV incidence becomes overly sensitive to temporal fluctuations of data points. Moreover, when the HIV epidemic has just started and the trend has not been stable, the back-calculated incidence in the most recent years would be more uncertain than that based on long-lasting epidemic dynamics. This is caused by small number of diagnosed infections in recent observed times, yielding substantial uncertainties. However, in many existing settings in developed countries, the HIV epidemic has continued for substantial number of years, and in such an occasion, the uncertainties in the estimated recent infections are not as large as that estimated in the early epidemic phase with dramatic peaks and troughs, as shown by Yan and Zhang [

In addition, this method has been criticized because the estimation strongly depends on the distribution of the incubation period, which needs to be determined from other cohorts. Estimation of the incubation period encountered critical challenges in the 1990s, as the introduction of ART extended the length of the incubation period, inevitably changing this distribution. To account for the effect of ART, extended methods were proposed [
