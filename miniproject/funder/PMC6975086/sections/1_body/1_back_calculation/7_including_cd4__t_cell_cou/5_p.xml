<p>This method can make full use of all the available data, including HIV and AIDS diagnoses as well as CD4+ T-cell counts at diagnosis. Using this method, one cannot only estimate the incidence of HIV infections but also the diagnosis rates at different CD4 stages and during different time intervals, providing insightful information to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Using this model, Birrell et al. estimated HIV incidence in England and Wales [

However, this method is also highly dependent on the progression rate between different stages. Moreover, the quantities requiring estimation have much higher dimensions yielding additional difficulties. Birrell et al. [
