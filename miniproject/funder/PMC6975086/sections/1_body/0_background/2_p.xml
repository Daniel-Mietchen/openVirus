<p>Unlike many acute infectious diseases, HIV infection progresses slowly in vivo and has a complex natural history. During the first 2-4 weeks following infection, the virus replicates rapidly and this period is referred to as the acute stage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thereafter, viral loads are greatly reduced and reach a quasi-steady state, which is called the asymptomatic stage. During the asymptomatic stage, the viral load reflects the steady state achieved between high rates of viral replication and virus clearance, and is maintained at a remarkably stable level (i.e., the viral load set point) over a number of years. If untreated, the median length of asymptomatic stage may range from 8-11 years. Infected individuals in the asymptomatic stage do not show overt symptoms but can transmit HIV infection through high-risk behaviors. Subsequently, the viral load increases slowly, resulting in the onset of AIDS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Because their immune systems are severely damaged, individuals with AIDS experience a number of opportunistic infections and are at high risk of death without treatment.
