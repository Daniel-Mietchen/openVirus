<p>Starting in the 1980s, a large number of modeling studies have aimed to estimate HIV incidence, and a variety of useful methods have been proposed for this purpose. These diverse methods have played important roles in HIV incidence estimation in different parts of the world. However, only brief comparative notes have been published elsewhere [

In this review, we comprehensively describe the major methods that have been used for HIV incidence estimation, including (i) the classical back-calculation method, (ii) the method based on CD4+ T-cell depletion, (iii) the use of HIV case reporting data, (iv) the use of cohort study data, (v) the use of serial or cross-sectional prevalence data, and (vi) biomarker approach. We focus on the structural mechanisms of modeling as well as the mathematical derivation of likelihood functions, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. Our review is targeted to a general audience in theoretical biology. Finally, we summarize important implications for future development of estimation methods for HIV incidence.
