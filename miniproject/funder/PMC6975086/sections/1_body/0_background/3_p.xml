<p>Owing to the lengthy asymptomatic stage without symptoms, many individuals do not realize that they are infected for a number of years. Moreover, through sexual contact and intravenous drug use, infections often remain undetected due to the reliance on voluntary testing following those high risk exposures[

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This issue both leads to increased HIV transmission and complicates modeling exercises, increasing the difficulty of explicitly quantifying the epidemiological dynamics of HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, owing to the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevalence estimation is controversial: even where prevalence can be estimated, this estimate may not reflect the current dynamics of HIV epidemics and may reflect only the degree of spread from many years in the past [
