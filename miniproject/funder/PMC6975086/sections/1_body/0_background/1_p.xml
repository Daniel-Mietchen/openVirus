<p>Since the first patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], its causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), has led to 77 million HIV infections globally and remains a major public health issue [

To strategically assess the impact of interventions and to guide policy makers in achieving improved control of HIV/AIDS, it is critical to quantify the dynamics of HIV epidemics accurately and reliably. HIV incidence (i.e., the transient number of new infections) and prevalence (i.e., the fraction of infected individuals at a given point in time) are two major indicators that are used to assess and interpret the transmission dynamics of HIV. HIV incidence and prevalence have been estimated using mathematical and statistical modeling approaches by many academic and governmental research groups. For instance, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) regularly provides updates of national and global estimates, indicating that 1.8 million people were newly infected with HIV and 940,000 deaths occurred in the year 2017 [
