<p>In fact, the method based on a CD4+ T-cell depletion model is also a kind of back-calculation method (it is sometimes referred to as the extended back-calculation method) because it also uses HIV/AIDS or CD4 T-cell counts at diagnosis to ‘back-calculate’ the time of infection among infected individuals. In the classical back-calculation method, only the total number of HIV/AIDS cases is required. In the extended back-calculation method, CD4+ T-cell counts at diagnosis are required at the individual level. For non-experts, the extended back-calculation method is easier to carry out owing to its low computational complexity compared with the classical back-calculation method. Nevertheless, similar to the classical back-calculation method, the validity of the extended back-calculation method is highly dependent on the CD4+ T-cell depletion model. In many countries and geographic areas, the empirical data required to estimate parameters of the CD4+ T-cell depletion model are extremely scarce. In China for example, after the test-and-treat policy became widespread, it became much more difficult to empirically observe CD4+ T-cell count data during natural infection in the absence of ART.</p>
