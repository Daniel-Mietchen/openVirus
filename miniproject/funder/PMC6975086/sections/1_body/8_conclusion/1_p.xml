<p>A variety of methods exist to estimate HIV incidence from different data types and scopes, and it is difficult to conclude which method perform best. Rather, it should be remembered that HIV incidence estimation itself described what cannot be directly validated, as the estimated quantity is not directly observable in natural settings. Thus, a new method should be regarded as way to mitigate uncertainty with respect to the estimates of another method, and analyzing HIV data from multiple standpoints and sources is one way to overcome such uncertainty. As the methods for HIV incidence estimation have different scopes and different advantages and disadvantages, we hope that this review will be useful for determining which datasets need to be collected to estimate HIV incidence in a comprehensive manner. Should a surveillance system be improved to collect multiple types of datasets as described above, it would be feasible to cross-validate different methodologies and see how different methods can complement each other so that an objective assessment of the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be eventually achieved.</p>
