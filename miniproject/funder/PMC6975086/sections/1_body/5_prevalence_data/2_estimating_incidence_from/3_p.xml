<p>SPECTRUM has been updated several times since its initial 2004 release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], and the last update took place in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Other studies using the similar modeling approach have been conducted to estimate HIV epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Hallett et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] indicated that this method can estimate HIV incidence from the earliest stages of the epidemic, which is helpful to evaluate HIV epidemics over time. However, if large amounts of data are available, the estimate will involve a large uncertainty as the variation range of the incidence curve is very large. Since SPECTURM need to use EPP to generate the prevalence estimate and projections, and subsequently estimate the incidence of new HIV infections, any change in the incidence can only be detected through prevalence changes that may be observed over several years in later time. An additional disadvantage of this method is the difficulty in choosing an appropriate dataset from which prevalence is estimated. The estimation of HIV incidence could be significantly biased if the prevalence for the entire population is not estimated properly. For the long time, epidemiologists have used the data from antenatal clinics to estimate the prevalence in the entire population in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. As the HIV prevalence then appeared to be greater than that of the general population, national population-based household HIV surveys data are additionally used to calibrate overall population prevalence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In fact, EPP began to include such household survey data in the estimation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Besides, household survey could miss a large part of the population that was affected by the HIV epidemic, and may on the other hand yield substantially small estimate of the prevalence. Synthesizing the use of different datasets over time could act as a cause of biased estimation.
