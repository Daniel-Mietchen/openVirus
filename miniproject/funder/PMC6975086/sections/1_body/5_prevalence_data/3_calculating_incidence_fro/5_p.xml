 </inline-formula> can either be estimated based on the age-specific cohort mortality rates of infected individuals, or estimated using the distribution of survival time after infection, although we omit the details in this review. To use this method, age-specific cross-sectional prevalence data are required. Moreover, the duration between two cross-sectional measurements of prevalence should be small to ensure that the incidence and prevalence do not change significantly during this time interval. Because people with long survival time are preferably included in cohorts, the time-length bias is inevitable with this method. Both methods using serial and cross-sectional prevalence could be affected by the increasing coverage of ART [
