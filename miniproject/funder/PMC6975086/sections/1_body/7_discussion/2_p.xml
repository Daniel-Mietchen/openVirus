<p>Back-calculation methods are widely used to estimate the incidence and prevalence of HIV in various parts of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. These methods were initially developed using AIDS diagnosis data only, but were later extended to use both HIV and AIDS diagnoses, and then to further account for CD4+ T-cell counts at diagnosis. The back-calculation method has also been modified to include the effect of ART on the distribution of the incubation period. Back-calculation methods have clear advantages and disadvantages compared with other methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. First, the back-calculation method requires only data from case reporting systems, and does not necessarily require laboratory testing and individual-level data. However, the incidence estimate in recent years tends to be unstable, especially where the HIV epidemic has just started, and accuracy of the estimate is influenced by the distribution of the incubation period (or the progression rate) as well as the testing rate.
