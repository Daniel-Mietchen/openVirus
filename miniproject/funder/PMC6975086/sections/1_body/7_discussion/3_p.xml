<p>Compared with back-calculation method, it would be easier to implement the statistical estimation using CD4+ T-cell depletion among non-experts. However, it assumes that the distribution of delays in diagnosis does not change over time. Thus, it may overestimate HIV incidence if HIV testing rates increase over time. As mentioned above, cohort studies have many difficulties and may introduce some biases when incidence is directly estimated among high-risk populations with close follow-up. For methods using prevalence data, both methods using serial and cross-sectional prevalence data are associated with uncertainties in evaluating HIV prevalence and AIDS deaths. Moreover, both methods are strongly influenced by the use of ART. Methods using cross-sectional prevalence data further assume that HIV incidence during the time interval between two prevalence surveys is constant, which is only true for very short time intervals. Biomarker-based approaches, which uses biomarkers in biological samples collected in cross-sectional studies to identify recent HIV infections, can avoid the difficulties associated with follow-up of high-risk uninfected persons in cohort studies as well as difficulties in estimating the distribution of long incubation periods. Biomarker-based methods can better estimate more recent HIV incidence compared with the back-calculation method. As laboratory testing techniques progress, MAAs have become available at low cost, which could minimize the effort and cost involved in incidence estimation in the future. Nevertheless, minimizing the ‘false recency ratio’ (FRR) at a sufficiently low level remains to be a challenge. Biomarker approaches also involve other technical difficulties in quality control, training and evaluation of assays.</p>
