<p>In this review, six major methods for estimating HIV incidence were briefly described. These included the back-calculation method, methods using CD4+ T-cell depletion models, methods using HIV case reporting data, methods based on cohort studies, methods using prevalence data, and biomarker-based approaches. Back-calculation methods can be divided into three subgroups according to the data used: (i) AIDS diagnosis data only, (ii) both HIV and AIDS diagnosis data, and (iii) HIV/AIDS diagnosis data as well as CD4+ T-cell counts at diagnosis. Similarly, methods using prevalence data can be further divided into methods based on serial and cross-sectional data. Our primary foci were the background mechanism of estimation, the required data types, the scope of application, the model formulation, the derivation of the maximum likelihood function, and the advantages and disadvantages of applying each method in practice.</p>
