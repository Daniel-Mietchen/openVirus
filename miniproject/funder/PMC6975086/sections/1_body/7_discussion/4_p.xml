<p>The required data are, at the moment, divided into four different categories: (i) epidemiological data including AIDS diagnoses and HIV diagnoses, (ii) CD4 T-cell counts at diagnosis, (iii) prevalence data, and (iv) biomarker testing data. Prevalence data may be further divided into serial prevalence and cross-sectional prevalence data. It must be noted that definitions of HIV incidence are not uniform across different methods. For the back-calculation method, methods using CD4+ T-cell depletion models, methods using cohort studies and methods using serial prevalence data, HIV incidence is defined as the number of new HIV infections per unit time (year) or the instantaneous incident infections occurring at time 
 <italic>t</italic>. However, for methods using cross-sectional prevalence data, HIV incidence is defined as the average hazard of new infections occurring during the interval. For the biomarker approach, an HIV incidence rate is estimated, which is defined as the infection risk per unit time for each uninfected individual (except for the method using BED-CEIA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], which estimates conventional incidence instead). Obviously, conventional incidence and incidence rates can be converted as long as the total number of uninfected individuals is known. In addition to different incidence definitions, there is also another difference among these methods. The back-calculation method, methods using CD4+ T-cell depletion model, methods using cohort studies and methods using serial prevalence data can estimate serial incidence (i.e., the incidence year-over-year). However, the method using cross-sectional prevalence data and the biomarker approach estimate the cross-sectional incidence or the HIV incidence at a time prior to collection of samples. Thus, different methods estimate HIV incidence with variable time frames.
