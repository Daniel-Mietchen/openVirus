  <p>Mean antibody titers determined by VNT (expressed as log
   <sub>10</sub> virus neutralization titers) in calves vaccinated with A22 IRQ and A MAY 97 monovalent vaccine and UVC group. Viruses used in the VNT were A22 IRQ (
   <bold>Panel A</bold>), A MAY 97 (
   <bold>Panel B</bold>) and A/VIT/15/2012 (
   <bold>Panel C</bold>). The calves were challenged on 21 dpv (A22 IRQ-21, A MAY 97-21) or 7 dpv (A22 IRQ-7, A MAY97-7). UVC group was challenged on the same day. The error bars indicate the standard error of the mean antibody titers for each group. For the A MAY 97 and A/VIT/15/2012 VNT, titers &gt;2.4 are expressed as 2.4.
