<p>The vaccines used in this study are widely used in Southeast Asia (A MAY 97) and in the Middle East (A22 IRQ). Despite the poor in vitro matching data and field reports of vaccine failures, this study suggests that these vaccine strains should be effective against this new A/Asia/G-IX/SEA-97 variant, provided they are formulated with a high antigen dose. The findings further support the hypothesis that highly potent emergency vaccines can provide protection against heterologous challenge, when used correctly, and offer early protection, leading to a reduction in virus excretion. However, in FMD free countries, vaccination should always be one option that needs to be combined with other measures, such as movement control and stamping out, to ensure control and subsequent eradication of FMD.</p>
