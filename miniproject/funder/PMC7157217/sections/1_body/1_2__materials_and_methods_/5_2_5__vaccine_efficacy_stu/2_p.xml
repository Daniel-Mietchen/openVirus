<p>Calves were challenged by the intra-dermo-lingual (IDL) route with 10
 <sup>5.2</sup> PFU/mL of A/VIT/15/2012 at two sites (100 µL per site). The calves were observed daily post-vaccination and post-challenge, until the experiment was terminated at 35 days post-challenge (dpc). Calves were monitored for clinical signs of FMD between 1 and 7 dpc, and detailed examination was carried out on 3 and 7 dpc, following sedation with Xylazine (0.2 mg/kg), which was antagonized by using Atipamezole (0.025 mg/kg). Lesions on the feet were considered signs of systemic spread of infection. Rectal temperatures were monitored daily. Clotted blood was collected on −21, −18, −14, −10, −7 and −4 dpc, daily on 0 to 7 dpc, and 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 dpc. In the laboratory, blood samples were centrifuged, and serum was collected and stored at −80 °C (for virus isolation and genomic detection) and −20 °C (for serology). Oral and nasal swabs were collected daily from 0 to 7 dpc, and on 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 dpc, using Salivette swabs (Sarstedt) and sterile cotton swabs, respectively. In the laboratory, oral fluids were extracted using 1 mL of Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium, containing 5% FBS and antibiotics, while the nasal swabs were incubated in 2 mL of Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium, containing 5% FBS and antibiotics. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, the tubes were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, and the fluids were collected in new tubes, labeled and stored at −80 °C. Probang samples were collected on −7, 0, 7, 10, 14, 21, 24, 28, 31 and 35 dpc and frozen at −80 °C, until processing.
