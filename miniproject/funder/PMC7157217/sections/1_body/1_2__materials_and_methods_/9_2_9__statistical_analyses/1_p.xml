<p>Clinical protection (count data) were analyzed using the Fischer exact test. For analysis of the VNT data, ANOVA (one-way for a single factor or two-way for multiple factors) was used to identify significant differences between groups. If a statistical difference was identified by using the one-way ANOVA, then the result was analyzed in a pairwise t-test (using Holm correction for multiple comparisons). In the two-way ANOVA, significant differences between models were tested by using the F-test. Longitudinal data (virus isolation, RT-PCR results and NSP response) were analyzed, using a linear mixed regression model, using the LME4 Library [

Using forward selection, the best model with the lowest AIC (Akaikes Information Criterion) was chosen. For the NSP responses, the data from 0 to 35 dpc were analyzed. NSP-response (PI) was used as a response variable. Calf number was added as a random variable. As explanatory variables, dpc (as a factor) and vaccine group were analyzed, as well as interactions. Data on virus isolation and RT-PCR were also analyzed the same way. All analyses were performed by using R version 3.3.1 [
