<p>Heterologous neutralizing antibody titers against A/VIT/15/2012 (≥1.20 log
 <sub>10</sub>) were observed at 10 dpv in 9 out of 10 calves in the D-21 vaccine groups (except for #8101 in A MAY97-21) (

 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00080-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The mean heterologous antibody titer in both the A22 IRQ-21, as well as the A MAY97-21 group, reached its peak at 10–14 days dpv and were 1.35 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.28) and 1.11 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.25), respectively, and in the D-7 vaccine groups, it was 1.05 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.18) and 0.69 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.35) for A IRQ-7 and A MAY97-7 groups, respectively, at the time of challenge. There was no significant difference in heterologous antibody titers for the two A22 IRQ vaccinated groups (A22 IRQ-21 vs. A22IRQ-7, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.094) or for the two A MAY 97 vaccinated groups (A MAY97-21 vs. A MAY97-7, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06). No differences were found between the groups that were vaccinated at -21 dpc (A22 IRQ-21 vs. A MAY97-21; 0.019), or between the groups that were vaccinated at -7 dpc (A22 IRQ-7 vs. A MAY97-7; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07). In both the A22 IRQ-7 and the A MAY97-7 groups, titers increased after challenge, but it is unclear if this was due to vaccination or challenge. Post-challenge all the vaccine groups showed a more than fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody titer against the challenge virus.
