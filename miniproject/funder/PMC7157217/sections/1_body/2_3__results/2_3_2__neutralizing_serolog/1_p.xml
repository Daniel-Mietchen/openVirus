<p>Neutralizing antibodies determined by using the VNT with the same virus as the vaccine strain were considered as homologous, while antibodies in the VNT against the challenge virus were considered heterologous. In the statistical analysis, for titers with a value of &lt;0.3 (log
 <sub>10</sub>), 0.15 was used as a value and for titers with a value of 2.4 (log
 <sub>10</sub>), and 2.55 was used as a value. A fourfold increase in homologous neutralizing antibody titers was observed at 7 dpv in all four vaccine groups (

 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.20) for the A22 IRQ-21 and 2.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.20) for the A MAY97-21 group, compared to 1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.30) and 1.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> (SD = 0.23) for A22 IRQ-7 and A MAY97-7 groups, respectively (
