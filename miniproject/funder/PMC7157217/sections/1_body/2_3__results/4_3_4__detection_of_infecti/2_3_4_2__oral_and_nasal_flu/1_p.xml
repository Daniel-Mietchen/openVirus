<p>Infectious virus and viral RNA were detected in the oral fluids of all calves (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00080">Table S1b</xref>). Viral RNA was detected for longer periods compared to infectious virus. Both infectious virus and viral RNA were detected more frequently and at higher levels in oral swabs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 179) than in nose swabs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 131). Viral RNA could be detected in the oral fluid at 14 dpc from one calf in the A22 IRQ-7 group (#8106) and two calves in the A MAY 97-7 group (#8109 and #8111), while viral RNA was detected again at 28 dpc in #8109. In the linear mixed regression model, the virus titers in oral swabs showed a significant difference between days post-infection but did not show any significant difference in infectious virus levels between the different vaccine groups. The same analysis for virus titers in nose swabs samples did not show significant differences between groups or time post-challenge. However, in oral swabs, as well as nose swabs, the linear mixed regression model showed a significant difference in the RNA levels between days after infection and group, with significant differences between groups on different days (interaction between days after infection and group was significant) (
