<p>FMDV was isolated from probang samples from 15 of the 23 infected calves, whilst viral RNA was detected in all calves in at least one sample in the period between 10 and 35 dpc (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.90). Both the control animals had viral RNA in the probang samples, but infectious virus could not be isolated. The titers in probang samples did not exceed 2.18 PFU/mL, in contrast to the highest titers in oral (7.19 PFU.mL) and nasal swabs (3.88 PFU/mL). The linear mixed regression model did not show any significant difference in infectious virus levels in probangs between the different groups or days after infection; however, a significant difference in the RNA levels was noticed between days after infection and group and between groups at different days (interaction between day after infection and group was significant;
