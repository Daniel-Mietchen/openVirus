<p>In total, 19 of the 20 vaccinated calves had no infectious virus in the serum, and viral RNA could be detected in ten of the calves at 1 dpc; a number had viral RNA intermittently; and all calves were negative for FMDV genome from 5 dpc onward (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-08-00080">Supplementary Table S1a</xref>). One protected calf had three positive RT-PCR results from 1–4 dpc, whilst an unprotected vaccinated animal had infectious virus and viral RNA detected until 4 dpc (#8111), (
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00080-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, viral RNA was detected in the sera of all three unvaccinated controls from 1–5 dpc and virus was isolated 1-3 dpc (
 <xref rid="vaccines-08-00080-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were more than twice as many positive RT-PCR results (
 <italic>n</italic> = 26) in blood, compared to VI positive results (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12), possibly as a result of the latter being more sensitive to presence of neutralizing antibodies. The serum samples did not show any significant difference in infectious virus levels between the different vaccine groups or days after infection; however, significantly higher viral RNA levels were found in the UVC group, but this varied by day after challenge (
