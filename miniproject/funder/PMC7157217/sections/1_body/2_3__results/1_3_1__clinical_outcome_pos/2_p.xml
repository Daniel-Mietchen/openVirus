<p>All calves in the D-21 groups (A22 IRQ-21 and A MAY97-21) were clinically protected against FMD (i.e., no lesions observed on the feet). One calf in the A22 IRQ-7 (#8105) group had FMD lesions on the right front foot, while two of the calves in A MAY97-7 had lesions on three (#8109) or four feet (#8111).
