<p>Two calves in the A22 IRQ-21 group (#8095 and #8096) and one in the A22 IRQ-7 group (#8105) showed low positive results in the NSP ELISA on at least one day before challenge (PI values 50%–52%). Most probably, these were non-specific reactions, because, on other days, the PI values were below 50%. At 6–7 dpc, all animals from the vaccine groups had NSP antibody responses that lasted until 35 dpc, when the experiment was terminated (

Amongst the UVC group, calf #8113 showed a low positive response from 0 to 6 dpc (52%–57% inhibition), with a strong increase above 80% inhibition from 8 dpc. Calf #8112 in the UVC group had a strong response (&gt; 90% inhibition) between 10 and 21 dpc, and the percentage inhibition declined on day 28 and 35 dpc. The linear mixed regression model analysis showed that dpc (as a factor), group and interaction between dpc and group best explained the NSP response (

The interaction shows that there was a significant difference between the different groups in the peak of the response at different days post challenge, which is mainly due to the lower response in the unvaccinated controls after 21 dpc (
