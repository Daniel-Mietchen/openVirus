<p>All calves in the D7 and D21 vaccine groups had detectable homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibody titers on the day of the challenge, indicating a successful outcome to the emergency vaccination, even though the mean antibody titers between the D-21 and D-7 groups differed significantly. The heterologous neutralizing antibody titers to the challenge virus were lower than the homologous titers in most of the animals, but apparently enough to offer clinical protection in all but three calves, despite the severe direct challenge by IDL route. Under field conditions, it is likely that exposure to FMDV will be less severe and therefore it can be expected that the clinical protection would be better than what was observed in this study [

In such a situation, good protection from the clinical disease against challenge at 7 dpv can be expected. Similar observations were made by Cox et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the mechanisms that govern the early protection in the absence of neutralizing antibodies are poorly studied and understood. The role of the innate immune response along with the non-neutralizing and opsonizing antibodies (that is detectable by ELISA) and IgM needs further investigation. The in vitro correlates responsible for early protection offered by emergency vaccines should be identified to provide confidence to the different stakeholders during vaccine assisted control of FMD outbreaks in ‘
