<p>Since the calves were challenged by IDL route, the primary site of replication was the tongue epithelium with lesions developing on the tongue. FMDV could be isolated from the oral swabs of all calves between 1 and 7 dpc, with viral RNA detected by PCR between 1and 10 dpc. One animal in the A MAY 97-7 and two in A22 IRQ-7 groups had viral RNA up to 14 dpc. The result suggests that the D21 groups had limited viral replication at the primary site of infection compared to D7 groups, showing an advantage of a more mature immune response and therefore early vaccination. It also provided some evidence of the value of oral swabs as diagnostic material where tongue lesions are predominant with a longer diagnostic window, although our observation might be biased by the IDL challenge method. FMDV at low titers was isolated from nose swabs, only from a few vaccinated calves between 1 and 6 dpc.</p>
