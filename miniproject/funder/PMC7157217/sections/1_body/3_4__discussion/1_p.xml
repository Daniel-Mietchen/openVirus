<p>The poor in vitro vaccine matching data, combined with field evidence of vaccine failures in SEA (WRL FMD Report 2013), suggested that the FMDV vaccine strains, A MAY 97 and A22 IRQ, might be ineffective against the new variants of A/ASIA/G-IX/SEA-97 lineage. The study described here measured the efficacy of the abovementioned vaccine strains against challenge with an FMDV variant virus of A/Asia/G-IX/SEA-97 lineage at 7 dpv to determine early protection and at 21 dpv when the immune response is fully developed. The vaccines conferred partial protection in 60%â€“80% of the calves by 7 dpv, and 100% protection in those challenged on 21 dpv. The time interval between the vaccinations and infection is unpredictable in an outbreak, and this study confirms previous reports that the number of days between vaccination and infection significantly influences the outcome whilst emergency vaccines with a higher antigen content can be effective despite a poor antigenic match [

 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1), even if animals become infected, mainly by reduction of infectivity, which is probably correlated with the reduction of clinical disease and excretion [
