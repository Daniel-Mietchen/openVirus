<p>Viremia, defined by isolating infectious FMDV, was not found in any of the challenged vaccinated calves, except for one in the A MAY 97-7 group. This contrasted with the UVC group that showed viremia 1â€“3 dpc. The linear mixed regression model confirmed differences between the level of viral RNA detected in vaccinated and control groups in blood, mouth swabs, nose swabs and probangs. Protection from clinical disease did not correlate with the prevention of sub-clinical infection, as measured by the presence of anti-NSP antibodies, irrespective of clinical status. This confirms the findings of Cox et al. [

This contrasts with our study where the calves were challenged by IDL route and there was a poor antigenic match between the vaccines and the challenge virus.
