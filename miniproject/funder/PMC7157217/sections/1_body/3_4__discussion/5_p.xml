<p>Earlier studies have shown that the percentage of animals that remain persistently infected after an outbreak of FMD is up to 50% in unvaccinated herds, decreasing considerably with vaccination, as vaccination reduces transmission [

 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], though the risk associated with such animals is relatively low [
 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In our study, the time between vaccination and infection did not have an impact on the number of animals becoming persistently infected. Almost all the animals had viral RNA in their probang samples at least until 35 dpc, and the levels of RNA did not differ significantly between the groups. Infectious virus at very low titers could be isolated intermittently until 31 dpc from at least one or two animals in each group. Similar observations were made by Cox and Barnett [
 <xref rid="B32-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], where no differences in virus recovery rates from OPF were apparent between vaccine treatment groups or in comparison to the unvaccinated treatment groups. However, in the study mentioned before, where cattle were challenged 21 dpv by direct contact with an antigenically related virus, virus/viral RNA was recovered less frequently compared to unvaccinated groups [
 <xref rid="B44-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It is probable that these factors play a role in the number of persistently infected animals and should be considered during an outbreak response.
