The objective of the current study was to measure the vaccine efficacy, in cattle, of two vaccine strains (A22 IRQ and A MAY 97) that are present in most FMDV antigen banks, against challenge at 7 and 21 days post vaccination (dpv) to determine the efficiency of vaccines at different time points post-vaccination, as well as their impact on persistent infection.
