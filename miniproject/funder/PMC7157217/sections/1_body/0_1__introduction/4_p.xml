<p>FMDV vaccines are classified either as conventional vaccines with a standard dose of antigen or emergency vaccines with higher doses of antigen. The vaccines incorporate chemically inactivated whole virus preparations of a particular strain or strains, of one or more serotypes, formulated either with an oil-based adjuvant or with aluminum hydroxide-saponin adjuvant [

 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Vaccine-induced protection against clinical disease is best during homologous challenge, but when antigenically different viruses cause an outbreak, protection can be lower [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several countries that are FMD-free without vaccination have established reserves of inactivated viral antigens in the form of FMDV antigen banks that can be formulated into vaccines when required. These banks hold several FMDV vaccine strains according to the perceived risk for each country or region [
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Due to the continuous evolution of FMDV, field viruses isolated during outbreaks are generally genetically and antigenically different from vaccine strains. Since it would take several months to produce a homologous vaccine strain during an FMDV emergency, countries with a vaccine bank will select the most suitable strain from the existing antigen reserve. However, it is important to match the vaccine strains as closely as possible to the field strains against which protection is required [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In vitro antigen matching studies, using virus neutralization test (VNT) or liquid phase blocking ELISA (LP ELISA), can predict to a certain extent how these vaccine strains match with the field strains. It gives rise to concern if the existing vaccine strains show a poor match (low r
 <sub>1</sub>-value) with the field virus [
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, previous studies have shown that, regardless of a poor antigenic match, most of the high-potency emergency vaccines can protect against heterologous challenge [
