<p>FMD virus (FMDV) exists as seven distinct serotypes (O, A, C, Asia-1, SAT-1, SAT-2 and SAT-3), with numerous topotypes, genotypes or lineages within each serotype [
 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Genetically serotype A viruses have been classified under three major geographically restricted genotypes namely, Euro-SA, Asia and Africa [
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and several genetically distinguishable subgroups [
 <xref rid="B4-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Asia, lineages such as A-Iran87, A-Iran96, A-Iran99 and A-Iran05 have emerged over time and currently a newly emerged genotype, A/Asia/GVII is predominant [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in Southeast Asia (SEA), since the emergence of the A/ASIA/G-IX/SEA-97 lineage in 1997, there has been little diversity in serotype A viruses, though occasional variants within the lineage have been reported [
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some of these variant strains have spread beyond SEA, causing outbreaks in countries that were previously free of serotype A, such as the People’s Republic of China and South Korea [
 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, during 2011–2012, a new variant strain within the SEA-97 lineage emerged in SEA, resulting in vaccine failures in Thailand and Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00080" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies, based on nucleotide sequences of the 1D region of serotype A isolates from SEA (2011–2015), showed the emergence of three variant strains during 2004–2008, 2010–2013 and 2014. The OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD in SEA, Pakchong in Thailand, classified these new variants as the A/TAI/LopBuri/2012-related strains. The variant strains showed lower r1 values (poor antigenic match in an in vitro virus neutralization test or ELISA) when matched with the two vaccine strains, A
 <sub>22</sub> Iraq 64 (A22 IRQ) and A Malaysia 97 (A MAY 97), which are included in several of (inter)national FMDV antigen banks (unpublished data).
