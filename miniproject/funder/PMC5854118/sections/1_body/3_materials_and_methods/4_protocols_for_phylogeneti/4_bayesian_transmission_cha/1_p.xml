<p>The Bayesian approach reported in (
 <xref rid="msw217-B18" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al. 2014</xref>) was adapted to account for incomplete sampling as well as heterogeneity in HIV transmission rates. In place of a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model (as in 
 <xref rid="msw217-B18" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al. 2014</xref>) a generalized branching model was used to describe transmission dynamics. In this model, the (prior) time interval between a case becoming infected and infecting others (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>gen</sub>) is distributed such that there is a peak after infection, a chronic phase, and increased infectivity with progression to AIDS. Cases were sampled after a random time since becoming infected (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>samp</sub>). The prior distribution of the numbers of secondary cases was negative binomial (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.7), reflecting a convolution of a Poisson distribution conditioned on a gamma-distributed overall infectivity. To account for infected individuals in transmission chains for whom a sequence was not available, likelihood terms were adjusted by numerically calculating the probability that a case infected at a given time had no sampled descendant cases by the time the study finished, and then conditioning on each case’s number of sampled and unsampled descendants. A reversible-jump Bayesian MCMC approach with proposal moves as described in (
 <xref rid="msw217-B18" ref-type="bibr">Didelot et al. 2014</xref>) was used to fit the model. This approach produces a posterior collection of transmission trees. From these, we extracted the portion of infections in the acute stage, recent changes in incidence and other outcomes required for the comparison study. The generation time
