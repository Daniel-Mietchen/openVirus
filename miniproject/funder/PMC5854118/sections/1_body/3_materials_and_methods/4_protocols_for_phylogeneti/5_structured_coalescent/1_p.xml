<p>Structured coalescent models were implemented in the rcolgem R package and were based on compartmental infectious disease models using the approach described in (
 <xref rid="msw217-B57" ref-type="bibr">Volz 2012</xref>). These models were tailored to the Regional and Village scenarios, and included compartments for stage of infection (early HIV infection through AIDS as in 
 <xref rid="msw217-B12" ref-type="bibr">Cori et al. 2014</xref>), sex, and diagnosis/treatment status. Transmission rates were allowed to vary between compartments, and generalized logistic functions described secular trends in the force of infection through time. Coalescent models also included a deme for the unsampled source deme to capture the effects of lineage importation into the surveyed region. Models were fitted to the dated viral phylogenetic trees and to available epidemiological data under the approximation that the corresponding likelihood terms are independent. For the Regional simulations, the contribution to the likelihood model of the CD4 counts at diagnosis and gender of all sequenced individuals was assumed multinomial; the proportion of diagnoses with a sequence was assumed binomial; and that of survey data (sex, diagnosis, and treatment status) was assumed multinomial. For the Village simulations, fewer meta-data variables were available. The likelihood model assumed that estimated HIV prevalence was within the bounds given by the available survey data. A parallel Bayesian MCMC technique (
