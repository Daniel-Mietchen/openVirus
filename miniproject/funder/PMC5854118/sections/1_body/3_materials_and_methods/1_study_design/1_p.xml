<p>The blinded PANGEA-HIV methods comparison exercise was announced in October 2014 at HIV Dynamics &amp; Evolution, and later on the PANGEA-HIV website. In a training round (round 1), participants were asked to identify trends in incidence on simulated sequence datasets that were similar in size to the datasets in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T3">table 3</xref>, but that had qualitatively different epidemic dynamics. Data included full-genome viral sequences, patient meta-data, and further broad information on the simulated epidemic (

All participants shared their findings. PANGEA-HIV and the participants agreed on the objectives and reporting variables listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T1">table 1</xref>; on the timelines for the second final round; and that participation will be retrospectively restricted to teams addressing at least one of the pre-specified reporting variables. Simulation models were updated to include explicit HIV care and intervention components, and re-calibrated to generate the epidemic scenarios shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F1">figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F2">2</xref>. Blinded datasets were released on 10 February 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary text S2, Supplementary Material</xref> online). The deadline for submissions was 8 May 2015. Questions and clarifications during the exercise were disseminated to all participants. Submissions were checked manually, and teams were given the opportunity to fix conceptual errors. Few submissions to the Regional simulations were obtained, and the deadline for submission to Regional datasets was extended to 18 August 2015. The Village simulations were un-blinded on 14 May 2015, and a preliminary evaluation was presented and reviewed by all participants at the 22nd HIV Dynamics &amp; Evolution conference. Teams Vancouver and Basel-Zürich informed the evaluation group of a conceptual misunderstanding of the reporting variables, and provided updated incidence estimates after the intervention 1 day after the presentation. These updates on the Village datasets were used in the evaluation reported here. The Regional datasets were un-blinded on 3 September 2015.
