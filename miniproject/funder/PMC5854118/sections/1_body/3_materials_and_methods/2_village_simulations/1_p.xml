<p>The Village simulations were generated using the Discrete Spatial Phylo Simulator with HIV-specific components (DSPS-HIV,

The DSPS-HIV is an individual-based stochastic simulator which models HIV-1 transmissions along a specifiable contact network of individuals and produces a line-list of all events (

HIV-1 subtype C sequences were simulated along these viral phylogenies using πBUSS (
 <xref rid="msw217-B3" ref-type="bibr">Bielejec et al. 2014</xref>), with substitution rates parameterized from analyses of African subtype C sequences. An overview of the simulation pipeline is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F1">figure 1</xref>, and details about the parameter values and assumptions used in the DSPS-HIV and to generate phylogenies and sequences are found in

Notably, assumptions were made in sexual mixing partners, partner duration, interventions, sampling, and between- and within-evolution complexity. Disease progression and transmission within the DSPS-HIV are determined by set-point viral load using previously described relationships (

 <xref rid="msw217-B61" ref-type="bibr">Wawer et al. 1994</xref>), before treatment was widely available, with the root of the sequences dating back ∼40 years previously, coinciding with the recent subtype C estimates of a common ancestor in the 1940s (
