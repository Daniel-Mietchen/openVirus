<p>Overall, we aimed to evaluate if the most recent generation of viral phylogenetic tools could be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objectives were inspired by current HIV-1 prevention trials in sub-Saharan Africa (

 <xref rid="msw217-B101" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al. 2014</xref>). The primary goal of these trials is to achieve substantial reductions in HIV-1 incidence over a short period. Viral phylogenetics could be an effective tool to measure similar reductions, especially in contexts where incidence cohorts do not exist, and thereby contribute to monitoring the impact of prevention strategies. First, participants were asked to estimate recent reductions in HIV-1 incidence resulting from a simulated community-based intervention over a 3- to 5-year period. Here, incidence was defined as the proportion of new cases per year among uninfected adults, and reductions in incidence were measured in terms of the incidence ratio before and after the intervention. Second, it has been debated whether frequent transmission during the early acute phase of HIV infection could undermine the impact in reducing incidence of universal test and treat (

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences have been used to provide estimates of the proportion of transmissions arising from individuals in their first year of infection (

 <xref rid="msw217-B44" ref-type="bibr">Ratmann et al. 2016</xref>). Here, we sought to evaluate whether viral phylogenetics based on full-genome sequences can provide accurate estimates of the proportion of transmissions from individuals in early and acute HIV (defined here as in their first 3 months of infection), because these are likely not preventable in current prevention trials where testing intervals are 1 year or more (

 <xref rid="msw217-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al. 2014</xref>). Third, as sequence data are now collected as part of HIV-1 prevention trials (HPTN 071 (PopART) Phylogenetics Protocol Team 2015; 
 <xref rid="msw217-B37" ref-type="bibr">Novitsky et al. 2015</xref>), different approaches to prospective sequence sampling have emerged. Sequences could be collected at high coverage in villages or smaller townships at the risk of missing long-range transmissions, or at lower coverage over geographically much larger areas. We sought to compare the impact of these sampling strategies on viral phylogenetic analyses by simulating epidemics in village and larger regional populations, and sampling sequences at high and low coverage respectively. Other objectives included evaluating the benefit of using concatenated HIV-1 sequences comprising simulated 
 <italic>pol</italic>, 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes, as compared with using simulated 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences alone, and the impact of frequent viral introductions into the modeled population as a result of long-distance transmission.
