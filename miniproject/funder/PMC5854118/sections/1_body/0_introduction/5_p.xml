<p>Five external research groups participated in the exercise, out of eight teams that initially indicated interest. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T2">Table 2</xref> lists the phylogenetic methods that were used: the ABC-kernel method (A. Poon, J. Joy, R. Liang; team Vancouver) (

These methods differed in the underlying transmission and intervention models, assumptions to facilitate estimation of the reporting variables, and computational estimation routines. Here, we summarize the findings of the exercise, and discuss their implications for using phylogenetic methods to estimate recent aspects of HIV-1 transmission dynamics in generalized epidemics. Datasets and simulations generated here may be of use for testing other applications of viral phylogenetic methods, and are made available alongside this article.
