But the generalized epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and sequence availability in these resource-poor settings differ fundamentally from well sampled concentrated epidemics in wealthy countries, where viral phylogenetic tools have been proven to be most effective to date (
 <xref rid="msw217-B16" ref-type="bibr">Dennis et al. 2014</xref>). To strengthen the application of viral phylogenetics in sub-Saharan Africa, in October 2014 PANGEA-HIV invited research groups to participate in a blinded methods comparison exercise. Two individual-level HIV epidemic models were used to simulate generalized HIV-1 epidemics. From these, we generated corresponding viral sequence datasets comprising simulated 
 <italic>pol</italic>, 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes (which we refer to as full genome sequences for brevity), as well as basic individual-level epidemiological data on those infected individuals that were sequenced in the simulations. External research groups then analyzed the blinded data.
