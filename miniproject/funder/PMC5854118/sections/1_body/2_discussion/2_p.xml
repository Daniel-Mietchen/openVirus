<p>It is not possible for phylogenetic methods to capture all factors that influence the spread of HIV-1, ranging all the way from biological factors determining person-to-person transmission (

 <xref rid="msw217-B26" ref-type="bibr">Gregson et al. 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msw217-B51" ref-type="bibr">Tanser et al. 2011</xref>), and the broader impact of prevention and care services (
 <xref rid="msw217-B23" ref-type="bibr">Gardner et al. 2011</xref>). Of course, capturing all such features may not be needed: particular aspects of HIV-1 spread in generalized epidemics could be estimable from sequence data under the simplifying assumptions of phylogenetic methods, and at relatively low sequence coverage.
