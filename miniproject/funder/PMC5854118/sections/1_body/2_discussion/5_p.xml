<p>The methods comparison exercise demonstrates that viral phylogenetic tools can successfully estimate aspects of recent transmission dynamics of generalized HIV-1 epidemics at limited sequence coverage of the infected population, when full-genome sequences are available. Two methods, the ABC kernel method of team Vancouver and the Bayesian transmission analyzer of team London (

 <xref rid="msw217-B34" ref-type="bibr">Kühnert et al. 2016</xref>) are readily available through the BEAST2 software package. The structured coalescent (
 <xref rid="msw217-B58" ref-type="bibr">Volz et al. 2009</xref>) was customized to reflect available information on the simulated epidemics, and required considerable resources (roughly 1 week of computation time on a 64-core machine of 2.5 Ghz processors per analysis). The methods comparison reflects these different stages in development and customization. In this context, the structured coalescent approach was overall most accurate, producing accurate estimates of incidence and changes in incidence, as well as broadly accurate estimates into the proportion of early transmissions on the Regional simulations from full-genome sequences. Confidence intervals were sufficiently tight for epidemiological interpretation, bearing in mind that uncertainty in tree reconstructions was ignored. This indicates that the latest generation of viral phylogenetic methods can complement standard incidence estimation techniques where full-genome sequences are available from the general population. The use of sequence data for estimating incidence trends in sub-Saharan Africa could be particularly useful where demographic and health survey data are sparse (
 <xref rid="msw217-B38" ref-type="bibr">Pillay et al. 2015</xref>), no relevant observational HIV cohorts exist, or where estimates would otherwise be solely reliant on data from particular population groups such as pregnant women (
 <xref rid="msw217-B36" ref-type="bibr">Montana et al. 2008</xref>). Further, this study supports using viral phylogenetic methods for identifying sources of HIV-1 transmission from full-genome sequences in certain settings. Broadly accurate estimates into the fraction of transmissions attributable to a population group were obtained when both transmission from that group was not infrequent (at least 10%) and sample size was not too small (thousands of sequences for the HIV-infected populations considered). Viral phylogenetic methods could thus help to quantify the contribution of several other source populations that are of key interest for prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, including the proportion of individuals infected within localized high prevalence areas (
 <xref rid="msw217-B50" ref-type="bibr">Tanser et al. 2013</xref>), or the proportion of young women infected by male peers (
