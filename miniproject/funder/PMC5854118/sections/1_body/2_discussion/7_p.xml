<p>This study has limitations. First, phylogenetic methods were evaluated on simulated HIV-1 epidemics. While the use of two models guards to some extent against over-interpretation, analyses of real datasets may be more complex and could be associated with overall larger error. Of note, the simulated datasets are free of sequence sampling biases, which can substantially distort phylogenetic inferences (

Second, the evolutionary components of the two models generated sequences that do not contain gaps or sequencing errors, cannot be translated to amino acids, were correctly aligned, and did not contain recombinant sequences. Viral trees reconstructed from real sequence data are likely less accurate than those used in this analysis, a potential source of error that is not represented in our evaluations. Frequent recombination could imply that full HIV-1 genomes are more appropriately analyzed on a gene-by-gene basis (

 <xref rid="msw217-B60" ref-type="bibr">Ward et al. 2013</xref>), in contrast to our full-genome analyses of simulated sequences that excluded recombinants. This limitation is particularly relevant to epidemic settings in sub-Saharan Africa where multiple subtypes and recombinant forms circulate at high frequencies. Third, phylogenetic analyses of full-genome sequences were not compared with similar analyses using shorter fragments of the genome such as, e.g., several 250 base pair regions from the
