<p>The methods comparison exercise was challenging. First, the exercise focused on quantifying recent transmission dynamics, whereas HIV-1 sequence data are more routinely used to characterize the origins and spread of the virus (

 <xref rid="msw217-B7" ref-type="bibr">Brenner et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msw217-B17" ref-type="bibr">Dennis et al. 2012</xref>). To be precise, the challenge here was in obtaining quantitative estimates of HIV-1 incidence and the sources of transmission in generalized epidemics, and to do so close to the present, when the phylogenetic signal weakens (
 <xref rid="msw217-B13" ref-type="bibr">de Silva et al. 2012</xref>). Second, sequence coverage was relatively low in most simulations, as is expected for most endemic-phase settings in sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, frequent viral introductions complicated the interpretation of viral trees, timelines were tight (3 months for the Village datasets, and 6 months for the Regional datasets), and phylodynamic models had to represent viral spread in heterogeneous populations (males and females with different risk profiles). We aspired to evaluate the extent to which these challenges can be addressed with full genome HIV-1 sequences, and through customized phylogenetic methods.
