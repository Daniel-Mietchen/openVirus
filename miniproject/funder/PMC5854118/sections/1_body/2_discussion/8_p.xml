<p>The PANGEA-HIV methods comparison exercise showed viral phylogenetic methods can be adapted to provide quantitative estimates on aspects of recent HIV-1 transmission dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa, where sequence coverage remains limited. On simulations, the structured coalescent approach was overall most accurate for estimating recent changes in incidence and the proportion of early transmissions in modeled populations with generalized, and large HIV-1 epidemics. Future molecular epidemiological analyses would ideally make use of several of the evaluated phylogenetic tools, in order to obtain robust insights into HIV-1 transmission flows and how to disrupt them. Further methodsâ€™ refinement is required to this end, with our analysis suggesting a focus on estimating the sources of HIV-1 transmission from full-genome HIV-1 sequence data. These findings were obtained through a community-wide, blinded evaluation, and thereby add confidence into the use and interpretation of viral phylogenetic tools for HIV-1 surveillance and prevention in sub-Saharan Arica and beyond.</p>
