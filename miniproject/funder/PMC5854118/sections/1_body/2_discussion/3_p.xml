<p>To validate this hypothesis from the outset, the PANGEA-HIV team simulated data under two highly complex HIV transmission and intervention models, whose components are considered essential for understanding long-term HIV transmission dynamics (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T1">table 1</xref>) were chosen both because molecular epidemiological studies into the sources of transmission and temporal changes in epidemic spread are in principle feasible (

Crucially, the model simulations were constrained to pessimistic and optimistic projections of the likely outcomes of on-going HIV-1 prevention efforts in sub-Saharan Africa (
