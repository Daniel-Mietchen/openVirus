 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F6">Figure 6B</xref> shows the proportion of variance in outlier presence that is explained by each of the remaining covariates. Signs indicate the impact of a change in predictor values on the number of phylogenetic estimates with very large error. Subplots are empty when phylogenetic methods did not produce estimates with large error (indicating a higher degree of success). Overall, with regard to estimates of incidence and incidence reduction, higher sequence coverage (16% vs. 8% in the Regional datasets and 50% vs. 25% in the Village datasets) and a large proportion of sequences obtained after intervention start (&gt;80% vs. 50%) were associated with more outliers for more than one phylogenetic method. Frequent viral introductions (20%/year vs.  &lt; =5%/year) were associated with more outliers by team Basel-Zürich. These predictors tended to outweigh the impact that true differences in incidence and incidence reduction had on outlier presence.
