<p>We evaluated to what extent the variation in errors of phylogenetic estimates could be associated to systematic differences in the simulation datasets (referred to as “covariates”), such as sequence coverage and frequency of viral introductions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T3">table 3</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F6">Figure 6A</xref> illustrates the phylogenetic estimates that deviated largely from the true values (referred to as “outliers”). We focused on quantifying the association of outlier presence with the covariates listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T3">table 3</xref> using a partial least squares regression approach, which enabled us to handle a relatively large number of co-dependent covariates (see “Materials and Methods” section).
