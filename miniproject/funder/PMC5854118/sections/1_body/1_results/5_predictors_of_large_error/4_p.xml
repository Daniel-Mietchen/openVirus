<p>In contrast, with regard to estimates of the proportion of early transmissions, outliers were in several cases best explained by true differences in the proportion of early transmissions. Several phylogenetic methods had substantial difficulty estimating frequent early transmissions. Low sampling coverage did not contribute substantially to the presence of outliers. To substantiate this observation further, we compared phylogenetic estimates from just before the intervention to those after the intervention, and found no consistent improvements in accuracy with a doubling of sampling coverage (
