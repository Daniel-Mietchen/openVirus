<p>Participants were primarily asked to estimate incidence reductions from before the intervention (year 39 or 2014) to just after the intervention (year 43 or 2018), and to estimate the proportion of early transmissions in the year before and after the intervention (

Participating teams developed fast computational strategies for handling full-genome HIV sequence datasets within given timelines (3 months for 13 Village datasets and 6 months for 20 regional datasets). First, where only sequences were provided, viral phylogenies were reconstructed with maximum likelihood methods (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Team Vancouver did not provide estimates to datasets of the Regional model that contained true phylogenetic trees; and teams Cambridge-London and Basel-Zürich did not provide estimates to datasets of the Regional model that contained sequences. The most common reasons for incomplete recall were limited availability of computing resources, tight timelines to evaluate the simulations, and difficulties in tree estimation when viral introductions occurred frequently. Nearly all participants focused on inference from full viral genomes (
