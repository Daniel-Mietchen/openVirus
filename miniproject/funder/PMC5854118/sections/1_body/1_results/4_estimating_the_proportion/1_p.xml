<p>Phylogenetic estimates of the proportion of early transmissions just before and after the intervention were more accurate on the Regional simulations than the Village simulations, potentially reflecting stronger signal as a result of larger effect sizes in the Regional simulations (

On the regional simulations, estimates by team Cambridge-London had a mean absolute error of 3.9% and correlated with true values by 92%. However, on the Village simulations, the mean absolute error in estimates by team Cambridge-London was 12% (
