<p>Phylogenetic methods differed in their ability to estimate incidence after the intervention (

Bias in these estimates was relatively small for estimates of two teams (on an average 0.35% by team Cambridge-London and 0.57% by team London). Team Basel-ZÃ¼rich achieved substantially more accurate estimates on the Regional datasets than the Village datasets, whereas the converse was true for team London (
