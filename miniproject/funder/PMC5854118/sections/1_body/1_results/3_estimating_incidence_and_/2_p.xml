<p>The accuracy of phylogenetic estimates of changes in incidence as a result of the intervention largely reflected the accuracy of the underlying incidence estimates (

This meant that large reductions in incidence, which are expected from combination prevention interventions, could be correctly detected at relatively low sequence coverage when sequences were sampled for 5Â years since intervention start by the most successful method. Epidemic simulations with &gt;25% reductions in incidence were correctly classified as declining in 15/17 (88%) of all simulations with a submission by team Cambridge-London, although the true positive rate was lower with other phylogenetic methods (
