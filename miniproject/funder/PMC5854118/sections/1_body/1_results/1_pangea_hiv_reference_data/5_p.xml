<p>The simulations were designed to retain signal for differentiating between the “fast”, “slow” and “no” community-level intervention scenarios through the viral sequences provided (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary fig. S5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online). However, we expected that rapid increases in sequence coverage after the intervention would complicate phylogenetic inference. The simulations also retained, on average, information for differentiating between the 10% and 40% early transmission scenarios of the Regional simulations at very low sequence coverage (
