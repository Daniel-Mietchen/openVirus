<p>13 simulated datasets capture generalized HIV-1 epidemics over 45 years in a smaller village population of ∼8,000 individuals (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T3">table 3</xref>). Sequence coverage was higher in this smaller population, 25–50% by the end of the simulation. These data were simulated under an individual-based household model using the Discrete Spatial Phylo Simulator for HIV, developed at the University of Edinburgh (“Village” model). Model components are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F1">figure 1</xref>, and further information is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary table S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Material</xref> online. The Village model was parameterized to simulate an HIV-1 epidemic mostly contained within a small rural African village, with a peak prevalence of 20–25% and peak incidence of 5–7% without treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F2">fig. 2</xref>). In 12 out of 13 simulations, a community-level intervention providing antiretroviral treatment took place for the last 5 years of the simulation. Treatment uptake was either “fast” or “slow”, with reductions in incidence averaging between 10% and 40% relative to before intervention start. Additionally, simulations were configured so that either a small (4%) or large (20%) proportion of transmissions occurred during the first 3 months of infection. Some infections originated from outside the model population in half of the simulations.
