<p>Viral sequences were generated from the simulated transmission chains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F1">fig. 1</xref>). First, individuals were sampled at random for sequencing. The majority of individuals were only sampled in the last years of the simulations, reflecting that sequences are only beginning to be more routinely collected in sub-Saharan Africa (

The viral trees did not always correspond to the transmission trees, because viruses diversified within infected individuals before transmission (

 <italic>env</italic> genes were simulated along the viral trees (∼1,500, ∼3,000 and ∼2,500 nucleotides respectively, for a total of approximately 6,000 nucleotides), from an HIV-1 subtype C starting sequence. The sequences thus represent generalized subtype C epidemics, as in most Southern African countries. The nucleotide sequence evolution model that was used incorporated known differences in evolutionary rates by gene and codon position and relative differences in substitution rates by gene and codon position (

 <xref rid="msw217-B1" ref-type="bibr">Alizon and Fraser 2013</xref>). The coalescent and sequence evolution models did not account for recombination, sequencing errors, or selection beyond differential evolutionary rates across genes, codons and within-host lineages (

As a key indicator of the realism of the simulated sequences, we calculated the proportion of the variation in evolutionary diversification among the simulated HIV-1 sequences, that can be explained by a constant molecular clock model. The proportion explained ranged from 25% to 60% (
