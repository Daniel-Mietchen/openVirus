<p>20 datasets correspond to generalized HIV-1 epidemics in a region of ∼80,000 individuals between 1980 and 2020 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T3">table 3</xref>). The proportion of infected individuals of whom one sequence was sampled (sequence coverage) was 8–16% by the end of the simulation. These data were simulated under the individual-based HPTN071 (PopART) model, version 1.1, developed at Imperial College London (“Regional” model). The overall simulation pipeline and model components are illustrated in

In 18 of the 20 simulations, a combination prevention intervention was started in 2015 for 3 years at varying degrees of uptake and coverage, resulting in 30% or 60% reductions in incidence relative to the start of the intervention, when incidence was close to 2% per year. In half of the 20 simulations, the proportion of early transmissions in 2015 was respectively calibrated to 10% and 40% (

 <xref rid="msw217-B27" ref-type="bibr">Hayes et al. 2014</xref>). The proportion of transmissions from early and acute HIV has been challenging to estimate without sequence data, and the ranges used here reflect estimates from several settings in sub-Saharan Africa (
 <xref rid="msw217-B10" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al. 2012</xref>). About 5–20% of all transmissions per year occurred from outside the model population, which hindered prevention efforts in the simulations through continual replenishment of the epidemic.
