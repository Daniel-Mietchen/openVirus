  <p>Simulated epidemic scenarios under the Regional and Village models. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Six generalized HIV-1 epidemic scenarios were simulated in a region of ∼80,000 adult individuals using the Regional model, and (
   <italic>B</italic>) nine scenarios were simulated in a rural village population with an initial population of ∼6,000 individuals using the Village model. The scenarios differ in terms of incidence, the proportion of early transmissions, and scale-up of the combination prevention package during the intervention period (gray-shaded time period). From these, 33 datasets were generated, that included either viral sequences or viral trees. These datasets further varied in the sequence sampling frame and the frequency of viral introductions; see also 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msw217-F1">figure 1</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="msw217-T1">table 3</xref>. Datasets E, G, I, J, K, P had more frequent viral introductions or higher sequence coverage, and are not shown. The proportion of early transmissions under the Village model was smoothed with a 3-year sliding window to better visualize trends in this smaller model population.
