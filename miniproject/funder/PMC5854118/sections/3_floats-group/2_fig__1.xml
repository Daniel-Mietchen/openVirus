  <p>Simulation pipeline to generate HIV-1 sequence data, viral phylogenies, and accompanying individual-level data. Two simulation models (Regional and Village) were implemented for the methods comparison. The two individual-level epidemic and intervention models generated HIV-1 transmission chains in the model population, and its components are shown in blue to green. Next, individuals were sampled for sequencing, and a viral tree was generated for these individuals. Tree generation accounted for within-host viral evolution under a neutral coalescent model. Finally, viral sequences comprising the 
   <italic>gag</italic>, 
   <italic>pol</italic> and 
   <italic>env</italic> genes were simulated along the viral tree. Sequence generation accounted for known variation in evolutionary rates across genes, codon positions, and along within-host lineages. Further details are provided in
