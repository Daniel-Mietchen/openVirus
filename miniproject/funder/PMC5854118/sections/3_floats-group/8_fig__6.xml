  <p>Predictors of large error in phylogenetic estimates. (
   <italic>A</italic>) For each response, the error in the phylogenetic estimate was calculated, and statistical outliers were identified. The plot shows error in phylogenetic estimates by team and outcome measure. For large errors, the corresponding PANGEA dataset code in table 1 is indicated. (
   <italic>B</italic>) The contribution of the systematically varied covariates in table 1 to the presence of outliers was quantified through partial least squares regression (PLS, see “Materials and Methods” section). The plot shows the contribution of each predictor to the variance in outlier presence in colors, and the corresponding signs of the regression coefficients are added. Estimates from team Cambridge could not be characterized due to small sample size. The impact of the error predictors varied across the primary objectives of phylogenetic inference, as well as the phylogenetic methods used. With regard to estimates of incidence and incidence reduction, a subset of phylogenetic methods was particularly sensitive to high sequence coverage, a very large proportion of sequences obtained after intervention start, and a large frequency of viral introductions. With regard to estimates of the proportion of early transmissions, outliers were in several cases best explained by true differences in the proportion of early transmissions.
