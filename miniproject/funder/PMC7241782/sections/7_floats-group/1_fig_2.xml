  <title>Outline of the two-stage model: Black points in the upper graph indicate the observed values in each week.</title>
  <p>A Two-stage model produces a one-week ahead flu prediction by a combination of the 1st and 2nd models. The 1st model, the input of which is the time series of historical data, predicts future ILI rate/patient number as regular trends. The 1st model predicts the number of patients of this week and one-week ahead, given the historical data until the last week. The outputs of the 1st model are shown as blue points in the upper graph. Then, the 2nd model predicts irregular trends, which are differences between the predicted values and the actual values. The input for the 2nd model is time series data of the weekly total search frequencies of a set of predefined queries. The output of the 2nd model is shown as a dotted red arrow in the upper graph. The output of the Two-stage model is indicated by a red point, which is the simple sum of the outputs of the 1st and 2nd models.</p>
