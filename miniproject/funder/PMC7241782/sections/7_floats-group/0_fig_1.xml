  <title>Overview of the previous research (Left) and two-stage prediction model (Right).</title>
  <p>Given historical data and UGC data, the existing approaches predict the influenza volume using historical and UGC simultaneously. In contrast, the Two-stage prediction model comprising the 
   <bold>1st model</bold> and the 
   <bold>2nd model</bold> can predict regular trends such as the periodicity from the historical data in the 
   <bold>1st model</bold> and irregular trends such as sudden epidemics from the UGC data in the 
   <bold>2nd model</bold>. Finally, the Two-stage model combines the regular and irregular trends from these models and predicts ILI activity such as the ILI rate in the US and the number of flu patients in Japan after a week.
