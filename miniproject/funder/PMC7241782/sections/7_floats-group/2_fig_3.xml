  <title>Example of flu prediction using the two-stage model.</title>
  <p>When estimating the ILI rate/ILI patient number for the target week of 51th week, the historical data for 26 weeks from 24th to 49th week are used for the 1st model because of an approximately one week delay before data are reported. For the 2nd model, GT data for 26 weeks from 25th to 50th week are available before the target week is used.</p>
