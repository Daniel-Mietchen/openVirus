<p>The introduction section should look like a concise summary of the research topic. I suggest the authors could show some previous studies' outstanding achievements based on the hospital surveillance data and UGC data (e.g. the quantity comparison of forecasting results based on the historical data and UGC data) rather than only explain the datasets.</p>
