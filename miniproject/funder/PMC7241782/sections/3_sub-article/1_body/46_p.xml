<p>Also, how model 2 works with model 1’s outcome is not described. Eq(2) is not enough to understand how ILI rate from model 1 outcome can be used for model 2. Although “xt and ot-1 denote a current input and previous output vectors…” is described, what actual data are x and o, and how these variables correspond to ILI rate results from model 1.</p>
