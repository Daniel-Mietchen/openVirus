<p>My major concern is about the methods. Methods section lacks enough description of the main procedures of the Two-stage model. Very few words were used to describe the model. Author said “We designate the combination of the 1st Model and the 2nd Model as the Two-stage Model”, but how were these 2 models combined isn’t described. More details are needed to illustrate how to combine the two model’s results to obtain the final prediction value. Does the proposed approach only add the two models’ results? Or with any weights?</p>
