<p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled ”Robust Two-stage influenza Prediction Model considering Regular and Irregular Trends” constructed a new Two-stage model to make real-time influenza forecasts based on the surveillance data and the google trend data in US and Japan. The manuscript is well organized, and the purpose of the work is clearly defined. Although the rationale of the approach presented is generally understandable, some points should be further clarified and described well.</p>
