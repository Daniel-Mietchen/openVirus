<p>The mechanism shown as Figure 2 should be described in more details. I assume the solid black line represent the previous historical data. Then author should describe all the remaining dots (2 blue dots, one black, one red) following the order of the steps. For example, does left blue dot (prediction from the 1st model) occur before the above black dot. How is the 2nd blue dot predicted? And how is the red dot predicted? Why there is not red dot above the 1st left blue dot? Please describe the scenario more.</p>
