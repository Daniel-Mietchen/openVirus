<p>This study proposed a novel method for flu prediction: The Two-stage model that predicts regular trends from historical data and irregular trends from the UGC data. In the experiments conducted using the datasets of the US and Japan, we demonstrated that the proposed model can predict the ILI rate and the number of ILI patients with higher accuracy than existing models in the respective countries. The present results suggest that the proposed model is the most suitable for seasonal flu prediction among the compared models and that it is robust to outliers. Our model is only applicable to countries or regions where the amount of historical data is sufficient, which is the resource of the 1st model. Future studies must be conducted to develop a predictive model that can achieve higher accuracy without historical data or with fewer historical health reports.</p>
