<p>The proposed method has an advantage not only in performance, but also in robustness against outlier data. Noise and outliers included in UGC data, which are sometimes caused by transaction delays under heavy traffic or malfunctions in crawling, always hinder epidemic prediction tasks. It is crucial to build a model which is robust against outlier data for prediction, but most researches, except [
