<p>Throughout the experiments, we demonstrate that historical ILI data and UGC data are useful for flu prediction, which is consistent with the results of previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. One salient feature of our model is that the time series data spans are divided clearly into regular trend parts and irregular trend parts. We show that the proposed model, which processes the historical data separately from the UGC data as input, achieves better performance than the existing models that use these two input data simultaneously. Although this study employed the AR model as the 1st model, we could replace this part with any other models such as RNN [
