<p>The accuracy of ARGO in the US is close to that of the Two-stage model, but its accuracy in Japan is not as high as in MAE and MAPE. This indicates that ARGO highly depends on feature quantity. Compared to ARGO, the results from random forest seems to be a more stable result in every period. The predictive performance of the Two-stage model was higher than those of the ARGO and RFR models in many points of comparison.</p>
