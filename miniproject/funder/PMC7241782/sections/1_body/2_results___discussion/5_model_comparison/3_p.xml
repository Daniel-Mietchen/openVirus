 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233126.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the time series and observed (obs.) vs. predicted scatter plots of each model and the observed values in the US and Japan cases. The time series graphs show that the Two-stage model output predicted values close to the observed values. The model performed better at the beginning of epidemics than the other models in the case of Japan. The obs. vs. predicted scatter plots illustrate the prediction result of each model by period and country. It shows that ARGO tended to deviate upward while the Two-stage model and random forest tended to deviate downward. We need a longer observation period for the interpretation of the phenomena. The verification of how each model works for flu prediction is an issue for future studies.
