 <xref rid="pone.0233126.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the results of testing for accuracy and the differences in accuracy scores between the original data and processed data with outliers. The smaller the difference value is, the more robust the model is. In

 <sup>2</sup>, the 15% outliers reduced the performance by only -0.020 (compared with 0.112 for RFR, and 0.081 for ARGO), such a smaller difference against outliers shows the high robustness of the proposed model. Although under specified situations, the ARGO model in Japan for

 <sup>2</sup> and random forest in the US for MAPE show better performance, the Two-stage model is relatively stronger. For example, the Two-stage model showed that the difference in MAPE is between +1.30 and -3.33 in the US and between -2.14 and -7.95 in Japan. Consequently, the results demonstrate that the Two-stage model is robust against outliers.
