 <xref rid="pone.0233126.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of training, validation, and test periods. For the experiments, we assessed the predictive performance using test data for one year. A year-long period is also set for the validation data. We set 104 weeks (two year-long) and 156 weeks (three year-long) for the 1st model training on historical data and the 2nd model training on GT data before the test period, respectively.
