<p>We also prepared datasets with outliers to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. UGC data sometimes exhibit disadvantages against noise (outliers) due to malfunctions in crawling or those in services because of heavy traffic. These problems lead to confounded prediction and time-consuming preprocessing of the data. Robustness against noise and outliers is important. Thus, we investigated the robustness of the Two-stage model. ILI data is not processed because it is less susceptible to contain outliers. GT datasets with outliers were created by randomly changing the frequency values of GT data in each query at each time span to 0.0 (the minimum value) or to the maximum value in each dataset without assuming any statistical distribution. Based on the above processing, three datasets with different ratios of outliers; 5.0%, 10.0%, and 15.0%, were created from the US GT data and the Japanese GT data, respectively. As described in the experimental settings, we conducted the same experiments on the prediction of the ILI rate and the number of ILI patients in the US and Japan from the 40th week of 2017 to the 39th week of 2018.</p>
