<p>We apply the AR(26) model as the 1st model using historical data for 26 weeks (a half year) as predictors. The LSTM model as the 2nd model uses GT data, the period of which is from a total of 26 weeks. It predicts the gap separating the ground truth and predicted values by the 1st model. The number of hidden layers in LSTM is one layer; the size of the hidden layer is selected from (5, 20, 32, 64, 128) in the validation period. We set 50 as the number of epochs.
