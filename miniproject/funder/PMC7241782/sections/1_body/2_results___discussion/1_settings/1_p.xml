<p>The proposed model is evaluated by estimating ILI indexes (relative ratio in the US; the absolute patient numbers in Japan). The model produces a one-week forecast from a specific week using the ILI report delayed by one week in each country and GT data in the same week. Given 
 <italic>i</italic>-th week 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>, the model estimates the ILI rate (in the US case) or the number of ILI patients (in Japan case) after a week.
