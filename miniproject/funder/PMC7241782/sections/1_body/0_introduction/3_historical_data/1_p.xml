<p>Historical time series data, called historical data, have a feature that potentially involves crucially important information such as marked seasonality. Therefore, approaches based on historical data have been reported [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and various models [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared the effectiveness of flu prediction of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a regression model based on random forest. Nasserie T., et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] used disease models such as the IDEA model to project influenza peaks and epidemic final sizes. Some researches [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used long short-term memory (LSTM), a neural network model, to verify its effectiveness in flu prediction. Yang Wan. et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that the application of statistical filtering methods to epidemiological models makes reliable influenza prediction possible by comparing the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods such as particle filters. These researches improved the prediction performance and showed the effectiveness of data intensive prediction techniques of flu epidemics. Although numerous efforts have been made, these approaches suffer from one limitation; they are insufficient to discriminate against various unexpected sudden movements.
