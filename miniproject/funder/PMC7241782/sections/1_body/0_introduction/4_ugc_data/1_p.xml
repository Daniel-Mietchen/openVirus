<p>Another line of flu prediction research typically utilizes UGC text data or search query logs to seek signals of epidemic-related activities from crowds of users. To capture irregular movements detected by these signals, most studies have employed UGC on the Web [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] including search queries [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], microblogs [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and access logs to Web pages such as Wikipedia [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] for flu prediction. Although a comparison of these resources has been presented in earlier reports [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it still requires active discussions regarding which resources are the most useful for predicting flu epidemics. Signorini, A., et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] examined the volume in posts including keywords related to influenza in the Twitter stream and showed the usefulness of twitter data for tracking flu epidemics. In addition, some have studies tackled the aspects such as which keywords on Google are useful [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and when and where the model based on Twitter works well [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Various posts and search queries by users in UGC are important as signals to identify the beginning of epidemics and are used for the prediction of various epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] apart from influenza. Currently, Google Flu Trends (GFT) [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] is one of the most representative systems using UGC, which was designed to estimate the current ILI rate using Google search terms related to ILI. A benefit of using UGC data is that they can quickly detect the signals from online activities of a crowd of users. Nevertheless, UGC-based ILI prediction has some limitations: UGC exhibits difficulty in capturing crucially important regular trends such as long term annual movements in the time series of historical flu data, which might help the prediction of flu outbreaks [
