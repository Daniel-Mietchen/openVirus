<p>In conclusion, these materials have their own advantages and disadvantages. They mostly correspond to two phenomena of epidemic management: (1) interpreting the intrinsic time series (regular trend) and (2) interpreting a sudden unexpected epidemic (irregular trend). Several studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] described the model of predicting the influenza volume using historical data and UGC data simultaneously and showed the effectiveness of the combination of each resource simultaneously. Instead of simultaneously, this study separately employs the two resources; the historical data are applied for regular trends, and the UGC data, for irregular trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233126.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Our approach is practically useful because we can train the models separately; in case a UGC provider changes its service, our model would only have to train the UGC model. Our model is also robust against noise and outliers in data because the model is divided into two parts: regular prediction using historical data and irregular trend prediction using UGC data. We validated our hypothesis regarding the robustness of the proposed method throughout the experiment in “Robustness” of the Results Section.
