<p>We designated the combination of the 1st model and 2nd model as the 
 <bold>Two-stage model</bold>. Thus, the final prediction values of the Two-stage Model are calculated as the sum of the output value of the 1st model and that of the 2nd model. As each model is trained to predict a regular trend value and a deviated value from this, no coefficient weights are required to adjust them. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233126.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the example of the prediction by the Two-stage model: the 1st model first predicts future ILI rate/patient number as regular trends from historical data (blue point), and then, the 2nd model predicts the differences between the output of the 1st model and the actual value (red dotted arrow), as irregular trends. The Two-stage model outputs the sum of the output of the 1st and 2nd model.
