   <bold>1st model for regular trends</bold>: First, an autoregressive model is used to learn and predict the regular movements from only the historical data. We designate this model as the 1st model, which makes the basis of the succeeding model. The model predicts the future ILI rate/patient number from the historical data.

   <bold>2nd model for irregular trends</bold>: This model is designed to predict sudden outbreaks. To identify sudden outbreaks, the model learns and predicts the difference between the ground truth and the predicted values by the 1st model using GTs data, in a different training term from the 1st model training term.
