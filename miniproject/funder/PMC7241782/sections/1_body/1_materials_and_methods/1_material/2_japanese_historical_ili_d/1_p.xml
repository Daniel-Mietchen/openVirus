<p>Similar to the CDC, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) reports data on the number of patients with ILI symptoms every week in Japan through the Infectious Disease Weekly Report (IDWR). These reports have a delay of approximately a week because of the time necessary for aggregating clinical information, similar to CDC reports. However, the ILI patient number is more generic than the ILI rate in Japan, unlike the US. Therefore, we use the number of ILI patients from the 2009/40th week to the 2018/39th week as Japanese historical ILI data.</p>
