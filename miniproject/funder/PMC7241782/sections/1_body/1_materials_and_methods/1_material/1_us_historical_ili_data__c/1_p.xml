<p>In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides weekly influenza surveillance reports called FluView. Information on outpatient visits to health care providers for ILI is collected through the US Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). The national percentage of patient visits to healthcare providers for ILI reported each week is calculated by combining state-specific data weighted by state population. Because of the time required for data aggregation and percentage calculation, the CDC reports have a delay of about a week. We use the ILI rate data from the 2010/40th week to the 2018/39th week as the USâ€™s historical ILI data.</p>
