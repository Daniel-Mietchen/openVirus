<p>Google Trend (GT) data has been used as UGC data. We randomly selected 20 query words from flu-related queries used in [
 <xref rid="pone.0233126.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] as predictors and obtained the approximate weekly search volume data of these words from the 2012/40th week to the 2018/39th week. The time series of GT data were normalized to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of one.
