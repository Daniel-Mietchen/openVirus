<p>Because flu-related words used in the US differ from those in Japan, translating English words into Japanese is insufficient to select the appropriate queries. For example, the abbreviation of influenza “flu” is translated into “I-N-FU-LU-E-N-ZA” and is not translated into the Japanese abbreviation of influenza “I-N-FU-LU”. As an orthographical variant, the three categories of characters used by the Japanese three writing script are applied (kanji-script, hiragana-script, and katakana-script). Twenty queries were selected based on the correlation coefficients between the word frequency in Twitter and the number of patients with ILI symptoms. From GT, we obtained the approximate search volume weekly data of 20 words from the 2011/40th to the 2018/39th week. Like the US data, we normalized GT data such that the time series of GT data had a zero mean and a standard deviation of one. Our collection method complied with the terms and conditions for these data provision sites.</p>
