<p>Our paper uses the LSTM as the 2nd model. The input data for LSTM are the weekly search query frequency data obtained through GT. We use 26 weeks of GT data before each prediction point as predictors. We predicted the differences between the ground truth and the predicted values by the 1st model. In
