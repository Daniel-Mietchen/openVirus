<p>Our paper uses the AR model as the 1st model. The input data for the AR model is the total weekly ILI rate/number data. It is aggregated by medical institutions in each area. We selected AR(26), which uses 26 weeks (a half year) of ILI data as predictors, and attempted to capture the seasonality of half a year. Although AR(52) would be the best to capture year-long seasonality as a year accounts for 52 weeks, it practically requires more data in training. Thus, it is difficult to perform a sufficient number of test verifications.</p>
