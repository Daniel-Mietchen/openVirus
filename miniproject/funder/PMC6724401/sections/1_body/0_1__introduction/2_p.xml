<p>The clinical manifestations of dengue and their severity depend on various factors, such as the genetics of the virus and the host, as well as previous exposure to heterotypic DENV infections [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Each DENV serotype consists of various genotypes [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], representing their great diversity and allowing for the use of molecular epidemiology as a tool for understanding their evolution and transmission dynamics [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In recent years, the increase of dengue cases in the Americas has been associated, in part, with the co-circulation of several serotypes and the emergence of new lineages, replacement, or co-circulation of different clades in the same genotype [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, in Central America and the Caribbean, few countries have analyzed the genetics of the sampled DENV strains and their contribution to transmission dynamics [
