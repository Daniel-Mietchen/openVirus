<p>Dengue viruses (DENV) are arthropod-borne viruses of the genus 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, with four currently recognized serotypes (DENV-1–4) [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The principal mosquito vectors of transmission are members of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Dengue disease, historically described as "break-bone fever", can induce fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and in rare cases, severe dengue disease (SDD), presenting with hemorrhage, plasma leakage, and death [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. DENV has been present in the Americas at least since the 17th century [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Panama formally reported dengue-like illness in 1904, with subsequent outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Aggressive and sustainable vector control programs led to the eradication of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in the Americas from 1947–1970 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], however following the reintroduction of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and then the dengue virus in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the total dengue cases in the Americas increased exponentially [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Panama remained 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-free until their re-infestation in 1985 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and it was the last country in Central America to detect autochthonous dengue cases, reporting cases of DENV-2 in 1993 [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since then, all four serotypes have been continuously circulating and causing outbreaks.
