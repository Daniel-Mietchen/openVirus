<p>There is limited information on the spatiotemporal circulation of various serotypes and genotypes in Panama [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that the DENV-2 strains detected in the 2011 Panama outbreak that were associated with a high case fatality rate [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were related to strains from outbreaks in Nicaragua and Guatemala in 2009â€“2010 [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In order to determine the effects of co-circulation and the introduction of new DENV serotypes in Panama, we analyzed the dynamics of the strains sampled over a period of 25 years, complemented with an analysis of epidemiological data. Our study provides insight into DENV circulation in Panama, enhancing our understanding of the geographical distribution of DENV serotypes, genotypes and clades in the region.
