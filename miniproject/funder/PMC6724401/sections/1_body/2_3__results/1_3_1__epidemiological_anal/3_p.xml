<p>Although hospitalization before 2005 was not recorded, our database from 2005 to 2017 indicates that 8.26% (4254/51494) of cases required hospitalization (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00764-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). From 2005 to 2011, the numbers of hospitalized cases increased during 2006, 2009, and 2011. After implementation of the 2009 WHO clinical dengue classification, the number of hospitalized cases steadily increased. There were no statistical differences between age groups that required hospitalization, even though the groups of less than 1 year of age and greater than 50 years of age represented a smaller percentage of all hospitalized cases (1.5% for &lt;1 year old and 8.6%, 7.6%, and 10% for 50–59, 60–69, and &gt;70 years old age groups, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00764">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The age groups 10–19 and 20–29 years old had a slightly higher percentage of hospitalized cases (19.1% and 15.8%, respectively). Before the 2009 outbreak, Dengue deaths were sporadic, even when fatal cases were reported every year after 2004, with a total of 18 cases from 1993 to 2008. However, from 2009 to 2017, 60 fatal cases were due to dengue infection, amounting to 76.9% of all recorded dengue associated deaths from 1993–2017 (
