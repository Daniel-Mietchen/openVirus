<p>All four DENV serotypes have circulated in Panama since 1993. DENV-1 has been the most prevalent serotype, circulating during three different periods (1994–2000; 2003–2006, and 2009–2017) (

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. DENV-2 circulated over 17 years during three periods (1993–1994; 1999–2005, and 2011–2017). DENV-3 was detected four times (1995; 1999–2000; 2006–2012; 2016–2017), whereas DENV-4 circulated once from 1998 to 2000. A single imported case of DENV-4 from the Dominican Republic was reported in 2015, however no autochthonous cases were detected afterwards. We observed oscillating co-circulation of multiple serotypes every 4–6 years, followed by a two-year long circulation of a dominant single serotype (DENV-1: 1996–1997, DENV-2: 2001–2002, DENV-3: 2007–2008). The re-introduction of dengue in 1993–1995 was associated with a small outbreak with DENV-2 cases reported in 1993, DENV-1 in 1994, and, finally, DENV-3 cases in 1995 (

Detection of DENV-1 at the end of 2003 was associated with an increase of dengue cases in 2004–2005, as well as in 2009 after a paucity of two years. Similar trends (intense circulation followed by multiyear paucity of detection) were observed with DENV-2 and DENV-3 (
