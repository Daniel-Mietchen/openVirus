<p>The risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever was independent of gender (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00764-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). At the univariate level analysis for age groups, compared with the reference group (11–20 years old), the risk of hemorrhagic dengue increased in the 0–10 years-old age group 1.36 times (95% CI: 1.17–1.58, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). While being in the 31–40 and 41–50 age groups decreased the risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever, with 0.81 (95% CI: 0.70–0.95, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65–0.90, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), respectively. After adjustment by gender and region at the multivariate level, age groups 31–40 and 41–50 still had a protective factor for developing dengue hemorrhagic fever compared to the reference group. At the multivariate level, the risk of developing hemorrhagic fever was still increased 1.33 times (95% CI: 1.14–1.55, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) at 0–10 years old. When analyzed at the univariate level, the risk of developing hemorrhagic fever within the 71–80 year-old age group increased 1.29 times, with a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 0.056. At the multivariate level, the risk of developing hemorrhagic fever was 1.33 higher than the reference group, with a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of 0.033.
