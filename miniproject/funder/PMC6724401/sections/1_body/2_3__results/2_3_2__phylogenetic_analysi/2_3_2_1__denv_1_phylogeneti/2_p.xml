<p>During the introduction of DENV-1 in 1994, Panamanian DENV-1 strains from 1995–1999 were grouped into one cluster closely related to isolates detected previously (1993) in Puerto Rico (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Only one Panamanian isolate from 1998 clustered with Caribbean and Central American strains (Costa Rica 1993 and Puerto Rico 1996), suggesting possible co-circulation of two clusters of DENV-1 from L1, genotype V. However, several Panamanian DENV-1 strains sampled in 2004 were related to Nicaraguan and Mexican strains sampled in 2004–2006 and 2006–2008, respectively, and contained an amino acid substitution (M297T), which was previously described in L6 [
