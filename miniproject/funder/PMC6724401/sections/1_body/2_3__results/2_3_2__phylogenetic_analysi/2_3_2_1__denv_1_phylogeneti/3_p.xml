<p>Following the 2009 DENV-1 outbreak, Panamanian strains were grouped into two separate clusters (PA A1 2009–2011, PA A2 2009–2014), which were replaced in 2015 by strains belonging to clusters PA B1 2015–2017 and PA B2 2015–2017. The Panamanian strains of cluster PA A1 2009–2011 were related to strains sampled in South America in 1982–1986 and the Caribbean in 1991–2004. Cluster PA A2 2009–2014 contained Central American strains (Nicaraguan 2009) characterized by the substitution M297T, as described for the PA 2004 sequences. The PA B1 2015–2017 cluster was also characterized by this M297T substitution and was related to strains sampled in Central America (Nicaragua 2006–2012) and Mexico. All PA B2 2015–2017 were related to strains isolated in Colombia and Venezuela in 2004–2008 [
