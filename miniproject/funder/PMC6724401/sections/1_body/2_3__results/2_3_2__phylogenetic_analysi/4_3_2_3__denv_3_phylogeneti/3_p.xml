<p>DENV-3 was detected again between 2006 and 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and strains from these years were grouped into two clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f004">Figure 4</xref>). PA A1 2008-2010 was closely related to strains that circulated in Nicaragua during the same years and to strains detected later in Central America and the Caribbean islands. Similarly, the second cluster PA A2 2008–2012 was also related to strains sampled in Central America during this timeframe. DENV-3 was not detected in 2013–2014, however it caused a few cases between 2015 to 2017. Notably, strains isolated and sequenced from these cases were grouped in the same cluster PA 2015–2016, which were closely related to strains from China, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.
