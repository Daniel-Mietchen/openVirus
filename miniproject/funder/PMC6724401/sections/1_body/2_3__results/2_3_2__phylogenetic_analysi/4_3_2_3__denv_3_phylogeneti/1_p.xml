<p>The genetic diversity of DENV-3 strains allowed for the division into five distinct genotypes (I-V) [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The appearance and dissemination of DENV-3 genotype III from Asia to the Americas have been linked to severe disease epidemics [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. DENV-3 circulation has been reported four times in Panama, each time from genotype III strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f004">Figure 4</xref>), confirming previous studies stating that the first reintroduction of DENV-3 in Panama was from that genotype [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We looked at the amino acids previously described as having higher-scoring amino acid substitutions in DENV-3 E protein, such as residue 329 (domain III, at the surface of the protein) and between residues 380 to 385 [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In position 329, Panamanian DENV-3 sequences, independently of the year of isolation, have a Valine residue, similar to sequences from Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador, so they all belonged to genotype III cluster A, following Ramirez et al.’s classification [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f004">Figure 4</xref>). These first strains detected in Panama in 1994–1995 were imported cases and were similar to sequences circulating in Central America (Nicaragua, Honduras) during these years.
