<p>DENV-2 was detected again in Panama from 1999 to 2005 and was the only detected serotype from 2001–2002. DENV-2 isolates from 1999–2004 grouped in a cluster divided into two smaller clusters, related to Colombian strains within the AS/AM clade 1 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, the strain PA/DENV-2/GMI482608/2000 was closer to strains sampled in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador. This suggests that during that period, DENV-2 from two different clusters were co-circulating within Panama, suggesting separate introductions from these regions.
