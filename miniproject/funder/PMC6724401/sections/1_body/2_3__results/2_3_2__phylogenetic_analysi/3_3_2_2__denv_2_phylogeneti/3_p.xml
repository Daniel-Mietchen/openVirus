<p>DENV-2 was not detected again in Panama until 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00764-f001">Figure 1</xref>). During the Pan-American 2010 outbreak, neighboring countries Colombia and Costa Rica reported DENV-2 and DENV-1-3 in circulation, respectively [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. During that year, Panama did not show an increase in cases, but reported the detection of DENV-2, with co-circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-3, like Costa Rica. In Panama, this re-emergence of DENV-2 was associated with an important epidemic event one year later [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. DENV-2 isolates PA 2010-2015 clustered together with a Puerto Rican strain from 2013 and belonged to the AS/AM genotype sub-clade 2b-I (following [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] classification of Central American strains). They were genetically close to viruses described in Central America and Mexico from 2006–2011, which were also associated with outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; however the PA 2010–2015 and the PR 2013 had a substitution (A50T) in the E protein that might be associated with antibody escape [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since 2012, some strains could be regrouped within another cluster, PA 2012–2017. These strains were closer to strains from Central America (El Salvador 2015) and were also in the sub-clade 2b-I, but did not harbor the substitution A50T [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Strains from clusters PA 2010–2015 and PA 2012–2017 co-circulated for three years, followed by strains that were grouped in a third cluster, PA 2016–2017. These were related to Nicaraguan strains from 2006–2008 from sub-clade 2b-II carrying the non-silent mutation leading to the substitution of M492V in the E protein, a signature of this sub-clade [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These results suggest a higher degree of diversity of DENV-2 these last years with overlap and replacement between clusters of the same sub-clade (PA 2010–2015 and PA 2012–2017) and then co-circulation of two sub-clades at the same time (2b-I and 2b-II).
