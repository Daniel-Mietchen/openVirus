 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00764">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) was performed using the Titan kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), or Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) generating amplicons of approximately 1800 bp. Amplicons were then purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN), and sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing using BigDye terminator v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, USA) in an Applied Biosystems 410 Genetic Analyzer following the manufacturer’s protocols. Overlapping sequence segments were assembled and analyzed using Sequencher (version 5.0.1). Of the selected 222 strains, the full E gene was successfully obtained for 179 isolates and deposited in GenBank (93 strains for DENV-1: MH879156–MH879248; 53 for DENV-2: KY977454–KY977459, MF491509, MF491510 [
