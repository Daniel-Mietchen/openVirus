<p>Available sequences for each DENV serotype were downloaded from GenBank [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in order to construct datasets for phylogenetic analysis. All E gene sequences from these databases and from Panama (DENV-1: 2188 total sequences; 2179 for DENV2; 642 for DENV-3; 921 for DENV-4) were aligned using SEAVIEW 4.0 software [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Model selection for each dataset was carried out using the Model Compare package from MEGA7 [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Identical sequences from the same year and date and same country and location were deleted using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree topology without sacrificing the overall genetic diversity. We also constructed smaller datasets using the NJ tree, with representative sequences from each genotype and/or clade, but we kept all sequences close to the Panamanian sequences and all Panamanian strains: 182 sequences for DENV-1, 153 for DENV-2, 97 for DENV-3, and 48 for DENV-4 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00764">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). We then performed a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of all DENV serotypes using the General Time Reversible with proportion of invariable sites and gamma distribution (GTR + I + gamma). Phylogenetic trees were visualized using the midpoint root for clarification. The statistical significance of the tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap resampling of the sequences 1000 times with the RaxML algorithm using MEGA7. The protein E amino acid sequences were obtained from the translation of E gene and analyzed using MEGA7.
