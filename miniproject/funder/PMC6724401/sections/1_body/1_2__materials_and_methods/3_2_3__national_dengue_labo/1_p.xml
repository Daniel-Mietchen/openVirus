<p>The National dengue surveillance program was established in 1988 by MINSA, in collaboration with ICGES, to survey the entomological situation of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. vectors as well as all dengue human clinical cases in the country [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical suspected cases were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis or epidemiological link. The epidemiological link was defined as a clinical dengue suspected case in close contact (home or workplace) with a laboratory dengue confirmed case. This contact had to happen within less than 30 days of the onset of symptoms of the confirmed case. From 1993 to 2009, ICGES received all serum samples from dengue suspected cases for laboratory confirmation. Acute sera samples (0–3 days post onset of symptoms) were analyzed using viral isolation by the inoculation of Vero cells (African green monkey-ATCC CCL-81, USA). When cytopathic effect (CPE) was evident or at 14 days post-inoculation, the supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C in the ICGES viral repository. To characterize the serotype of the isolated virus, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using monoclonal antibodies supplied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Fort Collins was performed. Convalescent serum samples (5–20 days post-symptom onset) were analyzed using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Dengue IgM/IgG (Panbio, Abott laboratories). In 2010, the national surveillance program decentralized dengue surveillance, establishing capacity in all main hospitals and clinical units around the country for serological tests (ELISA IgM/IgG) used for laboratory confirmation of convalescent samples and NS1 ELISA for confirmation of acute samples. ICGES’ leadership in supporting national surveillance efforts continues to this day with the screening of acute samples, virus isolation, and serotype typing through the CDC qRT-PCR system [
