<p>Our results demonstrate that Panama has a strong level of laboratory support, with the highest percent of dengue laboratory confirmation in the region. Since 1999, Panama has maintained a 50% laboratory detection and confirmation rate of dengue cases. We have also reinforced test detection during outbreaks, as in 2011 when laboratory detection reached 80.6% of reported cases. For comparison, WHO recorded for Central America and Mexico that 18.4%, 10.8%, 9.1%, and 13% of cases were laboratory confirmed between 2014 and 2017 [
