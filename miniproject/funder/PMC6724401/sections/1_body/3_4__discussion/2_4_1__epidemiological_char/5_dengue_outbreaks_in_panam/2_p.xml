<p>The case fatality rate (CFR: dengue death/total dengue cases) has been highly variable during the 25 years of dengue surveillance in Panama (CFR: 0% to 0.49%). In 2011, the CFR associated with the reintroduction of DENV-2 in the country was 0.44%, however the CFR calculated over DHF cases was 44.7% (17 deaths/38 DHF cases x 100) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A year before, during a Pan-American outbreak with a particularly high DENV-2 prevalence, the CFR (deaths/DHF) was generally between 0% and 4% in most countries, with 2.6% being the median in the Americas. Even as Colombia and Honduras registered their worst dengue epidemics at that time, their CFR was around 2.3% and 2.5%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In Panama, this high CFR could be the result of several factors, which include poor participation of community members in vector control, seeking medical care late in the course of clinical illness, co-circulation of other viruses (e.g., H1N1 and PTV in 2009, CHIKV since 2014, ZIKV since 2015) [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] that may have complicated accurate differential diagnosis, thus resulting in the under-reporting of dengue cases and a decrease in the detection of severe dengue cases, and artificially increasing the CFR (death/DHF). Finally, this increase in DENV-related deaths could also be correlated with the fact that cumulated dengue cases, due to virus endemicity, could have increased the probability of secondary infections and thus the probability of severity [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The recirculation of DENV-2 in 2010â€“2011, after the co-circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-3, was associated with a severe outbreak in 2011 [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This DENV-2 cluster has previously been associated with severe outbreaks in Nicaragua [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, we were not able to link severity with a specific serotype in our study because the viral sequences from the most severe or fatal cases were not available.
