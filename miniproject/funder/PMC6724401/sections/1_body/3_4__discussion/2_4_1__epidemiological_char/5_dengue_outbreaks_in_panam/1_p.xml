<p>During the 2005 dengue outbreak, hospitalized cases represented 1.4% of total cases. However, our study shows that they increased the next year to 11.4% and were maintained at an average of 8.3% in subsequent years. The cost of a hospitalized dengue case in Panama during 2005 was calculated to be $1065 per case [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Given that both the number of hospitalized dengue cases and the cost of hospital care have increased, this surely represents an added burden in the cost of management, treatment, and control of dengue in Panama, which needs to be evaluated.
