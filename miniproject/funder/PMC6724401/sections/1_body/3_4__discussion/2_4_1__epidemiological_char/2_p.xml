<p>During these 25 years of dengue in Panama, incidence rates have typically been higher among adults; we observed high incidences in the 30–59 years old group, mainly until 2009. However, more recently, there has been a trend toward infections in younger age groups with higher incidences for the 10–19 years-old age group. The same pattern has been observed in some Brazilian cities [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], where the incidence rates have increased in younger populations. A different trend was observed in Colombia, where high incidence was reported in individuals 5–14 years of age in 2003, however transmission was highest since 2011 in the &gt;45 years-old age group [
