<p>Hospitalization was not significantly associated with age in Panama, although more than 19% of hospitalized cases were from the 11–20 years old reference age group. However, there is a higher risk (1.36 times) of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 0–10 age group compared to the reference group, similar to what has been observed in southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our multivariate analysis showed that the elderly (&gt;71 years old) also had a high risk (1.33 times) of developing hemorrhagic dengue, similar to other countries in the region [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This could be due to the higher level of chronic diseases, co-morbidities, as well as poorer immune responses in the elderly group [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Living in the Herrera province or the East Panama region conferred a higher risk of developing hemorrhagic dengue compared to the reference region, the Panama Metropolitan area, the region with the largest population and with a higher number of dengue cases. This could be explained by the fact that Herrera has an aging population [
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and the East Panama region has had recent urbanization and illegal settlements in what used to be swamps, mangroves, and forest areas without regular water services and garbage disposal. Moreover, in this region, health institutions were only recently made available.
