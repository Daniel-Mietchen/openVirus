<p>This study analyzes the epidemiology and phylogenetic characteristics of 25 years of dengue circulation in Panama. After DENV established its endemicity in 1993, the number of suspected, confirmed, and severe/fatal dengue cases has increased steadily, mainly since 2009. Interestingly, since 2009, at least two serotypes and frequently, three serotypes have been circulating every year, suggesting that the continuous co-circulation of different serotypes might increase the probability of secondary infections and dengue severity [

Despite several outbreaks (1995, 2005–2006, 2009, 2011, 2013–2014), dengue cases in the country always remained below the average of the region. Even neighboring countries, Costa Rica and Colombia, registered 5.5 and 18.5 times more cases than Panama during our study period, despite the constant interchange of migrants and merchandise, similar cultural characteristics, and similar demographics. Future studies are needed to determine if this difference in case numbers is due to less dengue infection associated with a strong vector control program, fewer persons attending health institutions, or underreporting of suspected dengue cases.
