<p>Moreover, for all serotypes, PA strains that were sampled in the 1990s were grouped with strains sampled from countries across the Americas and the Caribbean (mainly Puerto Rico). However, DENV 1-3 PA isolates, starting in 2000, were grouped in clusters with strains sampled mainly in Nicaragua and Mexico. This could suggest a sustained endemicity with exportation to other countries in the region, or a two-way exchange of strains between hyperendemic countries of the region; this pattern was described previously in Asia [

Independently of these scenarios, our results suggest high DENV diversity with exchange across the Americas, even if the most common exchange has been with Caribbean islands and Central America. Furthermore, DENV-1 PA B2 2015-2017 grouped with Colombian and South American strains, suggesting a wider exchange of strains inside genotype V between regions (Caribbean, South America, or Central America) than previously described [

Our data suggest that Panama participates in the exchange of DENV in the Americas, however given the information available, for most exchanges, the direction and year of exchange cannot be determined. Due to a lack of previous DENV sequences from Panama, the country has been absent from most molecular epidemiolocal and spatiotemporal phylogenetic studies of DENV in the Americas [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Future phylodynamic and phylogeographic studies with complete genome sequences from Panama and the region are needed to gain insights into DENV movements across the region.
