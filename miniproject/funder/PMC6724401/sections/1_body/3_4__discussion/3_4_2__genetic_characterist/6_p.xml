<p>For DENV-2, after 2010, three clusters overlapped PA 2010–2015, PA 2012–2017, PA 2016–2017, with the strains from the PA 2012–2017 cluster replacing the ones from PA 2010–2015 cluster after four years of co-circulation. We cannot determine whether cluster PA 2016–2017, with the E360G substitution in the E protein (changing a negatively-charged a.a. to a neutral one), will replace the PA 2012–2017 cluster or not, as the properties of this substitution have not yet been analyzed. Co-circulation of two clusters was observed only once for DENV-3 in 2008 with PA A1 2008–2010 and PA A2 2008–2012. </p>
