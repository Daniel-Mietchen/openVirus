<p>Our study has some limitations. National surveillance data could significantly underestimate the true burden of disease [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-00764" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and similarly could underestimate the diversity of strains circulating. Nevertheless, it is important to remember the inferential limitations imposed by uneven spatial sampling from any national surveillance program. There is the possibility that the diversity of circulating strains in Panama is even higher than described, especially because some regions (including the indigenous regions and the border regions with Columbia and Costa Rica) send very few samples for dengue serotype and genotype identification due to cost and the logistics of transportation of the samples to Panama City. Costa Rica experienced their largest outbreak with co-circulation of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in 2007 and of DENV-1, -2, and -3 in 2013, in which their strains were closely related to other clades found in the region [

This caveat of our study is similar to previous studies that rely on a passive surveillance system which typically underestimates the true number of cases [
