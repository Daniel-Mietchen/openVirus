<p>The co-circulation of more than one cluster for a serotype was observed mainly after 2009, and generally strains from one cluster were detected during a longer period of time than another cluster. For example, in 2009, two DENV-1 clusters, PA A1 2009–2011 and PA A2 2009–2014, overlapped, but PA A2 had maintained circulation for three more years. In 2015, again two DENV-1 clusters co-circulated, PA B1 2015–2017 and PA B2 2015–2017, but as in 2017, it is still unknown whether they will be replaced by another. Both co-circulating clusters had the amino acid L1 signature in the E protein, however PA B2 2015–2017 had one substitution S338L described for L6. Studies in Brazil showed that L1 has better in vivo replication in mosquitoes than L6; however, L6 has reduced antigenicity, weak B and T cell stimulation, and high viremia in humans, allowing transmission to vectors and suggesting an increased epidemiology fitness of L6 versus L1, explaining its dominance in that country [

Future studies will be needed to obtain the complete genome sequences of the Panamanian strains to detect lineage-specific mutations in order to better understand the viral and host-specific factors that influence the transmission dynamics of DENV circulation in Panama.
