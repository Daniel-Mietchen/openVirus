<p>In our study, the genetic characteristics of Panamanian dengue strains were analyzed from isolates and not direct from sera samples. Indeed, only isolates were available from 1993-2007, moreover the sample amount from 2008-2017 sera was not enough for direct sequencing. As bottleneck selection and specific mutations induced by more than five passage in Vero cells have been described [
