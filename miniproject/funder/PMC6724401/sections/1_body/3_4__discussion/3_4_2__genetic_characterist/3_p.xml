<p>In some occasions, Panamanian strains were monophyletic, grouped alone in a cluster without sequences from other countries. This was observed during the first dengue reintroduction in the 1990s for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4. The grouping of PA DENV strains in consecutive years as a monophyletic cluster was observed in a few cases, suggesting local persistence (endemicity) for 2 to 6 years: DENV-1 PA A1 2009–2011, PA B1 2015–2017, DENV-2 PA 2012–2017, PA 2016–2017, DENV-3 PA 1999–2000. It will be necessary in the future to include additional sequences, if they become available, from other countries of the Central American and Caribbean region to demonstrate that our monophyletic clusters consisting of only Panamanian strains are not due to an underrepresentation of genetic diversity in the region. </p>
