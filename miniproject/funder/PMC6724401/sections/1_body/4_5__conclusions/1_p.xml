<p>In conclusion, our epidemiological data shows that dengue is endemic in Panama, similar to other countries in the region, with an increased number of cases and severity. We also show a high genetic diversity of DENV circulating strains, with different clusters inside the same genotype for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3, suggesting an evolution towards hyperendemicity, which is also similar to other countries of the Americas [

The genetic diversity observed should be taken into account for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy which also needs to contemplate the different epidemiological situations in each country and region. This underscores the importance of continuing the effort of genotype surveillance and the need to strengthen clinical and epidemiological tracking to make it more representative of the entire territory to detect any introduction of new dengue strains or of any emergent arbovirus. Moreover, performing complete genome sequencing will be needed to identify the presence of substitutions in different viral proteins that could play a role in viral fitness, immune response, and/or epidemiological fitness to better understand dengue viral evolution.
