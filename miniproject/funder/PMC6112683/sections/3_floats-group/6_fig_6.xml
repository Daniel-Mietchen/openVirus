  <p>For each accepted particle, the process was simulated again, and the total number of infected individuals from these new realisations was recorded, and converted into an annual attack rate (by dividing by the total population, and by 2 as it is the average over two seasons). Point colour indicates the probability of an individual seeking treatment; larger attack rates correspond to smaller treatment probabilities given that they all fit the same data. The red line shows where the product of
