  <title>Schematic of influenza-like illness (ILI).</title>
  <p>Individuals with influenza or other respiratory viruses likely seek treatment at different, unknown rates, and as such ILI counts include an uncertain mixture of diseases. Virological testing is uncommon outside high risk groups, but when performed it is possible to use the resulting confirmed influenza data to model the population level circulation of influenza, specifically. Red quantities are those with known/observed values. Note that some ILI samples sent for testing return with as positive to none of the tested diseases, suggesting that their ILI symptoms may have some other cause.</p>
