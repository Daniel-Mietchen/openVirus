 <p>Understanding the epidemiology of seasonal influenza is critical for healthcare resource allocation and early detection of anomalous seasons. It can be challenging to obtain high-quality data of influenza cases specifically, as clinical presentations with influenza-like symptoms may instead be cases of one of a number of alternate respiratory viruses. We use a new dataset of confirmed influenza virological data from 2011-2016, along with high-quality denominators informing a hierarchical observation process, to model seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia. We use approximate Bayesian computation to estimate parameters in a climate-driven stochastic epidemic model, including the basic reproduction number

  <sub>0</sub>, the proportion of the population susceptible to the circulating strain at the beginning of the season, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. We conclude that

  <sub>0</sub> and initial population susceptibility were strongly related, emphasising the challenges of identifying these parameters. Relatively high

  <sub>0</sub> values alongside low initial population susceptibility were among the results most consistent with these data. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between
