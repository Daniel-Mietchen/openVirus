<p>When simulating from the posterior distributions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006377.g006">Fig 6</xref>), the range of parameter estimates accepted in the posterior induce a diversity of associated epidemic characteristics. Specifically, population epidemic metrics such as the attack rate (total proportion of the population infected over a season), and the proportion of the population susceptible at the beginning of a season, are related to

 <sub>0</sub> and the probability an individual seeks treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006377.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The majority of posterior probability mass is around the region in which 10-30% of individuals in the population are susceptible at the beginning of a season, and 75% of accepted particles had an attack rate below 14.1% (less than 970,000 infections occur per year). An attack rate in this region does align with previous estimates in other studies [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, parameter sets are also accepted in regions of parameter space resulting in larger proportions of susceptible individuals at the beginning of the season, associated with larger epidemics, and smaller probabilities that each infectious individual seeks primary care. We note that these estimates more closely resemble modelling results such as those of [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], who estimated susceptibility and attack rate using a multistrain model and assuming
