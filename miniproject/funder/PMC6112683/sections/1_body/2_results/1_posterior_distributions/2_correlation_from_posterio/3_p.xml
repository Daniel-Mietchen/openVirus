<p>The median posterior density for the initial susceptible proportion was 0.224 in 2011 and 0.188 in 2013, suggesting that most individuals are unlikely to be susceptible to the circulating strain of influenza each year, even when that strain was not the primary circulating strain in the previous season (however, note again that there was substantial uncertainty in estimates of initial susceptibility, and it was related to
