<p>Historical climate data were obtained from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (

We used climate data from Sydney, the state capital, as both the majority of the population and the majority of GPs in the study were located here. Climate data consisted of observations of temperature, precipitation, and absolute humidity, taken every three hours (i.e., 8 times per day), continuously from 1955–present. Note that three-hourly observations creates a cyclic temperature pattern with both daily and annual periods. So as to avoid having unrealistic diurnal dynamics, we used the average daily temperature rather than the three-hourly observations themselves. We used a fixed, total population size of 6.9 million, based on 2011 Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates. While the population of New South Wales is increasing over time, including demography would add considerable complexity, which we wished to avoid.
