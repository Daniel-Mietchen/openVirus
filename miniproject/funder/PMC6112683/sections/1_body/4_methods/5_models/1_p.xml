<p>We considered a continuous-time stochastic epidemic model, with an SEIRS structure, with an observation class and Erlang-2 sojurn times in the infectious class (modelled by splitting these classes into two consecutive compartments) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006377.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This process was approximated in discrete time with 8 timesteps per day. So as to avoid diurnal dynamics with transmission rates varying within days and being maximised in the early hours of the morning, we used the daily mean temperature at each timestep. We also allow external importation of cases, at a per-susceptible rate 
 <italic>ξ</italic> (constant through time) which we fit as part of the model. Note that because of the structure of the model, the mean infectious time of an individual is 2/(2
 <italic>γ</italic> + λ) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006377.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The model was parameterized based on physical epidemiological quantities, which were then transformed into model-based rates, which appear in
