<p>We chose to use exponential prior distributions so as to avoid putting maximum limits on the values these parameters may take, i.e., in the same sense that you would choose uniform priors to be uninformative, but with infinite positive support. Rates for the infectious and latent period exponential priors were chosen so that the means were within a reasonable range of influenza epidemiological parameters. The prior for

 <sub>0</sub> values, we chose to retain this relatively uninformative prior so as to minimise modelling assumptions. The probability that an individual chooses to seek treatment was assumed to be constant, both within and between seasons. In practice this may not be the case, particularly when a circulating strain is unusually transmissible, or produces stronger symptoms (in either case, potentially leading to greater media attention). However, the hierarchical observation structure means that we are able to capture some of this effect in the variation in testing probabilities, as we explicitly use the actual testing proportions given in our dataset, which varied each week.
