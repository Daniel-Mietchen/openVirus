<p>We chose this parameterisation so as to put priors on the physical quantities of interest. That is, priors were defined on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, mean latent, infectious and immune durations, and the probability of observation over the infectious period, and then transformed to obtain epidemic model parameters such as 
 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>γ</italic>. Initial conditions were fit for each season, so that susceptibility to the circulating strain in that season could be determined. Prior distributions for epidemic parameters appear in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Per-susceptible external importation of cases at a low rate was used to allow for the possibility of epidemic fade-out and reintroduction from elsewhere, and was assigned an exponential prior distribution with rate 10
 <sup>9</sup> (approximately 3 individual case importations per year per million susceptible individuals). We did not reject simulation runs in which fade-out occurred, except to require circulation of influenza in any week in which there were influenza cases observed.
