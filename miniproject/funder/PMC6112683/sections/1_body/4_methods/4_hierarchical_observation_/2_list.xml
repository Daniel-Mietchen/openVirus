  <p>Not all influenza cases are identical in morbidity, and given mild or asymptomatic cases patients may or may not choose to consult a GP. We assume that each infectious individual has some (unknown, independent and identically distributed) probability of consulting a GP.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Only a small proportion of GPs are part of the ASPREN network, and the proportion that are has varied over time. We then assume that an infectious patient who attends a GP has some probability (fixed, estimated from data, varying annually) of that GP being part of the ASPREN network.</p>

 <list-item>
  <p>ASPREN doctors are instructed to send a proportion of their ILI cases for swab testing. This target proportion has varied over time, and the proportion of cases that doctors actually send for testing has varied significantly beyond that. We assume that each infectious patient who attends an ASPREN GP has some probability (fixed, estimated from data, varying weekly) of being sent for testing.</p>
