<p>Because influenza has multiple strains, interactions between those strains are complex, and immunity from one strain may not confer protection to a different strain, we chose to model seasons with different strains separately. Specifically, the predominant strain in 2011 and 2013 was H1N1pdm2009, and the predominant strain in 2014 and 2016 was H3N2, so we performed model fitting separately on these two datasets. In doing so, we assume that epidemic parameters (e.g., 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) were consistent across seasons for a single strain, and we explicitly fit the proportion of the population susceptible and number infected at the start of each season. In 2012 and 2015 there were multiple strains with substantial circulation, and so we chose not to fit these seasons rather than making strong assumptions around interactions between strains.
