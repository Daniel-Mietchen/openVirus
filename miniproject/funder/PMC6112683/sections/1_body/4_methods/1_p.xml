The target coverage is approximately one GP per 200,000 people in metropolitan areas, and one GP per 50,000 people in regional areas. This database is continually updated and requires the voluntary participation of GPs, so there is variation between years and states. All GPs in the database reported to ASPREN the number of consultations they performed each week, along with every case of influenza-like-illness (ILI) that they observed. GPs were asked to take swab samples from a proportion of those patients presenting ILI symptoms—25% from 2012–2014, 20% in 2015–2016. In practice, not all GPs took samples, and the proportion of patients for which samples were taken varied substantially, however we use exact denominators accounting for the testing doctors and the number of ILI patients they observed. These swab samples were sent for PCR testing, resulting in respiratory virus virology data for each sample. In this study, we used those data from New South Wales, as this is the most populous state in Australia and has the most confirmed influenza cases.
