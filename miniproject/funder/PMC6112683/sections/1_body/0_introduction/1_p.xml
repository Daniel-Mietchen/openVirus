<p>Influenza is a highly contagious, rapidly evolving respiratory virus that circulates globally on a seasonal basis [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It can cause death in at-risk groups, and places a high burden on health systems (e.g., emergency room (ER) and general practitioner (GP) services). In some cases, antigenic shift creates circumstances where influenza can be particularly infectious or dangerous, resulting in influenza pandemics such as those that occurred in 1918 and 2009. However, understanding normal seasonal circulation is critical for effective healthcare resource allocation, forecasting future seasonal dynamics, and early detection of anomalous seasons.
