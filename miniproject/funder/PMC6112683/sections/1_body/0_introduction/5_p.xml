<p>In this study, we used a new, high-quality dataset along with modern Bayesian parameter estimation methods to investigate seasonal influenza dynamics in New South Wales, Australia, from 2011â€“2016. We used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmed influenza infections from the Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network (ASPREN; [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]) to fit models. Within these data, approximately 0.5% of general practitioners (GPs; known as family physicians in North America) within Australia reported each Influenza-like illness (ILI) case that they observed, along with the number of consultations they performed, and submitted swab samples for c. 20% of these ILI cases for virological testing via PCR. These data were available weekly. Knowing the numbers of doctors, consultations, ILI observed, and samples tested provides critical and unparalleled denominator data against which to assess the hierarchical observation process between population-level influenza dynamics and the observed confirmed infections. We fit model parameters using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), assuming the same strain-specific parameters for seasons in which the same predominant strain circulated. By performing this analysis using high-quality confirmed influenza data (including denominators), state of the art parameter estimation techniques, and minimal assumptions, we are able to characterize the epidemiology of influenza within populations. In doing so, we aim to both progress the science of disease modeling, and produce new epidemiological knowledge around population-level immunity to seasonal influenza.
