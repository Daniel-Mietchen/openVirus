<p>Estimates for

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While these most extreme values may be highly unlikely, estimates in the intermediate range are plausible when associated with reduced population susceptibility. Assumptions around parameter values can propagate through a modelling analysis, and impact on how we understand and characterise epidemic dynamics, e.g., when estimating the final size of a seasonal epidemic, or when calculating optimal vaccination policy. As such, careful analysis of high-quality data, estimating both population susceptibility and
