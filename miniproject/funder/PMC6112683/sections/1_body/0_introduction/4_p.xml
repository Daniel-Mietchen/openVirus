<p>Effective modelling of influenza dynamics is further complicated by the paucity and quality of available data. Influenza is difficult to identify clinically; patients presenting with influenza-like symptoms may have influenza (

To determine the actual cause of these symptoms requires a (relatively expensive) test, which may be appropriate for an at-risk individual presenting serious symptoms at a hospital but is unlikely to be necessary for an otherwise healthy individual in the 15–45 age group (for example). In addition, patients may be asymptomatic (while potentially still able to infect others), or those with mild symptoms may choose not to seek medical treatment at all. So, confirmed cases are likely to be only a subset of actual cases, with poor “denominator data”. The hierarchical observation process that links population level epidemic dynamics to observed confirmed cases (
