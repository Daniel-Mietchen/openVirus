<p>Influenza has been widely studied, through both experimental studies on animal models such as ferrets (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), and modelling studies based on data from human populations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the way influenza spreads within populations. Model-based analyses depend on the underlying assumptions and available data, and knowledge gaps exist that may be difficult or impossible to test using animal models (e.g., for seasonal influenza, long-term patterns of immunity through and across many seasons). Parameter estimation can also be challenging. For example, a key epidemic parameter is the basic reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, which is defined using a completely susceptible population. However, in practice few populations are likely to be completely susceptible, and so estimates are instead of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>, the effective reproduction number [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To determine 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> itself, it is necessary to also have an estimate of the proportion of individuals that are susceptible at the beginning of an outbreak. Unfortunately, estimating the initial susceptible proportion is close to impossible in practice, given the complexity of immunity and interactions between strains. Immunity to a strain may vary substantially between individuals with similar infection or vaccination histories [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and the life course of antibodies and interactions between antibodies to different strains is complex [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The rapid evolution and multi-strain nature of influenza means that individuals may have variable immune responses to different strains, particularly in the presence of complex phenomena such as “antigenic seniority” [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], whereby individuals have increased long-term immunity to the first strain they were exposed to during their lifetime. Recent evidence suggests that there may be some level of immunity existing in populations even to novel influenza strains with pandemic potential [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The presence of antibodies in an individual, particularly at low levels, may not prevent reinfection but may reduce the chance of infection when challenged or lead to a milder or asymptomatic illness [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Further, many historical studies have relied on serological data as a means of determining if influenza infection occurred (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). However, the results of serological studies can vary substantially based on the criteria used [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and produce estimates that are vastly different from active surveillance of symptomatic cases (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]), and the relationships between antibodies and immunity is not completely understood [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
