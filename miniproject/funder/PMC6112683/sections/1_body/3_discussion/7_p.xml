<p>It is difficult to be certain of the impact of particular assumptions on parameter estimates, given the complex interactions between parameters. It is possible that, combined, these modelling assumptions could have contributed to higher-than-expected posterior estimates of

The present study does not claim to provide a definitive answer, rather it should inspire further research with high-quality datasets and careful analysis that at least considers a full range of plausible priors, and that considers interactions between parameters rather than marginal estimates.
