<p>Observing potentially high transmissibility alongside lower susceptibility for seasonal influenza supports the idea that population susceptibility, rather than increased transmission, is the primary factor differentiating influenza strains with pandemic potential at a particular time from strains exhibiting routine seasonal circulation. The H1N1pdm09 strain that emerged and caused a pandemic in 2009 provides a specific example: when we fit parameters to this same strain in 2011 and 2013, it had relatively low levels of population susceptibility, and therefore routine, seasonal epidemics. It is likely that the difference between the circulation of the strain in 2009 and later years is due to differences in population susceptibility: because there were no similar strains circulating prior to 2009, a large proportion of the population (and specifically, anyone born after the most recent pandemic of a similar strain, in the late 1970s) was effectively naive, or only protected by cross-immunity. A confounding observation is that many estimates of

 </sub> during pandemic seasons have fallen in the range 1.0-2.0 [

There are myriad reasons which could contribute to lower than expected estimates of transmissibility in a pandemic. The most critical factor is that, while population susceptibility is increased relative to seasonal circulation, there remains some level of immunity within populations, particularly in older age cohorts, either due to previous exposure to similar strains or cross-immunity with other strains [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). It is also important to note that novel strains (e.g., transmitted from animal hosts) require the capacity to spread in humans, in addition to novelty and sufficient population susceptibility, before they can induce a pandemic [
