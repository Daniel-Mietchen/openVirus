<p>An understanding of seasonal influenza transmission is of critical public health concern, however effective inference can be constrained by the availability of high-quality data. In this study, we have used confirmed, multi-year virological data from a primary care surveillance network to perform model parameterisation for seasonal influenza in New South Wales, Australia. Making minimal assumptions around parameter values, we observe strong posterior relationships between

 <sub>0</sub> and population susceptibility, with higher 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values corresponding to lower levels of susceptibility to the circulating strain. These results emphasise the challenges of identifying parameters around susceptibility, transmission, and observation, and highlight the substantial uncertainty that remains in these areas. We encourage caution when making modeling assumptions, choosing priors, and interpreting results, particularly when parameters are related.
