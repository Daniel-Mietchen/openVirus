<p>Seasonal influenza can be a challenging process to characterize given the complex nature of immunity and the inability to discriminate influenza from other respiratory viruses without testing. In this study, we used confirmed virological influenza data, with known denominators, to ensure that the model is specifically based on true influenza cases and the hierarchical observation process is accurate, and modern Bayesian inference techniques, with uninformative, unbounded priors, to ensure that assumptions around these priors did not impact on the resulting parameters estimates. We identified strong posterior relationships between

 <sub>0</sub>, population susceptibility, and the probability an infected individual seeks treatment. The bivariate posterior distribution had maximum density where relatively high 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values correspond with low levels of population susceptibility (while the effective reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> remains within the expected range). This was in sharp contrast to the values that would be obtained by considering only the marginal posterior distribution of each parameter. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the challenges of identifiability in parameter estimates, and in particular the importance of considering immunity alongside transmissibility in modelling studies. While there remains uncertainty around parameter estimates, we encourage researchers to consider carefully the challenges of identifying related parameters, and the impact that strong prior and modeling assumptions can have on parameter estimates.
