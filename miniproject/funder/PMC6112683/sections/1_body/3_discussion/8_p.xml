<p>It is important to emphasise that throughout this study we chose to use general, uninformative priors, in an effort to avoid imposing any strong assumptions around parameter values. A reasonable alternative approach to this would be to use information from the literature to impose informative priors, such as by reducing the prior density for larger values of

 <sub>0</sub>, or making assumptions around population susceptibility. It is possible that informative priors could shift the resulting posterior distributions, and even impact the way that the study is interpreted. We emphasise the importance of carefully considering the priors used for this type of modelling study, and in interrogating how these choices might impact modelling outcomes.
