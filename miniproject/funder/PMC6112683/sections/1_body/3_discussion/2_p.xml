 <sub>0</sub> is the proportion of the population that is initially susceptible. Our results provide an additional line of evidence to reinforce this idea, with the majority of accepted parameter sets having parameters and model states such that

 </inline-formula> (for H1N1pdm2009 seasons), however there was substantial uncertainty in this estimate, with high posterior density across the range 2–10. This is consistent with previously calculated 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values for historic pandemic influenza seasons or within populations that were likely to have high levels of initial susceptibility, such as on the island of Tristan da Cunha in 1971, with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> in the range 3.73–10.69 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The highest extreme of our posterior estimates for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> exceed these estimates (in association with very low population susceptibility), and may be so high as to be implausible outside of unique outbreak scenarios. It is likely that with more data, posterior estimates would become more precise, however given the data available these extreme values cannot be discarded. We also emphasise that in epidemic studies marginal parameter estimates should be considered with caution, as maximum posterior density estimates from marginal distributions are very different to those from bivariate posterior distributions, given the strong nonlinear relationships between key parameters. This is illustrated clearly by comparing Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006377.g004">4</xref> and
