<p>It is important to emphasise that the modelling in this study directly considers confirmed influenza. Such data are not typically directly available, particularly with denominator data. Were it more common to report negative test results (or, test results positive for other respiratory viruses), then alternate data sources of confirmed influenza, such as national notifications databases, would be more valuable and provide higher resolution with which to investigate seasonal influenza.</p>
