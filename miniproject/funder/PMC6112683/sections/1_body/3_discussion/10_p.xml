<p>While high-quality data and modern parametrization methods are helpful, there are limits to what may be reasonably determined using highly filtered weekly data. We are not able to effectively discriminate infectious durations, nor latent periods, and credible intervals on many parameters (e.g., the probability of seeking treatment) were quite broad. It is conceivable that this may be possible with daily data, additional testing, or by incorporating other data sources.</p>
