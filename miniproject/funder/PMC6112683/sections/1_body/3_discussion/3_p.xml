<p>While there may be cases where only the effective reproduction number is important, it is, in our view, generally inappropriate to model a seasonal virus that has underlying immunity within a population without specifically considering that immunity. Doing so could create bias in predictions or model outputs, and, in the worst case, detrimentally affect public health outcomes if or when incorrect parameter estimates are used to inform resource allocation or vaccination strategies. For example, it may be more effective to target vaccination resources at individuals or households (or geopolitical regions) with higher likelihoods of susceptibility based on infection history in previous years. This likely differs from the optimal strategies if underlying immunity is ignored. Forecasting in the presence of mutation or antigenic drift is also of concern, with model assumptions likely to lead to vastly differing predictions particularly when made based on limited data at the start of a potential pandemic. Moreover, confusion over estimates may lead to problems when making comparisons between diseases. In every case, researchers should critically consider the modeling assumptions being made and the impact that they may have on parameter estimates and subsequent analyses.</p>
