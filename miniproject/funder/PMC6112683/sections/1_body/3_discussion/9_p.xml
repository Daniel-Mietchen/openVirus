<p>A key limitation of this study is that we considered each of the study years to have only a single circulating influenza strain, which disregards the low levels of circulation of other strains that did occur. The impact of the circulation of these other strains, even at low levels, could potentially bias parameter estimates. Constructing distinct models for the different strains means that we could not use these models to understand cross-immunity between strains. Models that consider multiple strains and their interactions, or asymptomatic infections, would be ideal, but parametrizing these more realistic models is likely to be very challenging without both a better epidemiological understanding of how immunity and cross-immunity between strains works, and high resolution data including these strains. A further critical limitation of this work is that we did not consider population turnover or age structure. Age structure plays a key role in immunity, treatment-seeking behaviour, and transmission between individuals. By not including age structure, we necessarily assume that individuals mix homogenenously with age, that immunity is uniform across ages and wanes consistently, and that vaccination coverage is uniform across age groups: all of which are known to be incorrect assumptions. Future work should seek to include age structure in models such as this, while seeking to ensure that the available data and computation resources are sufficient to effectively fit additional parameters. It is likely that to produce detailed models with cross-immunity and age structure, a detailed longitudinal cohort study would be required, including regular sampling of multiple types (e.g., serology and virology) and potentially movement or contact tracing. Existing studies such as the Fluscape cohort study [
