<p>By using models aggregated at a state level, without any age- or spatial- structuring, we make a number of simplifying assumptions. Specifically, we lose the ability to model heterogeneity in mixing and thus infection rates, vaccination coverage, immunity, or case ascertainment. We know that these factors should, in reality, be heterogeneous, as there is strong evidence for variations based on (in particular) age structure [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006377.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the data we have access to are unfortunately too sparse to effectively parametrize models at this fine level of detail. In some cases, this may introduce some degree of bias. For example, newborn children entering the population are necessarily susceptible, and by not tracking demographics we may overestimate the rate at which immunity wanes (i.e., underestimate the duration of immunity), which could potentially have some impact on estimates of other parameters, including
