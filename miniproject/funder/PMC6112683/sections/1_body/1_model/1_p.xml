<p>We chose to use an SEIRS-type model, with an Erlang-2 infectious period and exponential exposed and immune times, to model seasonal influenza (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006377.g003">Fig 3</xref>), which is consistent with known influenza biology. In this form of model, we track the number of individuals in the population who are susceptible (S), exposed but not yet infectious (E), infectious (I), or recovered and immune from reinfection (R) at any time. We include an observed class (O) to allow individuals to choose to seek treatment, or not. Note we allow immunity to wane, so that individuals return from the recovered class to the susceptible class, and include external importation of cases at a low rate. Transition events are stochastic, with rates that depend on the number of individuals in each class, and fitted parameters that relate to the epidemiology of the disease. We fit the initial proportion of individuals that are susceptible to the strain circulating in the given season as a parameter, and model seasons that had the same predominant circulating strain together, i.e., 2011 and 2013 both had predominantly H1N1pdm09 circulating, so we fit these seasons to have the same epidemic parameters, but each with a separate initial population susceptibility. The presence of an exposed class in the chosen model indicates that there is some lag between when an individual is exposed to the disease, and when they become infectious. We assume that they are not symptomatic during this exposed period. This is consistent with many existing models and known influenza epidemiology [
