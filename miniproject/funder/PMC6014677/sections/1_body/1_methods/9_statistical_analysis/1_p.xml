<p>ZIKV positivity and mean VL levels, along with standard deviations (SD; error bars), were calculated and graphed in R Statistical Software V.3.4.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Duration of RNA detection was determined based on the maximum number of days duration of ZIKV RNA detection for each bodily fluid, where the days were based on symptom onset (see calculation of days post-symptom onset under the “Definitions” section above). The sample size for each time-point (listed by bodily fluid in table below graph) was based on days post-symptom onset. Several time-points had few samples due to variation of days post-symptom onset at which the participants were enrolled. The first time-point of 5 surveillance index cases and 4 ZIKV rRT-PCR-positive contacts with no symptoms were excluded from the ZIKV positivity and VL analysis due to missing VL data and day of symptom onset information, respectively. Further, an extreme outlier for urine VL was excluded (8 days post-symptom onset, 8.9 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml). Percent positivity was defined as the percent of positive samples at specified days post-symptom onset for each bodily fluid.
