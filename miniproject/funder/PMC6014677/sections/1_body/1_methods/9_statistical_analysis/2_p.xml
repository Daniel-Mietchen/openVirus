<p>The symptomatic infection rate attributable to ZIKV infection for the contacts (n = 109) was calculated by subtracting the percent of ZIKV-negative contacts with ZIKV-associated symptoms (12/72 = 17%) from the percent of ZIKV-positive contacts with ZIKV-associated symptoms (14/37 = 38%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] in the context of a general estimating equations (GEE) model to identify associations between risk factors and contacts being positive for ZIKV infection by either rRT-PCR and/or IgM ELISA. The GEE model accounts for clustering due to the household-based study design. An exchangeable correlation structure was assumed, and confidence intervals were calculated using a robust (sandwich) variance estimator. The following were considered risk factors of interest for ZIKV infection: sex, age, household size, water faucet location outside of the house, on-site water storage, and recognizing mosquito larvae or pupae (all binary). Lack of variation in the study population precluded meaningful analysis of fumigation, abatement use, trash collection services, water services and repellent use reports. Potential confounders were assessed based on a literature-informed directed acyclic graph (DAG; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006518.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Due to the small sample size and minimal variation of the confounders among participants, the multivariate analysis was adjusted for a single SES proxy indicator; namely owning a refrigerator. All analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). The map was constructed in ArcGIS ArcMap V.10.3 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands CA).
