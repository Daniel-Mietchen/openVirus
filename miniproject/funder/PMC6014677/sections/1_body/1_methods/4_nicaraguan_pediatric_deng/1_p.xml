<p>The ongoing PDCS, which served as the parent study, was established in Managua in 2004 and follows ~3,700 2-to-14 year-old children who reside in the HCSFV catchment area. The HCSFV provides health care to all study participants. Acute-phase (days 1–5 since symptom onset) and convalescent-phase (days 14–21) blood, saliva, and urine samples are collected from suspected dengue, chikungunya, and Zika cases, along with clinical information. Suspected dengue or chikungunya cases are patients with fever (or feverish) and two or more of the following symptoms: headache, retroocular pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, positive tourniquet test and/or leukopenia. Acute-phase serum samples are tested for ZIKV, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) simultaneously using a multiplex rRT-PCR assay [
