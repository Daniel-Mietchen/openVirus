<p>RNA was extracted from 140 ul of blood, 200 ul of urine, or 200 ul of saliva specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and amplified using the ZCD rRT-PCR assay targeting ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Testing was performed on an ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in 25-ul reactions of the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with 5 ul of RNA template, performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Each plate was processed with negative and positive controls for ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV. Standard curves were prepared using quantitated ssDNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) containing the target sequences for ZIKV amplification. The concentration of RNA in the eluate (expressed as log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ul) was calculated from the linear regression equation for the standard curve. Viremia in log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/ml was then calculated while accounting for the volume used for extraction. For ZIKV quantitation, a 4-point standard curve (8.0, 6.0, 4.0, and 2.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/Î¼L of eluate) was included on every plate in duplicate. Urine samples from 9 contacts were extracted at higher volumes (1 ml instead of 200 ul) to concentrate the viral RNA. Volume variation was accounted for in the viral load (VL) calculations (
