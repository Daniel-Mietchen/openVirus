<p>Households were surveyed on visit 4 to assess entomological indicators. Water containers and potential breeding sites were inspected, and larvae and pupae were collected, speciated, and enumerated by experts in collaboration with the Department of Entomology at the NVL. Adult mosquitoes were captured in the interior and exterior of the houses using Prokopack backpack aspirators [

 <sup>®</sup> solution (Sigma Aldrich) to stabilize RNA for rRT-PCR analysis, and the homogenate was frozen at -80°C. RNA was extracted from 200 ul of the homogenate using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and analyzed for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV positivity by rRT-PCR (see above).
