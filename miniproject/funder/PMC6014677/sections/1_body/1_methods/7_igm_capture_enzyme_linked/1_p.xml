<p>An in-house single-dilution IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was performed to detect ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies on paired day 1 and day 21 serum/plasma samples. This method is similar to that described for detection of DENV-specific IgM [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or CHIKV-specific IgM [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and was adapted for detection of ZIKV IgM antibodies using a ZIKV envelope (E) domain III-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), ZKA64, kindly donated by D. Corti (Humabs Biomed SA) [

Briefly, wells were coated with goat anti-human IgM antibody overnight and then blocked using 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) diluted in 0.05% PBS-T (1X phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20). Subsequently, antigen produced from ZIKV-infected suckling mouse brain and extracted via the sucrose-acetone method [

Next, a single dilution of samples and controls (1:20) was added in duplicate, followed by anti-ZIKV mAb ZKA64 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After every incubation step, the wells were washed 4–5 times with 0.05% PBS-T. In the final step, 3’3’-5’5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was used to produce a colorimetric reaction that was terminated with 12.5% sulfuric acid. The cut-off was determined as 6.6 times the average of negative controls. All of the samples with absorbance values above the cut-off were considered positive. Evaluation with an extensive panel of Zika, dengue, and negative samples yielded a sensitivity of 94.5% and specificity of 85.6% [
