<p>A suspected Zika case, whether captured from the PDCS or from national surveillance, was defined as a patient presenting with rash and one or more of the following symptoms: conjunctivitis, arthralgia, myalgia, and/or peri-articular edema, regardless of fever. A suspected Zika case became a potential index case once a ZIKV infection was confirmed by rRT-PCR in serum, urine and/or saliva.</p>
