<p>During the study period, rRT-PCR-confirmed Zika cases (potential index cases) from either the Nicaraguan PDCS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] or the general population (National Surveillance System) who resided in the Health Center Sócrates Flores Vivas (HCSFV) catchment area were visited at their homes. The HCSFV catchment area consists of 17 neighborhoods within District II of Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua. Index cases (n = 33), along with all household members willing to participate in the study (contacts, n = 109), were enrolled into this study during the first household visit (day 1). Questionnaires were administered at the first visit and at subsequent visits on days 3–4 (visit 2), 6–7 (visit 3), 9–10 (visit 4), and 21 (visit 5), regardless of ZIKV infection status. The household questionnaire, addressing home-specific characteristics, was administered to the head of the household at the first home visit, and the individual questionnaire, addressing demographic, clinical history and socioeconomic status (SES)-associated factors, was administered to each household member. At each household visit, occurrence of symptoms was investigated by asking each study participant the question “Have you presented with any of the following symptoms?” followed by a list of common Zika symptoms. If a participant reported symptoms, the date of symptom onset and type of symptom(s) were recorded. During the follow-up visits (visits 2–5), the participants were asked to report symptoms since the last visit. Hence, the symptom questionnaire should cover prior occurrence of symptoms at the first visit and symptoms since the previous visit during subsequent follow-up visits. The participants were also asked “Have you been diagnosed with Zika in the past?”, assessing previous symptomatic infections. Blood (serum or plasma), urine, and saliva samples were collected at the visits as detailed in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For the index cases that were PDCS participants (85%, n = 28), the blood collection on the second and the final study visit corresponded to a programmed PDCS visit, and plasma was collected at these two time-points (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For saliva collection, passive drool (minimum 2 ml) was collected into vials. Laboratory testing was performed at the National Virology Laboratory (NVL) of the Ministry of Health in Managua. All household visits were performed between August 31 and October 21 of 2016, which corresponded to the tail end of the national Zika epidemic in 2016.
