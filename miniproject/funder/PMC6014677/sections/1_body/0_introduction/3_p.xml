<p>Household-based index cluster study designs, where household or neighborhood contacts of viremic index cases are recruited [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], allow capture of symptomatic cases immediately at and before symptom onset, as well as capture of asymptomatic infections, household transmission events, geospatial spread of infection, and individual and household risk factors for infection, including entomological risk factors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Additional data on household transmission, the percentage of asymptomatic ZIKV infections, and risk factors for ZIKV infection are essential to inform officials making critical public health decisions targeting prevention of ZIKV transmission; furthermore, little information has been published from Central America. The present index household study was implemented in Managua, Nicaragua, from August 31 to October 21 of 2016 and aimed to investigate household ZIKV transmission, maximum duration of viral RNA detection in bodily fluids, kinetics of ZIKV VL levels in bodily fluids, the symptomatic to asymptomatic (S:A) ratio, and risk factors for ZIKV infection.
