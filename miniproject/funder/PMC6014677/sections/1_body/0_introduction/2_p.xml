<p>Mathematical models suggest that a ZIKV-positive individual can lead to approximately 2–5 additional infections via mosquito transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ZIKV transmission is predominantly mosquito-borne, but sexual transmission has been reported as well [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Salivary transmission has been deemed possible but unlikely [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viral transmission is thought to depend on viral load (VL) in bodily fluids [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; therefore, characterization of ZIKV VL kinetics in different compartments is of great interest. Although ZIKV viremia in humans is relatively low, ZIKV RNA has been detected in blood, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While reported duration of VL in bodily fluids varies greatly, ZIKV RNA measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) has revealed detectable viral RNA up to 76 days post-symptom onset in semen, 29 days in saliva and urine, and 14 days in vaginal secretions and serum [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. With the exception of one publication reporting detectable viral RNA in whole blood up to day 81 post-symptom onset [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], ZIKV was shed the longest in semen [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Symptomatic ZIKV infection has been associated with fever, conjunctivitis, rash, myalgia, arthralgia/arthritis, headache and fatigue, though fever may not always be present [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Estimates of asymptomatic ZIKV infections range from 27% to 82% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], though more studies are needed.
