<p>It is known that water storage containers, present mostly due to intermittent water supply, create mosquito breeding sites and thus increase risk of virus transmission [

Entomological visits conducted on Yap Island during the Zika outbreak in 2007 found that 87% of the surveyed households had larvae- or pupae-infested water containers, although no viral RNA was detected in mosquitoes and/or immature stages [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> captured during the entomological visits were positive for ZIKV RNA. However, these results could have been affected by the intensive government vector control activities (fumigation and abatement) implemented concurrently with the study. Although analysis of Zika-positive households and entomological indicators revealed no significant associations, 52% of the households were positive for both ZIKV-infected residents and the presence of mosquitoes, larvae and/or pupae.
