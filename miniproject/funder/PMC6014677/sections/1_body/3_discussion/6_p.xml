<p>In conclusion, our ZIKV household study found that the majority of homes had â‰¥50% of Zika-positive members, demonstrating that ZIKV transmission was widespread among the enrolled households in urban Managua. Further, an S:A ratio of 14:23 (1:1.6) was estimated among the contacts, indicating that 62% of the infections were asymptomatic, thus contributing to silent transmission. Finally, the maximum number of days during which ZIKV RNA was detected was 7 days post-symptom onset in saliva and serum/plasma and 22 days in urine. Detecting ZIKV in saliva over a similar time period and concentration as serum/plasma indicates that saliva could potentially serve as a more accessible diagnostic sample. These findings provide information about detection of viral RNA, thus informing strategies for ZIKV detection in bodily fluids. The study also estimated urban ZIKV dissemination along with percent asymptomatic infections, assessing likelihood of silent transmission. Overall, the findings presented inform public health decision-making about Zika interventions, diagnostic methods and strategies, and vector control activities in Nicaragua, the region and globally.</p>
