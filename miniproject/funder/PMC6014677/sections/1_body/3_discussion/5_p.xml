<p>A major strength of the study was the number of visits per household– 5 visits in a time span of 21 days—that enabled close monitoring of the duration of ZIKV RNA detection and symptoms. The study also experienced several limitations. The Nicaraguan Zika epidemic lasted from June to October of 2016, with peak incidence in July and August. Hence, the present study was conducted during the tail end of the epidemic, which is likely the reason that few transmission events were captured. Because of the antigenic relatedness of flaviviruses, particularly DENV and ZIKV, the IgM ELISA can potentially display cross-reactivity between ZIKV- and DENV-induced antibodies. However, comprehensive evaluation of the in-house MAC-ELISA with an extensive panel of specimens yielded a sensitivity of 94.5% and specificity of 85.6% when compared to rRT-PCR-confirmed Zika or dengue cases and flavivirus-naïve individuals, respectively. While specificity could not be analyzed in this study, the in-house IgM ELISA captured all rRT-PCR-confirmed index cases, indicating excellent sensitivity. Furthermore, no DENV infections were detected by rRT-PCR in this study and the concurrent parent cohort study, suggesting that potential false-positive Zika IgM results due to cross-reactivity were unlikely. Finally, symptomatic Zika cases may have been erroneously categorized as asymptomatic, due to recall bias. However, as a whole, the questionnaires were likely to capture previous Zika-associated symptoms since: (i) of 23 cases that were ZIKV-positive at enrollment, 6 (rRT-PCR-negative IgM-positive) did report Zika-related symptoms; (ii) symptoms such as arthralgia may be persistent and re-occurring [
