<p>This investigation of ZIKV household transmission enabled determination of the S:A ratio, duration of detectable ZIKV RNA, kinetics of ZIKV VL in bodily fluids, and risk factors for ZIKV infection. The index cluster study design enables capture of asymptomatic infections, since symptom data are actively sought, in this case approximately every 3–4 days for the first 9–10 days and then again 11–12 days later. We calculated an S:A ratio of 1:1.6, corresponding to 62% asymptomatic ZIKV infections, which is consistent with published studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). These findings, along with our detection of relatively high serum VL before symptom onset, imply that asymptomatic infection is an important factor in ZIKV transmission. Further, our study found that 61% of the households had contacts with ZIKV infection, with an average of 1.9 (range 1–6) positive contacts per household. In 60% of the households, ≥50% of the members were positive for ZIKV infection. Thus, the majority of the households and the majority of household members of the ZIKV-positive index cases were positive for ZIKV infection, suggesting that ZIKV transmission was widespread among the enrolled households in urban Managua, Nicaragua.
