<p>In our analysis, all index cases that had initial saliva samples (n = 26) would have been captured as ZIKV rRT-PCR-positive with acute saliva samples only. Furthermore, saliva and serum/plasma had similar mean VL levels and mean days of ZIKV detection. Other studies detected ZIKV RNA more frequently in saliva than in serum samples, while the mean number of days duration from symptom onset was the same (3.5 days) [

Hence, saliva, an accessible and non-invasive sample, may be an underrated and feasible diagnostic specimen for ZIKV rRT-PCR testing in suspected symptomatic cases, although it does not extend the window of detection beyond that of serum or whole blood [
