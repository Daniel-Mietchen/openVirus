<p>Despite the modest number of rRT-PCR confirmed ZIKV infections captured (33 index cases and 11 contacts), a total of 522 bodily fluid samples were processed by rRT-PCR (105 serum/plasma, 206 saliva, and 212 urine,

All 44 rRT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infections were positive at the entry visit: 13 (29%) were positive for ZIKV RNA in urine and saliva; 11 (25%) were positive in serum and saliva; 10 (23%) in serum only; 5 (11%) in urine only; 2 (5%) in serum, saliva and urine; 2 (5%) in saliva only; and 1 (2%) in serum and urine. Percent positivity (see

Among rRT-PCR-positive subjects with Zika-associated symptoms, the maximum number of days duration of ZIKV RNA detection was 7 days post-symptom onset in serum/plasma and saliva and 22 days in urine (
