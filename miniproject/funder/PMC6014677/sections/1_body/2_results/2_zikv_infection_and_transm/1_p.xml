<p>Serum/plasma, urine, and saliva samples were collected from index cases and contacts during a total of 165 household visits (5 visits to 33 households, see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and analyzed by molecular and serological assays as described in the Methods section. At enrollment, 34 contacts (31%) were positive for ZIKV infection, of which 11 (32%) were acutely infected (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 7 rRT-PCR-positive only and 4 rRT-PCR- and IgM-positive). The remaining 23 (68%) were positive by IgM only, indicating a recent ZIKV infection. The majority of the cases that were ZIKV-positive at enrollment were 15 years or older (n = 22, 65%) and female (n = 24, 71%). Three ZIKV incident infections were captured by IgM seroconversion among the contacts who were initially Zika-naïve, two of whom were 15 years or older and one female. The three seroconversions were located in different households. Overall, a total of 37 (34%) positive contacts were identified during the study period, 34 at enrollment and 3 post-enrollment, corresponding to 20 households. Hence, 20 households (61%) recorded ZIKV-infected contacts, with an average of 1.9 positives per household (±1.4, range: 1–6) among enrolled household members (
