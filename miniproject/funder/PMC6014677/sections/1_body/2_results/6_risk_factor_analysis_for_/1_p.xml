<p>All households reported abatement of water containers with Temephos in and around the household. A total of 29 (88%) households reported Temephos being deposited four times per year (abatement), and all households reported fumigation. The Ministry of Health provided these vector control measures at no cost. All households reported regular trash collection service, and only 12% (n = 4) reported having problems with regular water supply, thus precluding meaningful analysis. Repellent use was rare, with only 8% (n = 9) reporting use; 5 female and 4 male. Sex, age (being ≥15 years old), household size (≥4 contacts in a household), having a water faucet located outside of the house, and recognizing mosquito larvae or pupae were not statistically associated with ZIKV infection (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The risk of being ZIKV-positive among those who reported storing water on site, adjusted for owning a refrigerator (SES indicator), was 2.32 (95%CI: 1.26, 4.28) times the risk of being ZIKV-positive among those who reported not storing water, across households.
