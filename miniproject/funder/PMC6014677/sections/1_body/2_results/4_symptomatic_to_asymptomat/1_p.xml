<p>On average, the symptomatic index and contact cases (n = 40) were enrolled 2.2 days post-symptom onset (±1.5, range -1 to 7). Among the 37 Zika-positive contacts, 14 were symptomatic (38%), while 12 of 72 ZIKV-negative contacts reported similar symptoms (17%), resulting in a 21% symptomatic infection rate attributable to ZIKV infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref>). Among the 14 symptomatic Zika-positive contacts (7 rRT-PCR and 7 IgM-positive, see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the following Zika-associated symptoms were recorded: rash (57%), arthralgia (43%), fever (36%) and headache (29%). While conjunctivitis was listed on the symptom questionnaire, it was not reported by any of the Zika cases. These results are consistent with the parent PDCS cohort, where only 6% of Zika cases reported conjunctivitis during the epidemic. Several other symptoms, such as cough, shivers, difficulty breathing, ophthalmoplegia, nausea, and pruritus were reported (

Of the 23 asymptomatic ZIKV-positive contacts, 4 were rRT-PCR- and IgM-positive, and 19 were positive by serology only (
