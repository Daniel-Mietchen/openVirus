<p>A total of 33 symptomatic rRT-PCR ZIKV-positive index cases were enrolled between August 31 and October 21 of 2016 (

The Ministry of Health prioritized Zika diagnosis for pregnant women upon symptom onset due to the known congenital risk factors. A total of 109 contacts, including two pregnant women, were enrolled at the first household visit from the 33 households, corresponding to a total of 142 participants. While all subjects approached agreed to participate in the study and there was no loss to follow-up, a total of 85 household members (37%) who were reported to be living in the respective home by the head of the household, but were not at home during the enrollment visit, were not interviewed or enrolled (

One enrolled contact did not answer the individual questionnaire but fulfilled the other study requirements, including the symptom questionnaire and sample donation. The number of enrolled contacts per household ranged from 1 to 7, with an average of 3.3 ± SD of 1.6. The average age of index cases and contacts was 11.4 (±7.8, range 2–37) and 30.7 (±20.6, range 1–79) years, respectively (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006518.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The index cases tended to be younger since the majority were PDCS participants. Both index cases and contacts were 70% female. The heads of the 33 enrolled households reported little variation with respect to SES-associated household characteristics: 100% reported zinc as the roof material; 100% reported to be the house owners; 97% (n = 32) reported the house floor material to be concrete, brick, and/or ceramic tiles, and only one reported a dirt floor; none reported owning an air conditioner; and 67% (n = 22) reported owning a refrigerator.
