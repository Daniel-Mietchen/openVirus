<p>As the global health community braces itself for the next Ebola- or Zika-like pandemic and sets new milestones in accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, we must not lose sight of the basics: Africa’s communicable disease burden—and consequently our world’s—will persist until we commit to getting the diagnosis right the first time. As attention turns to non-communicable diseases in the Global South in recognition of these nations’ double burden of disease [

Contemporary neglect of communicable disease epidemiology in SSA is perhaps best captured in comments from Wilber Downs during his Thirty-Sixth Annual Theobald Smith Memorial Lecture at the New York Society of Tropical Medicine in 1974, despite four decades of medical advances:

  <p>Whose responsibility is it to engage in such a program? Certainly the local governments have prime responsibility, backed up by the World Health Organization for necessary inter-regional studies. Interested foreign governments, mission groups, and foundations, it is to be hoped, will provide backing, as they have done in the past. But I cannot permit myself to be optimistic. At this time what is being done by all parties combined to improve the situation with respect to the diagnosis of infectious diseases in Africa is utterly inadequate [
