<p>Misdiagnosis of febrile illness persists as an understudied health problem in SSA, while global focus on malaria eradication has bred a malaria-industrial complex that diverts resources from more common sources of acute fever, especially in urban areas. Rates of malaria misdiagnosis are exacerbated by limited health care resources, clinician and patient perceptions of fever, and limited community knowledge of disease ecology. A socio-environmental approach to febrile illness would help overcome many social and clinical barriers to effective diagnosis and patient management.</p>
