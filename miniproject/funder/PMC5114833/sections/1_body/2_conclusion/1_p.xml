<p>A socio-environmental approach to acute febrile illness etiology, diagnostics, and management provides several opportunities for integrated research into: (1) scalability of recent advances in diagnostic technology both in the lab and field; (2) geo-demographic and socio-environmental correlates of specific communicable diseases that contribute to SSAâ€™s febrile illness burden; (3) the environmental and human behavioral drivers of vector breeding, as well as assessing integrated vector management techniques that have been successfully deployed in other tropical urban contexts; and (4) the testing of various community-level educational and behavioral interventions related to febrile illness knowledge and care-seeking, particularly given the matrix of caregivers (family, pharmacists, physicians, traditional healers, etc.) available within relatively close proximity in any large sub-Saharan African city. Toward these ends, we summarize some proposed key solutions ranging from clinical to institutional scales:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Renew the focus on differential diagnosis in tropical medicine and public health training;</p>

   <p>Pilot the reallocation of malaria-related health care resources in low-transmission urban settings to support febrile illness diagnostics (which includes malaria);</p>

   <p>Encourage local and international funding agencies to prioritize health worker training and laboratory diagnostic capacity.</p>
