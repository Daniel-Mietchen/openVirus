<p>Global funding for malaria alone reached US$2.7 billion in 2013, a threefold increase from 2005 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], amid calls by leading malaria research institutions to further scale up funding of malaria control programs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that investments would have to grow to US$6.4 billion by 2020, and US$8.7 billion by 2030 to achieve its global target for a 90% reduction in malaria transmission [

 <italic>de facto</italic> presumptive diagnosis for patients experiencing acute febrile illness (AFI), a category that encompasses half of clinical visits in many SSA nations. Successful malaria control efforts have lowered malaria transmission in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] to the point where bacterial and viral pathogens now drive AFI in the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. But the global burden of AFI remains unknown due to limited focus on fever, and estimating this burden is ridden with challenges [
