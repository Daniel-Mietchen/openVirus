This is similar to the One Health approach, which recognizes the interconnectedness of humans, animals, and the environment, but with a greater emphasis on the social context within which these actors produce effects on health within social-ecological systems [

This paper argues that the global health community needs to convene interdisciplinary groups of experts to embrace an integrated approach for AFI, and offers Ghana as a case study to highlight the obstacles to developing a more comprehensive focus on communicable disease diagnostics across SSA. Malaria is certainly still an important problem in many parts of the world, but malaria control strategies could be far more targeted and efficient if we had a better handle on febrile illness etiology. In the meantime, West Africa—given its growth rate and depletion in capacity following the Ebola epidemic—will continue to be a frontline for a host of neglected tropical diseases that continue to be misdiagnosed as malaria and remain untreated.
