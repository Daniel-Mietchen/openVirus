<p>While malaria’s landscape ecology has traditionally been rural, the typical SSA capital has experienced persistent annual urban growth rates of 5–6% driven largely by rural-to-urban migration, with some cities growing in excess of 10% annually, implying population doubling every decade [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; and model optimal deployment of these intervention strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In resource-constrained SSA, a region on pace for the world’s highest rates of population growth over the next half-century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], most febrile illnesses are still presumptively treated as malaria despite growing evidence that, especially in urban contexts, malaria is probably not a major problem. Yet the global health and development communities remain disproportionately focused on malaria control, which often results in an outpouring of funds into preventative consumables and management with relatively little measurement and evaluation. Despite having the best of intentions, this creates a cycle of policy and monetary relationships between international donors, local government, and national malaria control programs that we call the “malaria-industrial complex.”
