<p>But we also need to improve our understanding of how patients and clinicians perceive AFI, craft targeted educational messages—which integrate our vector ecology findings—for both the public and clinicians, integrate new diagnostic heuristics into clinical practice, and measure the heuristic’s effectiveness. Many social, economic, and institutional factors are associated with the propensity for seeking care for AFI. Previous work in Tanzania showed that AFI patients did not necessarily pressure clinicians into issuing a malaria diagnosis, and that malaria over-diagnosis may have been attributable to a mismatch between patient expectations and clinician perceptions [

Clinicians, on the other hand, were subject to pressures from their initial malaria-centric training, their peers, and perceived patient expectations, in addition to having shared rationales about malaria being easier and more socially acceptable to diagnose [
