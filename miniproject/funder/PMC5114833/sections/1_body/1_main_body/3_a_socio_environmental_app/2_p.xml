<p>We need to return to public health basics: community-level surveillance coupled with rigorous assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to febrile illnesses, an approach that has been used in Ghana in a variety of malaria-related studies [

Many rich geographic data sets have been used in previous works on health, poverty, and place in Accra, including georeferenced census data, land cover data derived from satellite imagery, water and other infrastructure availability, and household health data, including self-reported malaria (i.e. a proxy for febrile illness) [

Practitioners can leverage prior research on characterization of urban neighborhoods to produce high-resolution risk maps of environmental risk factors such as vector species. Traditional epidemiological methods can link environmental factors, demographic characteristics, health behaviors, and hallmark symptoms with confirmed diagnoses. These are precisely the tools used in outbreak investigations, though many SSA nations still have underfunded surveillance systems that hamper timely outbreak detection and response, particularly in those West African nations whose clinical and public health infrastructures were devastated by Ebola in 2015 [

The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework, adopted by the WHO African Regional Office for Africa in 1998, aims to improve detection and response by public health managers and decision-makers in African nations and shows great promise for strengthening surveillance systems. But IDSR has not been a panacea, as a recent implementation in northern Ghana has been fraught with “low priority for surveillance, ill-equipped laboratories, rare supervision and missing feedback” [
