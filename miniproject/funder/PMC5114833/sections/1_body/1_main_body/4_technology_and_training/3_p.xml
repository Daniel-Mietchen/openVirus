<p>In Ghana, active learning approaches that engage clinicians with the medical literature and local research teams have previously been associated with improved clinical practices in malaria care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. But efforts to improve the training of Ghanaian health care workers with regard to AFI are subject to a variety of socio-cultural considerations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. For example, a recent trial in rural Ghana demonstrated that the introduction of RDTs in absence of microscopy can substantially reduce malaria over-diagnosis and over-prescription of anti-malarials, but that there is limited impact where microscopy already exists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. But these modern nuances in care are mediated by historical difficulties deploying trained and motivated staff in all regions of Ghana [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Patient perceptions may also influence diagnosis of febrile illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. An evidenced-based approach to febrile illness thus requires a nimble health education component that motivates and empowers health care workers and patients alike to value differential diagnosis of AFI. Greater community member awareness of malaria transmission has been associated with better adherence to vector control interventions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>], and we can leverage these lessons toward proper management of fever. A prototype for febrile-illness-related health communication is currently being piloted as a “Test and Treat” campaign in Nigeria by a group called Support to National Malaria Programme (SuNMaP).
