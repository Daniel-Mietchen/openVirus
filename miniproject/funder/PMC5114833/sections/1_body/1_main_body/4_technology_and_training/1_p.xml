<p>Many RDTs for tropical infections are new, and some have not yet been rigorously tested in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. There remain unknown issues of cross-reactivity among bacterial and viral families, which has remained a problem around the world among flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Cross-reactivity has been observed between dengue and both chikungunya and leptospirosis, as well as in some malaria-positive patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Molecular methods do not have these limitations, but the cost and technical and logistical expertise associated with such methods currently limit rapid deployment and geographically-scalable solutions to differential diagnosis. Commercial serology kits, RDTs, and innovative point-of-care diagnostic products are more suitable, but require ongoing characterization of cross-reactivity as our knowledge of communicable disease epidemiology grows. Fortunately, some new RDT products have demonstrated better sensitivity and specificity than microscopy when compared to DNA-based polymerase chain reaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Other innovations, such as TaqMan array cards that can simultaneously detect dozens of pathogens at a time in less than three hours, show promise as screening tools during outbreak investigations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. New mobile and handheld technology also has the potential to transform diagnostic accuracy. Recent trials of tablet-based diagnostic algorithms have vastly improved AFI diagnosis and pushed antibiotic prescription rates—which are largely driven by anti-malarials—from 84 to 15.4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Mobile devices show promise for improving the management of childhood fevers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], particularly with electronic versions of WHO’s Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy [
