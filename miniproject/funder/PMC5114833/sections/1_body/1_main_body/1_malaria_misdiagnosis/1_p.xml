<p>Malaria misdiagnosis receives little attention but remains a common problem throughout SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with a greater burden on poor communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In high-transmission, low-resource settings, health care facilities have historically depended on clinical algorithms for malaria case management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A clinical algorithm will indicate a diagnosis of malaria given a defined set of predictor symptoms and signs such as intermittent fever, chills, and an enlarged liver and spleen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. But because the symptoms of non-severe malaria resemble those of most AFI, clinical algorithms for malaria typically result in fewer true-negatives and a higher rate of false-positives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], thus impeding differential diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Because the presence of fever is often presumptively treated as malaria, even when malaria may not be circulating [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the true burden of diseases such as typhoid, influenza, and dengue fever are likely understated in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This was a contributing factor in WHO’s 2010 revision to malaria care guidelines to recommend confirmation of all suspected malaria cases by parasitological test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Yet even where evidence-based guidelines exist for malaria diagnosis, health care provider adherence to guidelines can be problematic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].
