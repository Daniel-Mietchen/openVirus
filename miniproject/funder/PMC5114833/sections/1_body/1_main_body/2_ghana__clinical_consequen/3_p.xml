<p>Dengue exposure with probable local transmission was recently demonstrated in Ghana [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The study tested archived plasma samples from 218 children aged 2–14 years who tested positive for malaria at local health facilities in three Ghanaian cities, and found previous dengue exposure in 21.6% and recent exposure in 3.2% of the children sampled. Notably, this study screened the opposite population—lab-confirmed malaria patients—whom we would not normally evaluate for other sources of infection. Therefore there is a real possibility of dengue infections (and potentially other arbovirus infections) in malaria-negative febrile illness patients, which highlights the complexity of febrile illness in Ghana. These findings are most certainly just the tip of the iceberg for communicable disease epidemiology in Ghana, and across SSA. But clinical revelations must be complemented by advances in environmental and community health.
