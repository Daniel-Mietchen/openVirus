<p>Insect disease vectors thrive in Ghana’s urban areas—and likewise in most SSA nations—due to poor sanitation infrastructure, regular rainy seasons, widespread household water storage due to limited drinking water availability, and low public awareness of vector control behaviors. Among the most important mosquito vectors are 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti,</italic> the primary vector for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever, and 
 <italic>Culex spp</italic>, vectors for several diseases including West Nile virus, filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Entomological surveys have documented 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in West Africa for over one hundred years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and the entomological literature relating to arboviral diseases in Ghana is decades old [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Dengue fever, for example, does not appear in the Ghanaian medical literature until the 21st century even though dengue was reported in seven West African nations with a mortality rate of about 5% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has reappeared in mosquito surveys for over fifty years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The breeding density and biting behavior of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were found to be sufficient for facilitating an outbreak of dengue in four northern Ghanaian communities over a decade ago, though flaviviruses had still not been isolated from mosquito catches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The last mosquito survey of Accra published in the scientific literature, conducted in 2003, reaffirmed the presence of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, but focused on just six communities [
