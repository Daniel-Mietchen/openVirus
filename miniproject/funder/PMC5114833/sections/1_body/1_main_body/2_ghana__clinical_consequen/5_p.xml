 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are the most common mosquitoes of public health importance documented in Accra due to their ability to breed in highly polluted water found in sewers and discharge basins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> will also breed alongside 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in man-made containers and pockets of rainwater that collect in refuse piles. Accra’s historical potable water shortages and subsequent municipal water rationing induce widespread household water storage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], which in turn exacerbate the breeding of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes by amplifying the number and density of urban breeding sites. In contrast, Ghana’s primary malaria vector, 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, is a traditionally rural pest which prefers clean, still or slow-moving water near vegetation as is typically found in irrigation canals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> may be adapting to polluted water in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], but the solid waste problem has never been demonstrated to provide enough 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> breeding habitat to support malaria transmission relative to the heightened risk for viral infections posed by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> or 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes.
