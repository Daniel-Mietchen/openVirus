<p>Ghanaian clinical staff nationwide were found to be diagnosing approximately nearly half of sick children (and nearly 40% of all outpatients) with malaria, with fewer than a third of diagnoses confirmed 
 <italic>via</italic> microscopy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. From 2001 to 2006, 47% of outpatient facility visits by children in Accra—and 37% of adult visits—resulted in a clinical malaria diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The same study also highlighted how rainfall over the prior two months was a significant predictor of malaria morbidity. We have long understood the association between rainfall, mosquito breeding, and malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and this has contributed toward the institutionalized view that seasonal spikes in fevers during rainy seasons are primarily attributable to malaria. While this is true, rainfall amplifies many other mosquitoes of public health importance such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, as well as water-borne and water-washed pathogens when flood waters breach inadequate sanitation infrastructure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Typhoid fever may be prone to misdiagnosis as malaria during periods of heavy rain, and child pneumonia has been shown to present clinically with malaria-like symptoms in SSA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. A 2009–2010 Accra study of 605 feverish children suspected of malaria yielded a parasite-positive rate of just 11% after blood microscopy, yet 80% were diagnosed with malaria and prescribed anti-malarials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. All of the evidence suggests that malaria incidence data do not accurately represent Ghana’s malaria burden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and are consistent with observations of very low parasitemia levels (1.5%) in Accra made 25 years ago despite similar frequency of fever as in rural areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].
