<p>Ghana’s 2014 population of 27 million was 51% urban [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], though according to WHO, the entire nation is still considered a high transmission zone for 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria, the most dangerous of the malaria parasite species that infects humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The 2014 World Malaria Report notes over 20,000 malaria deaths in Ghana between 2000 and 2013, with 2,506 in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. More than half of all clinic visits in Ghana are due to febrile illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Ghana received about US$100 million for malaria control from international and domestic funders in 2013 alone, an amount that fluctuated between $72–110 million from 2010 to 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In 2013 over 75% was spent on insecticides, insecticide-treated bed nets, and antimalarials, while only approximately 13% was spent on diagnostics—an amount less than the amount reportedly spent on management costs—and just 1–2% was spent on monitoring and evaluation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In 2014, the amount spent on diagnostics fell to approximately half of 2013 levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Many health care facilities still lack RDTs, and just 23% of Ghana’s reported malaria cases were confirmed 
 <italic>via</italic> microscopy or RDT in 2013; the balance were presumptively diagnosed [
