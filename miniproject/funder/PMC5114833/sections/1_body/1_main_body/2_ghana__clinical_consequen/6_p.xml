<p>Still, a recent study of health perceptions in Accra affirmed the significance of malaria as a primary health threat that cuts across communities of all socio-economic levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The linking of malaria to inadequate sanitation was a persistent theme as residents of both high- and low-income neighborhoods associated uncollected refuse and clogged drains with mosquito breeding—and thus malaria—with less concern for traditional sanitation-driven diseases such as typhoid fever. This linkage of malaria and garbage was the most popular health misperception reported across Accra, and likely contributes toward the popular perception of a heavy malaria morbidity burden in Ghana [

 <italic>malaria</italic> have historically been used interchangeably [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In summary, the accumulated evidence from Ghana beckons an approach to fever that integrates biomedical advances with social, behavioral, and environmental levers of patient management.
