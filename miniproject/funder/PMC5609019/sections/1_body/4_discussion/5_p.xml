<p id="Par51">The mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the main transmitting vector of dengue, and is distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, however, the principal mosquito for dengue dispersion in Guangzhou is 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, with no 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> identified until 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The density of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> increased sharply in the past decade and was highest in 2014, especially in urban areas, which contributed at least in part to the largest outbreak of dengue in Guangzhou. 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> breeds mostly in the wild and depends on accumulated water in various containers or plants. As the subtropical geographical environment and climate in Guangzhou is similar to Southeastern Asia where 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the main vector for dengue, Guangzhouâ€™s rainfall and air temperature is suitable for the growth and reproduction of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> both indoors and outdoors
 <italic>.</italic> Additionally, local customs among residents of breeding 
 <italic>Dracaena sanderiana</italic> and 
 <italic>Rohdea japonica</italic> provides a variety of suitable breeding sites for mosquito vectors.
