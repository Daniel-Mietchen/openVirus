<p id="Par52">Generally, dengue epidemics transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> tend to be mild and short-lived [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], such as the epidemics that occurred in Henan in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], France, Croatia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, recent studies indicated that the propagation efficiency of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> for DENV transmission was as high as that of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> infected with DENV show higher concentrations of DENV RNA in abdominal tissues compared to 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is likely that the increased intensity of transmission and final outbreak size of the 2014 Guangzhou epidemic were in part due to entomological characteristics of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. These findings suggest the potnential for large outbreaks in areas such as Europe and the United States which are endemic for 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Song et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found apparent lagged effects on the relationship between mosquito abundance and dengue fever, and the lag time was no more than two months in most years, which was consistent with the incubation periods of dengue. Our study also showed cases peaked about one month after peak adult mosquito densities, in line with these findings.
