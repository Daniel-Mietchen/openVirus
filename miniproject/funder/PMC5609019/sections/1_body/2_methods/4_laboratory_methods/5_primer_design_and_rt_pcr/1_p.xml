<p id="Par31">To amplify the entire sequence of the DENV E gene, DEN750 (5′-CAAGAACCGAAACGTGGATG-3′) and DEN2639 (5′-TGTGGAAGCAAATATCACCTG-3′) were designed for DENV-1, and DEN2F(5′-CCAGGCTTTACCATAATGGC-3′) and DEN2R(5′- CCAGCTGCACAACGCAACCAC-3′) were for DENV-2. RNA samples were used for one-step RT-PCR (TaKaRa, Japan). The RT-PCR reaction was performed at 50 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription, denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, primer annealing at 60 °C for 1.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. A final extension at 72 °C for 10 min was performed to ensure complete double-stranded DNA synthesis. The PCR products were purified using QIA-quick PCR purification kits (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions [
