<p id="Par25">During the outbreak, mosquito density was monitored using 
 <italic>Breteau Index</italic> (BI), 
 <italic>Standard Space Index</italic> (SSI) and 
 <italic>Adult Mosquito Density Index</italic> (ADI) by CDC. The BI measuring of indoors and SSI of outdoors are two conventional 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larval indices applied to evaluate mosquito density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The index is calculated as follows: BI = number of positive containers per 100 houses, SSI = number of positive containers per 100 standard spaces. The ADI measurement of adult mosquitos was calculated by the number of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> collected per hour and per person by human landing catches.
