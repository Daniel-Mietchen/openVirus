<p id="Par20">The dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> family Flaviviridae
 <italic>,</italic> and is a single-stranded positive-sense, RNA virus with a genome of about 11Â kb. It is antigenically divided into four serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). The four virus serotypes are transmitted by mosquito vector species 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and circulate in tropic and subtropical areas, transmission being largely dominated by one strain in different regions and times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A serotype-specific lifelong immunity is developed after initial infection, subsequent infection by another serotype however will promote the risk of DHF/DSS due to antibody-dependent enhancement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, there are still factors contributing to the challenge of vaccine development, such as viral interference, reversion to virulence, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and the lack of immunologic correlates and good animal models [
