  <p>Phylogenetic tree of the DENV-1 E genes isolated in Guangzhou in 2014. 24 sequences from isolated strains and 55 reference sequences from GenBank were aligned using ClustalW. Phylogenetic tree was constructed with the maximum likelihood methods with Kimura 2-parameter corrections of multiple substitutions. Virus strains are indicated by place, date of isolation, and GenBank accession number. Furthermore, the strains isolated in 2014 also were labeled with the district and isolation month</p>
