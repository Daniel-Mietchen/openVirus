<p id="Par37">In various countries, both civil society and the pharmaceutical industry have teamed with governments to introduce prevention and control programmes. For example, the 
 <italic>Médecins sans Frontières</italic>’ Access Campaign has begun screening and treatment programmes for hepatitis B and C in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India (Manipur province), Myanmar and Pakistan. The 
 <italic>Clinton Health Access Initiative</italic> is working with health ministries in several countries, such as Myanmar and Rwanda, to support the introduction of sustainable government-led programmes for treating hepatitis C. The company 
 <italic>MSD India</italic> initiated a programme to educate patients and their families about hepatitis C and to help to manage the cost of treatment; its Project Sambhav was launched in the Punjab in 2012 with two elements: disease management and micro-financing. The 
 <italic>Onom Foundation</italic> in Mongolia, working closely with the national Government, has instituted a prevention campaign that includes prevention, screening and early diagnosis, on-site rapid testing projects, lobbying, and the creation of a national database on viral hepatitis.
