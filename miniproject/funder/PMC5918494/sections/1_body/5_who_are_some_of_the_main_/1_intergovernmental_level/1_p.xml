<p id="Par29">After years of neglect of viral hepatitis there are encouraging signs of movement: the disease is moving up towards its deserved place on the international public health agenda. At the same time, LMICs have to cope with emerging communicable diseases and threats such as Ebola, Zika and dengue, not to mention malaria and tuberculosis, and expanding epidemics of noncommunicable diseases, including obesity, as well as humanitarian crises and emergencies. At the intergovernmental level, “combat viral hepatitis” is included in target 3.3 of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal on health. The use of the verb “combat” dismays many hepatitis professionals, given the use of the term “eliminate” for other diseases, especially as vaccination offers the possibility of preventing hepatitis A and B and treatments are available to cure hepatitis C.</p>
