  <p>Phylogenetic tree of nucleotide sequences encoding the VP1 in EV-A71 genogroups, CV-A6, CV-A10, and CV-A16. The phylogenetic tree was inferred with MrBayes v3.5 [
   <xref rid="B78-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] with the general time reversible substitution model allowing for heterogeneity modeled by a gamma distribution and allowing for invariable sites (GTR + G + I) with 5 Ã— 10
   <sup>6</sup> chain length. The sequences are publicly available in GenBank with the accession number between parentheses. Tips are colored according to the genogroup A, B, C, D, E, F, and CV genotypes (CV-A6, -A10 and -A16), as black, red, blue, green, orange, purple and gray, respectively. Posterior probability supporting the topology is shown next to the branches.
