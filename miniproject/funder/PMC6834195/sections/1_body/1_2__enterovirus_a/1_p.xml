<p>Species Enterovirus A are classified within the genus Enterovirus, one of the more than 30 genera in the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, which also includes the related human viral pathogens within the Hepatovirus, Parechovirus, and Kobuvirus families [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Members of the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family have non-enveloped, 30–32 nm icosahedral capsids containing 60 tightly-packed protomers which are highly stable under acidic conditions allowing virions to survive exposure to gastric acid, disinfectants and remain infectious at ambient room temperature for several days [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genomes, ranging from 6.7 to 10.1 kb in size, possess 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and encode a single polyprotein from which all viral gene products are processed by viral proteases [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The proteins encoded in the enteroviral genome are organized from 5′ to 3′ with up to four structural capsid proteins followed by seven nonstructural proteins [
