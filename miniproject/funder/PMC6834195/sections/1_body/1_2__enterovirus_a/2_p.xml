<p>The Enterovirus genus consists of 12 species of Enterovirus A to J and Rhinovirus species A to C [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], among which Enterovirus A to D and Rhinovirus A to C have been isolated previously from humans. The genus contains strains from multiple taxa of polioviruses, coxsackieviruses (CVs) and echoviruses, based on biologic and antigenic characteristics during their original characterization [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, despite polioviruses and CVs both producing diseases in the CNS, CVs were initially distinguished by their propensity to produce paralysis in suckling mice but no cytopathic effects in cultured cells [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, CVs were further divided into CV groups A and B according to the pathological characteristics observed in new-born mice, with members in CV-A causing flaccid paralysis and CV-B causing spastic paralysis [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; however, polioviruses and echoviruses produce cytopathic effects in cultured cells while failing to cause lesions in new-born mice [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, problems arose from this biological classification scheme as different strains could exhibit properties of different taxa; therefore, from EV-D68, and subsequent newly recognized EVs, are named by assigning a chronological number in order of discovery [

 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. EVs have traditionally been serotyped by assessment of neutralizing antibody responses in cultured cells; however, since 2000, DNA sequence-based genotyping approaches have become standard practice, with a “type” rather than a serotype name, e.g., Echovirus type 30 rather than Echovirus serotype 30. In recent years, the genetic typing of specimens has grown due to the more rapid and simpler PCR testing for EV detection [

 <xref rid="B16-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while use of cultured cells are also increasingly being supplanted by molecular approaches due to their low isolation rates. For the identification of the viral type by nucleotide sequence analysis, the VP4-VP2 partial region of the capsid region and the analysis by amplifying the VP1 partial region (CODEHOP RT-semi-nested PCR) are widely used. In general, EV type identification by sequencing of the VP1 region, which is highly concordant with serotype designations, is considered reasonable [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Currently, more than 300 EV types have been characterized genetically by phylogenetic clustering, including rhinoviruses [

 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; in detail, Enterovirus A: 25 types, Enterovirus B: 63 types, Enterovirus C: 23 types, Enterovirus D: 5 types, Enterovirus E: 5 types, Enterovirus F: 7 types, Enterovirus G: 20 types, Enterovirus H: 1 type, Enterovirus I: 1 type, Enterovirus J: 6 types, Rhinovirus A: 80 types, Rhinovirus B: 32 types, Rhinovirus C: 55 types, and three types awaiting formal classification [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Pathogens associated with HFMD outbreaks belong to the species Human enterovirus A (HEV-A). In addition, in the context of CNS infections, poliovirus causing poliomyelitis (acute flaccid paralysis, AFP), which remarkably has almost achieved vaccinal control and eradication worldwide [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], is classified as Enterovirus C. EV-D68, which has caused large-scale respiratory infections in Japan, Europe and North America since 2014, and has been definitively associated with multiple paralytic cases (acute flaccid myelitis) arising from spinal cord damage, is classified within species Enterovirus D [
