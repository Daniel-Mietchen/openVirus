<p>Among the HFMD etiologic agents, EV-A71 is the most pathogenic and more frequently associated with complications extending to the CNS, such as brainstem encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B86-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Moreover, severe cases with EV-A71 infections could be detected earlier if caution is exercised in patients with physical findings, raised total white cell count, vomiting and absence of mouth ulcers [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Although fever is common to EV-A71 infections, its duration and severity have been shown as important independent risk factors [
