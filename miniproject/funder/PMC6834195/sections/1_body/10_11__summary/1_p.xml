<p>This review outlines the burden imposed by EV-associated HFMD and the development of CNS complications, such as encephalitis and meningitis. HFMD is often caused by EV-A71, CV-A6, and CV-A16 and there have been multiple extremely large outbreaks with associated neurological disease and fatal outcomes due to EV-A71 infections in East and Southeast Asia since the early 1980s. Vaccines against EV-A71 have been developed and used in China, which has suffered the highest burden of disease and fatalities, but widespread pediatric vaccination programs have not been introduced in other countries. Although fatal cases have been reported in Japan, the absolute number of severe cases caused by EV-A71 remains lower than those in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and other Asian countries. Nevertheless, baseline epidemiological surveillance in Japan of this infectious disease provides insights into the infectious trends of EV-A71 to assist in the breaking of chains of transmission and mitigating disease events.</p>
