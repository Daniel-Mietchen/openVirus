<p>After an EV gains entry to the oral epithelia by contact with contaminated material, the virus infects the oropharynx and subsequently the gastrointestinal tract. The infection can proliferate in the tonsils, cervical lymph nodes, Peyerâ€™s patches, and the mesenteric lymph nodes [

 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In our experience, it is extremely rare that the virus is isolated from feces more than two weeks after disease onset. There are also EV types that caused acute respiratory infections in Japan in 2015 that are difficult to isolate from feces, such as EV-D68, which is associated with an acute flaccid paralysis/myelitis presentation, in rare but serious cases, and for which droplet infection is the main route of infection and therefore a respiratory specimen is recommended for laboratory diagnosis [

 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In severe cases, as the viremia increases, the virus spreads to skin, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, heart, liver, pancreas, and, in some cases, enters the CNS and neurological and cardio-respiratory failure can potentially develop [
