<p>HFMD was first discovered in North America as an acute-onset, febrile viral infection with a characteristic maculopapular rash and blisters observed on the hands, feet, and mouth [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Inflammation and vesicles in the mouth can ulcerate with associated pain and discomfort that complicates eating and drinking for infants which can lead to dehydration. While most cases are self-limiting, a small percentage can develop further neurological complications [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, sore throat, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, irritability, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis and non-specific viral rashes [

 <xref rid="B31-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Despite the highly infectious nature of HFMD pathogens, which results in the high number of infections per outbreak, the symptoms usually resolve 7 to 10 days after disease onset [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05201-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and the main etiological agents are members of the species Enterovirus A: CV-A16, and EV-A71, with some less frequent cases caused by CV-A6 and CV-A10 [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since 2009, atypical HFMD cases caused by CV-A6 have been reported in Japan every other year from 2011 to 2019. The trend of cases caused by CV-A6 has been attributed to an inferred five-fold increase in pathogenicity since 2010; such an increase provided a better fit to the data than models involving changes in transmissibility or antigenicity [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-05201" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, these cases are considered atypical due to symptoms that could be misdiagnosed as varicella, such as vesiculobullous rash of the trunk and extremities, and the characteristic spread of eruptions with scabbing and crust formation that can leave skin lesions [
