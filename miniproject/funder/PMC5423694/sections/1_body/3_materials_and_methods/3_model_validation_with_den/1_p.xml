<p>To validate the model, we used data on human cases of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV at the country scale and mean temperature during the transmission window. Using statistical models (as described below), we estimated the effects of predicted

 <italic>T</italic>) on the probability of local transmission and the magnitude of incidence, controlling for population size and several socioeconomic factors. We downloaded and manually entered Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) weekly case reports for DENV and CHIKV for all countries in the Americas (North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean Islands) from week 1 of 2014 to week 8 of 2015 for CHIKV and from week 52 of 2013 to week 47 of 2015 for DENV (

ZIKV weekly case reports for reporting districts (e.g., provinces) within Colombia, Mexico, El Salvador, and the US Virgin Islands were available from the CDC Epidemic Prediction Initiative (

We aggregated the ZIKV data into country-level weekly case reports to match the spatial resolution of the DENV, CHIKV, and covariate data.
