<p>Because organisms do not typically experience constant temperature environments in nature, we incorporated the effects of temperature variation on transmission by calculating a daily average

 </sub> assuming a daily temperature range of 8°C, across the range of mean temperatures. This range is consistent with daily temperature variation in tropical and subtropical environments but lower than in most temperate environments. At each mean temperature, we used a Parton-Logan model to generate hourly temperatures and calculate each temperature-sensitive trait on an hourly basis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We set this threshold based on hourly temperatures exceeding the critical thermal maximum (
