<p>The residuals of the incidence model exhibit “inverse trumpeting,” in which residual variation is larger at low than high predicted incidence (Fig I in

However, the data did sometimes show transmission where we did not expect it, potentially because of imported cases, errors in reporting, or small pockets of transmission suitability in countries or times that are otherwise unsuitable on average. More local-scale case reporting that separates autochthonous from travel-associated cases would be needed to tease apart the source of this error.
