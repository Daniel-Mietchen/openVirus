 <italic>T</italic>) model while controlling for population and socio-economic factors, we used generalized linear models (GLMs) on the weekly case count data. Importantly, we focused on testing whether the case counts were consistent with the transmissionâ€“temperature relationship predicted from our model, rather than on maximizing the variation explained in the statistical model. We are more specifically interested in understanding autochthonous transmission (i.e., locally acquired, not just imported cases). We set country-level thresholds for the number of cases defining autochthonous transmission for our three diseases separately, based on current transmission understanding: seven cases of CHIKV, 70 cases of DENV, and three cases of ZIKV. We derived these thresholds in the following way. First, we looked for data on outbreaks of travel related cases in countries that are not expected to experience any local transmission. For instance, in 2014 Canada experienced 320 confirmed, travel-related cases of chikungunya (

Thus, to be conservative in our estimates, we set the threshold of transmission as seven cases/week for CHIKV. The reported weekly cases of DENV transmission in our study sample are considerably higher than for CHIKV (mean DENV incidence was nearly 100 times higher mean CHIKV incidence). We chose a moderately high threshold of 70 cases in a week (i.e., 10 times higher than the CHIKV threshold based on Canadian cases) to reflect higher overall incidence and increased potential for travel related cases. We examined the sensitivity of the results to choice of threshold by varying it from 25 to 100, and we found qualitatively similar results for all thresholds that we tested. As ZIKV is not as well established as either CHIKV or DENV at this time, smaller numbers of cases may indicate autochthonous transmission. Consequently, we chose a threshold of three cases for ZIKV (approximately half the CHIKV threshold). Further, the results were fairly sensitive to the ZIKV threshold as many locations have small numbers of cases. Since higher thresholds exclude a very large proportion of available case data making analysis impossible, we used the slightly less conservative threshold of three cases for autochthonous transmission of ZIKV. The resulting data consisted of zeros for no transmission and positive case counts when transmission is presumed to be occurring. To model these data, we used a hurdle model that first uses logistic regression on the presence/absence of local transmission data to understand the factors correlated with local transmission occurring or not (PA analysis). Then we modeled the log of incidence (number of new cases per reporting week) for positive values with a gamma generalized linear models (incidence analysis).
