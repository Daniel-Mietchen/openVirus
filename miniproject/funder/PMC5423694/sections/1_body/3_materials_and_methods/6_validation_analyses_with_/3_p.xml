<p>In both the PA and incidence analyses, we first used the full data sets to examine which of the candidate models best described the data. Randomized quantile residuals indicated that the logistic and gamma GLM models were performing adequately. We compared the approximate model probabilities, calculated from the BIC scores, as well as the proportion of deviance explained (D
 <sup>2</sup>) from each model. Next we examined the performance of the models in predicting out of sample, for both PA and incidence analyses. To do this we created 1000 random partitions, where 90% of the data were used to train the model and 10% were used for testing. In the PA analyses we classified each partition based on presence/absence, with separate classification thresholds for DENV versus CHIKV/ZIKV as these grouping had much different probabilities of occurrence. We assessed the performance of the model for the PA analysis based on the mean misclassification rate. In the incidence analyses we assessed the model performance based on the predictive mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Since differences in prediction success between the models in both the PA and incidence analyses were not statistically significant, we present the simpler models that only include the
