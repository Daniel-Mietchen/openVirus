<p>We accessed available data on projected 2016 gross domestic product (GDP) for countries of interest via the International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook Database (

The direct and total contributions of tourism to GDP in 2016 were compiled from World Travel and Tourism Council economic impact reports (

We retrieved population size data for 2013–2015 from the United Nations Population Division (

Throughout the analyses below, unless otherwise specified, we used the natural log of the population size and of GDP as our predictors. We have two reasons for this choice. The first is that, intuitively, the relative order of magnitude of the population/GDP is more important in determining observed outbreak sizes or probabilities than their absolute sizes. Second, population sizes and GDPs across countries tend to exhibit clumped patterns with a few outliers that are much larger than the others. From a statistical perspective, using the un-transformed populations (or GDPs) results in those few large/rich countries having very high leverage in the analysis, and thus potentially skewing the results. Taking a log of the population better balances these predictors and is the standard accepted approach when using these kinds of predictors in regression models.
