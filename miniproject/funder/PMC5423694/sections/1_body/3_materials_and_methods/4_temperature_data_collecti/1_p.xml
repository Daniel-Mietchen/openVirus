<p>We matched the DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV incidence data with temperature using daily temperature data from METAR stations in each country, averaged at the country level by epidemic week. A previous study found a six-week lagged relationship between temperature and oviposition for 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in Ecuador [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Assuming that the subsequent transmission, disease development, medical care-seeking, and case reporting in humans takes an additional four weeks, we assumed 
 <italic>a priori</italic> a ten-week lag between temperature and incidence (i.e., mean temperature for the week that is ten weeks prior to each case report). METAR stations are internationally standardized weather reporting stations that report hourly temperature and precipitation measures. Outlier weather stations were excluded if they reported a daily maximum temperature below 5°C or a daily minimum temperature above 40°C during the study period, extremes that would certainly eliminate the potential for transmission in a local area. Because case data are reported at the country level, we needed a collection of weather stations in each country that accurately represent weather conditions in the areas where transmission occurs, excluding extreme areas where transmission is unlikely. For the study period of October 1, 2013 through April 30, 2016, we downloaded daily temperature data for each station from Weather Underground using the 
 <italic>weatherData</italic> package in R [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We removed all data from Chile because it spans so much latitude and the terrain is so diverse that its country-level mean is unlikely to be very representative of the temperature where an outbreak occurred.
