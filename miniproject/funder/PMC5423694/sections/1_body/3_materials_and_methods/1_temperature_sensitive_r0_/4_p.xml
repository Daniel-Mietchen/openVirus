<p>We fit the trait thermal responses in Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0005568.e001">1</xref>) based on an exhaustive search of published laboratory studies that fulfilled the criterion of measuring a trait at three or more constant temperatures, ideally capturing both the rise and the fall of each unimodal curve (Tables S1-S2). Constant-temperature laboratory conditions are required to isolate the direct effect of temperature from confounding factors in the field and to provide a baseline for estimating the effects of temperature variation through rate summation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We attempted to obtain raw data from each study, but if they were not available we collected data by hand from tables or digitized data from figures using WebPlotDigitizer [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We obtained raw data from Delatte [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>). Data did not meet the inclusion criterion for CHIKV or ZIKV vector competence (
