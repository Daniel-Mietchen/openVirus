<p>The socio-ecological conditions that enabled CHIKV, ZIKV, and DENV to become the three most important emerging vector-borne diseases in the Americas make the emergence of additional 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted viruses likely (potentially including Mayaro, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, Uganda S, or Ross River viruses). Efforts to extrapolate and to map temperature suitability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g004">Fig 4</xref>) will be critical for improving management of both ongoing and future emerging epidemics. Mechanistic models like the one presented here are useful for extrapolating the potential geographic range of transmission beyond the current envelope of environmental conditions in which transmission occurs (e.g., under climate change and for newly invading pathogens). Accurately estimating temperature-driven transmission risk in both highly suitable and marginal regions is critical for predicting and responding to future outbreaks of these and other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted viruses.
