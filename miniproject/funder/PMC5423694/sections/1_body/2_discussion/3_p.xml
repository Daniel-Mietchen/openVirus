<p>Even though the thermal response data are imperfect—for example, CHIKV and ZIKV thermal response data are missing—and the human case data are reported at a coarse spatial scale, the validation analyses suggest that

 <italic>T</italic>) is an important predictor of both the probability of transmission occurring and the magnitude of incidence for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV. This has several key implications. First, temperature-dependent transmission is pervasive enough to be detected at a coarse spatial scale. Second, dynamics of the mosquito predict transmission for a suite of

 <italic>aegypti</italic>-transmitted viruses, without additional virus-specific information. Third, climate and socio-economic factors combine to shape variation in incidence across countries. Finally, these simple predictors explain a substantial proportion of the variance in both the probability and intensity of transmission.
