<p>Temperature is an important driver of—and limitation on—vector transmission, so accurately describing the temperature range and optimum for transmission of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV is critical for predicting their geographic and seasonal patterns of spread [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We directly estimated the temperature–transmission relationship using mechanistic transmission models for each mosquito species (

Because these trait thermal responses are unimodal across the majority of ectotherm taxa and traits, and because the traits combine nonlinearly to drive transmission, the emergent relationship between temperature and transmission is difficult to infer directly from field data or from individual trait responses. Here, we present a model of temperature-dependent DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV transmission that advances on previous models because it is mechanistic, fitted from experimental trait data (
