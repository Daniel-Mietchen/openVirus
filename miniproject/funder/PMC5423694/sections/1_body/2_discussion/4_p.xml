<p>Predicting arbovirus transmission at a higher spatial resolution and precision will require more detailed information on factors like the exposure and susceptibility of human populations, environmental variation (e.g., oviposition habitat availability, seasonal and daily temperature variation), and socioeconomic factors. However, as a first step our mechanistic model provides valuable insight because it makes broad predictions about suitable environmental conditions for transmission, it is mechanistic and grounded in experimental trait data, it is validated against independent human case data, and its predictions are applicable across three different viruses. Using these thermal response models as a scaffold, additional drivers could be incorporated to obtain more precise and specific predictions about transmission dynamics, which could in turn be used for public health and vector control applications. For this purpose, all code and data used in the models are available on Figshare [
