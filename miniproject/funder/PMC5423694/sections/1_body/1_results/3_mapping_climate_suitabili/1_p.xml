Considering the number of months per year at which mean temperatures do not prevent transmission, large areas of tropical and subtropical regions, including Puerto Rico and parts of Florida and Texas, are currently suitable year-round or seasonally (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g004">Fig 4</xref>). These regions are fundamentally at risk for DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, and other 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> arbovirus transmission during a substantial part of the year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Indeed, DENV, CHIKV, and/or ZIKV local transmission has occurred in Texas, Florida, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Temperature thus limits the potential for the viruses to generate extensive epidemics in temperate areas even where the vectors are present. Moreover, many temperate regions with seasonally suitable temperatures currently lack
