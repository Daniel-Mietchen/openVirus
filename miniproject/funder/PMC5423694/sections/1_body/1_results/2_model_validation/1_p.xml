<p>We used generalized linear models (GLM) to ask whether the predicted relationship between temperature and transmission, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>), was consistent with observed human cases of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV. Specifically, we assessed whether 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) was an important predictor of the probability of autochthonous transmission occurring and of the incidence given that transmission occurred. We also controlled for human population size, virus species, and two socioeconomic factors. (Note that we focused on testing the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) model, rather than on constructing the best possible statistical model of human case data.) To do this, we used the version of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) model that includes 8°C daily temperature range, along with country-scale weekly case reports of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV in the Americas and the Caribbean between 2014–2016. We first addressed the fact that countries with larger populations have greater opportunities for (large) epidemics by creating two predictors that incorporate scaled 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) and population size. In the models of the probability of autochthonous transmission occurring we used the product of the posterior probability that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) &gt; 0 (which we notate as 
 <italic>GR</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>) and the log of population size (
 <italic>p</italic>) to give 
 <italic>log</italic>(
 <italic>p</italic>)
 <italic>*GR</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>. (Here, and throughout, 
 <italic>log</italic> denotes the natural logarithm.) In the models of incidence, given that transmission does occur, we used the log of the product of the posterior mean of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) and population size, 
 <italic>log</italic>(
 <italic>p*R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>)). To control for several socioeconomic factors that might obscure the impact of temperature, we also included log of gross domestic product (GDP) and log of percent of GDP in tourism (using logs because the predictors were highly skewed, to stabilize variance). These are potential indicators of investment in and/or success of vector control and infrastructure improvements that prevent transmission. By comparing models that included the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) metric alone, socioeconomic factors alone, or both, we tested whether 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) was an important predictor of observed transmission occurrence and incidence (see Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>). Note that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) is out of sample for all validation analyses because it is derived and calculated strictly from laboratory data on mosquitoes, and we perform a validation analyses for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) using independent case incidence reports. For this validation step we assessed model adequacy for the transmission data in two ways. First we used the full dataset for case incidence reports to select the best model (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>) and to determine whether or not our predicted value of relative 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) based on laboratory data was included in the model (“within sample” analysis). Second we used a bootstrapping approach where models were fit on subsets of the case incidence data that were randomly sampled and then predictive accuracy of the competing models (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>) was assessed on left-out data (“out of sample” analysis).
