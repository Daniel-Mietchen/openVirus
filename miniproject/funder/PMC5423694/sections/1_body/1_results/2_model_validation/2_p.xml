<p>For the probability of autochthonous transmission occurring, the model that included both the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) predictor and socioeconomic predictors had overwhelming support based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC; model PA5 relative probability = 1, Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>). Based on deviance explained, the models that included 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>), with or without the socioeconomic predictors out-performed the model that did not include 
 <italic>R</italic>

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s001">S1 Text</xref>). In analyses of out-of-sample accuracy, models that included the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) metric (with or without the socioeconomic factors) were surprisingly accurate. They predicted the probability of transmission with 86–91% out-of-sample accuracy for DENV (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>). For CHIKV and ZIKV, models that included the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) metric or population alone had 66–69% out-of-sample accuracy (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref>). There were no significant differences in out-of-sample accuracy between the top four models, but for both DENV and CHIKV/ZIKV the best model was significantly better than the worst model [see supplementary code in 39 for full results]. The lower out-of-sample accuracy for CHIKV and ZIKV likely reflects the much lower frequency of positive values and the lower total sample size of this dataset. All results were similar for a set of models that separated 
 <italic>GR</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> from population size, so for simplicity we show the model predictors that combines 
 <italic>GR</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> and population size here (see Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005568.s002">S2 Text</xref> and [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] for results of other models). Further, from a biological perspective, the combined model better describes what we know about disease systems: if either the probability of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) being greater than zero is small or population size is very small, transmission is unlikely to occur. Together, these analyses suggest that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) is an important predictor of transmission occurrence, but that CHIKV and ZIKV need further data to better explain the probability of transmission occurrence (
