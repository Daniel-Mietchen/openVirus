<p>Although predicted

While the reason for this difference is unclear, the most likely explanation is that DENV is much more established in the Americas, so it is more likely to be detected, diagnosed, and reported. Because ZIKV and CHIKV are newly emerging, they may not have fully saturated the region at this early stage.
