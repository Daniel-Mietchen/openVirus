<p>The ability of the model to explain the probability and magnitude of transmission is notable given the coarse scale of the human incidence versus mean temperature data (i.e., country-scale means), the lack of CHIKV- and ZIKV-specific trait thermal response data to inform the model, the nonlinear relationship between transmission and incidence, and all the well-documented factors other than temperature that influence transmission. Together, these analyses show simple mechanistic models parameterized with laboratory data on mosquitoes and dengue virus are consistent with observed temperature suitability for transmission. Moreover, the similar responses of human incidence of ZIKV, CHIKV, and DENV to temperature suggest that the thermal ecology of their shared mosquito vectors is a key determinant of outbreak location, timing, and intensity.</p>
