<p>The posterior distribution of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) allows us to evaluate uncertainty in key temperature values that define the transmission range, including critical thermal minimum, maximum, and optimum. Uncertainty was higher for the critical thermal minimum for transmission than for the maximum or optimum, and the two mosquito species overlapped most for this outcome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g002">Fig 2</xref>, bottom panels). This result occurred because several trait thermal responses increase gradually from low to mid temperatures but decline more steeply at high temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g001">Fig 1</xref>), so uncertainty is greatest at low temperatures. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> has a substantially higher optimum and maximum temperature than

 <italic>albopictus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005568.g002">Fig 2</xref>) due to its greater rates of adult survival at high temperatures (see Supplementary Materials for sensitivity analyses).
