<p>Epidemics of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are sweeping through the Americas, and are part of a global public health crisis that places an estimated 3.9 billion people in 120 countries at risk [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue virus (DENV) distribution and intensity in the Americas has increased over the last three decades, infecting an estimated 390 million people (96 million clinical) per year [
