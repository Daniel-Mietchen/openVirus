<p>The effects of temperature on ectotherms are largely predictable from fundamental metabolic and ecological processes. Survival, feeding, development, and reproductive rates predictably respond to temperature across a variety of ectotherms, including mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Because these traits help to determine transmission rates, the effects of temperature on transmission should also be broadly predictable from mechanistic models that incorporate temperature-dependent traits. Here, we introduce a model based on this framework that overcomes several major gaps that currently limit our understanding of climate suitability for transmission. Specifically, we develop models of temperature-dependent transmission for
