<p>We synthesize available data to characterize the temperature-dependent traits of the mosquitoes and viruses that determine transmission intensity. With these thermal responses, we develop mechanistic temperature-dependent virus transmission models for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. We then ask whether the predicted effect of temperature on transmission is consistent with patterns of actual human cases over space and time. To do this, we validate the models with DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV human incidence data at the country scale in the Americas from 2014â€“2016. To isolate temperature dependence, we also statistically control for population size and two socioeconomic factors that may influence transmission. If temperature fundamentally limits transmission potential, transmission should only occur at actual environmental temperatures that are predicted to be suitable, and conversely, areas with low predicted suitability should have low or zero transmission (i.e., false negative rates should be low). By contrast, low transmission may occur even when temperature suitability is high because other factors like vector control can limit transmission (i.e., the false positive rate should be higher than the false negative rate). Finally, if the simple mechanistic model accurately predicts climate suitability for transmission, then we can use it to map climate-based transmission risk of DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, and other emerging pathogens transmitted by
