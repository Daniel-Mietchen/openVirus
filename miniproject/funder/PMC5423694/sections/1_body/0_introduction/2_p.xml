<p>Predicting transmission of DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV requires understanding the ecology of the vector species. For these viruses the main vector is 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a mosquito that prefers and is closely affiliated with humans, while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, a peri-urban mosquito, is an important secondary vector [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005568.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We expect one of the main drivers of the vector ecology to be the climate, particularly temperature. For that reason, mathematical and geostatistical models that incorporate climate information have been valuable for predicting and responding to 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. spread and DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV outbreaks [
