<p>After the first outbreak in September 2009, the Taiwanese government announced a quarantine policy (known as the 325 policy) on campuses to protect school-aged children from infections. This policy ensures that the school must be shut down for five days if there were two new infected cases within three days. As the pandemic vaccine was available in November, the quarantine policy was canceled by the government if the school achieved an 80% vaccination rate. The vaccinated population was about 5.6 million during the flu season, and approximately 520,000 individuals received vaccines on the national vaccination day, December 12. Besides using vaccines, the government also ordered 60 million masks for controlling the outbreak (

The overall vaccine rate was at an undesirable level in 2009, although the government has allocated abundant resources to control the disease. There were millions of leftover vaccines at the end of the vaccination program, and only one-third of vaccine orders were applied to the population. The low vaccination rate mainly associated with vaccination side effects, such as dizziness and vomiting that occasionally occurred in the younger population (

Concerns regarding the monovalent vaccine side effect have been discussed in the literature, where the author suggests the information of disease background and vaccination benefits should be available to the public in a transparent and easy-to-understand manner (
