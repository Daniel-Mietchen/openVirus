<p>Recently, attention has turned towards understanding the effectiveness of a vaccination strategy by use of disease modeling. 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Ball, Mollison &amp; Scalia-Tomba (1997)</xref> developed an SIR model with a stratified population in households to obtain the optimal threshold for controlling an epidemic. Becker and Starczak assessed the post-vaccination reproduction number in a stochastic SIR framework and suggested minimal vaccination coverage to prevent disease transmission (

Hill and Longini proposed a general framework to obtain optimal vaccination strategies to apply to several types of epidemic models, including SIR models, SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered) models, and SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) models (
