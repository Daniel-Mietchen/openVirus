<p>Yarmand et al. developed a simulation model to capture the epidemic dynamics in different regions and formulated the vaccine allocation problem as two-stage stochastic programming. Using the 2-SLP formulation, they estimated the value of the stochastic solution and the expected value of perfect information. The results showed that the proposed two-phase vaccination policy potentially resulted in a lower attack rate and a considerable saving in vaccine production and administration costsÂ (
