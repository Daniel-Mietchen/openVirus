<p>The time-series model can be utilized to understand how the disease transmitted in population over time. Sophisticated approaches focused on periodic outbreaks by integrating mathematical formulations with actual epidemical data. For example, Finkenstädt et al. developed models to estimate weekly transmission rates and unreported cases using surveillance data for measles in England and Wales. Their computational results were coherent with the actual transmission pattern and capable of explaining the biennial cycle of measles outbreaks (
