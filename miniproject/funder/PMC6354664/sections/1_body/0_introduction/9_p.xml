<p>From a retrospective review of the immunization strategy in 2009, simply ordering vaccines is insufficient for controlling influenza, as well as the effectiveness of timely implementing vaccination program is rarely discussed by literature. The present study aims to address these challenges. We compare the previous vaccine coverage and the expanding program to order double vaccine doses to cover people 13–18 and 50–64 years old. The analysis includes various vaccine policies of vaccination timing and campaign size using the epidemic data collected from both 2009 and the recent years. The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows.‘Materials and Methods’ describes the stochastic disease model, parameter setting, and assumptions. ‘Results’ presents the result of the simulation experiment. The final section is the discussion and conclusions.</p>
