<p>This study represents the first attempt to explicitly analyze the ILI time-series data during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the recent epidemics in Taiwan. A stochastic compartmental model is developed to simulate various epidemical scenarios. The simulation result is consistent with the actual ILIs reported by the government. Additionally, we apply the model to assess current and potential vaccination policies. Sensitivity analysis examines how different vaccine efficacies affected the vaccination performances in terms of infections and cases averted.</p>
