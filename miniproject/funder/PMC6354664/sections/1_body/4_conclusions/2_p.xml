<p>Our findings inform recommendations for public health policies. For example, vaccination programs may be able to deter epidemics not only by increasing coverage population but also by reducing the timeframe of vaccination activity. Furthermore, the policymaker should consider the uncertainty of vaccine efficacy when making decisions. According to the sensitivity analysis, the policies of shortening vaccination timeframe reduced infections for regular vaccine efficacy, but not for the case of below average. Both increasing vaccine doses and reducing vaccination timeframe fails to avert cases if vaccine efficacy is at an extremely low level of 20%.</p>
