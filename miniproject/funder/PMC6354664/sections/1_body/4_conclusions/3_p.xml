<p>The limitation of the present study state as follows. The transmission rate can be dissimilar for individuals with different age groups, while our analysis uses a mixed transmission rate across all age group population. Because of the availability of the ILI data limits us to obtain transmission rates for each specific population group. Future study may integrate the population-based prospective survey as an alternative source of the age-specific mixing dataÂ (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Mossong et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, our analysis did not consider asymptomatic cases. We believe that including asymptomatic cases into the simulation model would increase the scale of infections, but not affect the conclusion we made. Without loss of generality, our model can be adjusted easily to adapt to these considerations when more fine data are available in the future.
