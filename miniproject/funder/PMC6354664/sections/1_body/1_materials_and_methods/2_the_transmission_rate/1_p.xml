<p>The ILI data were collected from the CDC in Taiwan for determining the weekly transmission rate (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control, 2017a</xref>). The surveillance data only included reported cases without symptomatic ones. The epidemic scenarios in 2009 and regular season scenarios calculated in different ways stated as follows. In the new H1N1 pandemic scenario, we applied the reported ILIs in 2009 directly to determine the weekly transmission rate in 2009. In the regular epidemic scenario, the weekly transmission rate was estimated by use of the multi-year data of 2013–2015. The parameter value was obtained by the 
 <italic>least square method</italic> to minimize the sum of the squared deviation between actual new infections and fitted value. The fitting result was performed well for the estimation during 2013 and 2015, where the correlation coefficient was close to one, and the sum square of errors was small.
