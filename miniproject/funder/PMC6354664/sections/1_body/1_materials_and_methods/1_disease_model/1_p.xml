<p>The discrete-time compartmental model considers the transition rate from one population group to another by use of difference equations to determine the epidemic status over time. In the simulation study, we developed and applied the model to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccine policies. The stochastic SIR model was implemented on the R language version 3.4.2 to sample new infections and then compute the number of individuals in each compartment (

As opposed to the prior work we considered more details on vaccination activities, which include multiple vaccine types and their characteristics, vaccination timing, and recipient arrival frequencies. Additionally, we segregated the population by age and county according to the demographic data in Taiwan. The time horizon was one year and time unit is weekly in our model. We assumed that the population was closed, and there was no traveling or migration within the study period. However, this assumption can be relaxed by adding the birth and mortality rates to the compartmental model accordingly.
