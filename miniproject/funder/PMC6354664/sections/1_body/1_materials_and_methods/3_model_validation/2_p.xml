<p>Both results showed that the actual and simulated ILIs were very similar in the ways of pattern and scale. The sums of absolute error defined as —simulated infections—actual— actual are 3.0% and 3.6% for the 2013–2015 and 2009 scenarios, respectively. This confirmed the suitability of using the estimated transmission rates for predicting epidemic outcomes under different vaccination programs.</p>
