<p>In the regular epidemic scenario, the policies of covering 3 million people (referring to the programs implemented in Taiwan prior 2016) cannot prevent influenza outbreaks effectively (A-1, A-2, A-3, and A-4 policies in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). However, the total infections are reduced if vaccination activities can be completed early. On the other hand, the number of cases averted can be lost by 110% (decreasing from 352,922 to -389,614) if vaccination timing is not early enough. When considering a double campaign size of 6 million doses (the current program in Taiwan), there are no epidemics if vaccination activities are completed within 3 months (B-2, B-3, and B-4 policies in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). A small-scale outbreak still occurs for the policy with longest vaccination duration. This emphasizes the importance of quantity and timing in designing a vaccination program against influenzas.
