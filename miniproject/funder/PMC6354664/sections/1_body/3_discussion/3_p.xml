<p>The uncertain vaccine efficacy is an important consideration for planning a vaccination program. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the policies of doubling vaccination doses can still mitigate the amplitude of infections although the vaccine efficacy is at a below-average level. Neither increasing vaccination doses nor reducing vaccination period reduce infections when vaccine efficacy is as low as 20%.</p>
