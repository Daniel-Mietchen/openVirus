<p>The experiments were designed by referring to the current immunization program in Taiwan. Two levels of vaccination scales and four levels of campaign duration were considered to explore the effects of vaccination policies. 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarizes the studied policies. The first class of policies (from A-1 to A4) considered the vaccination scale implemented prior to 2016 that ordered 3 million doses of vaccine, and covered the population aged 0 to 12 and above 65 years old. Another set of policies (from B-1 to B-4) referred to the current implemented program of 6 million ordered doses with the target population of age 0 to 18 and above 50 years old. All vaccination policies were launched on week 40 (October first). Four scenarios on vaccination duration were investigated. The longest durations (A-1) lasted 4 months followed by the A-2 policy in 3 months, the A-3 policy in 2 months, and the shortest policy of A-4 in 1 month. A similar setting was applied for the policies of B-1 to B-4.
