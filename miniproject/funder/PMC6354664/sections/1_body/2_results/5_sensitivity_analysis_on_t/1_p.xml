<p>Vaccine efficacy fluctuation is usually associated with the drifting or recirculating of influenza viruses. In addition to investigating different epidemic scenarios, an analysis of both regular epidemic and 2009 pandemic scenarios with average vaccine efficacy (59%), below-average vaccine efficacy (50%), and the lowest vaccine efficacy (20%) was conducted to assess the effect that vaccine efficacy had on vaccination policies. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6">Figure 6</xref> displays the simulation result of average new infected cases for the three vaccine efficacy levels. As one can expect, all vaccination policies obtained more infections when vaccine efficacy decreased. For example, infected cases were increased between 250,000 to 350,000 for each policy if vaccine efficacy decreased from 59 to 50%. A larger scale of increasing on new infections observed when vaccine efficacy reduced to 20%.
