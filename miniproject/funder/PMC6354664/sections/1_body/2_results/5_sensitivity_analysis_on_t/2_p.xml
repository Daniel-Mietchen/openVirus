 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Figure 7</xref> displays cases averted by vaccine policies under various vaccine efficacy levels. In the regular epidemic scenarios, when vaccine efficacy was below the average value (50% vaccine efficacy), most A- policies obtained negative numbers of cases averted except for the policy that completed vaccination in one month (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7B</xref>). Compared to the situation when vaccine efficacy performed regularly (59% vaccine efficacy), the cases averted became positive when the vaccine period was shorter than three months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Fig. 7A</xref>). The policies of providing double vaccine doses (B1-B4 policies) averted more than 656,045 new infections (about 21% reduction from base case) if the vaccine efficacy is equal to or above 50%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7">Figure 7C</xref> reports cases averted when vaccine efficacy is 20%. All vaccination polices obtained a more close performance (−1,719,179∼−587,740 averted cases) compare with the simulation results using higher vaccine efficacy. In the presence of regular (59%) vaccine efficacy, potential infections can be averted by either adding vaccination doses to the population or reducing vaccination period. When the vaccine efficacy is 50%, the number of infections can be reduced only by adding vaccination doses. There is no chance to reduce infections if vaccine efficacy is as low as 20%. We further analyze the low vaccine efficacy effect in the 2009-like pandemic scenario (
