<p>The vaccination rate used the empirical data of 35% for children ≤3 years old, 75% for 4–18 years old population, and 44% for the population 65 years old and above. The arrival rate for the population aged 50–64 is assumed as 35%. We assumed that the new infections and recipient arrivals were Poisson distributed with the parameter setting as follows. The weekly arrival percentage was determined by the actual vaccine coverage rates divided by the number of weeks during the vaccination period. Then, the mean of Poisson distribution used the weekly arrival percentage multiplied by the number of the target population. When vaccine inventory is in short, the distribution policy considers a fair fill rate across all locations. Population data were collected from the government, and stratified by six age groups of 0–3, 4–12, 13–18, 19–49, 50–64, and ≥65, and twenty-two counties (

The pediatric vaccine was for the children less than or equal to three years old, and the adult vaccine was for the remaining age groups. The time unit was weekly, and there were fifty-two time periods in a simulation run.
