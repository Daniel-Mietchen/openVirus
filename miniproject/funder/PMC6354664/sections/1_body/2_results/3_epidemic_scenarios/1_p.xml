<p>The effectiveness of vaccination policies was evaluated under various epidemic scenarios. The first scenario (regular epidemic) used the estimated the weekly transmission rates of 2013–2015. Furthermore, vaccine efficacy was set as 59% according to the summary of the literature review (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Osterholm et al., 2012</xref>). The second scenario (2009-like pandemic) considered the irregular transmission pattern by using the actual transmission rate in each week in 2009. The transmission rate in each county was in similar due to the high population density and frequent domestic travels in Taiwan. Thus, our analysis used a unify transmission rate for all locations and assumed that the infected population could transmit diseases to the susceptible population within the same county. The vaccine efficacy was also reviewed according to the laboratory experiment for the monovalent vaccines reported in the literature. The simulation parameters for different vaccination policies under regular epidemic and 2009-like pandemic scenarios are summarized in
