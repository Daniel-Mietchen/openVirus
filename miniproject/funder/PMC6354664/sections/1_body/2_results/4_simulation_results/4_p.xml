 <xref rid="table-5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> displays the vaccination policies’ performances in the 2009-like epidemic scenario. The overall infections were greater than the regular epidemic scenario due to the higher transmission rates in 2009. The number of new infections reduced when shortening the vaccination period (109,765 for policy A-3 and 361,173 for policy A4), while policies with long vaccination period led to a negative number of cases averted (−370,316 for policy A-1 and −134,351 for policy A-2). Only augmenting vaccination doses obtained a lessening effect on the cases averted compared with the “regular epidemic” scenario, in which cases averted are 1,201,839∼1,188,321 the in the 2009-like epidemic scenario versus 1,324,635∼1,279,613 in the regular epidemic scenario. The explanation is that the first outbreak in 2009 occurred before the vaccines were available, and therefore, the immunization program could only avert the infections during the second wave in December.
