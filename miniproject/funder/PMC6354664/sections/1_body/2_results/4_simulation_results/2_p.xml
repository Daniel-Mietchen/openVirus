 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the numbers of new infections decreased when shortening the vaccination duration (A-1 &gt; A-2 &gt; A-3 &gt; A-4, and B-1 &gt; B-2 &gt; B-3 &gt; B-4). Vaccination programs during the 2013–2015 seasons were completed in three months. Thus, the policies shorter than three months (i.e., A-3 and A-4) obtained more positive cases averted. Policies with the shortest duration (A-4 and B-4) reduced infections from the longest duration policies (A-1 and B-1) by 742,536 reduced new infected cases for the three million doses policy and 697,513 reduced new infected cases for the six million doses policy. When doubling the vaccination scale, the B policies averted approximately 1.27 million more cases of infection than the corresponding polices. Policy B-4 obtained the best result among the eight policies.
