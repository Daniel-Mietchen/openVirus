 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Figure 4</xref> depicts the curves of weekly infections for the actual and vaccination policies. The policy A-2 obtained the closest estimation because the settings of coverage population and vaccination duration are identical with the actual situation. A considerable decline in the B policies indicated the effect of adding the three million doses to the vaccination campaign. Additionally, shortening the vaccination period lowered the peaks of transmission in both cases of coverage population. It is notable that no epidemic peaks occurred when vaccinating six million doses within three months (i.e., B-2, B-3, and B4 policies).
