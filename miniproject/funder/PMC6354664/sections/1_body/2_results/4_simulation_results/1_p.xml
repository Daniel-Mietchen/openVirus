<p>The stochastic disease model obtained vaccination outcomes under different epidemic scenarios. We reported the simulation result in 
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Tables 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="table-5" ref-type="table">5</xref> for the regular epidemic and the 2009-like epidemic, respectively. The average ILIs were calculated based on five replications of simulation. Also, the actual ILIs (in the first row of the tables) provided a baseline for evaluating vaccination policies. The cases averted in the A-1 to A-4 policies represented the decrease or increase of new infections by adjusting vaccination durations. While the cases averted in the B-1 to B-4 policies implied the effects of augmenting the vaccine coverage from the previous season of three million doses to six million doses.
