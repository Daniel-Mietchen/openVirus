 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Figure 5</xref> presents new infections each week to understand the new H1N1 outbreak concerning the immunization outcomes of vaccination policies. The first epidemic in Taiwan was observed in September followed by another larger outbreak in December. Vaccines were available for the target population after the first outbreak. Consequently, all vaccination policies did not affect the transmission prior to October. Both shortening the vaccination period and adding vaccine doses mitigated the total infections, but were unable to aviod major outbreaks in December until the vaccine period was reduced by one month. A significant reduction in the peak level during the outbreak in December was observed for the A-4, B-3 and B-4 policies. Also, administering 3 million doses in one month (A-4) obtained a lower peak level than vaccinating 6 million doses in 3 or 4 months (B-1 and B-2). These results imply that implementing an immediate vaccination activity during the epidemic can control the diseases effectively.
