 <p>Virulence can be defined as disease severity; virulence of a pathogen may evolve as the rates of host mortality and transmission are balanced. HIV virulence trends are estimated using set point viral load, a proxy for the rate of HIV disease progression. To assess the capacity for HIV virulence to evolve and to place published virulence trends in an evolutionary context, we developed an evolutionary model based on HIV viral load dynamics. Our model reveals that HIV virulence evolves to an optimal set point (âˆ¼4.75 log10 copies/mL) similar to levels seen in natural populations. In comparing published trends to model-based trends, we infer: a) published trends are consistent with HIV adaptation to the human population; and b) variation among published trends may be explained by epidemic context or by sampling biases resulting from improvements in HIV screening and diagnosis. We also assess trends in HIV community viral load, defined as the mean viral load of all reported viral loads in a community, and thought to reflect a population's transmission potential. We find that community viral load evolves in association with set point, in the absence of prevention programs like antiretroviral therapy, and does not necessarily predict HIV incidence.</p>
