   <bold>Heritability of SPVL between source and recipient transmission pairs.</bold> Linear regression coefficients of donor and recipient SPVLs estimated for each year of a 100-year simulated epidemic (initial mean SPVL = 4.5 and initial user-defined heritability parameter

   <sup>2</sup> = 0.5 (Equation 6)). Estimates of SPVL heritability decrease over the course of the epidemic, as expected with decreasing variance in SPVL. Inset plot is recipient SPVL by source SPVL at year 40 of a simulated epidemic.
