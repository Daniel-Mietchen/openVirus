  <title>Mean community viral load is not linearly or consistently associated with annual incidence.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Plot of yearly estimates of mean community viral load versus annual incidence, for 100 years of a simulated epidemic. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Distributions of 
   <italic>P</italic>-values for Spearman correlations between mean community viral load and incidence, by year, for 10-year periods from the same 100 year epidemic, from a sliding window of 10 with one year increments. Shown are a plot of CVL and incidence for a 100-year simulated epidemic, Spearman correlation coefficients between CVL and incidence for each overlapping 10-year period, and 
   <italic>P</italic>-value for each Spearman correlation test. Significant associations between CVL and incidence can be positive or negative, depending on epidemic context.
