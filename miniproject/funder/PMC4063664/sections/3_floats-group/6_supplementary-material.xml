   <bold>Recreation of simple SPVL sampling biases.</bold> The schematic illustrates two types of potential sampling biases, each reconstructed within a 20-year period (randomly-selected from a larger 100-year epidemic). Each 20-year period is divided into two 10-year periods, with the second 10-year period sub-sampled to recreate a sampling bias that may occur as an HIV epidemic progresses within a clinic, cohort, region or country. The blue region illustrates a sampling bias caused by improved diagnosis of symptomatic cases in the 2
   <sup>nd</sup> 10-year period (symptomatic cases are associated with higher viral loads; SPVLs&gt;5.0 log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/mL). In this case, one will not sample a greater portion of individuals with low set point viral loads as the epidemic progresses, which we simulate by removing a portion of the individuals with SPVL&lt;5.0 log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/mL in the 2
   <sup>nd</sup> 10-year period (light blue circles). This would lead to an higher estimated rate of SPVL change over time. The green region illustrates a sampling bias caused by increased rates of earlier ART initiation to symptomatic individuals in the 2
   <sup>nd</sup> 10-year period. In this case there are fewer people with higher SPVLs to sample, which we simulate by removing a portion of the individuals with SPVL&gt;5.0 log
   <sub>10</sub> copies/mL in the 2
   <sup>nd</sup> 10-year period (light green circles). This would lead to an lower estimated rate of SPVL change over time.
