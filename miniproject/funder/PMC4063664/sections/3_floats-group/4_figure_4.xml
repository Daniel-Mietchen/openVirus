  <title>A. Distributions of SPVL trends change as simulated epidemics progress.</title>
  <p>More extreme SPVL trends occur very early in simulated epidemics (the first 20 years). Boxplots of linear SPVL trends estimated from 100 randomly sampled 20-year time periods; thick line = median; box edges = quartiles; whiskers = minimum and maximum trends. 
   <bold>B.</bold>
   <bold>Trends in mean community viral load and mean set point viral load are related.</bold> Mean community viral load can evolve over time in the absence of HIV prevention programs. Community viral loads are estimated for each day using viral load measurements from each infected and alive individual, except for those individuals who have been infected less than 45 days (acute infection lasts for 3 months days in these simulations).
