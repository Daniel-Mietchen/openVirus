  <title>The effect of sampling biases on the estimation of model-based SPVL trends.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>A.</bold> Comparison of distribution of 20-year linear SPVL trends estimated from unbiased (black lines, initial mean SPVL = 3.5; grey lines, initial mean SPVL = 4.5) and biased (dotted lines, multiple colors representing multiple sub-sampling levels) data sets. The underlying distributions are produced from years 0 to 100 from simulated epidemics. Removing subsets (%) of all individuals (a schematic representation of the biased sampling process is shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003673.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) results in a distribution of linear trends with a median SPVL trend of greater magnitude than the unbiased trends. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Comparison of distribution of 20-year linear SPVL trends estimated from unbiased and biased data sets, but with the underlying distributions produced from years 10 to 40 from simulated epidemics.
