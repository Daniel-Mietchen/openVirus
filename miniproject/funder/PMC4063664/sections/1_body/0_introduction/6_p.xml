<p>Our primary aims are to understand both the underlying causes of empirical SPVL trends and also the variation among populations/cohorts in the estimation of these trends (rather than variation in SPVL among individuals

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Mller1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, or the relative contributions of viral genetic and environmental factors to SPVL variation 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Shirreff1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). To do this, we estimate the temporal changes in SPVL that can result from adaptive viral evolution in human populations, and we assess deviations from these trends related to virologic parameters such as initial mean SPVL, maximum per-contact transmission rate, or epidemic stage. We also examine the effects of potential sampling biases due to improvements in the rates of HIV diagnosis, changes in cohort recruitment procedures, or earlier initiation of ART after diagnosisâ€”biases that were not explicitly considered by the studies of empirical SPVL trends described in the meta-analysis.
