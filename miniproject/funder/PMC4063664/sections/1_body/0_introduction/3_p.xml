<p>The causes of this variability remain unexplained, but may include estimation methods (clinical or statistical) or differences among the HIV cohorts (and associated local epidemics) in which trends were studied. These cohorts contain primarily men of European descent with HIV subtype B infections. Our previous analysis of study parameters in these 8 cohorts (including transmission risk group frequency, sample size, length, calendar year time period, seroconversion lag, and sampling lag) showed that only seroconversion lag was associated with SPVL trend; 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, shorter periods between the last negative and first positive HIV-1 antibody tests were correlated with increased SPVL trends. It followed that for the 6 of 8 studies in the meta-analysis that were prospective seroconverter cohorts, the summary SPVL trend was 0.018 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year, 38% greater than the summary trend of 0.013 copies/mL/year for all eight cohorts (including both seroconverter and seroprevalent cohorts). However, this explanation for variation in SPVL trends is insufficient, as trends from seroconverter cohorts are still highly variable (range: âˆ’0.002 to 0.035 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year)
