<p>We have developed a stochastic, agent-based HIV evolutionary and epidemic model based on the dynamics of HIV viral load. This model is unique for HIV epidemic models in that it allows for the viral virulence phenotype (set point viral load) to change over the course of an epidemic. The model contains known functions related to viral load trajectories in acute, chronic and disease stages, viral load and transmission probability, SPVL and disease progression rate, and the heritability of SPVL across transmission pairs. These components provide an evolutionary framework in which a balance is achieved between efficient transmission and slow disease progression. This type of evolutionary structure for HIV transmission potential was proposed by Fraser
