<p>Positive trends in mean population SPVL (HIV virulence) may reflect the process of viral adaptive evolution in the human population; recent modeling studies 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Shirreff1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> have proposed the existence of an evolutionarily optimal SPVL of 4.52 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL, defined as the viral load that balances transmission probability with infected lifespan. For example, low SPVL will result in lower infectivity but more total transmissions (due to greater life expectancy), whereas high SPVL will result in high infectivity but fewer total transmissions (due to decreased life expectancy). The proposed optimal SPVL of 4.52 log
 <sub>10</sub> was qualitatively consistent with mean SPVL levels found in the Amsterdam Cohort Study (4.36 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the Zambian Transmission Study (4.74 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Fideli1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Mean SPVLs in the studies included in our meta-analysis were also qualitatively similar to 4.52, albeit with a wider range (from 4.25 to 5.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL). An even greater range in population viral loads was seen in a review of 57 studies, where medians ranged from 3.7 and 5.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL and the overall median was 4.45 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Korenromp1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These 57 studies were not studies of SPVL distributions, specifically; however, viral loads in the asymptomatic period are generally stable and likely to be close to SPVL
