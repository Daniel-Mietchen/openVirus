<p>A secondary aim is to understand trends in HIV community viral load (CVL). CVL is typically defined as the arithmetic or geometric mean (or median) of all reported individual viral loads (individuals diagnosed and sampled, with detectable viral load) in a specific community. CVL is considered to be a heuristic proxy for overall transmission potential (and level of HIV-associated health care) in a given community

Thus, the ability to accurately assess trends in CVL is critical for prevention programs that promote reduced population viral load and transmission potential as a measure of effectiveness: CVL needs to be a robust and informative metric for comparisons through time, meaningfully related to HIV epidemiological parameters that are important to the public health community. However, recent work has described potential pitfalls in the relationship between CVL and transmission potential (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In our analysis, we focused on the potential evolutionary context of trends in CVL: there are similarities between the estimation of SPVL and CVL trends, and we hypothesize that understanding biases related to SPVL trends will inform our understanding of CVL trends. Overall, we expect our model will improve our understanding of HIV epidemics and the virologic metrics that are used to study them.
