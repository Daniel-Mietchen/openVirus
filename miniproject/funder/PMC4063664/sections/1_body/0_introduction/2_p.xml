<p>The estimation of epidemic trends in HIV virulence includes the measurement and analysis of proxy markers for HIV disease progression, with set point viral load (SPVL) the most prognostic single marker of the time to AIDS after HIV infection

While exact definitions of SPVL vary, it is generally the HIV plasma RNA viral load after the resolution of acute infection, but within 6 months to two years after seroconversion (and prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy). We previously completed a meta-analysis of 8 published studies of population-level trends in SPVL; our meta-analysis found a positive summary trend (0.013 log
