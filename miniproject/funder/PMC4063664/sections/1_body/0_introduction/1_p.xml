<p>Virulence can be defined as the severity of disease caused by a pathogen; the virulence of a pathogen may evolve within a host population as the rates of transmission and host mortality are balanced by natural selection. For HIV, virulence can be defined as the rate of disease progression in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. Understanding if HIV virulence has evolved will inform our understanding of HIV epidemiology and pathogenesis, as increases in HIV virulence would result in more rapid disease progression
