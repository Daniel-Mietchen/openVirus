<p>This component includes HIV-uninfected people, HIV-infected people, and people who have died of AIDS. Each simulation starts with 
 <italic>N</italic> total HIV-uninfected and infected individuals at time zero, with each infected individual (of 
 <italic>n</italic> total HIV-infected individuals) provided a SPVL value following from a Gaussian distribution with user-defined mean and variance, with the variance parameter following published estimates

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Korenromp1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Entry of new (uninfected) individuals into the population is at a constant input rate such that the population, in absence of HIV infection, will stay at its initial value. Infected individuals may die of their HIV infections according to formulas given below. Further model details are given in
