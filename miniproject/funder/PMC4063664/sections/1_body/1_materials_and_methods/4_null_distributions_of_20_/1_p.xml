<p>We sought to place published SPVL trends in the context of results from our epidemic model. To do this, we created hypothetical null distributions of SPVL trends for epidemics with initial mean SPVL values equal to 3.5, 4.5, or 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL. For each of the 10 replicate runs for each initial mean SPVL, we randomly chose 100 separate 20-year time periods with replacement; we chose 20-year periods as most empirical estimates of SPVL trends cover 20-year periods. From each of these 20-year time periods we estimated a univariate linear regression of SPVL by calendar year of infection. This created a distribution of 1Ã—10
 <sup>3</sup> possible observed SPVL trends (100 20-year periods from 10 replicate model runs) for any given set of model parameters, where only the starting random number seed and the randomly chosen 20-year period were different between trend estimates.
