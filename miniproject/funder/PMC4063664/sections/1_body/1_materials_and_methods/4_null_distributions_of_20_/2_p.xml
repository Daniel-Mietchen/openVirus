<p>The HIV epidemics of European and North American countries are younger than 100 years; the first introduction of HIV to the US is estimated to have occurred in 1969 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> with introductions to Europe following. Empirical SPVL trends have been estimated most often using data from approximately 1985 to 2010 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Herbeck3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This may affect our choice of an appropriate null distribution for SPVL trends produced by our model. To accommodate this uncertainty we created separate null distributions, each spanning a different subset of the complete 100-year simulated epidemics: a) all 100 years of the model output; b) years 10–100 of the model output, under the assumption that European and North American subtype B epidemics began ∼1970, which, as studies of empirical SPVL trends began sampling at the earliest in 1984, leaves a ∼10-year window of the HIV epidemic that was not sampled by cohorts; c) years 0–40 of the model output, under the assumption that because empirical studies of SPVL trends include years up to ∼2010, this represents the first 40 years of the subtype B epidemic (∼1970 to 2010); and d) years 10–40, the most restrictive null, meant to reflect the empirical sampling years ∼1980 to 2010.
