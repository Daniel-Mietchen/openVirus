<p>For each day in a simulated epidemic, we calculated community viral load (CVL) as the mean and median viral load of all HIV-infected individuals who were currently in day 45 or greater of their infection (one half of the time to reach set point; with the length of acute infection set to 90 days in our standard parameter settings). This threshold is meant to mimic empirical estimates of CVL, where the majority of individuals in early acute infection are unsampled and do not contribute to CVL estimates.</p>
