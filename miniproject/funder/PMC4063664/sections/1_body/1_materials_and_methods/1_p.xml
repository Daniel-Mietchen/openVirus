<p>We have constructed a stochastic agent-based HIV epidemic model that simulates viral load dynamics within and between individuals. The model has four main components: 1) the distribution of set point viral load (SPVL) in a population of HIV-infected individuals linked via a sexual contact network (the population component)

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Herbeck2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; 2) the predictive relationship between HIV viral load and the per-contact viral transmission rate

The model includes fixed parameters (with estimates following from previous studies, when possible) and variable parameters (with unknown or uncertain estimates that we varied to evaluate their effects on epidemic and evolutionary output) (
