<p>To examine the potential for adaptive evolution of HIV virulence, we examined 10 replicate epidemic simulations for three different values of initial population mean SPVL (3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 log10 copies/mL). Trends in SPVL were calculated by regressing against the times of infection recorded for each individual (each individual had individual-specific SPVL and time of infection).</p>
