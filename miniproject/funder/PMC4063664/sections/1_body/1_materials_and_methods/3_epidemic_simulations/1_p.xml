<p>We ran epidemic simulations for 100 years, in discrete time-steps of one day. For each model run we tracked individual viral load trajectories, infected lifespan, sexual partnerships and transmission histories, and epidemic growth or decline, and we estimated population measures of AIDS mortality, SPVL trends and heritability. The mean, median, and variance of SPVL in the population could be calculated directly at any day in a simulated epidemic. Likewise, the mean, median, and variance of community viral load (CVL) could be calculated at any day using the viral load from each currently alive and infected individual. We conducted sensitivity analyses on each parameter from
