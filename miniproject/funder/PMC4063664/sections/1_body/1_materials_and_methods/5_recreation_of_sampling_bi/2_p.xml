<p>We recreated the above types of biased sampling in simulated epidemics as follows: 1) we divided randomly chosen 20-year epidemic periods (used to estimate SPVL trends) into individuals infected in years 1–10 versus years 11–20; 2) from the latter subpopulation (years 11–20), we created subsamples that included individuals with SPVLs either greater or less than SPVL = 5.0 log
