<p>Two distinct types of sampling biases may potentially result from the fact that HIV viral loads in primary infection are higher in symptomatic individuals

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Kelley1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>: a trend in mean SPVL may result from improvements over time in referral or cohort recruitment practices

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Janssen2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. For example, if rapid progressors are more readily identified and diagnosed as the epidemic progresses, and these individuals initiate ART before set point is measured, then fewer individuals with (relatively) high SPVL will be sampled as the epidemic ages. This is a bias caused by earlier diagnosis and ART initiation, and may lead to inferred trends of decreasing virulence. Alternatively, if increased diagnosis and recruitment of newly infected individuals is associated with improvements in referral or cohort recruitment, but does 
 <italic>not</italic> lead to earlier ART initiation, biased sampling in the opposite direction may result. In this case, relatively more symptomatic individuals would be sampled, and trends of increasing virulence may be inferred. (We recognize that increased and earlier diagnosis not leading to earlier ART initiation is not consistent with current clinical practice; however, most published studies of HIV virulence trends included sampling years from the 1980s and 1990s.)
