<p>To assess the published empirical trends in SPVL, we created hypothetical null distributions of 20-year linear trends in SPVL and placed the empirical trends within these distributions. Because local epidemics with published SPVL trends may have unique epidemic and evolutionary contexts, particularly the SPVL (virulence) of the founding viral strain, we created null distributions of SPVL trends for simulated epidemics with initial SPVL means of 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL. Notably, the simulated and empirical trends are within the same magnitude (between âˆ’0.02 to 0.03 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year), which suggests that adaptive HIV evolution may explain observed trends in HIV virulence.
