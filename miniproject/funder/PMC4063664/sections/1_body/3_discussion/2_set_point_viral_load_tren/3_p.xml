<p>What explains the variation among empirical trends? The placement of the empirical SPVL trends spans the three null distributions; yet, five (out of eight) lie within the upper distribution (&gt;0.01 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year) of the simulated trends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g002">Figures 2A</xref>). If we narrow our null distribution to years 10 to 40 of simulated epidemics to better reflect the years 1980 to 2010 of European and North American subtype B epidemics, the empirical trends of greater magnitude appear more consistent with model-based trends; these empirical trends are consistent with these epidemics being founded by viral populations of low virulence (virulence less than the optimal level) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We know from the respective publications that 4 of these 5 empirical trends belong to HIV cohorts with initial mean or median SPVLs less than our model-predicted optimal SPVL (&lt;âˆ¼4.75): 3.6

 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL (the first sampling period for these studies was most often a 2 to 5-year period starting in 1985; this would correspond to a time approximately between years 15 to 20 in our simulated epidemics). It is essential for future work to compare simulated adaptive evolution of SPVL to real epidemic data, using phylodynamic analysis to reconstruct epidemic histories overlaid with empirical and simulated SPVL trends.
