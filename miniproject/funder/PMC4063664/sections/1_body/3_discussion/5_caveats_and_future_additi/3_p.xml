<p>We plan to extend our model and analysis by comparing virulence trends among populations with more complex sexual mixing patterns, and among populations with varying sample fractions at different stages of an ART treatment cascade. We hope this epidemic modeling approach based on viral dynamics will be a useful tool in the prediction or evaluation of potential outcomes of prevention programs.</p>
