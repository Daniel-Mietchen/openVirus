<p>The global HIV pandemic is one of multiple separate epidemics that can be stratified by viral genotype (subtypes or circulating recombinant forms)

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Lewis1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Our model is not designed to recapitulate the entire global pandemic, but rather local epidemics containing a single subtype. The disease progression function of our model is based on subtype B data; it is possible that the relationship between SPVL and disease progression is different across subtypes

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Kiwanuka1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, but the disease progression function likely holds for different risk groups within local subtype B epidemics (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Fraser1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> that saturates at viral loads results in slower epidemic growth rates. Elevating this rate to perhaps better reflect transmission rates in the general population results in more realistic growth rates but a similar level of optimal virulence. Additionally, SPVL is known to vary among hosts due to host genetics (HLA type) 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Fellay1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>; our model does not distinguish among individuals in their susceptibility to infection or host effect on SPVL (which can influence transmission and disease progression). Nor does our model allow for variation within individuals in viral reproductive rate; 
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, in our model all viral lineages within a single person are assumed to contain the same viral genetic factors for viral reproduction and SPVL/virulence. When this is not the case, and virions within a host are allowed to vary in reproductive rate, it is theoretically possible that different evolutionary trends in relation to optimal SPVL may be seen
