<p>Our model includes simple demographic and sexual mixing terms, which we believe are sufficient to address the issues explored in this paper. A notable result from our model epidemics was the relatively low frequency of transmissions from “early HIV infection” relative to other published estimates 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. For our standard epidemic runs, ∼10% to 25% of infections took place while the source partner was in “early HIV infection” (with “early HIV infection defined as either the duration of acute infection or the first year of infection, respectively). Further work will clarify whether our low estimates suggest that behavioral or network parameters (rather than strictly viral dynamics, as included in our model) are the likely source of the high contribution of early HIV infection to onward transmission that is reported elsewhere. An additional possible cause of the high reported frequencies of transmission in early HIV infection are viral genetic factors associated with increased transmissibility in early infection

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Redd1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>; our model does not provide viruses with stage-specific transmission probabilities.
