<p>While our model results suggest that adaptive evolution may explain empirical trends, and that epidemic context may explain variation in empirical trends, we also assessed whether trends and variation among trends could be the result of cohort-specific sampling biases. To do so, we recreated two types of simple biases: improvements in diagnosis that result in increased sampling of high virulence individuals; or earlier ART initiations that result in decreased sampling of high virulence individuals. We found that the empirical SPVL trends are consistent with biased trends resulting from improved diagnosis of symptomatic cases. Whether this particular type of sampling bias may explain the empirical trends—as opposed to being explained by adaptive evolution—requires study of specific cohort clinical and community practices. Diagnosis of symptomatic individuals without earlier ART initiation is not consistent with clinical practice; it is unclear what the strength of this bias could be over time in HIV cohorts, and it is likely that both of the potential biases recreated here do exist (to some relative degree) in every HIV cohort.</p>
