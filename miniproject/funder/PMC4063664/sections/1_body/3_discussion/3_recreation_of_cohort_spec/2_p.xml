<p>We can try to infer, using data from the meta-analysis of observed SPVL trends 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Herbeck1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and our model output, which potential type of sampling bias is stronger in the empirical data. The meta-analysis contained 8 studies of SPVL trends, 6 of which were prospective cohorts that estimated virulence trends using only SPVL data from individuals with an estimated date of HIV infection. These 
 <italic>seroconverter cohorts</italic> are less vulnerable to sampling biases, because individuals enter the cohort uninfected. In the meta-analysis, the summary SPVL trend for all eight cohorts (including both seroconverter and seroprevalent cohorts) was 0.013 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year, 38% lower than the summary trend of 0.018 seen for the six seroconverter cohorts. A discrepancy between trend estimates in this direction (decreasing SPVL trend) is consistent with a sampling bias caused by earlier ART initiation in the seroprevalent cohorts. (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> the lower SPVL trends in the seroprevalent cohorts could be explained by a sampling bias caused by earlier ART initiation in those populations). This hypothesis is consistent with decreasing clinical thresholds for ART initiation (
