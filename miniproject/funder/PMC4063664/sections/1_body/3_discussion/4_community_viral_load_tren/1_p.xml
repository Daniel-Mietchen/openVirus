<p>The use of community viral load as a population-level metric of HIV transmission potential has been proposed

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-CDC1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To date few studies, empirical or modeling, have assessed this proposition thoroughly 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>; for CVL to be a useful tool for public health inferences, it must accurately and precisely reflect HIV epidemiological parameters of interest. There are similarities between the estimation of SPVL and CVL trends—we hypothesize that understanding the underlying causes or sampling biases related to SPVL trends can inform our understanding of CVL trends. With our model, we attempted to evaluate the possible affects of HIV epidemic and evolutionary context on trends in mean CVL. Our findings suggest the relationship between CVL and incidence is not straightforward, yet is strongly modulated by epidemic context, including: 1) the initial mean SPVL of an epidemic; and 2) the epidemic stage in which the CVL and incidence relationship is evaluated. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, significant associations between CVL and incidence can be identified in simulated epidemics, but there are both positive and negative associations. In this scenario CVL is not a robust population-level metric of HIV transmission potential. However, our estimate of CVL does not include individuals on ART with depressed viral loads and thus does not perfectly coincide with real world applications. Nevertheless, our model shows that attempts to infer transmission potential from CVL can give highly misleading results, as CVL is influenced by both historical and evolutionary factors.
