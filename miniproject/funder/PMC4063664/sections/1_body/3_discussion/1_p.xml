<p>We developed a stochastic agent-based HIV evolutionary and epidemic model that allows for the virulence phenotype, defined by the set point viral load, to change over time. The model is based on viral dynamic functions of transmission, disease progression, and heritability, but retains standard HIV epidemic model output such as prevalence, incidence and the proportion of transmissions occurring during different stages of infection. With this model we addressed questions related to HIV virulence evolution, sampling biases, and epidemic context, and explored how viral dynamic parameters affect SPVL trends and epidemic growth. We also addressed questions about the relationship between community viral load and incidence, in order to assess the use of community viral load as a useful public health metric.</p>
