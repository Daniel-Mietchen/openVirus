<p>An assumption inherent to many studies of HIV virulence is that SPVL trends will be linear. This assumption is likely false, as epidemic growth or decline is affected by the availability of susceptible individuals (among other factors); epidemics may not experience constant linear growth, and thus evolutionary pressures on the virus may shift over the course of an epidemic. Furthermore, processes of HIV evolution, including natural selection and genetic drift, can be affected in complex ways by changes in the viral effective population size (measured in this context most simply as prevalence). We examined the distribution of SPVL slopes in progressing stages of simulated epidemics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). For simulated epidemics with varying initial mean SPVLs (3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL), the distribution of slopes changed over time, as more extreme slopes (further away from zero) occurred in the first 20 years of epidemics, and all distributions converged to near zero as the epidemic entered years 40 and greater. This suggests that if the empirical SPVL trends are due to adaptive viral evolution, then we can hypothesize that local/regional epidemics (represented by national HIV cohort populations) with increasing SPVL were founded by viruses of low virulence (SPVLâˆ¼3.5).
