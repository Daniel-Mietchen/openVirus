<p>We next compared empirical SPVL trends to results from our model by producing null distributions of 20-year linear SPVL trends. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows the different null distributions for model runs with founder mean SPVLs of 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL, using all 100 years of simulated epidemics. Broadly, trends estimated from epidemics with initial mean SPVL = 3.5 were positive and trends from epidemics with initial mean SPVL = 4.5 or 5.5 were negative (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution for epidemics with starting mean SPVL = 4.5 included mostly negative trends despite the optimal SPVL equal to ∼4.75 copies/mL, due to transient increases in virulence early in epidemics, before the number of susceptible individuals begins to decrease (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Bolker1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. We compared the empirical SPVL trends to these null distributions, and the magnitudes of the empirical trends were similar to (and therefore consistent with) the model-based trends. The majority of these trends were located to the far right (positive) side of the distributions (SPVL trends&gt;0.01 log10 copies/mL/year) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). (95% confidence intervals for the empirical trends are overlaid on null distributions created from model years 0 to 100 in
