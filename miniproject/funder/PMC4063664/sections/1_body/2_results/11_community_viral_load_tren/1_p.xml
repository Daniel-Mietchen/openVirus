<p>In our simulated epidemics the mean CVL, measured as the mean or median of log
 <sub>10</sub>-transformed VL of all infected (and sampled) individuals in a population at a given time, changed over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). (Mean and median CVL are nearly identical in our simulations.) Community viral load evolved in association with SPVL: CVL trends were influenced by the initial mean SPVL of the founding population, and annual trends in mean/median CVL were qualitatively similar to annual SPVL trends. Mean CVL was consistently lower than mean SPVL due to frailty bias (individuals with low SPVLs were included in CVL estimates more often than individuals with high SPVLs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The variance around the mean CVL decreased over the first half of the model runs before stabilizing around 0.3 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL. The distribution of all viral loads in our simulations was qualitatively similar to the expected distribution proposed by Miller
