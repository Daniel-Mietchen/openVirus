<p>Next, we modified this model-based comparison of CVL and incidence in order to make comparisons more equivalent to the 10-year timescales of empirical observations of CVL 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Montaner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. We created a data set containing all 10-year time periods from the 100-year simulated epidemics, each created with a sliding window of length 10 years with increment of one year. For each of these 10-year periods, we estimated Spearman's rho and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value between yearly CVL and new infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). A minority of 10-year time periods from each epidemic (each initial mean SPVL) contained significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) associations between yearly mean CVL and number of infections, and the direction of association (Spearman's rho) alternated between positive and negative over the course of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These simulations were run in the absence of prevention programs such as antiretroviral therapy, yet suggest that mean CVL is not necessarily a strong predictor of HIV transmission potential.
