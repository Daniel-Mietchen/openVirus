<p>We assessed the hypothesis that CVL is a heuristic measure of a population's overall transmission potential,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1003673-Montaner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. First, for complete 100-year epidemic simulations, with initial mean SPVL values of 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL, we compared yearly values of mean CVL to annual incidence (infected/susceptible) for each year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Over this extended timescale, mean CVL and annual new infections were significantly correlated only for initial SPVL = 3.5 (Spearman's rho = 0.56,

 <sup>−</sup>09; for initial SPVL = 4.5, rho = 0.11, 
 <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.293; for initial SPVL = 5.5, rho = 0.12;
