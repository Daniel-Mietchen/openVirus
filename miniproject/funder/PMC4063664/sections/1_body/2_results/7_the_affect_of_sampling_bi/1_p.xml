<p>We simulated two types of sampling biases to begin in the latter half of 20-year time periods: 1) earlier ART initiation; and 2) increased rates of diagnosis (
 <italic>without</italic> associated earlier ART initiation). Hypothetically, these sampling biases may result in linear SPVL trends that are decreased and increased relative to true trends, respectively. Indeed, simulating these biases on model output resulted in incorrect estimates of the true evolutionary trends in SPVL (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows incremental positive shifts in SPVL trend distributions that result from increased sampling biases (by increasing the proportion of the HIV-infected population that is be affected by, in this example, increased rates of diagnosis without associated earlier ART). For this specific example (which included only simulated epidemics with initial mean SPVL = 3.5), the medians of biased SPVL trends were significantly different from the median of the true trend distribution (unbiased median = 0.0011; 10% removed median = 0.0028; 50% removed median = 0.0129 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year). Similar shifted distributions, though in the opposite direction, were found for biases due to earlier ART initiation.
