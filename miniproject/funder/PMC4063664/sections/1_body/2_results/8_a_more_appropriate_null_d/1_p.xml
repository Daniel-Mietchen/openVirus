 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the effect of sampling biases on null distributions produced from years 0 to 100 of simulated epidemics. As noted above, a more appropriate null distribution may be a time period from simulated epidemics that reflects the expected sampling times of HIV subtype B epidemics; this can be years 10 to 40 of simulated epidemics, reflecting approximately years 1980 to 2010. When this narrowed time period is used to recreate potential sampling biases, the effects on SPVL trend distributions are distinct than those seen when using the full 100 years of simulated epidemics: the median trend values increase significantly with more increased sampling biases (unbiased median = 0.0073; 10% removed median = 0.0094; 50% removed median = 0.0208 log
 <sub>10</sub> copies/mL/year), but all distributions overlapped extensively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003673-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In effect, with this narrow null distribution it is more difficult to distinguish between adaptive viral evolution and sampling biases as possible explanations for the empirical SPVL trends.
