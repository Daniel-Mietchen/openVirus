<p>We tested whether model output was sensitive to the parameters of the viral load functions. We initially focused on: 1) the viral load progression rate in chronic infection; 2) the maximum rate of progression to AIDS; and, 3) the maximum daily rate of transmission in the asymptomatic period. Variation in the rate of viral load increase and in the rate of disease progression had only minor effects on epidemic growth and the evolution of virulence (

With higher maximum transmission rates, the epidemic size increases more rapidly and virulence (SPVL) increases; these increases in SPVL were transient, however, as the supply of susceptible individuals soon declines and limits further epidemic growth. The evolutionarily optimal SPVL remains equivalent across different values of
