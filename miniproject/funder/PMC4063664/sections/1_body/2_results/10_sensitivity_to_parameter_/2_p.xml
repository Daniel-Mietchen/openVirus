In addition to the viral load progression rate, the maximum rate of disease progression, and the maximum transmission rate, we examined the effects of variation in other model parameters on SPVL trends. However, the time to peak viremia, the peak viral load in acute infection, the length of acute infection, the viral load at AIDS, the heritability of SPVL at time zero, and the mutational variance of SPVL all had minimal impacts on optimal SPVL.
