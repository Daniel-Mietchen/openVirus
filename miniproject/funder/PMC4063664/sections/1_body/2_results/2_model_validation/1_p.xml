<p>For model runs of 100 years with standard parameter values (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003673-t001">Table 1</xref>), we found the following: epidemic growth, starting from 500 HIV-infected individuals in an initial population size of 75,000 (infected and uninfected), varies across initial mean SPVL values. Runs with intermediate (4.5) and high (5.5) initial mean SPVLs resulted in faster rates of epidemic growth; these resulted in &gt;35,000 HIV-infected individuals before year 20 (
