<p>We developed a stochastic, agent-based, HIV evolutionary and epidemic model based on viral dynamics. Within this model, variation in SPVL across individuals is due to viral and other (host and environmental) factors. This provides an evolutionary framework based on viral transmission potential

Our primary goal is to understand the underlying causes of empirical SPVL trends and also the variation among cohorts/populations in the estimates of these SPVL trends.
