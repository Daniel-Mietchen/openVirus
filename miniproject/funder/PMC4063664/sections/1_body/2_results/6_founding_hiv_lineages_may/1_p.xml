<p>When we compared empirical SPVL trends to potentially more appropriate null distributions (produced by sampling only years 0 to 40, or years 10 to 40, of simulated epidemics), the empirical trends were even more similar to model-based trends. Specifically, the larger empirical trends (&gt;0.01 log10 copies/mL/year) were consistent with the median trends from null distributions for simulated epidemics with initial mean SPVL = 3.5 (

Thus, the larger empirical trends may be unbiased measures of adaptive viral evolution in populations where the initial founding viral lineages contained low virulence. The median SPVL trend for the null distribution produced from sampling from years 10 to 40 of epidemics with initial mean SPVL = 3.5 was 0.0073 log
