<p>For a standard epidemic run (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003673-t001">Table 1</xref>), ∼5% of all infections (over 100 year epidemic simulations) took place while the source partner was in “early HIV infection” (defined as 3 months, up to Fiebig stage V

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003673.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Changing the definition of “early HIV infection” to include the entire first year of infection increased the frequency of early infection transmissions to ∼20% of all transmissions (and this frequency is higher, ∼25%, if only simulated epidemic years 10 to 40 (∼1980 to 2010) were considered) (
