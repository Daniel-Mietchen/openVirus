<p>The recommendations outlined in [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were followed when carrying out the article search and selection process. A flow diagram of the article search and screening process is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164541.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched from 25 to 31 August of 2015 for relevant articles using the search queries identified in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164541.s004">S1 Table</xref>. Records were also identified through sources from relevant review papers and Liao’s 2011 thesis: see Refs. [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] for all review articles used. After these initial records were screened and relevant articles were chosen to be considered in full text screening, further records were identified through ancestry and descendant approaches. That is, searches for papers either citing or cited by these sources, using all of these initially identified articles.
