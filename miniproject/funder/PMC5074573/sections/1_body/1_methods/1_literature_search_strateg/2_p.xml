<p>A challenge to performing a successful meta-analysis is publication bias and associated dissemination biases [

These authors were chosen as contacts because they are assumed to be well acquainted with the current state of topic literature. Although contact with researchers yielded no additional records, publication bias is of minimal concern. Studies on behavioral response to epidemics/pandemics usually address multiple possible factors. It is a plausible assumption that the lack of significance of one particular factor, in this case gender, would not keep a study from being published.
