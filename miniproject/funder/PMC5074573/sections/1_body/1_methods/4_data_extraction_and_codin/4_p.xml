<p>For studies that did not include results on the basis of nonsignificance, the primary authors of these publications were contacted requesting results and associated error terms. In the case of nonresponse, missing nonsignificant results were excluded from the analysis. Although missing nonsignificant results may be treated as a perfect null value, meaning an effect size of zero, this approach is adequate only for rejecting the null hypothesis that gender plays no role in behavioral response and not for answering questions about size of effect and effect moderators [
