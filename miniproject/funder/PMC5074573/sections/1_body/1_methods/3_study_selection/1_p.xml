<p>Articles were screened against the above eligibility criteria at two stages: titles/abstract and full text. At the first stage, one reviewer (KM) screened the titles and abstracts of all identified texts for relevance. At the second stage, two reviewers (KM and SD) independently examined the full-text articles of all remaining records for eligibility based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. The second screening was duplicated in order to minimize selection bias. Discrepancies in exclusion choices were discussed and a final decision was made based on the criteria. The rationale for exclusion was recorded when a full-text article was reviewed and deemed unsuitable.</p>
