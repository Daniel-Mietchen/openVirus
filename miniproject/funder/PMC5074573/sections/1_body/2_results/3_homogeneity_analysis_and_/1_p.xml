<p>For homogeneity analysis the null hypothesis is that the distribution of effect sizes is homogeneous. Within the set of non-pharmaceutical studies, 
 <italic>Q</italic>(df = 49) = 314.930, rejecting the null hypothesis with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Within the set of pharmaceutical studies, 
 <italic>Q</italic>(df = 46) = 1835.4, rejecting the null hypothesis with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Due to the rejection of homogeneity for each set of effect sizes, a random-effects model was fitted for each dataset in order to determine the average true effect in the greater population of all possible studies. Results for the various random-effect models are summarized in
