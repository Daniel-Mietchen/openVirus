 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164541.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164541.g005">5</xref> the distribution of study effect sizes and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals are shown. The dashed reference line, placed at a log odds ratio of 0, corresponds to no gender difference in behavioral response. Studies with squares to the right of the reference line exhibit more female response, while studies with squares to the left of the reference exhibit more male response. The population mean effect size of the random-effects model incorporating these studies is given by the placement of the diamond at the bottom of the figure, while the horizontal corners of the diamond illustrate the 95% CI of this mean effect size.
