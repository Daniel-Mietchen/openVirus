<p>The random-effects model for non-pharmaceutical behaviors shows an average true effect of 
 <italic>μ</italic> = 0.402 (95% CI 0.307 to 0.496), implying that women are 49.5% (95% CI 35.9% to 64.2%) more likely than men to adopt/practice non-pharmaceutical behaviors in the general population. The estimated amount of total heterogeneity is 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.093, with 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 92.74% of the total variability in the effect size estimates is due to heterogeneity among the true effects. See
