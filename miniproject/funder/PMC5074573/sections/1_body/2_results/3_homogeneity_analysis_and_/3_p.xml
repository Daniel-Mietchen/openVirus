<p>The random-effects model for pharmaceutical behaviors shows an average true effect of 
 <italic>μ</italic> = −0.114 (95% CI -0.212 to -0.016), implying that men are marginally more likely (specifically, 12.1%, 95% CI 1.6% to 23.6%, more likely) than women to adopt/practice pharmaceutical behaviors in the general population. The estimated amount of total heterogeneity is 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.090, with nearly all of the total variability in the effect size estimates is due to heterogeneity among the true effects (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 99.78%). See
