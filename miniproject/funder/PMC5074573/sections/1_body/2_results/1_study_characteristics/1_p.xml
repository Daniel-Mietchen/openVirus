<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164541.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the literature search identified 10,797 records. A total of 10,616 records, including duplicates, were excluded during the initial screening and 96 publications were excluded during the full text screening. The most common reason for exclusion during full text screening was that the association between demographic traits and behavior was not reported. See 
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for the full distribution of reasons for exclusion. The level of agreement between the two reviewers (KM and SD) following the second round of screening was 88%, with 100% agreement reached following discussion of inconsistencies.
