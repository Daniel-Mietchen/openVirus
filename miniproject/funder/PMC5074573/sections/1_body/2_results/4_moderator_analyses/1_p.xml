<p>Mixed-effects models were constructed to test whether any of the heterogeneity among studies exhibited in the random-effects models was due to the influence of moderator variables. For each set of effect sizes publication year, continent, culture (Eastern, Western), country development (developed vs. developing), behavior type (intended, reported, actual), behavior category (preventive, avoidant, management), and overall percentage of respondents adopting/increasing the assessed protective behavior were assessed individually. No significant levels of heterogeneity within the non-pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical study sets were accounted for by any of these moderators. Results for the moderator analysis of the full study set are available in
