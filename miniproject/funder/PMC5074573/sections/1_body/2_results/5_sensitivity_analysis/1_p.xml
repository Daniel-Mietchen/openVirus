<p>Sensitivity analyses were performed on each set of studies in three ways: by removing effect size outliers, by using the trim-and-fill method, and by including studies whose results weren’t reported on the basis of non-significance. See 
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for a summary of sensitivity analysis results. Results for the sensitivity analysis of the full study set are available in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164541.s008">S1 Results</xref>. For the first sensitivity analysis, only one study [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] from the non-pharmaceutical study set had an effect size greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean and was removed, and none were removed from the pharmaceutical study set. Using the limited non-pharmaceutical dataset, both the fixed- and random-effects models still showed a significant effect size in favor of female behavioral response (
