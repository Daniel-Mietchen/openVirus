<p>When the trim-and-fill method was used to augment each set of studies, there were an estimated 9 studies missing from the non-pharmaceutical set and 4 studies missing from the pharmaceutical set. Even though the positive impact of female gender on non-pharmaceutical behavior estimated using the random-effects model is smaller with the missing studies filled in (
 <italic>μ</italic> = 0.320, 95% CI 0.223 to 0.418), the results still indicate that the effect is statistically significant. When the pharmaceutical set was filled in with the missing studies, the random-effects model showed that the direction of the relationship remained the same but lost significance (
 <italic>μ</italic> = −0.071, 95% CI -0.175 to 0.034). Funnel plots for each of these study sets are included in
