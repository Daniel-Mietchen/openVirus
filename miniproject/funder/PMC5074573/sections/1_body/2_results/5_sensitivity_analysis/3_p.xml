 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>] failed to report data on the basis of non-significance for all or some behaviors. In the final sensitivity analysis, these unreported results were included as 0s (in other words, neutral effects) in the relevant study set. This method generally leads to more conservative effect size estimates. With the inclusion of the unreported data in this analysis, the direction and significance of the relationship shown by each of the fixed- and random-effects models remained the same for both non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical behaviors.
