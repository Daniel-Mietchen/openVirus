<p>Further research could possibly elucidate which, if any, of these unexplored study-level differences moderate the relationship between gender and health-protective behavior. It also is possible that including a greater number of studies across a wider range of countries could elucidate a moderator effect that was simply too weak to be found in the present meta-analysis. However, a concern with assessing too wide a range of potential moderators is the possibility of falsely significant results appearing simply due to over-testing. The moderators addressed in this study balanced exploration and plausibility, while taking feasibility of moderator calculation into consideration.</p>
