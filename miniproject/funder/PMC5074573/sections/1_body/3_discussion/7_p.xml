<p>A wide array of health-protective behaviors were considered in this analysis. It may be argued that this leads to the problem of comparing apples and oranges, but the separation of the study sets into pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical groups mitigates this issue. In the case of non-pharmaceutical behaviors, a particular action is not as important to policy makers as a general behavioral trend, upon which health campaigns can base targeting and advertising. Similarly, mathematical disease models including behavior can use these results to parameterize demographic-based model values. In summary, the present study quantitatively suggests that gender influences health-protective behavioral response in the general public, with females being more likely to adopt/increase non-pharmaceutical behaviors and males being more likely to adopt/increase pharmaceutical behaviors. Additional research into moderators of this relationship might help to understand the contexts in which it is attenuated or strengthened. Additionally, a quantitative analysis of other determinants of health-protective behavior could further assist policy makers and model builders.</p>
