<p>This study focused on the influence of gender on health-protective behavior. Many other geographic, demographic, and psychological factors have been shown to influence the uptake of health-protective behavior during respiratory epidemics/pandemics. Further study could focus on meta-analytically analyzing these other possible behavioral determinants (e.g., age, income, phase of epidemic/pandemic, country development) to develop a fuller understanding of the health-protective behavior of the general public during epidemics/pandemics.</p>
