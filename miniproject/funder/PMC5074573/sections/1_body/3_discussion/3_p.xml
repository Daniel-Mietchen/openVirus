<p>The random-effects model for pharmaceutical behaviors suggests that men in the general population are slightly (specifically, 12.1%, 95% CI 1.6% to 23.6%) more likely than women to practice and/or increase pharmaceutical health-protective behaviors in the context of epidemics/pandemics. However, nearly all of the variability in the effect size estimates was due to heterogeneity among the true effects, none of which could be accounted for by including moderators. Furthermore, the addition of studies based on the trim-and-fill method rendered the observed relationship non-significant. Although the study design of this meta-analysis limits the danger of publication bias influencing the results, the random-effects model using the filled-in study set implies that if publication bias is indeed present, then it has falsely skewed the results in favor of significance. In spite of this finding, the results of the other sensitivity analyses still favor a mildly positive relationship between male gender and uptake of pharmaceutical behaviors. Of the studies addressing pharmaceutical behaviors for which a direction (but not an effect size) was reported males tended to exhibit more behavioral response than females, but this observed relationship has little value given the small sample size (5 studies).</p>
