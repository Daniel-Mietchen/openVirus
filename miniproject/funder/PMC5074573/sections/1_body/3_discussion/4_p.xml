<p>While no significant moderators were found for the non-pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical study sets, the set of moderators tested in this study was not comprehensive. There are a variety of study-level differences that were not tested as moderators in this analysis, including perceived severity of the disease, demographic characteristics of the study sample other than gender (including mean age, income, education level, minority status, and risk status), and whether the response addressed absolute uptake or increase in uptake of behavior. While the perception of the severity of a disease likely impacts health-protective behavior and may act as a moderator of the relationship we address, we do not have adequate data to create a metric for perceived severity for the publications that did not explicitly report it. Data on the severity of a given epidemic/pandemic respiratory disease outbreak are available in terms of case counts and mortality rates, but data on perceived severity are not so easily obtained. Perceived severity may depend on the proximity of the study population to high-risk areas, news media focus and tone, phase of epidemic/pandemic in which surveys/questionnaires were administered, and a host of other intangibles that extend beyond the scope of this analysis. Similarly, while study-level demographic differences (i.e., one study administering questionnaires to mostly young people, another to mostly old people) could have an effect, there are not enough studies coming from heavily age-skewed demographic groups to make claims about the impact of age (or other demographic differences in study populations) on the relationship between gender and health-protective behavior.</p>
