<p>The result of the random-effects model conclusively shows that women in the general population are 49.5% (95% CI 35.9% to 64.2%) more likely than men to practice and/or increase non-pharmaceutical health-protective behaviors in the context of epidemics/pandemics, with no significant difference found when behavior type or behavior category are included as moderators. This finding is further supported by the results presented in all ten of the studies addressing non-pharmaceutical behaviors for which a direction (but not an effect size) was reported; each showed a positive relationship for the female gender and adoption of the given behaviors. The magnitude of the relationship remained large in each sensitivity analysis.</p>
