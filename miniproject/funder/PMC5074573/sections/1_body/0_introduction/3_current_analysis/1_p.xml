<p>In this paper, a meta-analysis is performed in order to quantitatively analyze the body of scholarly work relating to demographic determinants of human behavior in the context of epidemic and pandemic respiratory diseases, specifically avian influenza, swine influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To our knowledge, no previous study has quantified the direction and magnitude of the relationship between demographic characteristics and protective behavior in the general population in response to respiratory epidemics/pandemics. Potential moderating influences of study characteristics on this relationship are also tested. The results of this analysis will inform decision makers, public health officials, and modelers as to the differing behavioral response by men and women during epidemic and pandemic respiratory disease outbreaks.</p>
