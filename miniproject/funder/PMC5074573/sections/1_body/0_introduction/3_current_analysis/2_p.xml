<p>Meta analyses are ideal for research areas in which the body of literature addressing a shared research hypothesis is saturated but the conclusion is still unclear [

 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], meta-analyses have the advantage of being reproducible, able to include studies for which the results lack statistical significance, and able to quantify both the magnitude and the significance of the relationship in question. The disadvantage of meta-analyses compared to narrative reviews is that they cannot cover the same breadth of topics. While Bish and Michie [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] addressed age, gender, ethnicity, educational level, working status, marital status, and psychological factors associated with protective behaviors, this study covers only the association between gender and protective behaviors.
