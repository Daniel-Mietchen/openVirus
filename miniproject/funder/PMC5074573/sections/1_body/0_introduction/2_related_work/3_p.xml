<p>A 2011 Ph.D. thesis by Liao [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] included a section focused on the demographic determinants of individuals adopting protective behaviors in the context of a pandemic outbreak. Liao’s review finds that women consistently report more adoption of hygiene practices, government-recommended behaviors, and avoidance behaviors, and men regularly have higher vaccination intention. However, several studies find no association between gender and protective behavior. As in [

 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the conclusion reached in Liao’s review is qualitative rather than quantitative and a deeper statistical understanding of determinants of human behavior in the context of pandemic outbreaks is not reached. Furthermore, in each review discussed thus far the sample size of studies considered numbered less than twenty for gender analysis.
