<p>A 2010 review paper by Bish and Michie [
 <xref rid="pone.0164541.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] identified several demographic determinants associated with a higher probability of adopting protective behaviors during a pandemic, including being older, female, more educated, and non-White. However, this review offers a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis, providing a discussion of the different factors rather than a comprehensive investigation of the data presented in each of the studies. This qualitative assessment lacks a definitive conclusion due to the equivocal conclusions reached by the individual articles reviewed. While the authors find that “when there is a significant difference women are consistently more likely than men to carry out the behaviors,” they note that some studies find no gender differences.
