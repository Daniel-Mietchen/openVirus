<p>In addition, determining the drivers that are responsible for these protective behaviors can inform mathematical models that are intended to provide decision support. Mathematical modeling is typically used to understand disease dynamics and assess the impact of different interventions [

As such, understanding these behavioral factors is crucial for devising public health campaigns, providing information to parametrize mathematical models, and ultimately limiting disease spread.
