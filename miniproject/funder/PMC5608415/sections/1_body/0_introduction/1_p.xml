<p>During the last decade, Europe has faced outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) such as dengue and chikungunya, following the continuous importation of human cases in areas with established competent vectors such as the invasive mosquito

 <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (Skuse) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Vector control interventions can be implemented by local authorities to keep in check mosquito abundance and consequently reduce the epidemiological risk. Adulticide spraying rapidly reduces the number of mosquitoes, but its effect is short-lived [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For this reason, it is particularly indicated in situations where the transmission risk needs to be reduced drastically and quickly, such as when an individual is diagnosed with an MBD, to prevent or curtail an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the effectiveness of reactive measures decreases with the delay between outbreak initiation and implementation of control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a better approach may consist in preventive interventions. Treatment of potential breeding sites with larvicide products has a delayed impact in reducing adult populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but experimental studies show that their effect lasts for several weeks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], making them better suited for preventive routine control. The main limit to larviciding as a control option is the proportion of breeding sites that are actually accessible to interventions by public health authorities. To overcome this limit, education campaigns may be carried forward to encourage citizens to remove and treat potential breeding sites from their private premises during the mosquito season [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mathematical modelling of MBD associated with cost-effectiveness analyses can help optimizing routine vector control interventions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with respect to constraints in human and financial resources [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].
