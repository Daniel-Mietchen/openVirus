<p>We did not include other arboviroses transmitted by

 <italic>albopictus</italic> because of their lower epidemiological relevance to the considered area. For example, the risk of Zika virus transmission was found to be close to zero in the study region, even under conservative scenarios [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> but also by other affected mosquito species (e.g. West Nile virus associated to 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> L.). Furthermore, larviciding may assist in limiting the spread of other invasive mosquito species such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>Hulecoeteomyia</italic>) 
 <italic>japonicus</italic> (Theobald) and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
