<p>These results need to be contextualized with respect to our simplifying assumptions. First, all results are given conditionally on a uniform probability of importation of an infectious individual within a given epidemiological year. For comparison, in the considered provinces of Trento and Belluno, three imported cases of dengue and one imported case of chikungunya were recorded in 2014 (C. Rizzo, personal communication); however, the actual importation rate may vary significantly by year and time of the year, depending on spatio-temporal patterns of global epidemics and international travel. We did not consider reactive interventions that are implemented when a case of chikungunya or dengue infection is detected or after an outbreak has started (e.g., insecticide air spraying in the neighbourhood of the index case [

In addition, our results are relative to the prevention of arboviral transmission; however, there may be other purposes in vector control activities, such as the reduction of nuisance for citizens, which were not included in our analysis. For what concerns the economic assessment, we did not consider the impact of local transmission detection on the blood supply chain. Upon clinical confirmation of a locally transmitted arboviral infection, restrictions on the usage of blood bags collected in the region are applied to prevent transmission via transfusions, and screening tests on available blood supplies are implemented [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These additional interventions are quite expensive, and savings associated to the reduction of transmission risk granted by larvicides may dramatically offset the cost-benefit balance in favour of the intervention. However, these costs are difficult to estimate because of the lack of sufficient data.
