 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; other studies were based on endemic (extra-European) settings where transmission is mainly mediated by 
 <italic>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</italic> (Linneus) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Overall, results from different studies and approaches, including our own, are consistent in highlighting the potential of larviciding towards reducing mosquito populations; however, this reduction will not result in a complete elimination of the risk of local chikungunya or dengue transmission. Additional strategies may integrate the control of risks from mosquito-borne diseases, including source reduction methods (e.g. identification and removal of breeding sites), mass trapping (e.g. via lethal ovitraps) and approaches leveraging ecological interactions (such as the use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria or the release of genetically sterilized male mosquitoes). A comprehensive review of the potential for these strategies can be found in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but specific cost-effectiveness studies are needed to identify optimal strategies for vector control. European municipalities with temperate climate where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is established may take advantage of results from this study when planning and timing routine larviciding interventions aimed to prevent or reduce epidemiological risks. Temperate European areas share with our study collection area similar temperature suitability for the transmission of arboviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and similar abundances of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], so that results on the epidemiological effectiveness of larviciding should not differ significantly. More caution should be paid when extrapolating cost-effectiveness conclusions to different countries, given potential differences in health and intervention costs and in the choice of the WTP. Finally, we suggest that the proposed methodological approach may also be extended to European areas with different climates, conditional on the availability of local data on mosquito abundances estimated via entomological surveillance activities.
