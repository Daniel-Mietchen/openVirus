<p>We found that the most effective interventions in reducing the amount of expected locally transmitted cases were those for which the window of larvicide efficacy covered at least the month of July (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005918.t002">Table 2</xref>). Larviciding reduced the probability of secondary cases only moderately, but it had an important impact in avoiding larger outbreaks. Our analysis included two seasons that were representative of a broad range of mosquito abundances, due to the remarkable temperature differences. The cost-effectiveness of larviciding depends on the actual mosquito abundance in a given year; however, general rules could be identified independently of the considered year: small villages (&lt;10,000 inhabitants) with moderate-to-high mosquito abundances will maximally benefit of intense larviciding efforts made of season-round monthly treatment of public catch basins. For medium-sized towns (20–35,000 inhabitants) with high infestation rate, the benefits are partially offset by the higher cost of intervention; in these cases, a moderate larviciding effort (1 to 3 treatments within the season) is recommended. Larger cities in our study (&gt;35,000 inhabitants) were characterized by a low or intermediate transmission risk, and the high costs of an intervention covering the entire urban area made it economically disadvantageous. In these situations, treating specific neighbourhoods with highest mosquito abundance (called ‘hot spot' approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]) may be cost-effective. In order to evaluate such a scenario, however, it would be necessary to model the complex effect of the urban layout on the spatial distribution of breeding sites and on the dynamics of mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is out of the scope of our study. Treatment of private breeding sites via the direct involvement of citizens by door-to-door visits was recommended only in small towns with high mosquito infestation. A survey on the allocated budget for mosquito control programs across different municipalities showed that expenses required for the most cost-effective interventions are sustainable for the considered area.
