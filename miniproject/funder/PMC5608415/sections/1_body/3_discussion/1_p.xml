<p>In this work, we evaluated the effect of routine larviciding against dengue and chikungunya, two viruses transmitted by bites of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. We used data from two seasons of entomological surveillance in multiple sites from northern Italy to parametrize a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and control. The population model was coupled with a transmission dynamics model and a cost-effectiveness analysis to identify suitable routine vector control strategies for temperate climate municipalities in Europe. We found that, in the absence of interventions, the risk of autochthonous dengue transmission was low and limited to sporadic transmission in both years, because of the relatively low competence of European strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. On the other hand, the risk of a chikungunya outbreak was estimated to be up to 30% in 2015, with a non-negligible probability of observing outbreaks larger than 50 cases in most sites.
