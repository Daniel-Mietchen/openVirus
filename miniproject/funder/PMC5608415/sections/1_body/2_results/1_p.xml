<p>The estimated density of adult female mosquitoes (averaged between April 10
 <sup>th</sup> and September 30
 <sup>th</sup>) was between 4 and 88 per hectare in 2014 and between 9 and 198 in 2015, depending on the municipality (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005918.t001">Table 1</xref>). The higher abundance in 2015 is mostly due to the much higher temperatures recorded during summer. The initial reproduction numbers and the threshold for autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and dengue over time were estimated in a previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Here, for each site and year, we computed the probability of autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and dengue originated by an imported infection in the absence of interventions. Higher vector densities during 2015 resulted in an increased risk of local transmission for both infections, compared to the previous year. The probability of observing at least one secondary case was estimated to be up to 30% for chikungunya and 15% for dengue in highly infested towns in 2015. Corresponding maximum probabilities in 2014 were around 20% for chikungunya and 5% for dengue. This means that 7 importations of chikungunya and 15 importations of dengue in towns most at risk would have a &gt;90% probability of causing at least one secondary case in 2015. Sporadic transmission (less than 10 secondary cases) is by far the most likely scenario, especially for dengue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, we found a low, but non-negligible, probability (up to 2.7%) that an uncontrolled chikungunya outbreak would produce more than 50 cases in several sites during 2015.
