<p>For each site and year, and for each timing, effort level and assumed coverage, we evaluated the relative reduction in the expected number of secondary infections per imported case as a measure of effectiveness.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005918.s001">S1 Text</xref>). We found that an increase in the effort level does not proportionally reduce the expected number of cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In particular, an expansion in the coverage of breeding sites from 30% to 50% would be more effective than doubling the effort level while keeping the coverage at 30%. In general, interventions are most beneficial when the baseline risk is highest.
