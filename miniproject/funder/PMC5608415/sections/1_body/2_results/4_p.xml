<p>Towards an optimal allocation of resources, the benefits of reducing the potential number of transmitted cases needs to be compared with the intervention costs. Taking into account all possible clinical outcomes, including the probability of severe illness and of hospitalization, the estimated average cost per infection is 424.9 euros (95% CI 342–533) for chikungunya and 275.88 euros (95% CI 151–422) for each dengue infection. The corresponding average DALY loss per case is higher for chikungunya (0.45, 95% CI 0.10–1.12) than for dengue (0.29, 95% CI 0.15–0.44). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g004">Fig 4</xref>, we show the relative probability that each effort level (including the no-intervention scenario) will maximize the NHB for each site, year, and coverage. Three main outcomes can be identified. The first is represented by larger cities (Trento, Belluno and Rovereto, all above 35,000 inhabitants) where non-intervention has the highest likelihood of being optimal. In these sites, the poor economic effectiveness of larviciding depends on the relatively low number of expected secondary cases even in the absence of treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g003">Fig 3</xref>), combined with the high intervention costs due to the extent of the area to be covered. The second group consists of smaller towns where intervention is always beneficial (Povo, Santa Giustina, Tenno and Tezze, all below 10,000 inhabitants) and where higher effort levels have the highest probabilities of being optimal. Strigno (about 3,400 inhabitants) represents an exception to this rule, where the low intervention costs are counterbalanced by a very small transmission risk in the absence of interventions. Nonetheless, even in Strigno a low-effort intervention (single treatment) might be beneficial because of its low cost. The third situation occurs in towns of intermediate size (Feltre and Riva del Garda, between 20,000 and 35,000 inhabitants) where both the intervention costs and the transmission risks are high. In these cases, depending on the larviciding coverage, absence of intervention might be the optimal strategy in seasons of lower mosquito abundance (2014) while a low-to-moderate effort (1 to 3 treatments) might be the best choice in years of high infestation (2015). Overall, the probability that a more intensive intervention will be optimal increases with the coverage and with higher transmission risk (2015 vs. 2014). We also tested the cost-effectiveness of expanding the coverage by involving private citizens [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g005">Fig 5</xref> reports results of the NHB analysis for a single larvicide treatment, but qualitative inferences are similar for more intensive efforts (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005918.s001">S1 Text</xref>). The only two instances where involvement of citizens was found to be economically beneficial were Povo and Tezze and only during the 2015 mosquito season, i.e. only where the urban size is small enough to keep intervention costs low and where the transmission risk at baseline is sufficiently high.
