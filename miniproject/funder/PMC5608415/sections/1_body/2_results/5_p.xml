<p>Two municipalities under study, Trento and Riva del Garda, had responded to a previously administered questionnaire on public expenditure on vector control, declaring an overall budget of 0.254 euro and 0.532 euros per inhabitant, respectively. In Trento, the most cost-effective activity predicted by our model was monitoring by ovitraps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005918.g004">Fig 4</xref>), which has an estimated average cost of 0.016 euro per inhabitant; in Riva del Garda, one or two larvicide applications per year would be likely optimal and would cost between 0.256 and 0.512 euros per inhabitant. Therefore, the most cost-effective strategies are sustainable with respect to the current allocated budget. We provide full details on questionnaires, municipality-specific answers and intervention costs in the
