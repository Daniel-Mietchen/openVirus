<p>Routine preventive larvicide treatments can reduce significantly mosquito populations and consequently the probability and size of outbreaks triggered by sporadic importation of infected cases. To evaluate the overall effectiveness, we considered the expected number of total secondary infections per imported case. Under the baseline scenario of no control interventions, this index ranged from 0.1 to 5.2, depending on the site and year; corresponding numbers for dengue were everywhere below 0.5. Because of the smaller epidemiological risk of dengue, we discuss only the cost-effectiveness analysis on chikungunya, leaving corresponding results for dengue to the
