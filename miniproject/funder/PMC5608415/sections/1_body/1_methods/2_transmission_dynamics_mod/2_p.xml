<p>We then included the effect of routine larviciding in the population model. Experimental studies of several available commercial larvicide products show that 99% of existing larvae and hatching eggs are killed within a given breeding site, with constant efficacy of about 30 days, independently of the specific product used [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We considered a standard approach targeting breeding sites in publicly accessible spaces (e.g., catch basins placed in public parks and along the road system), and an additional strategy where public interventions were integrated by the involvement of citizens in treating and removing breeding sites within private premises. The latter was parametrized on results from a pilot project conducted in two municipalities within the same area of this study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], in which larvicide products were delivered door-to-door and free of charge to house dwellers, who were sensitized and educated to mosquito control interventions. A key determinant of effectiveness is the fraction of existing breeding sites in a given area that are actually treated (coverage). We adopted a coverage range between 30% and 50% for larviciding of public catch basins only, and between 60% and 75% for interventions that additionally involve citizens. These ranges were computed from available data on the density and proportion of reachable breeding sites in public and private premises [
