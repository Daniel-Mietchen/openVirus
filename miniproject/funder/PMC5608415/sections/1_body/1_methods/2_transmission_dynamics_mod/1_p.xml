<p>We simulated the transmission dynamics associated with chikungunya and dengue using a standard SEI-SEIR approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in which mosquitoes develop lifelong infection after an (extrinsic) incubation period since the bite to an infectious human (SEI sub-model), whereas humans develop temporary infection, followed by the development of immunity, after an (intrinsic) incubation period since the bite from an infectious mosquito (SEIR sub-model). We considered temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation periods and per-bite transmission probabilities for dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas only temperature-independent estimates were available for Chikungunya [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The transmission model was initialized with a single infectious human, representing an imported case at a date sampled uniformly between January 1

 <xref rid="pntd.0005918.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The model considers four developmental stages of mosquitoes (eggs, larvae, pupae and adults) and reproduces their life cycle by means of temperature-dependent parameters regulating the stage-specific rates of mortality and development. Free model parameters (i.e. the site- and year- specific habitat suitability and the capture rate of BG traps) were estimated via a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach based on a Poisson likelihood [
