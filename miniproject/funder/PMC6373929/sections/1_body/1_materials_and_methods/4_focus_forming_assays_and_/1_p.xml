<p>Virus titers for stocks and infectious blood meals after 1 hour of exposure to mosquitoes were determined by focus forming assays and immunostaining as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), were added in duplicate to confluent C6/36 cell monolayers attached to 24-well Costar (Corning, NY) plates, and incubated for 1 h with periodic gentle rocking to facilitate virus adsorption at 28 °C. Wells were then overlaid with 1 ml of 0.8% methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) diluted in warm Optimem (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% FBS, antibiotics and 1% (w/v) L-glutamine and incubated undisturbed for 4 days at 28 °C. Methylcellulose overlay was aspirated and cell monolayer rinsed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (Invitrogen) followed by fixation with a mixture of ice-cold acetone and methanol (1:1) solution and allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Fixation solution was aspirated and plates were allowed to air dry. Plates were washed thrice with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS, followed by hour-long incubation with a dengue-specific hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid. Mouse hyperimmune sera (MIAF) to DENV were prepared in adult mice; using 10% crude homogenates of DENV- infected newborn mouse brain in phosphate-buffered saline as the immunogen. The immunization schedule consisted of four intraperitoneal injections of antigen mixed with Freund’s adjuvant, given at weekly intervals. After the final immunization, mice were inoculated with sarcoma 180 cells, and the resulting immune ascitic fluids were collected. All animal work was done at UTMB under an IACUC approved animal use protocol (number 9505045). Plates were washed thrice followed by hour-long incubation with a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD). Detection proceeded with the addition of aminoethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate (ENZO Life sciences, Farmingdale, CT) prepared according to vendor instructions.
