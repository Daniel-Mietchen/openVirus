<p>At 7 or 15 days post bloodmeal (dpbm), mosquitoes were cold-anaesthetized and their legs and wings were removed. The proboscis of each mosquito was then inserted into a capillary tube containing 1–2 μL of FBS for salivation for up to 30 min then expectorated saliva was collected into a tube containing 100 μL of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Detection of DENV in the mosquito body but not the wings/legs indicated a non-disseminated infection (limited to the midgut), whereas the presence of virus in both the body and wings/legs indicated dissemination into the hemocoel. Mosquito bodies as well as wings/legs of infected bodies were tested for DENV after homogenization in 400 μl of MEM containing 5% of FBS, and centrifugation for 2 min at 11,500 x g at 4 °C to separate virus supernatant and debris. For each sample, 100 μl of supernatant were cultured in 24-well plates containing Vero cell monolayers and DENV was detected by focus forming assays and immunostaining described above, but without the ten-fold serial dilutions. So detection was limited to presence/absence revelation. Saliva of infected wings/legs were tested to detect DENV presence by real-time RT-PCR using an internal control of 10 no-infected mosquito saliva pooled together; 100 μl of each sample was used for RNA extraction using the QIAamp Viral RNA Extraction Kit (QIAgen, Heiden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Dengue virus RNAs extracted from mosquito saliva were amplified using Bio-Rad iTaq universal probes one-step kit (Cat#172–5141) following Manufacturer’s protocol. For detecting DENV-1 and DENV-3, forward primer (5’ATTAGAGAGCAGATCTCTG 3’), reverse primer (5’TGACACGCGGTTTC 3’), and Probe 5’/56-FAM/TCAATATGCTGAAACGCG/3BHQ_1/-3’ were used; for DENV-4, forward primer 5’AAT AGA GAG CAG ATC TCTG 3’ was used. The RT‐PCR was performed by Quant Studio 6 Flex instrument made from applied BioSystems by life technologies. The cycling conditions were RT step at 50.0 °C for 10 min, at 95.0 °C for 3 min, and 43 cycles of 15 s at 94.0 °C and 1 min at 55 °C.</p>
