<p>During our experiment with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>furcifer</italic>, we observed 5 days after oral DENV exposure a high mortality rate. Based on this observation, we planned subsequent experiments to include a negative control cohort exposed to uninfected blood meals to assess the effect of DENV on mortality. The uninfected blood meals used as the negative control contained a 33% volume of washed sheep erythrocytes and 33% volume of cell culture media (Gibco DMEM, High glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin and 10% of Bacto Tryptose Phosphate Broth) supplemented with 21% FBS, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a final concentration of 0.005 M as a phagostimulant, and sucrose at a final concentration of 10%. The

 <italic>taylori</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Kedougou and St. Louis and 20 dpbm for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Dakar, then surviving mosquitoes were tested for DENV infection as described above.
