<p>Infection (number of positive bodies/total number of engorged mosquitoes incubated and tested), disseminated infection (number of mosquitoes with positive wings-legs/ total number of engorged mosquitoes incubated and tested) and transmission (number of mosquitoes with infected saliva/ total number of engorged mosquitoes incubated and tested) rates were calculated for each species and each dpbm. The rates obtained were compared using Fisherâ€™s exact test. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations potential impact of the virus serotype, incubation and mosquito origin were estimated using beta regression model. A Wilcoxon test was performed to compare differences between survivals among groups. For all tests, differences were considered statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05 using R v. 2.15.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [
