<p>Our results showed that for all 3 populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, DENV-1 exposure affects mosquito survival. However, for the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> population, after 7 dpbm we no longer detected an effect on survival of mosquitoes with DENV-1 infection. This absence of effect of DENV-1 infection on 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> is surprising because this species is not normally adapted to this DENV serotype, which is not known to circulate in the forest galleries frequented by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> in Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Indeed, only DENV-2 has been shown to circulate regularly in a sylvatic cycle in southeastern Senegal in the Kedougou region [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In summary, our results indicate that DENV-4 exposure did not affect survival of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Kedougou before 9 dpbm but it affected early the survival of the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from Dakar and Saint Louis and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic>. DENV-3 caused high mortality in all mosquito populations tested, mainly in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Dakar. Survival was been most affected by DENV-1 which showed the highest potential transmission rates.
