<p>Our results showed high infection and disseminated infection rates with DENV serotypes 1, 3 and 4, both for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> population from Dakar reached their maximum values as early as 7 dpi, while for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Kedougou and St. Louis, IRs increased between 7 dpbm and 15 dpbm to reach their maximum values later. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from Dakar develop DENV infection earlier than populations from Kedougou and St. Louis and this could be explained by highest blood meal titer for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti aegypti</italic> Dakar than others populations. However differences were not significant between populations from Dakar and Kedougou for DENV-1 and -3, as observed earlier [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but IRs and DIRs were higher in the present study. This could be explained by difference of virus strains and especially by high oral virus doses (10
 <sup>6</sup>–10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/ml) compared to those used previously (10

 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations from western (Burkina Faso: Koro, Bobo and Kari mosquito strains) and eastern (Kenya: Rabai and Shimba Hills mosquito strains) Africa showed lower rates despite the same viral titers (107.3–10
