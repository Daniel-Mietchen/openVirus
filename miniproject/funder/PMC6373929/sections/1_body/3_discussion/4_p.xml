<p>Regarding enzootic, sylvatic vectors, infection and dissemination rates were relatively high for the different serotypes tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007043.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007043.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). The same population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>furcifer</italic>, with different DENV-2 strains, showed similar IRs (26 to 97%) and DIRs (17 to 75%) to the rates we obtained [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. But in our study we did not detect transmission potential by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>furcifer</italic>. The decreasing of viral titers in mosquito saliva observed at least in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> between 7 and 15 dpbm may explain the low transmission rates obtained.
