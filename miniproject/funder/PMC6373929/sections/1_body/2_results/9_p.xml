<p>For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Kedougou and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>taylori</italic>, our analysis did not reveal any effect between DENV serotypes and the mosquito population survival rate (p = 0.344 and p = 0.378 respectively). But survivals were significantly different between DENV serotypes for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> Dakar (p &lt;0.001) and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> Saint Louis (p = 0.002). For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Dakar the DENV-1 induced the highest mortality (Wilcoxon test: p&lt;0.001).
