Disseminated infection rates were 57.5–67.5% and 60–72.5% for the population from Dakar, 50–62.85% and 86.66–93.75% for the population from St. Louis and 50–56.66% and 66.66–93.33% for population from Kedougou respectively at 7 and 15 dpbm. While the infection and dissemination rates were high, the potential transmission (saliva infection) rates were globally low (0–20%), 0–5% for Dakar, 0–2.85% and 0–5.88% for St. Louis, and 0% and 0–3.33% for Kedougou, respectively at 7 and 15 dpbm.
