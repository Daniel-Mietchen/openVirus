<p>In Africa, the sylvatic circulation of DENV-2 appears to be predominant [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in contrast to Asia and South America where endemic/epidemic DENV strains circulating in peridomestic cycles are most common, and a sylvatic, nonhuman primate-amplified enzootic cycle has not been identified except for in Malaysia. The first isolations of DENV-2 from naturally infected mosquitoes in Africa date to 1969 when two strains were isolated from Ibadan and Jos in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thereafter, several epizootics of DENV-2 were reported through the periodic amplifications of the sylvatic cycle involving wild populations of mosquitoes and monkeys in several West African countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, despite these frequent epizooties and the presence of the epidemic vector 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in all bioclimatic areas, only sporadic DEN cases were recorded in West Africa. This could be explained by the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti formosus</italic>, the ancestral African sylvatic and zoophilic form that uses tree holes as its larval habitat. Indeed, both sub-species exist in Africa but the presence of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti aegypti</italic> (the domestic, highly anthropophilic and primarily endophilic subspecies) in West Africa remains debatable mainly because of the lack of reliable methods to distinguish the two subspecies. The first documented outbreak caused by DENV-2 in West Africa occurred in Burkina Faso in 1982 and was suspected to be triggered by an introduction from the east of an epidemic Seychelles strain [
