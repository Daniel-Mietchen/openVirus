<p>Dengue fever (DEN) is the most common arboviral disease in the world and is caused by four genetically distinct serotypes of virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4) belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. Among the 390 million annual infections estimated around the world, 240 million are inapparent and only 96 million are symptomatic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007043.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Dengue fever causes a wide clinical spectrum similar for the four serotypes. The different clinical manifestations of DENV infection range from asymptomatic to several symptomatic forms ranging in severity from classical dengue fever, to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, mainly by the peridomestic mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti aegypti</italic> and secondarily by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and other anthropophilic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes.
