<p>The Mayaro virus (ATCC VR-66, strain TR 4675) was kindly provided by Dr. Davis Ferreira, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro—UFRJ. This strain corresponds to the first Mayaro virus isolate in Trinidad, 1954. The passages history of this strain, includes passages in the mouse brain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the MAYV stock used in this work was propagated in C636 cells whenever necessary for viral titre increase. Vero cells were propagated at 37 °C in minimum essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), which were selected and plated in transfer to 24-well plate (3 X 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well) and used for virus titrations. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and, upon reaching ∼80% confluence, the medium MEM was removed. 100μl of each 10-fold virus dilution was then added, and the control wells received phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After 1 hour incubated in the rotary shaker, 1.5 mL of CMC 3% (carboxymethylcellulose 3%, supplemented with 2% FBS) was added. Plates were returned to incubation at 37 °C for more 48 h. Throughout this time, cytopathic effects were observed. After incubation, 500μL of CMC 3% from each well was removed, 1 mL of formaldehyde 20% was added and maintained for 1 hour under these incubation conditions. Subsequently, the plates were washed and 500μL of 5% crystal violet (CV) was added. The plates were incubated for 30 minutes with the dye. After incubation, the plates were washed for lysis plate count. To determine viral titers in tissues, mice were sacrificed by exsanguination and perfused with 1X PBS. The right and left ankles, right and left quadricep muscles, spleen, liver, eyes and heart were removed by dissection at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hours post-infection. The tissues were weighed and then homogenized in MEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and stored at 80°C until viral load. To perform a 10X serial dilution after maceration of the tissue, the weight of each tissue was multiplied by nine, and the final value corresponds to the volume of medium required for each tissue, weight of organ as 10% of the total volume. All experiments were performed 5 times.
