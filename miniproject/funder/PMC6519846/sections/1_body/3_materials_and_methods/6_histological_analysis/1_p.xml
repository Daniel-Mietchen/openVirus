<p>For histology, the mice were sacrificed and the quadricep muscles and ankle joints were removed and fixed in Karnovsky fixative (paraformaldehyde 4% and glutaraldehyde 4%, pH 7.3). The bone-associated tissues were decalcified with EDTA 10%, pH 7. Further, the tissues were embedded in paraffin and a 5 Î¼m section obtained by microtomy, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) and observed by light microscopy. The quantification of the inflammatory cell infiltration was performed based on the following score: 0 without infiltrates; 1 light infiltrates; 2 moderate infiltrates; 3 severe infiltrates. The score considers the number of infiltrates, the size and their distribution in the tissue. For each time the best slide of each animal (N = 3) was chosen to quantify the inflammatory infiltrate. After analysis the scores were added.</p>
