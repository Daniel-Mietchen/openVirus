<p>The electronic method of von Frey is based on the use of an apparatus (anesthesiometer electronic) that has a pressure transducer connected to a digital force counter expressed in grams (g). The pressure transducer is adapted to a polypropylene tip, which is brought into contact with the animal′s leg [

Nociceptive thresholds were determined by exerting a linearly increasing pressure on the center of the animal′s paw until a flexion reflex occurred, followed by a flinch response upon withdrawal of the paw. The pressure-meter automatically records the pressure value when the foot is removed. To perform the test, the animals were placed in acrylic boxes with non-malleable wire floor for 15 minutes for aclimatization. A sloping mirror below the railing provides a clear view of the animal hindpaw during measurements. The baseline measurements of all groups were performed before infection, and the other measurements were taken at 3, 7, 10, 15 and 21 days postinfection. There were always two measures per animal at a time. The intensity of hypernociception was quantified by the difference between baseline and the other evaluated times (delta = basal—other times). In this experiment, animals with 28 days of age were used, since it is the minimum age required to perform the test.
