<p>At 3, 10, 15 and 30 days post-infection, the serum was collected, centrifuged at 514xg for 10 minutes and stored at -20 °C. The levels of serum cytokines were determined using the CBA mouse Th1/Th2/Th17 kit (BD Biosciences), which simultaneously quantifies IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF and CBA flex IL-9, IL-13, MCP-1 and IL12-p70, following manufacturer′s instructions. The level of cytokines was also evaluated in muscle tissue at 3, 7, 10, 15 and 30 days post-infection. For this, the muscle was macerated in PBS, centrifuged at 514 xg and stored at -80 °C. The data were acquired using by Flow cytometer BD FACS Verse.</p>
