<p>Animals were observed for a period of 21 days. During this time, they were monitored every 24 hours for the appearance of signs of disease, such as weight loss and muscle weakness. The physical test used to evaluate muscle weakness was wire-hanging, modified from the method described by Sango, McDonald [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This method uses a metal grid and a box lined with wood shavings; the mice are placed on the grid and it is shaken to make the animal hold on. The grid is then inverted, placed over the box and maintained at a height of 23 cm. The tendency to fall is measured using a stopwatch, and a maximum time of 2 minutes is established.
