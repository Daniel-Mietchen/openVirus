<p>In the identification of murine as animal models for alphavirus, the age of the animal has been considered a determining factor in the susceptibility and severity of the disease. As neonatal and young mice are more susceptible, they have been the most used to reproduce alphaviral disease [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The resistance of adult mice to alphavirus infection is due to type I interferons, which quickly provide an antiviral state [

 <sup>+/-</sup> and IFN-α/βR
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice that develop moderate or severe disease, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, it was shown that the Balb/c mice at 15 days old and, regardless of the infection pathway, were susceptible to the disease induced by MAYV.
