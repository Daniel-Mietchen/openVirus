<p>As with other alphavirus infections, Mayaro fever causes persistent, often debilitating joint pain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Joint pain is due to the action of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as tissue damage, which sensitizes nociceptors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The presence of pain at only 2 and 3 days PI shows that induced-MAYV pain is associated with the inflammatory response, which is characterized by elevated IL-6 and TNF-α levels on day 3 PI.
