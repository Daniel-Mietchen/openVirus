<p>Clinical signs such as ruffled fur, hunched posture and eye irritation were common and frequent in both infection pathways. Eye irritation is a frequent symptom in patients with Mayaro fever, who report photophobia and retroocular pain [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This clinical sign in the animal model was described only for sindbis virus, but the infection pathway used was intracranial, a localized infection pathway [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in other animal models for alphavirus, such as CHIKV and RRV, which also used peripheral infection pathways, no eye irritation was reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that CHIKV can infect humansâ€™ cornea and be transmitted by the ocular pathway in animals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and here we demonstrate that the MAYV is able to replicate in the eye of the animals. Therefore, it is important to investigate their potential for transmission by this pathway. Signs of disease such as gait alteration, weight loss and death occurred only in animals infected below the forelimb and have been described for pathway-independent RRV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Edema in paw, which is a characteristic sign of alphavirus infection, has also been reported for MAYV in models using the C57BL / 6 and A129 lines, however, it was not observed in this work [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As for the signs of tremors, hunched posture and animals falling and circulating spontaneously, no reports were found in the literature. The kinetics of MAYV replication showed a similar pattern in the two infection pathways studied, with the virus persisting longer in the joints than in the other tissues. In addition, both pathways were efficient at spreading the virus. The presence of alphavirus in the heart and eye in other animal models was not reported in the literature, making it necessary to investigate the tropisms of other alphaviruses by these tissues.
