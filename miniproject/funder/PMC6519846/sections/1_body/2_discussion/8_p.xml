<p>Patients with prolonged arthralgia during MAYV infection show that levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, IFN-γ, PDGF- α, VEGF and IL-12p70 remained elevated up to 12 months after infection. The acute phase was marked by a high expression of MCP-1, while IL-9 and IL-2 were predominant during the convalescent phase. These data showed that a robust early inflammatory response is associated with the development of chronic arthralgia [
