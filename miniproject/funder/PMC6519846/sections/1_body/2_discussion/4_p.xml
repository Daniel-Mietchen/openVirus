<p>The infection also resulted in several histopathological changes, such as myositis, tenosynovitis, synovitis and periostitis. These tissue changes were responsible for the lower strength of infected animals in the physical test. This resistance loss was more intense between 10 and 15 days PI, corresponding to the tissue damage and the beginning of the regeneration process. Both infection pathways could cause myositis, which was characterized by presence of infiltrates and destruction of muscle fibers. Tissue damage described for MAYV is similar to that found in animal models for CHIKV and RRV, with extensive degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscle, inflammation of the periosteum and tissues associated with the joint being reported [
