<p>New, potentially aggressive lesions have been identified in CHIKV infections in animals, such as necrosis of cartilage and bone proliferation in the periosteum. In patients with CHIKV, imaging studies have revealed the presence of tenosynovitis, synovial thickening, periostitis, periosteum proliferation and bone erosion.
