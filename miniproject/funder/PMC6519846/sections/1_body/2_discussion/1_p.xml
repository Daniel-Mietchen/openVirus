<p>The arthritogenic alphaviruses include chikungunya (CHIKV), Sindbis (SINV), Ross River (RRV), Mayaro (MAYV), Barmah Forest (BFV) and O′nyong′nyong (ONNV) viruses, which are associated with arthritis and/or debilitating arthralgia, and in some cases with bone pathologies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These viruses are considered an important socioeconomic problem, since they have the potential to cause large epidemics with a significant impact on human health and the economy, due to their debilitating effects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The current understanding of the mechanisms involved in alphaviral pathogenesis has been based on studies with animal models and clinical observations, mainly with RRV and CHIKV. With the risk of emergence and urbanization of the MAYV in South America and other continents, it has become necessary to understand the pathology and immune response of this virus. Therefore, this research presents an animal model of arthritis and myositis induced by the MAYV.
