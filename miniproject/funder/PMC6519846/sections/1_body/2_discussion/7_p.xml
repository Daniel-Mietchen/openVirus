<p>The evaluation of the cytokine profile showed that MAYV induces a strong inflammatory response in early days of infection, mediated by cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and INF-γ and chemokine MCP-1. These mediators have also been expressed in animal models for RRV and CHIKV, and more recently it has been demonstrated in patients with Mayaro Fever [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-α during early stages are probably responsible for inducing pain observed in animals on day 3 PI. In patients with chronic arthralgia in MAYV infection, these factors are also elevated [

Initial inflammatory response in animals was rapidly controlled by anti-inflammatory action of IL-4 and IL-10, and in later stages by IL-4. Besides the control of immune response, IL-10 also plays an important role in muscle regeneration by inducing the exchange of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype in the injured muscle [

The action of IL-10 on tissue recovery is indicated by the presence of fibers with centralized nuclei, which is a characteristic of the muscle regeneration process. The presence of INF-γ and IL-4 suggests the participation of adaptive immunity. A second increase in TNF-α levels in animals FPP after 30 PI may indicate the persistence of viral RNA in the tissue, as has been demonstrated for CHIKV [
