<p>The MAYV as well as the chikungunya virus present a high potential for urbanization and emergence due to the ability of these viruses to mutate and adapt to new transmission cycles [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Cuiabá, capital of Mato Grosso state, an entomological surveillance study identified the species of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> as mosquitoes naturally infected by MAYV, corroborating with the occurrence of urban transmission in Cuiabá and possibly in other cities of central region of Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This shows that Mayaro fever should be included in the differential diagnosis with dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in areas where there is co-circulation of these arboviruses [

Due to its geographical proximity, vector species and population flows, the United States is the country with the highest risk for MAYV emergence [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is present and experimentally able to transmit the MAYV [
