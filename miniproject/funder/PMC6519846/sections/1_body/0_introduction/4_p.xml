<p>As the pathophysiology of the MAYV is not fully elucidated and represents an important public health issue, the objective of this research was to establish an animal model for the study of the pathogenesis induced by the MAYV. The results demonstrated that Balb/c mice at 15-days developed acute disease with musculoskeletal damage, which included myositis, arthritis, tenosynovitis and periostitis. A strong inflammatory response was induced on initial days of infection, which was controlled through the participation of IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines. These results present an animal model to study the pathogenesis of the Mayaro virus.</p>
