<p>Mayaro virus (MAYV, genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family) is an emergent arbovirus, responsible for sporadic cases, outbreaks and small epidemics of acute febrile disease in South American countries, particularly in the Amazon basin. However, serological data have shown the circulation of the MAYV in Central American countries, such as Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and more recently in Haiti, where a new strain was isolated [

 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> mosquito as a vector and nonhuman primates as natural hosts, however other vectors (
