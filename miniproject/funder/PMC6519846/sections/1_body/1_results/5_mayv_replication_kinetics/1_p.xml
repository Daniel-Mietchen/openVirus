<p>Peak titers of infectious virus were detected at 24 to 48 hours post-infection (hpi) in both infection pathways (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g013">13</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g014">14</xref>). In animals from FLP the highest viral titers were detected in the left and right ankles with 10
 <sup>9</sup> PFU/g and 10
 <sup>10</sup> PFU/g, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g013">Fig 13E and 13F</xref>), and live, spleen and muscles reached a peak of 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/g (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g013">Fig 13A, 13B, 13G and 13H</xref>). In FPP animals, viral titers of up to 10
 <sup>10</sup> PFU/g were detected in the right ankle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g014">Fig 14D</xref>), and 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/g in the muscles and left ankle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g014">Fig 14F, 14G and 14H</xref>). MAYV has also been found in other organs such as the heart and eye. The viremia persisted for up to 144 hpi in both groups.
