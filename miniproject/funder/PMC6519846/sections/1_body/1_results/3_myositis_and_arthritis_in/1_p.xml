<p>The analysis of MAYV-induced morphological changes was performed on skeletal muscles and joints, on 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 days PI. Myositis occurred symmetrically for both infection pathways, affecting the skeletal muscle of the pelvic limbs in a similar way. In FLP, little or no inflammation was observed on day 3 PI, with the muscle tissue being very similar to the control (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g005">5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g006">6B</xref>). However, on days 7 and 10 PI, an increased number of inflammatory infiltrates were observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g006">Fig 6C, 6D and 6J</xref>), concentrated in specific points, but disperse in all tissue. Additionally, there is also the presence of degenerating fibers (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g006">Fig 6C and 6H</xref>), which are characterized by a pale color, swollen appearance and central nucleus. Collagen deposition (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g005">Fig 5I</xref>). With 15 and 20 days PI there were still small foci of inflammatory infiltrate. In the joints and bones of the foot, inflammation started on day 3 PI, and the presence of inflammatory cells in the synovium, tendon, ligament, periosteum and extensive inflammation and destruction of associated muscle was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In FPP, the inflammation in the muscle began on day 3 PI, with the presence of degenerating fibers (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g009">9B</xref>). On days 7 and 10, the inflammatory process continued (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8C and 8D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g009">9C and 9D</xref>), but there was no difference in the histological score between post-infection times (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g009">9G</xref>). At day 15 PI there were still few infiltrate cells (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g009">9E</xref>), with full tissue recovery on day 20 PI (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g009">9F</xref>). In both groups, tissue recovery occurred between 15 and 20 days PI, which is indicated by the presence of fibers with rows of centralized nuclei (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g005">5E</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g006">6H</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g008">8F</xref>).
