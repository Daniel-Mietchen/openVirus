<p>MAYV infection initially activates the Th1 pattern, inducing a strong inflammatory response, which is followed by cytokine induction of the Th2 response. Both groups showed similar cytokine profile in serum. On the third day after infection, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF, INF-γ and IL-6 and chemokine MCP-1 were detected in the serum of both infected groups. TNF and INF-γ levels remained high until day 10, when an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also observed. In FPP at 30 days PI, IL-4 and TNF were detected again. In FLP, the IL-4 cytokine was present at 10 days PI and on 30 days PI no cytokines were detected (Figs
