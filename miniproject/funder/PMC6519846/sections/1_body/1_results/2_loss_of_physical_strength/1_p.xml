<p>In the physical test, it was found that both infected groups showed significant reduction in time differences when compared to controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g004">Fig 4A, 4B and 4C</xref>). In the Figure, it can be observed that in the first five days, all groups had very close and low time averages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Up to the tenth day post-infection, an increase in the time of all four groups was observed. However, from the tenth day a significant difference was observed between the infected and uninfected groups, which continued up to day 19 PI. On day 16, FPP began to increase the permanence time adhered to the grid, while in the FLP animals, this increase occurred from day 17.
