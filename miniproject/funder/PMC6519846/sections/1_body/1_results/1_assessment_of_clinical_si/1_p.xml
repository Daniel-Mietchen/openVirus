<p>The inoculation of the animals was performed via two distinct pathways, below the forelimb and in the rear footpad, determined as FLP and FPP, respectively. Clinical signs such as ruffled fur, hunched posture and eye irritation were observed in both groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007375.g002">Fig 2A, 2B and 2C</xref>). Weight loss in FLP begins at day 1 PI, while in the other groups, we observed a gradual increase in body weight. A significant difference between FLP and the control group is evident on day 7 PI and remains up to day 19 PI. Some signs such as hind limb drag, tremors, and falling and circulating spontaneously were observed in a single experiment in the FLP animals. The change in the animalsâ€² gait was more pronounced from day 10 PI. Tremors were observed only in three animals and only one animal showed the signal falling and circulating spontaneously. In addition, 33% of the animals succumbed to infection in the same experiment (
