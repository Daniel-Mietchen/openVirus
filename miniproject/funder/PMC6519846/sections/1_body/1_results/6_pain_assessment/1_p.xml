<p>Until now, we have shown that MAYV infection induced clinical, morphological and inflammatory changes. Our next question was if these inflammatory indices were associated with articular dysfunction. For that, mice with 28 days were used to evaluate the intensity of hypernociception. Our results revealed that at 2 and 3 days PI, both mice from FLP and FPP groups, showed a decrease in their nociceptive thresholds in comparison to MOCK-infected groups. From day 7 PI the nociceptive thresholds were already similar to baseline levels (
