  <title>Mayaro virus induces weight loss in 15-day old Balb/c mice.</title>
  <p>Mice weight was evaluated throughout the experiment. 15-day old Balb/c mice were infected with 2.57 x 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU in the rear footpad and 1.25 x 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU below the forelimb by subcutaneous injection. A) Infected mice did not present a statistical difference in hind limb pad pathway. B) A statistical difference was observed for the below the forelimb pathway. C) Behavior of the groups throughout the experiment. Control groups received only PBS 1X. The animals were monitored at 24-hour intervals for weight gain or loss, and statistics were ascertained with two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (* P value ≤ 0.05;*** P value &lt;0.0002). N = 12 animals/group.
