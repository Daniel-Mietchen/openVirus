  <title>Mayaro virus-induced myositis in the ipsilateral muscle in mice infected via the rear left footpad with 2.57 x 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU.
  </title>
  <p>Animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 PI. for tissue damage analysis. The quadricep muscle was fixed in Karnovsky, embedded in paraffin, and 5μm sections were made and stained with HE. (A) Negative control. (B) MAYV infection at 3 days PI. (C) MAYV infection at 7 days PI. (D) MAYV infection at 10 days PI. (E) MAYV infection at 15 days PI. (F) MAYV infection at 20 days PI, with centralized nuclei (arrow). (G) Histological score. Images (200X magnification, bar 40 μm) N = 3 animals/group.</p>
