  <title>Evaluation of muscle weakness in 15-day-old Balb/c mice.</title>
  <p>Mice were subjected to the Wire-hang physical test at 24-hour intervals. 15-day old Balb/c mice were infected with 2.57 x 10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU in the rear footpad and 1.25 x 10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU below the forelimb by subcutaneous injection. Control groups received only PBS 1X. (A and B) average time that animals were able to remain attached to the grid, infected groups presented significantly lower means than the control time. (C) Behavior of the groups throughout the experiment. Statistics were performed with two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. (* P value ≤ 0.05;** P value &lt;0.0034; **** P value &lt;0.0001). N = 12 animals/group.
