  <title>Myositis Mayaro virus-induced contralateral muscle in mice infected below the right forelimb with 1.25x10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU.
  </title>
  <p>The animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 PI. for tissue damage analysis. The quadricep muscles were fixed in Karnovsky, embedded in paraffin, and 5μm sections were made and stained with HE. (A) Negative control. (B) MAYV infection at 3 days PI. (C) MAYV infection at 7 days PI. (D) MAYV infection at 10 days PI. (E) MAYV infection at 15 days PI. (F) MAYV infection at 20 days PI. (G) Negative control, fibers in cross-section. (H) Fibers in cross section showing centralized nuclei (arrowhead). (I) Fibers undergoing phagocytosis. (J) Histological score. Images A, B, C, D, E, F (200X magnification), G, H and I images (400X magnification). 40μm bar. N = 3 animals/group.</p>
