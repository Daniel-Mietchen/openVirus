  <title>Cytokine profile of 15-day old Balb/c mice infected below the forelimb with 1.25x10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU.
  </title>
  <p>Serum was collected 3, 10, 15 and 30 days post-infection for analysis of cytokine levels. At day 3 PI levels of MCP-1 (A), TNF (B), INF-γ (C) and IL-6 (D) were high, and TNF (B) and INF-γ levels up to the 10th day. IL-10 (E) and IL-4 (F) levels increased at day 10 PI. Statistics were performed with one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. Gray bars: Infected. Black bars: negative control. (* P value ≤ 0.05; ** P value ≤ 0.01; *** P value ≤ 0.001; **** P value ≤ 0.0001). N = 3 animals/group.</p>
