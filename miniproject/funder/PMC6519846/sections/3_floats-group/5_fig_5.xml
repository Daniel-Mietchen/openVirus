  <title>Mayaro virus-induced myositis in the ipsilateral muscle in mice infected below the right forelimb with 1.25x10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU.
  </title>
  <p>The animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 PI. for tissue damage analysis. The quadricep muscle was fixed in Karnovsky, embedded in paraffin, and 5μm sections were made and stained with HE. (A) Negative control. (B) MAYV infection at 3 days PI. (C) MAYV infection at 7 days PI (D) MAYV infection at 10 days PI (E) MAYV infection at 15 days PI. Fibers with centralized nuclei (arrowhead). (F) MAYV infection at 20 days PI. (G) Fiber in degeneration, with pale color and swollen appearance. (H) Region of degenerating fiber undergoing phagocytosis. (I) Vasculitis. (J) Histological score. Images A, B, C, D, E, F and I (200X magnification, 40 μm bar); G and H pictures (magnification 400X, bar 40 uM). N = 3 animals/group.</p>
