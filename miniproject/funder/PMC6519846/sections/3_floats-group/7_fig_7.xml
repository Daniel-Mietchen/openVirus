  <title>Mayaro virus-induced arthritis in mice infected below the right forelimb with 1.25x10
   <sup>7</sup> PFU.
  </title>
  <p>Animals were sacrificed at 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 days p.i. for tissue damage analysis. The ankle joint was fixed in Karnovsky, decalcified in 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and 5μm sections were made and stained with HE. (A) Negative control. (B) Infiltrated in the joint capsule, muscle and synovial membrane with 7 days PI. (C) Infiltrated the ligament, tendon and muscle with 10 days PI. (D) Infiltrated synovial membrane with 15 days PI. (E) MAYV infection with 20 days PI. (F) Tendonitis and myositis with 7 days PI. (G) Periostitis with 10 days PI. (H) Tenosynovitis with 15 days PI. (I) Synovitis with 7 days PI. (J) Histological score. M: muscle; T: tendon; L: ligament; B: bone; P: periosteum; SM: Synovial membrane. Images A, B, C, D, E (40X magnification, 200 μm bar); F and I images (100X magnification), G and H images (200X magnification) 100 μm bar. N = 3 animals/group.</p>
