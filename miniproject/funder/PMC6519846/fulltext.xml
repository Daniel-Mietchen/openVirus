Clinical manifestations include fever, headache, ocular pain, rash, myalgia, and debilitating and persistent polyarthralgia. Understanding the mechanisms associated with MAYV-induced arthritis is of great importance due to the potential for its emergence, urbanization and dispersion to other regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>15-day old Balb/c mice were infected by two distinct pathways, below the forelimb and in the rear footpad. Animals were observed for a period of 21 days. During this time, they were monitored every 24 hours for disease signs, such as weight loss and muscle weakness. Histological damage in the muscles and joints was evaluated 3, 7, 10, 15 and 20 days post-infection. The cytokine profile in serum and muscles during MAYV infection was evaluated by flow cytometry at different post-infection times. For pain analysis, the animals were submitted to the von Frey test and titre in different organs was evaluated throughout the study to obtain viral kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>Infection by two distinct pathways, below the forelimb and in the rear footpad, resulted in a homogeneous viral spread and the development of acute disease in animals. Clinical signs were observed such as ruffled fur, hunched posture, eye irritation and slight gait alteration. In the physical test, both groups presented loss of resistance, which was associated with histopathological damage, including myositis, arthritis, tenosynovitis and periostitis. The immune response was characterized by a strong inflammatory response mediated by the cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and INF-&#x003b3; and chemokine MCP-1, followed by the action of IL-10 and IL-4 cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Interpretation</title><p>The results showed that Balb/c mice represent a promising model to study mechanisms involved in MAYV pathogenesis and for future antiviral testing.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The Mayaro virus, although restricted to some regions of Latin America, has great potential for emergence, which makes it of great medical-scientific interest. Therefore, pathogenesis study of the MAYV in an animal model has fundamental importance for the determination of viral and host factors that contribute to disease development. In addition, it will allow develop and evaluate the effectiveness of possible antiviral agents. In this study, the authors were able to standardize a disease model for the MAYV in BALB / c mice. From the obtained data it is possible to observe the induction of acute arthritis and myositis, accompanied by the reduction of physical strength of the animals. As described for other alphaviruses in both animal models and patient, the proinflammatory mediators TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, INF-&#x003b3; and MCP-1 were elevated in the serum of MAYV-infected animals and therefore appeared to be mediators which also play an important role in the pathogenesis of MAYV.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004901</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-610X</contrib-id><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Franciele Martins</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-610X</contrib-id><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Franciele Martins</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8768-610X</contrib-id><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>Franciele Martins</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors are grateful for the financial support of CAPES, CNPq and FAPEMIG.

However, serological data have shown the circulation of the MAYV in Central American countries, such as Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and more recently in Haiti, where a new strain was isolated [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. MAYV infections mainly affect people living or working near forest areas where MAYV is kept in an enzootic cycle, which primarily involves the <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> mosquito as a vector and nonhuman primates as natural hosts, however other vectors (<italic>Culex sp</italic>, <italic>Sabethes sp</italic>, <italic>Psorophora sp</italic>, <italic>Coquillettidia sp</italic> and <italic>Aedes sp</italic> mosquitoes) and wild vertebrates (marsupials, rodents and birds) may be important in the transmission cycle and spread of the virus [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The MAYV as well as the chikungunya virus present a high potential for urbanization and emergence due to the ability of these viruses to mutate and adapt to new transmission cycles [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent studies in Brazil have already demonstrated the occurrence of Mayaro fever in urban areas of Manaus city and Mato Grosso state [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In Cuiab&#x000e1;, capital of Mato Grosso state, an entomological surveillance study identified the species of <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> as mosquitoes naturally infected by MAYV, corroborating with the occurrence of urban transmission in Cuiab&#x000e1; and possibly in other cities of central region of Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This shows that Mayaro fever should be included in the differential diagnosis with dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in areas where there is co-circulation of these arboviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The recent MAYV case in Haiti poses a potential threat for spreading through Central and North America. Due to its geographical proximity, vector species and population flows, the United States is the country with the highest risk for MAYV emergence [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, reports of European tourists who visited the Amazon region and returned to their countries with symptoms characteristic of Mayaro fever, highlights concerns regarding MAYV as a potential emerging disease in Europe, where <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is present and experimentally able to transmit the MAYV [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Mayaro fever is characterized as a self-limiting disease, which can range from mild to moderately severe. Clinical manifestations include fever, headache, ocular pain, rash, photophobia, joint edema, myalgia, and arthralgia. Hemorrhagic phenomena such as petechiae, gingival bleeding and epistaxis have also been observed [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Like other arthritogenic alphaviruses, MAYV also induces disabling and long-lasting polyarthralgias, with the joints of the wrist, ankle and small joints of hands and feet being predominantly affected [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>As the pathophysiology of the MAYV is not fully elucidated and represents an important public health issue, the objective of this research was to establish an animal model for the study of the pathogenesis induced by the MAYV. The results demonstrated that Balb/c mice at 15-days developed acute disease with musculoskeletal damage, which included myositis, arthritis, tenosynovitis and periostitis. A strong inflammatory response was induced on initial days of infection, which was controlled through the participation of IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines. These results present an animal model to study the pathogenesis of the Mayaro virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec006"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Assessment of clinical signs of the disease in infected animals</title><p>The inoculation of the animals was performed via two distinct pathways, below the forelimb and in the rear footpad, determined as FLP and FPP, respectively.

A significant difference between FLP and the control group is evident on day 7 PI and remains up to day 19 PI. Some signs such as hind limb drag, tremors, and falling and circulating spontaneously were observed in a single experiment in the FLP animals.

These viruses are considered an important socioeconomic problem, since they have the potential to cause large epidemics with a significant impact on human health and the economy, due to their debilitating effects [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The current understanding of the mechanisms involved in alphaviral pathogenesis has been based on studies with animal models and clinical observations, mainly with RRV and CHIKV. With the risk of emergence and urbanization of the MAYV in South America and other continents, it has become necessary to understand the pathology and immune response of this virus. Therefore, this research presents an animal model of arthritis and myositis induced by the MAYV.</p><p>In the identification of murine as animal models for alphavirus, the age of the animal has been considered a determining factor in the susceptibility and severity of the disease. As neonatal and young mice are more susceptible, they have been the most used to reproduce alphaviral disease [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The resistance of adult mice to alphavirus infection is due to type I interferons, which quickly provide an antiviral state [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been shown in experiments with adult IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R<sup>+/-</sup> and IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;R<sup>-/-</sup> mice that develop moderate or severe disease, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Over time several animal models for arthritogenic alphaviruses have been tested in different strains of neonatal or young mice, including CD-1, Swiss, Balb/c and C57BL/6 [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, it was shown that the Balb/c mice at 15 days old and, regardless of the infection pathway, were susceptible to the disease induced by MAYV.</p><p>Clinical signs such as ruffled fur, hunched posture and eye irritation were common and frequent in both infection pathways. Eye irritation is a frequent symptom in patients with Mayaro fever, who report photophobia and retroocular pain [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This clinical sign in the animal model was described only for sindbis virus, but the infection pathway used was intracranial, a localized infection pathway [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, in other animal models for alphavirus, such as CHIKV and RRV, which also used peripheral infection pathways, no eye irritation was reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that CHIKV can infect humans&#x02019; cornea and be transmitted by the ocular pathway in animals [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and here we demonstrate that the MAYV is able to replicate in the eye of the animals. Therefore, it is important to investigate their potential for transmission by this pathway. Signs of disease such as gait alteration, weight loss and death occurred only in animals infected below the forelimb and have been described for pathway-independent RRV [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Edema in paw, which is a characteristic sign of alphavirus infection, has also been reported for MAYV in models using the C57BL / 6 and A129 lines, however, it was not observed in this work [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As for the signs of tremors, hunched posture and animals falling and circulating spontaneously, no reports were found in the literature. The kinetics of MAYV replication showed a similar pattern in the two infection pathways studied, with the virus persisting longer in the joints than in the other tissues. In addition, both pathways were efficient at spreading the virus. The presence of alphavirus in the heart and eye in other animal models was not reported in the literature, making it necessary to investigate the tropisms of other alphaviruses by these tissues.</p><p>The infection also resulted in several histopathological changes, such as myositis, tenosynovitis, synovitis and periostitis. These tissue changes were responsible for the lower strength of infected animals in the physical test. This resistance loss was more intense between 10 and 15 days PI, corresponding to the tissue damage and the beginning of the regeneration process. Both infection pathways could cause myositis, which was characterized by presence of infiltrates and destruction of muscle fibers. Tissue damage described for MAYV is similar to that found in animal models for CHIKV and RRV, with extensive degeneration and necrosis of skeletal muscle, inflammation of the periosteum and tissues associated with the joint being reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>New, potentially aggressive lesions have been identified in CHIKV infections in animals, such as necrosis of cartilage and bone proliferation in the periosteum. In patients with CHIKV, imaging studies have revealed the presence of tenosynovitis, synovial thickening, periostitis, periosteum proliferation and bone erosion. These clinical findings show that the initial acute disease may progress to chronic erosive arthritis [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, identification of tenosynovitis and periostitis in animals infected by MAYV emphasizes the importance of imaging tests in clinical studies of patients with prolonged polyarthralgia.</p><p>As with other alphavirus infections, Mayaro fever causes persistent, often debilitating joint pain [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Joint pain is due to the action of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as tissue damage, which sensitizes nociceptors [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The presence of pain at only 2 and 3 days PI shows that induced-MAYV pain is associated with the inflammatory response, which is characterized by elevated IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels on day 3 PI.</p><p>The evaluation of the cytokine profile showed that MAYV induces a strong inflammatory response in early days of infection, mediated by cytokines TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and INF-&#x003b3; and chemokine MCP-1. These mediators have also been expressed in animal models for RRV and CHIKV, and more recently it has been demonstrated in patients with Mayaro Fever [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; during early stages are probably responsible for inducing pain observed in animals on day 3 PI. In patients with chronic arthralgia in MAYV infection, these factors are also elevated [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Initial inflammatory response in animals was rapidly controlled by anti-inflammatory action of IL-4 and IL-10, and in later stages by IL-4. Besides the control of immune response, IL-10 also plays an important role in muscle regeneration by inducing the exchange of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype in the injured muscle [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The action of IL-10 on tissue recovery is indicated by the presence of fibers with centralized nuclei, which is a characteristic of the muscle regeneration process. The presence of INF-&#x003b3; and IL-4 suggests the participation of adaptive immunity. A second increase in TNF-&#x003b1; levels in animals FPP after 30 PI may indicate the persistence of viral RNA in the tissue, as has been demonstrated for CHIKV [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Patients with prolonged arthralgia during MAYV infection show that levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, IFN-&#x003b3;, PDGF- &#x003b1;, VEGF and IL-12p70 remained elevated up to 12 months after infection. The acute phase was marked by a high expression of MCP-1, while IL-9 and IL-2 were predominant during the convalescent phase. These data showed that a robust early inflammatory response is associated with the development of chronic arthralgia [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cytokines IL-13, IL-9, IL-12p70 and IL-17 were also evaluated in animals but showed no differences in relation to the control. The major anti-inflammatory mediators induced in humans were IL-1R&#x003b1; and PDGF-BB [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], different to the results found in this study using animals, in which IL-10 was the major agent responsible for inflammation control.</p><p>These results show that the animal model for Mayaro virus has been able to reproduce the acute disease that occurs in humans, regardless of the infection pathway, and is adequate to understand most events resulting from MAYV infection, such as tissue damage and inflammatory response. The presence of the cytokines MCP-1, TNF and INF-&#x003b3; serum, as well as MCP-1 in the muscle, indicate the action of macrophages in target tissues of infection, which makes this cell and MCP-1 important elements common in therapy of arthritis caused by RRV, CHIKV and MAYV [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is important that further studies are conducted to evaluate the role of these immune factors in the pathogenesis induced MAYV. Additional efforts need to be made in cohort studies to obtain more information about the course of the disease in humans, since we presented evidence here for ocular infection and severe tissue damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec014"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animals were anesthesiaded with ketamine/Xylazine in all procedures and all experiments were done with agreement of Ethics Committee on Animal Use (Comit&#x000ea; de &#x000c9;tica no Uso de Animais&#x02014;CEUA) of the Federal University of Vi&#x000e7;osa, protocol number 63&#x02013;2013, established by the National Animal Experimentation Control Council (Conselho Nacional de Controle de Experimenta&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o Animal&#x02014;CONCEA), an organ that is part of the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Virus titration</title><p>The Mayaro virus (ATCC VR-66, strain TR 4675) was kindly provided by Dr. Davis Ferreira, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro&#x02014;UFRJ.

The pressure transducer is adapted to a polypropylene tip, which is brought into contact with the animal&#x02032;s leg [<xref rid="pntd.0007375.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The pressure-meter automatically records the pressure value when the foot is removed. To perform the test, the animals were placed in acrylic boxes with non-malleable wire floor for 15 minutes for aclimatization. A sloping mirror below the railing provides a clear view of the animal hindpaw during measurements. The baseline measurements of all groups were performed before infection, and the other measurements were taken at 3, 7, 10, 15 and 21 days postinfection. There were always two measures per animal at a time. The intensity of hypernociception was quantified by the difference between baseline and the other evaluated times (delta = basal&#x02014;other times).
