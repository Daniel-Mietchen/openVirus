<p>In contrast to these increases, there was a relative decrease in the number of patients aged 40 to 64 years with newly diagnosed cirrhosis and in the number of cases of cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis. These trends likely reflect the aging of the cohort of patients with hepatitis C (most of whom were born 1945-1965), whose ages ranged from 39 in 2004 to 69 in 2014. It is important to note that the absolute numbers of those aged 40 to 64 years and those with viral hepatitis did increase until 2011; however, these increases were smaller than those in the comparator groups, resulting in a relative decrease. However, from 2011 onward, the absolute numbers of these patients decreased by 13%. These decreases cannot be attributed to highly effective treatment regimens for hepatitis C, which were not available until 2013; rather, these figures likely reflect the fact that the incidence of new hepatitis C infections has been decreasing since the 1980s.

 </sup> With the current widespread treatment of hepatitis C, we would anticipate more drastic reductions of viral hepatitisâ€“related cirrhosis and its complications in the future.
