<p>In addition to the increasing numbers of younger patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, we also found increased numbers of older patients and those with NASH-related cirrhosis. These findings reflect the obesity epidemic and are consistent with studies showing an increasing prevalence of NASH and increasing numbers of older patients and those with NASH-related cirrhosis pursuing liver transplant.

 </sup> Importantly, these shifts have implications for the future because patients with new diagnoses now may require transplant years later. Other studies have projected such increases in NASH- and obesity-related transplants decades after increases in obesity prevalence.

 </sup> These trends may also negatively affect the population of patients who need transplant because their increasing comorbidity burden will render them less suitable for transplant.

 </sup> Notably, we found an increasing comorbidity burden in this study, particularly in older patients.
