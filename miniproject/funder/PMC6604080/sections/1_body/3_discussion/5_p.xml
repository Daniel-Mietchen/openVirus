 </sup> showing an increase in HCC incidence, driven primarily by hepatitis C. However, these studies analyzed patients treated in the Veterans Affairs system, who have a greater prevalence of viral hepatitis; therefore, those results may not be generalizable to the general population. In contrast, our study includes patients from multiple health systems and payers, and our findings may be more generalizable. One study

 </sup> of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data did show decreasing HCC incidence and mortality rates in particular racial and ethnic groups in recent years. Another notable finding is the extremely low prevalence (1%) and incidence (0.5 per 100 person-years) of HCC in younger patients, which has been seen elsewhere.

 </sup> If confirmed, these data could support less stringent HCC surveillance in the growing population of younger patients with cirrhosis.
