<p>A significant finding was the decreasing mortality rate, which has been seen in other studies.

 </sup> posited a shift of inpatient mortality to the immediate postdischarge setting, but nevertheless found reduced 1-year mortality. Although this study does not allow us to definitively comment on reasons for this improvement, it may be associated with improved care. For hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, timely endoscopy and paracentesis have been linked to decreasing mortality.

 </sup> Others have found increasing use of antibiotics, an intervention with proven mortality benefit, for patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding.

 </sup> The mortality improvement in our study occurred despite an increasing prevalence of decompensation both at diagnosis and during follow-up (mostly ascites). The reason for this increase in baseline decompensation is unclear, but it may reflect the shift in causes of cirrhosis away from viral hepatitis and toward alcohol and NASH. Notably, baseline decompensation was much more common among patients with alcoholic and NASH cirrhosis compared with patients with viral hepatitis. Patients with viral hepatitis may be more likely to undergo liver fibrosis assessment at an asymptomatic phase, whereas in patients with alcoholism and NASH, liver disease may be diagnosed only after symptoms of end-stage liver disease occur. The decrease in mortality also occurred despite extremely low rates of transplant, which also decreased during the study period. This low transplant rate highlights the importance of focusing on quality care to improve outcomes, because transplant alone is unlikely to achieve these goals on a population scale. Future work should continue to explore reasons for these mortality trends.
