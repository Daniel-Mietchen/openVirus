<p>In this statewide cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed cirrhosis over a decade, we found increases in the proportion of those younger than 40 years and 65 years and older, as well as increases in the proportions of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and NASH, with a decrease in the proportion of patients with viral hepatitis. The increasing burden of alcoholic liver disease in younger adults is consistent with the findings of several other studies. One study of US death certificates

 </sup> showed an increase in cirrhosis-related mortality in young adults from 2009 to 2016 driven by alcoholic liver disease. Another study
 <sup>

 </sup> of commercially insured adults in the United States showed an increase in the prevalence of alcoholic cirrhosis, with this increase most pronounced in younger patients. Hospitalization costs for cirrhosis have also increased in recent years because of an increasing burden of alcoholic cirrhosis.

 </sup> More broadly, in a nationally representative sample, high-risk drinking and alcohol use disorders increased from 2001 to 2013 across all age groups, with the highest absolute risk among younger adults.

 </sup> Future projections based on epidemiologic data also support an increasing effect of alcohol on the population with cirrhosis.

 </sup> Our study provides data showing that these increases in alcohol use, cirrhosis prevalence, mortality, and costs are also reflected in an increasing number of new diagnoses of alcoholic cirrhosis in younger adults. The long-term costs of this shift include lost productivity in those of prime working age, as well as costs associated with liver disease surveillance (eg, HCC and varices) in younger patients with longer life expectancies.

 </sup> These data support the allocation of resources to reduce the burden of alcohol use disorder, which is increasingly leading to advanced liver disease.
