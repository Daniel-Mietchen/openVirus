 </sup> Ascites during follow-up was defined by the presence of a code for ascites or paracentesis or by the presence of ascites laboratory specimen. The presence of hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and HCC during follow-up was determined on the basis of diagnostic codes. Decompensation was defined by the occurrence of ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding during follow-up. These complications of liver disease were considered to be prevalent (ie, present at cirrhosis diagnosis) when they were identified in the first 180 days of follow-up.
