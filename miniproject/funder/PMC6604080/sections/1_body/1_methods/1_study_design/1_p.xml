 </sup> We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed cirrhosis between 2004 and 2014 in the Indiana Network for Patient Care, the largest interorganizational clinical data repository in the United States, connecting more than 46 000 clinicians, 16 000 practices, and 110 hospitals across Indiana. It contains inpatient and outpatient data from more than 14 million patients, including both administrative and clinical data, as well as death certificate information for patients who die inside and outside Indiana.

 </sup> To ensure that these were incident cirrhosis diagnoses (ie, new diagnoses), we required at least 1 year of continuous follow-up in the Indiana Network for Patient Care before the first cirrhosis claim. We excluded patients with a claim for any solid-organ transplant during this 1-year period.
