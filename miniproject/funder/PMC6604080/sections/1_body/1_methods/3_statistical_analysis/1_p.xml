<p>Categorical variables were described using counts and percentages, and bivariable comparisons were performed with Pearson χ
 <sup>2</sup> test. Continuous variables were described using means and standard deviations, and comparisons were made using 1-way analysis of variance. Temporal linear trends in proportions were assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. We used survival analysis to examine differences in outcomes based on age and cause of cirrhosis and to examine temporal trends in outcomes. Mortality outcomes were compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression, and other outcomes were compared using competing risk regression, accounting for the competing risk of death that would prevent the outcome of interest (eg, death prevents a patient from undergoing liver transplant).

 </sup> Multivariable models included age, sex, cause of cirrhosis, decompensation at baseline, Charlson comorbidity index, health insurance, and year of cirrhosis diagnosis. Two-sided tests were used, and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using Stata statistical software version 13 (StataCorp).
