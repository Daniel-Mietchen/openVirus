<p>This study found a shifting profile of the population of those with newly diagnosed cirrhosis that is likely to affect clinical care and future outcomes. These data can help inform contemporary natural history projections for different causes of cirrhosis in different age groups. Of particular interest are the increased number of diagnoses in younger and older patients and increases in the numbers of cases of alcoholic cirrhosis and NASH. We also found changes in outcomes, notably a decreasing mortality rate. Together, these data support the allocation of resources toward the prevention of alcoholic liver disease and the treatment of NASH, as well as understanding ways to better care for these increasing populations. In addition, existing models of care that have focused on populations of predominantly viral hepatitisâ€“induced cirrhosis have been useful; however, new models to better address the unique needs of younger and older patients with cirrhosis (eg, dedicated care focusing on treatment of alcohol use disorders and comorbidities associated with NASH) are needed to continue to improve outcomes.</p>
