<p>These outcomes are influenced by patient demographic and clinical characteristics. For example, increases in cirrhosis-related mortality in young adults have been ascribed to alcohol use.

 </sup> In contrast, cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is more commonly diagnosed in older patients, who have lower rates of transplant and greater mortality while waiting for a transplant.

 </sup> Viral hepatitis, which in the United States is most prevalent among baby boomers, is strongly associated with HCC.

 </sup> As these characteristics change on a population level, we would expect to see corresponding changes in outcomes. Recent data show increases in alcohol use disorders in the general population as well as an increase in alcoholic cirrhosisâ€“related mortality.

 </sup> The epidemics of obesity and diabetes have resulted in increasing frequency of NASH, with corresponding increases in transplant referrals.

 </sup> With respect to viral hepatitis, the expanding availability of effective antiviral agents may lead to improved outcomes.

 </sup> In contrast to these recent changes in the United States, much of our knowledge of the natural history of cirrhosis is derived from older studies and studies performed elsewhere.
