<p>The incidence of HCC was low in patients younger than 40 years, with an absolute incidence rate of 0.5 (95% CI, 0.2-0.9) per 100 person-years; 7 (88%) of these patients who developed HCC had viral hepatitis (eTable 2 in the

Older patients had a similar absolute risk of HCC compared with those aged 40 to 64 years, but after multivariable adjustment, the risk was increased (SHR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.22). This increased risk appeared to be associated with the cause of cirrhosis. In those without viral hepatitis, the adjusted SHR for older patients was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.79-1.95); in those with viral hepatitis, the adjusted SHR was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.19-2.78). The rate of HCC in those aged 40 to 64 years with viral hepatitis was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.3-3.0) per 100 person-years, and in those aged 65 years and older it was 4.4 (95% CI, 3.2-5.9) per 100 person-years compared with all patients without viral hepatitis (0.9 [95% CI, 0.8-1.1] per 100 person-years). The rate of incident HCC remained constant (
