<p>Patients younger than 40 years with compensated cirrhosis had a lower rate of subsequent decompensation compared with older patients (adjusted SHR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99), predominantly associated with a lower rate of hepatic encephalopathy (adjusted SHR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.78) (eTable 2 in the

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was associated with lower rates of incident ascites (adjusted SHR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.37-0.56), hepatic encephalopathy (adjusted SHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.28-0.50), variceal bleeding (adjusted SHR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16-0.47), and overall decompensation (adjusted SHR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.43-0.60) (eTable 4 in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Rates of decompensation increased over the study period, largely because of an increase in the incidence of ascites (
