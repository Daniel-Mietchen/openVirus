<p>During follow-up, 3026 patients (32.7%) died: 126 (21.5%) of those younger than 40 years, 1924 (31.9%) of those aged 40 to 64 years, and 976 (36.8%) of those aged 65 years and older. Corresponding mortality rates were 6.4 (95% CI, 5.4-7.6), 9.9 (95% CI, 9.5-10.4), and 16.2 (95% CI, 15.2-17.2) per 100 person-years, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>). The higher mortality rate in those aged 65 years and older was attenuated after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98-1.23). These differences in mortality associated with age were present in patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, although the differences were more apparent in patients with compensated cirrhosis (eFigure 1 in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>). Corresponding 1-, 2-, and 5-year cumulative survival rates are shown in eTable 3 in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>. Mortality rates decreased during the study period (11.9 [95% CI, 10.7-13.1] per 100 person-years in 2004 vs 10.0 [95% CI, 8.1-12.2] per 100 person-years in 2014; annual adjusted HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.86-0.88) (

Compared with cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis was associated with reduced mortality (adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-0.98), and NASH was associated with increased overall mortality (adjusted HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.30-1.60) in both bivariable and multivariable analyses (eTable 4 in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>). The reduced mortality associated with alcohol was more apparent for those with decompensated cirrhosis; the increased mortality associated with NASH was more apparent for those with compensated cirrhosis (eFigure 2 in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>). This reduction in mortality was present across age groups and different cirrhosis causes and persisted after multivariable adjustment.
