<p>Restricting the definition of NASH led to an increase in NASH prevalence (0.38% per year; 95% CI, 0.21%-0.55%;

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="note-ZOI190254-1-s">Supplement</xref>) was largely associated with patients without a recorded cause of cirrhosis; those with the restricted NASH definition had unadjusted mortality rates similar to those for the other causes (10.5 [95% CI, 9.1-12.1] per 100 person-years) and reduced mortality after multivariable adjustment (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.97). Other outcomes were unaffected by the alternative NASH definition.
