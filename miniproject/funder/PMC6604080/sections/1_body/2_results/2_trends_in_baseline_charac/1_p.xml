<p>Between 2004 and 2014, new diagnoses of cirrhosis increased by 69% (620 in 2004 vs 1045 in 2014). The proportion of those younger than 40 years increased by 0.20% per year (95% CI, 0.04% to 0.36%;

The proportion of liver cirrhosis due to alcohol increased by 0.80% (95% CI, 0.49% to 1.12%) and the proportion due to NASH increased by 0.59% per year (95% CI, 0.30% to 0.87%), whereas the proportion due to viral hepatitis decreased by 1.36% per year (95% CI, −1.68% to −1.03%) (

There was an increase in baseline decompensation by 1.80% per year (95% CI, 1.49% to 2.12%) across age groups, with greater increases for ascites (1.84% per year; 95% CI, 1.56% to 2.12%) compared with hepatic encephalopathy (0.85% per year; 95% CI, 0.59% to 1.10%). Comorbidity burden also increased over time, particularly in those aged 40 to 64 years and in those aged 65 years and older, with the proportion of patients with 4 or more comorbidities increasing by 0.39% per year (95% CI, 0.08% to 0.70%) and 0.75% per year (95% CI, 0.20% to 1.30%), respectively. The prevalence of HCC did not change over time.
