<p>Comparisons of the different causes of cirrhosis are shown in 
 <xref rid="zoi190254t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The group with viral hepatitis had the highest proportion of men (2237 [62.0%]), and the group with autoimmune or cholestatic disease had the highest proportion of women (141 [58.7%]). Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and NASH had higher proportions of baseline decompensation (1247 [40.2%] and 893 [38.7%], respectively) than did patients with viral hepatitis (945 [26.2%]). At baseline, HCC was present in 265 (7.3%) of those with viral hepatitis, compared with only 70 (2.3%) of those with alcoholic cirrhosis and 92 (4.0%) of those with NASH. The comorbidity burden was greatest among those with NASH.
