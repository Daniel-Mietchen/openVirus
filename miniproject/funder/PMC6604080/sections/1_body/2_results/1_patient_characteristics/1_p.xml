The younger and older groups had higher proportions of women compared with those aged 40 to 64 years (285 [48.7%] and 1366 [51.6%] vs 2501 [41.5%]). The leading causes of cirrhosis were alcohol in the group younger than 40 years, viral hepatitis in the group aged 40 to 64 years, and NASH in the group aged 65 years and older. At baseline, 3149 patients (34.0%) had decompensation, and of those, 2111 (67.0%) had ascites and 1613 (51.2%) had hepatic encephalopathy (similar across age groups). Hepatocellular carcinoma was present in 439 patients (4.7%) and was more common among older patients (174 [6.6%] of those aged â‰¥65 years vs 6 [1.0%] of those aged &lt;40 years). Older patients also had a greater burden of comorbidities; 1425 (53.8%) of those aged 65 years and older had at least 2 comorbidities (excluding their liver disease) compared with 2156 (35.8%) of those aged 40 to 64 years and 148 (25.3%) of those younger than 40 years. The top payers were Medicaid for those younger than 40 years (199 patients [36.7%]), commercial insurance for those aged 40 to 64 years (1664 patients [31.0%]), and Medicare for those aged 65 years and older (2226 patients [89.8%]).
