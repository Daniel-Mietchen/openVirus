<p>A total of 356 cattle serum samples were analysed for presence of RVFV antibodies, of which 147 samples were from the Kyela district and 209 samples were from the Morogoro district. The overall seropositivity by cELISA was 29.2% (104/356) and a seroprevalence of 32% (47/147) and 27% (57/209) were recorded among animals in Kyela and Morogoro districts respectively. Animals older than 2 years were more likely to be seropositive than animals younger than 2 years (OR = 0.19; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). There were no significant differences between the districts (OR = 0.98; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1.0) and the type of holding (OR = 1.25; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.34).
