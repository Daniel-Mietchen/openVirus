<p>For each cELISA experiment, duplicate internal controls were incorporated. The optical densities (ODs) of the control were detected at 450 nm. To verify the reliability and validity of the results obtained from each cELISA test, the average of the ODs of the two negative controls (NCs) was &gt; 0.7 while the average of the two positive controls divided by the average OD of the NCs was &gt; 0.3. For each sample, the competition percentage was calculated by dividing the OD of the sample by the average OD of the negative control multiplied by 100 ([ODsample/ODNC] x 100). A sample was considered positive if the value obtained from the formula was ≤ 40%. Any sample with a value of &gt; 50% was considered to be negative, whereas values ranging from 40–50% were considered to be doubtful.</p>
