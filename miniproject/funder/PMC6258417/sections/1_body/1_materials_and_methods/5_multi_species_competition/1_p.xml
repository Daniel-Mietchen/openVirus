<p>Each serum sample was analysed with the commercial Innovative Diagnostic (ID.vet) Screen RVF competition multispecies ELISA (cELISA) (IDVet, Montpelier, France). The commercial cELISA is based on the recombinant RVFV nucleoprotein and detects both RVFV IgM and IgG antibodies. The cELISA was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 50 μl of the dilution buffer was dispensed into each well of a labelled ELISA plate pre-coated with recombinant RVFV nucleoprotein. Then, 50 μl of the internal positive (freeze-dried RVFV IgG positive bovine serum supplied by the manufacturer) and the internal negative control (supplied by the manufacturer) were added in duplicates. To the remaining wells, 50 μl of each sample was added. After mixing samples and controls with the TST dilution buffer (50 mM Tris/150 mM NaCl/0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0), we incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The wells were washed three times with washing buffer using a well plate washer (Thermo Scientific Wellwash Microplate Washer, Waltham, MA USA). Next, 100 μl of antinucleoprotein peroxidase (HRP) conjugate was added to the wells and the contents of the plate were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, followed by washing three times with 300 μl of wash solution as before to remove excess conjugate. Then, 100 μl of substrate solution 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. To terminate the reaction 100 μl of 2n Sulphuric acid (2NH
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) stop solution was added to each well. The presence of antibodies to RVFV was detected by lack of a colour change, whereas absence of antibodies to RVFV was detected by a change in substrate colour to blue. The contents of the wells of the microplate were read at a wavelength of 450 nm by a microplate absorbance reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA).
