<p>Other factors that may contribute to the observed high RVFV seroprevalence include activities that facilitate animal movements such as livestock trade, moving animals to areas with green pastures during the drought season, lending animals among the community members and payment of dowry. Animal movements from high-risk areas could introduce RVFV into na√Øve animals in new areas [

Such data will be essential for formulation of RVFV control strategies.
