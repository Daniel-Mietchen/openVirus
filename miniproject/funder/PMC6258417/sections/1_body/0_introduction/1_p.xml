<p>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic disease that causes storm abortions in ruminants [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The disease leads to introduction of restrictions for international livestock trade from enzootic/endemic countries. The disease imposes a dual impact in that it exacerbates the poverty cycle in livestock-dependent communities, by causing substantial health costs and at the same time affecting negatively the livelihoods of the communities in many sub-Saharan countries where it is enzootic/endemic[

Since then, the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) has been associated with several periodic disease epidemics and epizootics affecting human and animals in many regions of Africa. Although the virus is enzootic/endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, it has the potential for global spread and has already crossed significant natural geographic barriers such as the Indian Ocean, the Sahara Desert and the Red Sea to reach naive ecologies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006931.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in 2000. This northward spread of RVFV suggests the possibility of the virus being introduced into Europe and North America where several species of mosquitoes competent for viral transmission exist [
