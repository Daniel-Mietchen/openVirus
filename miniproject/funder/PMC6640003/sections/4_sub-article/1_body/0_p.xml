<p>This study aims to assess the presence of serum IgG to S. Enteritidis and Typhimurium by age and sex in a broad Ugandan cohort. It is of value because the sero-epidemiology of NTS in Uganda, as opposed to other African countries, is not well understood.

   <p>More detail is needed for the in-house ELISA. Presumably, it was conducted with purified OPS, as with other studies from this group (e.g. Fiorino 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-27468-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
    </sup>). At the moment, it is not clear whether the serum IgG responses are directed against the OPS (and therefore serogroup B/D-specific) as opposed to the core oligosaccharide or lipid A (all other NTS). What is an Antibody Unit?

   <p>The authors mention that the lack of seroconversion to OAg-specific IgG in Ugandan children could be due to variation in exposure to NTS. To further support this hypothesis, it would be interesting to assess the kinetics of IgM since both anti-Typhimurium IgG and IgM can demonstrate bactericidal activity (Goh 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-27468-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
    </sup>). If these titers are available, it would add a thought-provoking element to the data set.
