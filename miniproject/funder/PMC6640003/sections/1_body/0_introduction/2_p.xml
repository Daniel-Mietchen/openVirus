<p>Studies in Malawian children indicate that anti-

Given that incidence of iNTS disease drops in children over 2 years, it has been suggested that a rise in specific antibodies and bactericidal activity correlates with protection. This hypothesis is complicated by the observation that among HIV-infected Malawian adults, high LPS-specific IgG was associated with a lack of
