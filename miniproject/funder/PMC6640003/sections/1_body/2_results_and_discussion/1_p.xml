<p>In this assay, overall O-antigen seropositivity was 82% for 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium, and was 70% for 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis. Levels of antibody were undetectable in at least 50% of children until 18 months for both serovars and a similar pattern of increasing IgG level was observed with increasing age ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). There were no observable differences in antibody levels by sex ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). HIV-infected individuals did not have notably high IgG antibody responses, although the study was not powered to demonstrate this.
