<p>In a cross-sectional study, we investigated NTS-specific antibody responses in the rural Ugandan General Population Cohort (GPC)

 </sup>. Levels of IgG against serovars 
 <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium and 
 <italic>S</italic>. Enteritidis LPS O-antigens were measured using a standardised in-house ELISA in stored sera from a cross-section of 1,090 Ugandans of all ages, 10 of whom were HIV-infected. Sera from adults (â‰¥ 16 years) were collected from January 2014 to November 2015, and children (&lt;16 years) from January 2016 to November 2017. Antibody units (AU) were calculated using Gen5 software (version 2.0) using a five-parameter logistic (5PL) curve generated with a standard serum from an iNTS-exposed individual. Sera were defined as seronegative if below the lower limit of detection (4 AU for 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and 5 AU for 
 <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis) at 1:100 serum dilution.
