<p>The study investigates the sero-prevalence of iNTS, serovar Typhimurium and Enteritidis in Uganda. The study further describes the sero-epidemiology by age and sex of these pathogens in Uganda. This is a very useful study since very little is known about the basic epidemiology of iNTS in the Uganda population.

   <p>Since the authors’ main explanation for the observed differences in sero-prevalence between Malawi and Uganda are due to differences in the experimental assays used to quantify O-antigen IgG, it would be good to give more details of this in-house ELISA assay. </p>

   <p>Since some of the authors from the Malawi study are also authors of the present study, is it not possible to run some of the Uganda sera (probably the sera in the less than 18 months age group) on the older flow-cytometry technique described in the MacLennan 
    <italic>et al.</italic> (2008 
    <sup>

   <p>I agree with the authors that very little is known about the most commonly circulating and disease-causing serovars of NTS in Uganda. However, it might be good to mention one or two current literatures, such as Afema 
    <italic>et al.</italic> (2016 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-27467-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
    </sup>), where they show that neither  
    <italic>S. </italic>Typhimurium nor  
    <italic>S. </italic>Enteritidis are commonly isolated NTS serovars in Uganda (while in Malawi, Typhimurium and Enteritidis together make up over 90% of NTS cases (Feasey 
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015 
    <sup>
     <xref rid="rep-ref-27467-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
    </sup>)).

   <p>It wouldn’t hurt to show a graph of the O-antigen IgG data in HIV-infected and age-matched healthy individuals.</p>
