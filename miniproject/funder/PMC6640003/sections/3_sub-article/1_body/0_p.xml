<p>The article describes an important aspect of research which needs more data. Knowing when children are exposed to salmonella infection can inform schedules for vaccination and other control interventions.

   <p>The aim of the study should be clear, given the limitation in the standardized method for immunological assessment (I suspect it was to determine the kinetics of antibody acquisition by age). The differences in assays could be discussed in the limitations and maybe how the difference can affect the date explained as well. </p>

   <p>The assay is not described (just called in house) - reviewers could have advised how best to analyse or interpret the data. Did they try to do an EQA with another lab that used a different method to maybe determine concordance?</p>

   <p>While the infants in this study have antibodies much later than Malawi, it is not clear if the mean concentrations increase with time or if it is just the number(%) (i.e. positivity rates) of participants with antibodies that increase over time. The authors could have compared the reported concentrations between the countries.</p>
