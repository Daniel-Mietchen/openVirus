<p>A total of 155 S, 99 M, and 97 L minigenomic segments of RVFV sequence data were available from Genbank (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Sequences had lengths of 1689–1692 base pairs (bp) for S, 3871–3885 bp for M, and 6397–6404 bp for L. These sequences represented RVFV strains from 18 countries across Africa plus Saudi Arabia (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Saudi Arabian strains were represented by sequences for two S segments, one M segment, and one L segment only. Full details of the sequence data are available via Figshare (
