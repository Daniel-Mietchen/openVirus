<p>Skyride plots reconstructing temporal variation in RVFV genetic diversity are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005226.g002">Fig 2</xref> for all three segments. All three indicate a peak in diversity around the middle of the twentieth century, followed by a decline and levelling off, with a subsequent increase in the reconstruction for the S segment.
