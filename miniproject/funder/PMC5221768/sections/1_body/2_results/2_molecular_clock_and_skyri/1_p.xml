<p>The nucleotide substitution models with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion scores identified by JModelTest were TPM2uf+I+G for the S segment, and GTR+I+G for both M and L. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree for the M segment is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005226.g001">Fig 1</xref>; trees for the other two segments can be found in the supplementary materials (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s001">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s002">S2</xref> Files). Lineages previously identified and discussed by Bird et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] are indicated on the trees.
