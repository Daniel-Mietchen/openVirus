<p>The downsampled datasets consisted of 49 sequences for S, 33 for M, and 32 for L. For L, the posterior mean substitution rate was 2.406 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year (1.106 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 4.4065 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) and the posterior mean TMRCA was 1870 (1810–1919). For S, the rate was 3.636 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year (2.058 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 5.248 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) and the TMRCA was 1914 (1893–1935). These rate estimates are consistent with those estimated from the full dataset, although the TMRCA point estimates are rather different; we noted a clear loss of precision in using the smaller alignments and considerable HPD interval overlap. For M, however, the posterior mean rate was 2.74 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/site/year (1.965 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 3.573 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) and the posterior mean TMRCA was 1881 (1844–1907). The results of the posterior mean nucleotide substitution rates and TMRCA from both full and downsampled datasets are summarized in supplementary materials (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s003">S3 File</xref>). The skyride plots for the downsampled analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s004">S4 File</xref>) did not indicate that the inclusion of all GenBank sequences had any major effect on the demographic reconstructions.
