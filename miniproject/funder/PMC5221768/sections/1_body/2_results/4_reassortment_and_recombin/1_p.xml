<p>The full concatenated alignment was 11,999 bp in length, with the S segment occupying positions 1–1695, the M segment positions 1696–5595, and the L segment positions 5596–19999. The RDP algorithm identified two events that suggest segment reassortment. The first suggested that strain 2007000608 is a reassortment of the L and S segments of 2007000234 and the M segment of 2007001811. All three isolates were sampled in Kenya in late 2006 or early 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, the GenBank records for the M segments of 2007000608 and 2007001811 are identical, which raises the possibility of a database error. The estimated breakpoints were at positions 1581 (95% confidence interval 1238–2043) and 5565 (5391–5917), strongly suggesting agreement with segment boundaries.
