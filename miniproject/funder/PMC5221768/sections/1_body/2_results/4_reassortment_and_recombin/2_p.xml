<p>The second event suggested that the Tanzanian isolate TAN/Tan-001/07 was a reassortment of the M segment from another Tanzanian isolate, TAN/Dod-002/07, and the L and S segments from the Kenyan isolate 2007001564. All three were sampled in early 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and no two segments were identical. RDP identified a number of small recombination events, but none involved a longer genomic region. Again, the breakpoints at positions 1919 (1385–2202) and 5441 (5285–5917) were consistent with reassortment. RDP identified four other potential recombination events whose breakpoints did not coincide with segment boundaries in the concatenated alignment, and therefore were not suggestive of reassortment; see supplementary file for details (
