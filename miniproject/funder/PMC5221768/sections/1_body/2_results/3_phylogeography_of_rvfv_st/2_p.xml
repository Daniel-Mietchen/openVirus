The reconstruction using all three segments revealed that the highest median number of jumps was from Kenya to other countries in East Africa; movements of RVFV lineages from Kenya to Tanzania are particularly well supported (posterior probability &gt;0.9). Hence, arrival of the virus in Tanzania in 2007 was probably related to a single introduction event from Kenya. Introductions of RVFV to Madagascar came in three waves: the first from Zimbabwe, and the second and third from Kenya.
