<p>The M and L segments suggested a single introduction from Kenya to Saudi Arabia, with a posterior probability &gt;0.79 for both segments. Movement of the virus between Kenya and Sudan occurred in both directions, with posterior probabilities of &gt;0.7. Similarly, transitions between Central African Republic and Zimbabwe were reconstructed in both directions (posterior probabilities 0.57, 0.79, and 0.69 for S, M, and L, respectively, for Central African Republic to Zimbabwe; posterior probabilities 0.62, 0.51, and 0.64 for Zimbabwe to Central African Republic, for S, M, and L, respectively). The S segment revealed information about movements involving countries for which it was the only segment available: from Kenya to Somalia (posterior probability 0.77), Burkina Faso to Mauritania (posterior probability 0.80), Burkina Faso to Senegal (posterior probability 0.78), Kenya to Central African Republic (posterior probability 0.91), and Kenya to South Africa (posterior probability 0.91). Results of phylogeographic analyses for the downsampled datasets were similar with the results from those reported above (
