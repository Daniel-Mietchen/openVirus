 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005226.g003">Fig 3</xref> presents the MCC phylogeny for the M segment, this time with branches colored by highest posterior probability of location; trees for the other two segments are in the supplementary materials (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s005">S5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005226.s006">S6</xref> Files). The tree shows that strains from Saudi Arabia belong to the same lineage (B) as those from Kenya in 1998 and Madagascar in 1991. Most strains from West Africa (Mauritania and Burkina Faso) are part of lineage D, but those from Guinea are in lineage C, which is otherwise recorded in the Central African Republic and Zimbabwe.
