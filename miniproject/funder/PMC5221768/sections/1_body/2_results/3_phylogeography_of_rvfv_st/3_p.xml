<p>The two major outbreaks in Egypt since 1977 originally may have been the result of a long-distance introduction from Zimbabwe, as they are closely related to strains from that country in 1974. The Markov Jumps reconstruction revealed a possible transition from Kenya to Mayotte, with posterior probabilities ranging from 0.83 to 0.96 in different genomic segments. All sequences from Sudan came from a single outbreak in 2007â€“2010, and were closely related to isolates from outbreaks occurring in other East African countries since 2007; the reconstruction suggested direct movement of the virus from Kenya to Sudan (posterior probability &gt;0.7).</p>
