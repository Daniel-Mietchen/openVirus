<p>We used JModelTest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to identify the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model for each of the segments separately. A molecular clock-based phylogenetic analysis was performed for each segment separately in BEAST [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], using the best-fitting nucleotide substitution model for each segment, an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and a GMRF Bayesian skyride tree prior [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Because variation among virus sampling dates (i.e., 1944â€“2010) is of meaningful magnitude relative to the time to most recent common ancestor of the clade in question [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the temporal information associated with sampling each isolate had to be taken into consideration [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Sampling dates were used as prior information to calibrate the tree, estimate ages of different RVFV lineages, and infer evolutionary history of the strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock was used in light of its high accuracy and precision to infer temporal information into molecular phylogeny [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Codon positions 1 and 2, and codon position 3, were treated as two separate partitions in the alignment. Multiple Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) runs of 10
 <sup>8</sup> states (the first 10% was discarded as burn-in) were combined to achieve estimated sample sizes of at least 250 for all numerical model parameters.
