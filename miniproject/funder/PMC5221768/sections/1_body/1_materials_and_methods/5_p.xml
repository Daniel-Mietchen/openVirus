<p>Reassortment between RFV segments was investigated by concatenating the alignments for the three segments, retaining only sequences from isolates for which at least two segments were available. We used the RDP method implemented in the program RDP4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to identify recombination breakpoints in the concatenated alignment. A reassortment event was implied where these breakpoints coincided with segment boundaries.
