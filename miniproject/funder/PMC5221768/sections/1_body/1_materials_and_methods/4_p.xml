<p>As the full dataset consisting of every available RVFV sequence in GenBank is a very uneven sample, we wished to confirm that our results were robust to this unevenness. Hence, we repeated these analyses using datasets produced by randomly removing sequences from each alignment until they contained no more than one sequence from isolates obtained in a single country during a single year. For each segment, the molecular clock and phylogeography procedure was then repeated as described above, for these smaller datasets. The smaller size of these datasets led to poor MCMC convergence when the JModelTest-identified substitution models were used, so we employed the SRD06 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] model instead. All other settings in BEAST were identical.
