<p>The posterior set of trees from each of the three initial BEAST analyses was used as an empirical tree set for a discrete-trait phylogeography analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We assumed an asymmetrical rate matrix. For each tree sampled from the MCMC, Markov Jumps procedure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was used to reconstruct a stochastic realization of the between-country diffusion process; results were summarized over the entire posterior distribution by calculating median numbers of transitions between each pair of countries and the posterior probability that at least one transition occurred.
