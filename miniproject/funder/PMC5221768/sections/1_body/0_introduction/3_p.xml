<p>RVFV has been isolated from both livestock and mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The virus is maintained in mammal host species, including cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, in which infections have been reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. RVFV is transmitted via several routes: mosquitoes serve as vectors in most cases, but direct transmission through aerosol and contact with abortion products are other routes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. RVFV is also capable of persisting in the environment for long periods between epidemics [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], facilitated by vertical transmission among mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
