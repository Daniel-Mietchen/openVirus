<p>A recurrence of RVF in East Africa was reported in 1997–1998 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In 1987, the first West African epidemic occurred in Senegal and Mauritania during flooding in the lower Senegal River area [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 2000–2010, outbreaks were reported in Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia, Senegal, Mauritania, and Swaziland, with incidence rates higher than in the 1978 Egyptian epidemic [
