<p>Historical movements of RVFV among countries raise concerns about possible appearance of RVFV in new regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Here, we aim to derive a detailed picture of RVFV phylogeny based on analysis of sequences of the three segments. We used phylogeographic approaches to examine mobility patterns of virus lineages across the virusâ€™ geographic distribution.
