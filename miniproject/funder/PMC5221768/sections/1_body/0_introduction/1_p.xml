<p>Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is an acute zoonotic viral disease caused by RVF virus (RVFV; 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>) that affects both large mammals and humans, and that is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It causes high mortality and abortions in ruminants [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; while infections in humans are characterized by febrile illness, followed by hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and ocular disease, and can lead to death [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, being first isolated in Kenya in 1930 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Outbreaks were limited to that region until 1977–1978, when the virus spread to Egypt [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 1993, southern Egypt suffered a further outbreak, in which 600–1500 human infections were reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Periodic RVFV epizootics and epidemics have been associated with above-average rainfall and other environmental factors that result in dramatically increased mosquito populations [
