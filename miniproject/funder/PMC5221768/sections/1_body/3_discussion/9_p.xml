<p>These latter phylogeographic analyses revealed the overall picture of RVFV history and migration across Africa and Arabian Peninsula. Early RVFV strains were restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa; however, the virus was later identified from several parts across North and West Africa. The considerable mobility and dynamic distribution of the virus allowed spread and invasion of the virus to new regions, including in the Arabian Peninsula. Understanding the movement patterns between countries represents one of the major reasons why we set out to understand the detailed picture of the virus evolution and biogeography.</p>
