<p>Discrete-traits phylogenetic approaches have some limitations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our case, these limitations are associated with the nature of virus sampling across its range, as sampling is generally unbalanced. This point suggests that some aspects of our results should be interpreted with caution. For example, country was used as indication of location in our analyses, which is quite coarse for some of the spatial phenomena that we would like to reconstruct. As more sequence data become available, it should be possible to develop finer-resolution views.
