<p>The substitution rate estimates in our study were similar to those in previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Other studies have reported higher rates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]: for example, estimates from Aradaib 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] were 4.20 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 5.06 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, and 4.29 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year for S, M, and L, respectively; the 95% HPD intervals reported in that paper overlap with ours. These differences might be a result of the different datasets used: our work should have better resolution because the dataset is larger and more diverse. The Aradaib 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] study was also limited to only two lineages of the 11 in our analysis, and covered only strains from Kenya, Sudan, Madagascar, and Zimbabwe. Interestingly, Freire 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] found a lower evolutionary rate in the large minigenomic segment, suggesting a distinct evolutionary history in the three segments; our results corroborated this finding [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
