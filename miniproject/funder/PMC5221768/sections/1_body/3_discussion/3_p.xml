<p>Previous studies reported earlier TMRCA estimates than ours. Bird 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] estimated the mean TMRCA as 1891 for the S segment, 1882 for M, and 1887 for L. These differences could be a result of our larger dataset, and reflect higher estimates of substitution rates; again, their HPD estimates overlap with ours. As the HPD intervals for the TMRCAs of the three segments in our analysis all overlap, the difference in point estimates likely reflects statistical uncertainty only. Our TMRCA estimates for all segments agreed well with the first report of RVFV in 1930 in Kenya [
