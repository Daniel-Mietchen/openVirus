<p>RVFV strains from West Africa fell in two lineages (C &amp; D): one included samples from Guinea and another that included samples from Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Senegal. Our results suggest possible introduction of RVFV to Guinea from the Central African Republic, and that the outbreak in Mauritania in 1987 had its origin in lineages that were in Burkina Faso in 1983. The route of introduction from East Africa to West Africa more fundamentally is still unclear. Our analysis suggested interesting patterns for outbreaks in Mauritania and Egypt, in comparison to recent outbreaks in Kenya, with single viral introductions to Mauritania and Egypt, but multiple origins for the 2007â€“2010 outbreaks in Kenya.</p>
