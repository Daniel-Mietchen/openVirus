<p>This study used up-to-date phylogenetic approaches [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] to investigate the ancestry of RVFV strains across Africa and Saudi Arabia, and to study virus movements and host transitions. Sequences for the three segments of the RVFV genome were available for strains sampled over a span of 66 years (1944â€“2010). RVFV minigenomic segments showed differences in amounts of genetic change and time scale [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These analyses used phylogenetic approaches similar to ours; however, our analysis takes advantage of a discrete-traits phylogenetic analysis using Markov Jumps to infer the history of between-country and between-host movements.
