<p>Previous studies identified evidence of reassortment events among RVFV segments [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our phylogenetic analyses showed incongruences in the topologies of the three minigenomic segments of RVFV, these incongruences could result from genetic reassortments. Final analyses to investigate the reassortment and recombination events were based on the RDP algorithm: all strains potentially involved in the reassortment events were from East Africa. This possibility of reassortment raises two important concerns in regard to the potential of RVFV epidemics and its pathogenicity, although detailed studies with which to answer these questions are lacking. Successful reassortment under natural selection requires (1) co-occurrence of at least two different strains in the same host, area, and time; and (2) the reassorted strain would have to be virulent and able to infect a host. The two strains detected as possible reassortments in this study were from humans and bovines, and not restricted to a single host [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005226.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], this study also suggests that small recombination events may indeed occur, although none involving long gene regions. Reassortment and recombination represent key potential mechanisms to promote emergence of novel strains of RVFV that may be more virulent and can infect broad ranges of hosts, and locations. Further studies investigating possible influences of reassortment events in RVFV evolution across Africa and Arabian Peninsula are much needed.
