<p>Our results assist the RVFV control program across its range in three ways. (1) The study shows possible movement and migration of the virus among endemic areas; as such, this study allows tracking virus movement among countries, which may inform transportation guidelines for animal shipments. (2) Our calculations of evolutionary rates and TMRCAs offer a more detailed picture of the temporal nature of successive outbreaks of RVFV. Finally, (3) possible reassortment and recombination events reported herein raise important questions regarding control programs related to novel strains of RVFV across the potential geographic range, attenuated vaccination efficacy, and changing virus pathogenicity. Future studies should collect samples more systematically, and on a much finer scale with respect to location and host, to give a more detailed picture of migratory patterns of RVFV across the continent for a comprehensive study including reconstruction of both geographical and between-host transmission.</p>
