<p>Sequences were aligned with NCBI- and GISAID-archived [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] HA and NA sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213290.s001">S1 Table</xref>), using MegAlign program (Lasergene, version 14, DNASTARInc., WI, USA). The Lasergene MegAlign software marks nucleotide differences between the aligned sequences. Subsequently, chromatograms of our sequences were inspected visually for these nucleotides to check if the chromatogram peak and deduced bases match. This procedure is essential to verify whether a detected nucleotide substitution was due to real mutation or to a technical problem in the automatic chromatogram base calling. The annotated Palestinian sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession numbers KY075819-KY075852.
