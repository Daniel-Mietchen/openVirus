<p>Influenza A RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Amplification of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes occurred in a one step RT-PCR reaction using One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Complete HA and NA ORFs were basically amplified using primer sets recommended by WHO [

The primer pair H3N2R1104 and N2F257 for A(H3N2) amplification were modified during this research based on initial sequencing results to enhance the yield of the RT-PCR product as following H3N2R1104 (
 <monospace>ATCCACACGTCATTTCCATCATCA</monospace>) and N2F257 (
 <monospace>AAACCAGCAGAATACAGAAATTGGTC</monospace>). Screening for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) was performed using the N1F401/NARUc and H3A1F3/HARUc primer pairs respectively [
