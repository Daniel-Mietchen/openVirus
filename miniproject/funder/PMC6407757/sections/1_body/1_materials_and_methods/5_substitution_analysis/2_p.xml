<p>We noticed that the HA substitutionsâ€™ numbering in the literature was not consistent, as some authors used the amino acid (aa) position on the HA protein while others used aa positions on the HA1 and HA2 subunits. Therefore, we decided to indicate both position numberings in our tables to avoid confusion; however, we used the HA1 and HA2 substitution numbering throughout the manuscript and underlined the HA2 substitutions to distinguish them from HA1 ones.</p>
