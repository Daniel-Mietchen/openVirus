<p>Substitution events in the Palestinian HA and NA genes were identified by comparing sequences to the A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) vaccine strains of the isolation season 2014/2015, A/California/07/2009(H1N1) and A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2). Occurrence of these substitutions in archived sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213290.s001">S1 Table</xref>) and recent vaccine strains (A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1), A/Switzerland/9715293/2013(H3N2), and A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)) was also recorded. Substitution analysis was performed using MegAlign program. Additionally, amino acid substitution/mutation report provided by FluServer [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was used to assess circulation of the substitution. To delineate substitutions, PubMed and FluServer [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] databases were queried. Information regarding location of substitution within antigenic sites of A(H3N2) isolates was identified based on epitope mapping reports [

 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Substitution residues in the antigenic sites of A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates were identified based on recent studies, which used A/California/07/2009 for mapping epitopes [
