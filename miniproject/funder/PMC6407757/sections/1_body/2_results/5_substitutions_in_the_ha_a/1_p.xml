<p>23 non-synonymous substitutions were identified in the HA genes of the Palestinian influenza A virus subtype A(H3N2) (
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 18 of the 23 substitutions occurred in the HA1 domain and five in the HA2 domain, respectively. HA1 substitutions D53N, E62K, N121K, N121A, N122D, N128A, N128T, R142G, N144S, N144R, N145S, L157S, F159Y, K160T, P198S, N225D, and Q311H were located within antigenic epitopes of the HA gene. 26 synonymous substitutions were also detected in the Palestinian HA genes of the A(H3N2) isolates (
