<p>50 samples (25%) of the collected 200 NPA tested positive for IAV, from which 24 represented A(H1N1)pdm09, and 26 represented A(H3N2) subtype, respectively. IAV infection distributed almost equally between males (54%) and females (46%), while subtype H3N2 was responsible for most IAV infections among males (65.4%), H1N1 caused more infections in females (58.3%); this was not statistically significant.</p>
