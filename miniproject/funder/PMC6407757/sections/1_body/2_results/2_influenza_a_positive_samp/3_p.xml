<p>While the monthly distribution of IAV positive samples relative to collected samples each month did not significantly vary between the months (26.3% on February, 21.8% on March, 29.9% on April and 22.2% on May), the monthly distribution of the subtypes changed. In fact, the majority of the A(H1N1)pdm09 cases were detected in April, while the majority of the A(H3N2) cases were detected in March (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213290.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Fisherâ€™s Exact Test for count data was performed to test whether being infected by A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) is associated with the month of sampling. The test was significant for both subtypes (p-value = 0.00019 for A(H1N1)pdm09 and 0.0011 for A(H3N2)).
