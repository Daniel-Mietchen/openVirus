<p>The percentages of cases infected with IAV throughout the four age groups relative to the number of total samples presented in each group were 30.4%, 23.8%, 20%, and 26.8% for age group ≤1 year, 1–6 years, 7–18 years, and &gt;18 years, respectively. However, the distribution of IAV subtypes throughout the different age groups varied. Most of the IAV infections in the eldest age group (&gt;18 years) were due to A(H1N1)pdm09 (

Although this finding was not statistically significant based on Fisher’s exact test (p-value = 0.078 for H1N1 and 0.094 for H3N2), the test revealed that the odds of being infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 among adults were higher than the odds of being infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 in those ≤6 years, while the odds of being infected with A(H3N2) in subjects ≤6 years were higher than in adults.
