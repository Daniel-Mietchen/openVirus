<p>Twenty non-synonymous substitutions were detected in the three HA genes of the Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates; three occurred in the signal peptide, ten in the HA1 domain, and seven in the HA2 domain (
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). With the exception of A3D substitution in the signal peptide, all other substitutions occurred in NCBI- and/or GISAID-archived [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] sequences. Seven out of the ten substitutions in the HA1 domain of the Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates; P83S, S84N, K163Q, S185T, S203T, K283E, and I295V were located within antigenic epitopes. 27 synonymous substitutions were also detected in HA of the Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates (
