<p>Both HA and NA sequences of Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates showed percent identity around 97â€“98% with A/California/7/2009, the H1N1 vaccine component between 2011 and 2016, which includes our sampling season. Percent identity was however ~99% for HA and &gt;99% for NA with A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1)pdm09, the H1N1 vaccine component since season 2016/2017. All three Palestinian isolates with full length HA gene carried substitutions D97N, K163Q, S185T, S203T, A256T, K283E in the HA1 domain and 
 <underline>E47K</underline>, 
 <underline>S124K</underline>, 
 <underline>E172K</underline> in the HA2 domain and consequently fell into clade 6B (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213290.g003">Fig 3</xref>), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates did not necessarily cluster with regional isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213290.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Palestinian KY075819 was almost identical with an isolate from California of the same year (KT836680), Palestinian KY075820 clustered with an isolate from Hawaii (KT836860), and Palestinian KY075821 clustered with an isolate from India (KT241020) and Jordan (EPI589572) on the same branch with A/Michigan/45/2015(H1N1).
