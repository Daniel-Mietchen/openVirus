<p>Percent identities between 11 of the 12 HA sequences of Palestinian A(H3N2) and A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2), vaccine component of our isolation season 2014/2015, ranged from 97.4â€“98.4%. However, it was &gt;99% with A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2), the vaccine component of seasons 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. Ten of these 11 Palestinian sequences exhibited substitutions L3I, N144S, N145S, F159Y, K160T, N225D, Q311H in the HA1 domain, and 
 <underline>D160N</underline> in the HA2 (
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) designating them to subclade 3C.2a. One (KY075834) of these 11 Palestinian sequences possessed all above substitutions but N144S and therefore fell into clade 3C.2. The twelfth Palestinian HA sequence (KY075845) contained N128A, R142G, N145S substitutions, and therefore fell into clade 3C.3. Ten (with full length HA gene) of the 12 HA sequences of Palestinian H3N2 isolates subjected to phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213290.g004">Fig 4</xref>) clustered together or/and with isolates from Bangkok (KP877361), Hawaii (KT842604), and Jordan (EPI589747 and EPI589759). Palestinian KY075845 clustered with an isolate from Washington (KT843007).
