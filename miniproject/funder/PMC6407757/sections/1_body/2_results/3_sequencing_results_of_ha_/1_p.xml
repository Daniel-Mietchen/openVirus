<p>HA and NA segments of all 50 positive IAV samples were subjected to gene amplification and sequencing. Complete or partial HA and/or NA sequencing were obtained in 10 H1N1 (three samples with full length HA and NA genesâ€™ sequences, seven with ~70% partial NA sequences only) and 12 H3N2 (six samples with full length HA and NA sequences, one with full length HA and partial NA, three with full length HA only, and two with partial HA gene sequence only).</p>
