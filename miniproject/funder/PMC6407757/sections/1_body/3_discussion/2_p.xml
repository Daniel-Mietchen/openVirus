<p>Our study demonstrated that the rate of infection with IAV among the different Palestinian age groups did not differ significantly and ranged from 20%-30%. The highest infection rate was detected in the â‰¤1-year-olds group, which in this study, were subjects that were either hospitalized, or visited a private clinic. Indeed, infants are considered to be at a high risk for influenza infection and associated with hospitalization (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] argue, that there is a lack of studies in this regard and the majority of the data was from the USA. On the other hand, a comprehensive Flu Watch Group cohort study [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], concluded that influenza A infected 24% or 22% of unvaccinated people in the season preceding pandemic or during pandemic season, and that infection rates were highest in children, which generally agrees with our findings.
