<p>Our study elucidated that both A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were co-circulating in Palestine between February and May 2015 without an overall predominance of one subtype or the other. This finding was in accordance or was partially in accordance with regional studies from Lebanon, Iran, and Tunisia [

 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which were performed during the same influenza season of our sampling. However, our findings did not agree with WHO weekly influenza surveillance reports of 2015 for season 2014/2014, which revealed a predominance of A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype in the Middle East [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hence, we reviewed the Flumart Outputs of the WHO FluNet database [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] for the Middle Eastern and North African countries for the exact period of our sampling. Reasonable data (IAV subtyped cases ≥ 50 over 8 weeks of our sampling time) were available from Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and Turkey. While no one single A(H3N2) case was indicated from Qatar, the A(H1N1)pdm09 reported cases by far outnumbered A(H3N2) cases from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Oman, Tunisia and Turkey. The percentages of subtyped A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 cases from Iran were similar to our results and to those of Moasser et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showing no predominance of one subtype. Interestingly, A(H3N2) was predominant in Israel according to the WHO Flumart Outputs [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and a recent Israeli study [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which was in line with surveillance reports from the northern hemisphere for season 2014/2015, including the USA, Canada and Europe, [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The discrepancies between our findings and regional reports, including the WHO influenza surveillance report in regard to subtype dominance cannot be attributed to our study setting in regard to targeted study sample, as both subtypes were present in all groups of our study sample; hospitalized patients, outpatients, kindergarten children, private clinic patients, and private individuals. From another aspect, our study revealed that the odds of being infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 among adults was higher than in infants and children ≤ 6-year-old, while the odds of being infected with A(H3N2) was higher in infants and children ≤ 6-year-old. Nevertheless, The relationship between age and infection with a specific influenza A subtype is a matter of inconsistencies between different reports, which may vary with season, epidemic timing, lack of pre-existing immunity against novel A(H3N2), and study settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our case, this result could be attributed to the limitation of our study in regard to the number of samples collected in these different groups and the months of collection.
