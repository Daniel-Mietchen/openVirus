<p>The emergence of IAV substitutions/mutations should be carefully monitored for public health concerns, as detailed above, many amino acid substitutions evolved during outbreaks and were only detected in few cases before becoming dominant few years later. Therefore, we believe that our study contributes to the international efforts by providing epidemiological and molecular biological insights into influenza A viruses circulating in Palestine and advocate for comprehensive annual typing and mutation analyses of Influenza A in Palestine and the region.</p>
