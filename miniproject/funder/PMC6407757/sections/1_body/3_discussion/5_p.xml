<p>We detected 20 non-synonymous substitutions in the NA sequences from 10 Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates. All of these substitutions were circulating in NCBI- and GISAID-archived sequences. Some of these substitutions were detected in oseltamivir-resistant strains, but do not confer resistance per se, such as N44S, N200S, V241I, and N369K [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Substitutions S79L and K331N, occurred independently in three and in one Palestinian NA sequences, were studied thoroughly by Ilyushina et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], who demonstrated that S79L reduced the activity of the NA enzyme, while the K331N was associated with evidently increased resistance to IFN-Î»1. Substitutions V241I, N369K, N386K and K432E, detected in all Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 NA sequences, may alter the binding affinity between oseltamivir and NA, and consequently affect susceptibility of A(H1N1)pdm09 strains to oseltamivir [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Substitution I365T, which occurred in one Palestinian sequence, was related to virulence and antigenic drift/escape mutant [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Substitution N44S detected in four Palestinian samples created a new potential N-glycosylation site at position 42, while N386K, detected in all Palestinian isolates, removes a potential N-glycosylation site at position 386, both cases may affect antigenic properties of the strain [
