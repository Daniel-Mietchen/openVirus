<p>Seventeen non-synonymous substitution events were recorded in the HA1 and HA2 aa sequences of the Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09. The Palestinian A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates fell into clade 6B. A(H1N1)pdm09 with clade 6B were predominant for season 2014/2015 as indicated by the WHO [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], regional [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and International reports [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Most of the 6B clade-defining substitutions evolved during the last years and were reported earlier in some studies before being attributed to the new clades. S185T was previously reported in isolates from Tunisians with severe influenza A infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. S203T contributes to antigenic drift [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and is a common variant marker within an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Substitution S84N, found in HA gene of one Palestinian isolate is one of the substitutions defining the novel genetic subclade 6B.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Substitution I321V is also a common variant marker within outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and was found in all Palestinian isolates. 
 <underline>E47K</underline>, 
 <underline>S124K</underline>, and 
 <underline>E172K</underline> substitutions located in the HA2 do not only define clade 6B; they were reported, along with other substitutions, to increase HA stability through generation of favorable inter- and intramonomer interactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A variant with 
 <underline>E47K</underline> was also shown to induce infection in ferrets [
 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
