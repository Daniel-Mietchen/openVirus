<p>Ten Palestinian 2015 A(H3N2) isolates fell into subclade 3C.2a, one into clade 3C.2, and one into clade 3C.3, respectively. This result was in accordance with the WHO, regional and international reports of the same season [

Some of the substitutions (N121K, P198S, L157S), which were detected only in the single Palestinian 3C.3 HA sequence (KY075845) are of significant interest. N121K became dominant in 2017 and was detectd in isolates from severe influenza cases in Hong Kong in 2017 [
