<p>This report describes influenza A viruses circulating in Palestine in 2015, a country with very limited surveys in the epidemiology and genetic properties of infectious agents. Influenza season 2014/2015 was a season featured with low vaccine efficacy against the A(H3N2) vaccine component (A/Texas/50/2012), which consequently led to its replacement by A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 [

 <xref rid="pone.0213290.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Molecular characterization of circulating influenza viruses is indispensible for the annual vaccine recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report tackling molecular epidemiology and characterization of human influenza A viruses circulating in Palestine.
