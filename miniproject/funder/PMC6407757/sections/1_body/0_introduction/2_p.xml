<p>In contrast to many other vaccines, influenza vaccines have to be evaluated and updated annually due to antigenic shift and drift. For example, variability of the circulating A(H3N2) subtype has required four changes in the vaccine component between 2014 and 2018 [

Vaccines against influenza are trivalent and contain one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and one influenza B strain or quadrivalent and contain one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2), and two influenza B strains. These are predicted as most likely to circulate in the following season. While WHO usually recommended trivalent influenza vaccine, recommendation for 2018/2019 influenza season was to use a quadrivalent vaccine [

This decision was made as a consequence of the 2017/2018-influenza season with the majority of circulating influenza B belonging to the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage; in Europe specifically the majority of influenza infections in 2018 of season 2017/2018 were caused by Influenza B viruses [
