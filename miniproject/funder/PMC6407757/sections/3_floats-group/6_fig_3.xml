  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene segment of Palestinian influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolates.</title>
  <p>Palestinian HA sequences (in red) were compared with those from regional and international isolates, as well as vaccine strain of the season 2014/2015 and the current vaccine strain (in dark blue). NCBI and GISAID accession numbers are indicated for all archived sequences. HA1 aa substitutions are in green and HA2 aa substitutions are in green and underlined.</p>
