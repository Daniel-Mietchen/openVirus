The occurrence of sequential infection by more than one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) is a major contributing factor for the induction of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS), two major medical conditions caused by DENV infection. However, there is no specific drug or vaccine available against dengue infection. There are reports indicating the increased incidence of concurrent infection of dengue in several tropical and subtropical regions. Recently, increasing number of DHF and DSS cases were reported in India indicating potential enhancement of concurrent DENV infections. Therefore, accurate determination of the occurrence of DENV serotype co-infections needs to be conducted in various DENV prone parts of India. In this context, the present study was conducted to analyse the magnitude of concurrent infection in northern Kerala, a southwest state of India, during three consecutive years from 2013 to 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 120 serum samples were collected from the suspected dengue patients. The serum samples were diagnosed for the presence of dengue NS1 antigen followed by the isolation of dengue genome from NS1 positive samples. The isolated dengue genome was further subjected to RTPCR based molecular serotyping. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sequence of PCR amplified products.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Out of the total number of samples collected, 100 samples were positive for dengue specific antigen (NS1) and 26 of them contained the dengue genome. The RTPCR based molecular serotyping of the dengue genome revealed the presence of all four serotypes with different combinations. However, serotypes 1 and 3 were predominant combinations of concurrent infection. Interestingly, there were two samples with all four serotypes concurrently infected in 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>All samples containing dengue genome showed the presence of more than one serotype, indicating 100% concurrent infection. However, the combination of serotypes 1 and 3 was predominant. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating the concurrent infection of dengue in the northern Kerala, India. The phylogenetic analysis of dengue serotype 1 identified in this study shows a close relationship with the strain isolated in Delhi and South Korea during the 2006 and 2015 epidemics respectively. Similarly this study indicates that the phylogeny of dengue serotype 3 of northern Kerala is more closely related to dengue isolate of Rajasthan state, India. The geographical and climatic conditions of Kerala favours the breeding of both the mosquito vectors of dengue (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), which may enhance the severity of dengue in the future. Therefore, the study provides an alarming message for the urgent need of an antiviral strategy or other health management systems to curb the spread of dengue infection.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Concurrent</kwd><kwd>RT-PCR</kwd><kwd>CprM</kwd><kwd>Phylogeny</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Mutation</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>NS1 antigen</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>Department of Science and Technology (DST)-Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)</funding-source><award-id>SB/YS/LS-366/2013</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>Kerala State Council for Science, Technology &#x00026; Environment (KSCSTE)-Kerala Biotechnology Commission (KBC)</funding-source><award-id>015/YIPBIKBC/2013/CSTE</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Department of Science and Technology (DST)- Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Young Scientist Scheme (SB/YS/LS-366/2013), Govt of India, New Delhi and Kerala State Council for Science, Technology &#x00026; Environment (KSCSTE)-Kerala Biotechnology Commission (KBC) under Young Investigator Scheme (015/YIPBIKBC/2013/CSTE), Govt of Kerala, India.

The virus is transmitted by day-biting mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Liu-Helmersson et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug available that can neutralize all the four serotypes of dengue viruses.</p><p>There are four distinct DENV1-4 serotypes circulating all over the world and causing DENV infection. The infection causes symptoms ranging from acute febrile illness to severe manifestations, including bleeding and organ failure resulting in the DHF or DSS (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Gubler, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Moi, Takasaki &#x00026; Kurane, 2016</xref>). Co-infection with circulating DENV 1 and DENV 2 was reported in 1982 in Columbia (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Gubler et al., 1985</xref>). It has been known that sequential infection of more than one serotype of dengue increases the severity of dengue symptoms (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Hammon, 1973</xref>). Meanwhile, there are reports indicating concurrent infection of dengue with more than one serotype (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Anoop et al., 2010</xref>). However the correlation between concurrent infection of dengue with more than one serotype and severity of the disease symptoms is not well established. In this context, the current study becomes highly relevant and gives a platform for future investigation to understand the severity of the disease and concurrent infection caused by different dengue serotypes.</p><p>In the last 50&#x000a0;years, co- circulation of dengue serotypes was reported in South Asia, including India. The first virologically confirmed dengue case was reported in the east coast of Calcutta, India during 1963&#x02013;64 (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 1966</xref>; <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar et al., 1964</xref>). In addition, a dengue outbreak at Kanpur, India was documented during 1968 by DENV 4 (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Chaturvedi et al., 1970</xref>). The presence of DENV 3 was found in patients as well as <italic>A.&#x000a0;egypti</italic> mosquitoes in Vellore, India in 1966, and since then all the four types of DENV have been co circulated and isolated from patients and mosquitoes (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Myers &#x00026; Carey, 1967</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Wenming et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In 1996, DENV 2 serotype infections were noticed in India, followed by spreading all over the country (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Shah, Deshpande &#x00026; Tardeja, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2000</xref>). The capital city of India, Delhi, became hyperendemic by hosting all four dengue virus serotypes by 2003 (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Dar et al., 2003</xref>) with the coinfection of DENV 1 and DENV 3 in 2005 (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>). The magnitude of concurrent infection (19%) observed during the Delhi outbreak in 2006 is much higher in comparison with Taiwan (9.5%) and Indonesia (11%). Furthermore, replacement of DENV 2 and 3 with DENV 1 as the predominant serotype in Delhi over a period of three years (2007&#x02013;2009) has been reported.</p><p>The occurrence of dengue fever was reported in the Kottayam district of Kerala, a south-western region of India, followed by an outbreak in 2003. Concurrent infection with all three DENV 1&#x02013;3 were reported in a large number of patients in 2008 (<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Anoop et al., 2010</xref>) in Ernakulum district, a central region of Kerala. In 2013, various parts of India, including Davangere and Central Karnataka out of 123 positive NS1 antigen samples 56(45.5%) were infected with dengue fever, 37(30.1%) with DHF, and 30(24.4%) with DSS (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Kalappanvar et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since dengue cases are increasing at an alarming rate and causing a major health threat in tropical countries, it is necessary to identify and confirm the viral serotypes through epidemiological surveillance studies. The present study was conducted in order to specifically identify dengue virus and to assess the concurrent infection in the northern Kerala (Malabar region), India during three consecutive years (2013&#x02013;2015). Some of these areas are ideal ecosystems for the proliferation of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. In this study, NS1 positive samples were further tested by amplification of the junction region of capsid and pre membrane gene (CprM) of the dengue viral genome (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 1992</xref>) by single step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by specific serotype identification.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, we are reporting for the first time the 100% concurrent infection by different dengue serotypes among the samples analysed, including two samples which were positive for all four dengue serotypes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>The viremic blood samples from patients with suspected dengue symptoms (as per WHO guidelines) were collected from the Government hospital and local diagnostic centres located in the northern Kerala, India. The Institutional Ethics committee (IEC) clearance (O.R.No:IAD/IEC/13/14) was taken from the Institute of Applied Dermatology (IAD), Kasaragod district, Kerala for conducting this study. The prior&#x000a0;informed consent&#x000a0;was obtained from all participating human subjects. The blood samples used in this study were collected between June and August of 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. The blood samples were collected from patients who came to the diagnostic centres with a doctor&#x02019;s prescription or with the suspicion (1&#x02013;5 days). Donors were aged 5&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years of either sex, including paediatrics (0&#x02013;5&#x000a0;years old). Two millilitres of blood was collected in a vacutainer tube from each individual and serum was separated by centrifugation as per the standard procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of NS1 antigen by capture ELISA</title><p>The presence of NS1antigen in the patient serum sample was screened for using a DENV specific NS1 detection Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (Jmitra and Co., New Delhi, India). The kit contains monoclonal antibodies against NS1 coated on micro wells, which can detect NS1 antigen secreted by DENV in the infected patient. Fifty microliters of serum sample per micro well was used in the 96 well plate assay. Normal serum specimens obtained from healthy humans of same sex and age groups were included as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of dengue viral RNA</title><p>Dengue viral RNA was extracted from NS1 positive serum samples using the pure link RNA mini kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Clarified human serum sample of 150 microliters volume was used for RNA isolation. All RNA samples were examined for their purity and concentration using Nano photometer (2000C; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Amplification of dengue viral CprM region by RT-PCR</title><p>Isolated Dengue viral RNA from serum samples was subjected to single step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al., 1992</xref>).

The reaction mixture contained all the components necessary for PCR amplification including D1 as a forward primer and dengue virus type-specific reverse primers TS1, TS2, TS3, and TS4 in separate individual tubes. The CprM consensus regions and each serotype-specific primers were designed as mentioned by <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al. (1992)</xref> with slight modification of TS4 primer 5&#x02032;-CTCTGTTGTCTTAAACAAGAGA-3&#x02032;. The PCR amplified products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide sequencing</title><p>All necessary Good Lab Practices (GLP) were employed to avoid artifacts. The precautions were taken to avoid the contamination of serum samples by bar coding of samples. The cross contamination was prevented by setting of the PCR independently in the separate tubes with pair of specific primers. The tube containing no template was also setup as a negative control. The RT-PCR product (511 bp) obtained using D1 and D2 primers was separated on the 1% agarose gel. The DNA band was eluted from the gel using Wizard gel and PCR clean up system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as per the manufacturer instructions and was sequenced directly using big dye terminator V3.1 ready reaction sequencing mixture in an automated AB3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Additionally, nested PCR products obtained using D1 and TS1/TS3 dengue virus serotype specific primers were purified and sequenced as detailed above.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid sequence similarity and diversity</title><p>The nucleotide sequences obtained from the above method were submitted to GenBank database (NCBI).

The low proportion of dengue viral genome in NS1 positive serum samples may be due to loss of intact viral genome or the degradation of dengue positive RNA sense strand while handling the samples. The serotyping of the dengue viral RNA samples using nested PCR with sero specific primers revealed that all samples are concurrently infected with multiple serotypes. Different combinations of Dengue virus (DENV) concurrent infections including DENV 1 and DENV 3, 34% (nine cases out of 26 cases), DENV 2 and DENV 3, 27% (seven cases out of 26 cases), DENV 1,2 and 3, 31% (eight cases out of 26 cases) were observed. Further, it was also observed that two of the samples were concurrently infected with all four serotypes as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>. However, coexistence of all four serotypes in one host needs to be authenticated by characterizing the viral genome after isolation and propagation of viruses from those serum samples. The observations indicate the possibility of enhancement of future concurrent infections, as the percentage of single serotype infection decreased and concurrent infection of multiple serotypes increased based on the current investigation. As supporting evidence, there were only 19% of concurrent infections during 2006 (Delhi, India). However, there was a significant increase in the percentage of concurrent infections in 2009 (56.8%) in Ernakulum, India. The percentage of concurrent infection reached 100% based on the current investigation. It is also important to note that Kerala, a southwest state of India, provides an ideal ecosystem for the propagation of both the mosquito vectors (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) of dengue transmission.</p><p>Since the maximum nucleotide sequence was obtained in the case of DENV 1, the amino acid alignment (1-139 aa) was made with the various DENV 1 isolates existing in the data base, which revealed an identity of 98%&#x02013;99%, except Isoleucine instead of Valine at 131st position as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>.

Concurrent infection of multiple serotypes of dengue poses a lot of questions regarding viral replication. The possibility of mutual interference among different dengue serotypes during replication within the same host need to be investigated in detail. If so, would there be any replicative advantage to one of the serotypes against the other three serotypes? The viral interference which leads to replicative advantage towards one particular serotype is a major concern in the development of tetravalent dengue vaccine (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study shows that all samples which were able to show PCR amplified product, analysed from the northern Kerala, India between 2013 and 2015 harbour more than one serotype of dengue, indicating 100% concurrent infection.
