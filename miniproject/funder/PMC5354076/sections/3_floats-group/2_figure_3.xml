  <title>The agarose gel images (1%) showing the amplified DNA from dengue viral genome using RT-PCR.</title>
  <p>(A) shows a representative DNA gel showing the 511 bp DNA fragment obtained by RT-PCR using dengue viral RNA as template with D1 (forward) and D2 (reverse) primers. Lane 1 and Lane 4 shows the presence of dengue viral genome in the sample as evidenced by a clear DNA band of 511 bp size. However, Lane 2 and 3 did not show the presence of dengue viral genome in the corresponding samples. (Bâ€“D) represents DNA gel images showing the nested PCR products by serotype specific primers with D1&amp;TS1 (Lane 1), D1&amp;TS2 (Lane 2), D1&amp;TS3 (Lane 3), D1&amp;TS4 (Lane 4) primer combinations using 511 bp PCR product as a template. In (B), Lane 1 and 4 shows the presence of amplified product of size 482 bp and 392 bp respectively indicating the presence of DEV 1 and 4 in the same individual. Similarly, Figure C Shows the presence amplified product of size 482 bp, 119 bp and 290 bp in Lane 1, 2 and 3 respectively, indicating the concurrent infection of dengue serotype 1, 2 and 3 in the same individual. Interestingly, (D) indicates the concurrent infection of all four serotypes in the same individual as evidenced by the amplified product of size 482 bp, 119 bp 290 bp and 392 bp in all four lanes respectively. M, indicates 1 kb DNA ladder (bp of ladder size is shown in (A), and lane number is indicated at the top of each figure part).</p>
