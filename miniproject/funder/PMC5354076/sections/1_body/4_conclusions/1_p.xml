<p>The present study shows that all samples which were able to show PCR amplified product, analysed from the northern Kerala, India between 2013 and 2015 harbour more than one serotype of dengue, indicating 100% concurrent infection. The occurrence of concurrent infection of DENV 1 and DENV 3 was higher as compared to other combinations. The DENV 1 isolates of Northern Kerala was more closely related to South Korean and Delhi strain based on phylogenetic analysis. Similarly DENV 3 was more closely related to Dengue 3 isolates of Rajasthan, India (
