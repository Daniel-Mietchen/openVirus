<p>There are four distinct DENV1-4 serotypes circulating all over the world and causing DENV infection. The infection causes symptoms ranging from acute febrile illness to severe manifestations, including bleeding and organ failure resulting in the DHF or DSS (

However the correlation between concurrent infection of dengue with more than one serotype and severity of the disease symptoms is not well established. In this context, the current study becomes highly relevant and gives a platform for future investigation to understand the severity of the disease and concurrent infection caused by different dengue serotypes.
