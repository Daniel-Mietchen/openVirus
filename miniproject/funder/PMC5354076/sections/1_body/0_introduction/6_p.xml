<p>Since dengue cases are increasing at an alarming rate and causing a major health threat in tropical countries, it is necessary to identify and confirm the viral serotypes through epidemiological surveillance studies. The present study was conducted in order to specifically identify dengue virus and to assess the concurrent infection in the northern Kerala (Malabar region), India during three consecutive years (2013â€“2015). Some of these areas are ideal ecosystems for the proliferation of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. In this study, NS1 positive samples were further tested by amplification of the junction region of capsid and pre membrane gene (CprM) of the dengue viral genome (
