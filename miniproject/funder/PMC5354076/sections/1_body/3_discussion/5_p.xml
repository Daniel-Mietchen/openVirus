<p>Since the maximum nucleotide sequence was obtained in the case of DENV 1, the amino acid alignment (1-139 aa) was made with the various DENV 1 isolates existing in the data base, which revealed an identity of 98%â€“99%, except Isoleucine instead of Valine at 131st position as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>. Since both amino acids belong to the non-polar group of standard genetic code, the amino acid change may not have any significance. Phylogenetic analysis of DENV 1 nucleotide sequences (GenBank accession no.

Concurrent infection of multiple serotypes of dengue poses a lot of questions regarding viral replication. The possibility of mutual interference among different dengue serotypes during replication within the same host need to be investigated in detail. If so, would there be any replicative advantage to one of the serotypes against the other three serotypes? The viral interference which leads to replicative advantage towards one particular serotype is a major concern in the development of tetravalent dengue vaccine (
