<p>Out of 100 NS1 positive samples, 26 (26%) were found to be containing dengue viral RNA and showed a target specific band (511 bp) on an agarose gel. The low proportion of dengue viral genome in NS1 positive serum samples may be due to loss of intact viral genome or the degradation of dengue positive RNA sense strand while handling the samples. The serotyping of the dengue viral RNA samples using nested PCR with sero specific primers revealed that all samples are concurrently infected with multiple serotypes. Different combinations of Dengue virus (DENV) concurrent infections including DENV 1 and DENV 3, 34% (nine cases out of 26 cases), DENV 2 and DENV 3, 27% (seven cases out of 26 cases), DENV 1,2 and 3, 31% (eight cases out of 26 cases) were observed. Further, it was also observed that two of the samples were concurrently infected with all four serotypes as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>. However, coexistence of all four serotypes in one host needs to be authenticated by characterizing the viral genome after isolation and propagation of viruses from those serum samples. The observations indicate the possibility of enhancement of future concurrent infections, as the percentage of single serotype infection decreased and concurrent infection of multiple serotypes increased based on the current investigation. As supporting evidence, there were only 19% of concurrent infections during 2006 (Delhi, India). However, there was a significant increase in the percentage of concurrent infections in 2009 (56.8%) in Ernakulum, India. The percentage of concurrent infection reached 100% based on the current investigation. It is also important to note that Kerala, a southwest state of India, provides an ideal ecosystem for the propagation of both the mosquito vectors (
