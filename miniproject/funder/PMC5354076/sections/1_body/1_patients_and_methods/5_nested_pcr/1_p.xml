<p>A second round of amplification was initiated using one microliter of the above PCR product (1:100 in sterile distilled water) as a template in the subsequent nested PCR reaction. The reaction mixture contained all the components necessary for PCR amplification including D1 as a forward primer and dengue virus type-specific reverse primers TS1, TS2, TS3, and TS4 in separate individual tubes. The CprM consensus regions and each serotype-specific primers were designed as mentioned by 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Lanciotti et al. (1992)</xref> with slight modification of TS4 primer 5′-CTCTGTTGTCTTAAACAAGAGA-3′. The PCR amplified products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel.
