<p>All necessary Good Lab Practices (GLP) were employed to avoid artifacts. The precautions were taken to avoid the contamination of serum samples by bar coding of samples. The cross contamination was prevented by setting of the PCR independently in the separate tubes with pair of specific primers. The tube containing no template was also setup as a negative control. The RT-PCR product (511 bp) obtained using D1 and D2 primers was separated on the 1% agarose gel. The DNA band was eluted from the gel using Wizard gel and PCR clean up system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) as per the manufacturer instructions and was sequenced directly using big dye terminator V3.1 ready reaction sequencing mixture in an automated AB3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Additionally, nested PCR products obtained using D1 and TS1/TS3 dengue virus serotype specific primers were purified and sequenced as detailed above.</p>
