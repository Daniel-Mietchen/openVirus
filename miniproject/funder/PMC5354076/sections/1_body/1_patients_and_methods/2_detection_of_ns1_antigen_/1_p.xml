<p>The presence of NS1antigen in the patient serum sample was screened for using a DENV specific NS1 detection Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit (Jmitra and Co., New Delhi, India). The kit contains monoclonal antibodies against NS1 coated on micro wells, which can detect NS1 antigen secreted by DENV in the infected patient. Fifty microliters of serum sample per micro well was used in the 96 well plate assay. Normal serum specimens obtained from healthy humans of same sex and age groups were included as controls.</p>
