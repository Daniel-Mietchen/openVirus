<p>The above amplified RTPCR product (511 bp) was used as a template for nested PCR, using serotype specific primers as detailed in methods section. The nested PCR analysis of dengue serotyping showed that a single individual is hosting for more than one dengue virus serotype circulating in the blood. In all 26 samples of multiple infection, three different serotypes co-existed in eight samples, two different serotypes co- existed in sixteen samples, and four different serotypes co-existed in two samples. There are nine cases of concurrent infection with DENV1 and DENV 3, seven cases with DENV 2 and DENV 3, eight cases with DENV 1, 2 and 3, and two cases with DENV 1, 2, 3 and 4 combinations as shown in the 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>. There was a large number of concurrent infection with DENV 1 and DENV 3. The concurrent infection of all four serotypes is an alarming indication and needs to be investigated in detail. The sequential infection with more than one serotype of a particular region leads to a severe cause for eliciting antibody dependent immune response.
