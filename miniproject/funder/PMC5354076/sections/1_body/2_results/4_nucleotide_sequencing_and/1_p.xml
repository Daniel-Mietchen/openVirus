<p>The D1 and D2 primer based amplified PCR product corresponding to CPrM region was sequenced (GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KX031992" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KX031992</ext-link>) and the data confirmed the presence of dengue viral genome sequence in the samples. The nucleotide sequence was found to be 99% similar with the existing CprM region of DENV 3 viral strains in GenBank database. Blast analysis, using CprM junction nucleotide sequence, showed similarity with DENV 3 isolates from Pakistan with 99% query coverage (GenBank accession no.

Nucleotide sequencing of DENV 1 specific nested PCR product, obtained using D1 and TS1 primer combinations, gives the size of 423 bp (GenBank accession no. 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/KJ954284" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">KJ954284</ext-link>). The corresponding amino acid sequence (1-139 aa) derived from DEV 1 specific amplified region represents non functional poly protein partial sequence. DENV 3 specific nested PCR product using D1 and TS3 primer combinations gives the size of 235 bp (GenBank accession no.

However, PCR amplified product of DENV 2 and DENV 4 were the lesser in quantity, the nucleotide sequences were not obtained with clarity.
