<p>Dengue viral RNA was isolated from NS1 positive serum samples, as detailed in the patients and methods section. The isolated RNA was subjected to RT-PCR based amplification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>) using D1 and D2 primers. There was dengue specific amplified product of size 511 bp present only in 26 samples. This observation confirms the presence of dengue genome in these 26 samples out of 100 samples, which were NS1 positive. The initial dengue NS1 antigen detection and the presence of identifying dengue genome in the serum samples indicates the possibility of dengue infection. A representative gel image, which indicates the presence of 511 bp amplified product is given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3">Fig. 3A</xref>. Out of fifty-one NS1 positive samples in 2013, thirteen samples were found to be positive for dengue genome. Similarly, there were three out of seventeen and ten out of thirty two samples positive for dengue genome analysed during 2014 and 2015, respectively (
