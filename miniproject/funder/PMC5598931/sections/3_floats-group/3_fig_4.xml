   <bold>A</bold> Estimated mean final epidemic size as a function of k and R
   <sub>index</sub> by assuming an intervention on day 0 capable of reducing mosquito adult population by 80%. Vertical dashed line corresponds to the mean value of k obtained by analyzing NHAPS data [
   <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (NHAPS), Miami-Dade County residents data for weekdays (M-D Wd), and Miami-Dade County residents data for weekends (M-D We). Model parameters are assumed at their baseline value as reported in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, and N
   <sub>V</sub> = 10,000. 
   <bold>B</bold> As A, but the intervention starts on day 30. 
   <bold>C</bold> As A, but the intervention starts on day 60. 
   <bold>D</bold> As A, but the intervention starts on day 90. 
   <bold>E</bold> As A, but the reduction of mosquito population is 90%. 
   <bold>F</bold> As E, but the intervention starts on day 30. 
   <bold>G</bold> As E, but the intervention starts on day 60. 
   <bold>H</bold> As E, but the intervention starts on day 90. 
   <bold>I</bold> As A, but the reduction of mosquito population is 99%. 
   <bold>J</bold> As I, but the intervention starts on day 30. 
   <bold>K</bold> As I, but the intervention starts on day 60. 
   <bold>L</bold> As I, but the intervention starts on day 90.
