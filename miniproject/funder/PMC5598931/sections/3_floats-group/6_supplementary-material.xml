   <bold>A</bold> Estimated mean final epidemic size as a function of k and R
   <sub>index</sub>. Vertical dashed line corresponds to the mean value of k obtained by analyzing NHAPS data [
   <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (NHAPS), Miami-Dade County residents data for weekdays (M-D Wd), and Miami-Dade County residents data for weekends (M-D We). Model parameters are assumed at their baseline value as reported in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, and N
   <sub>V</sub> = 1,000. 
   <bold>B</bold> As A, but for N
   <sub>V</sub> = 100,000. 
   <bold>C</bold> As A, but for the outbreak probability. We define “outbreak” an epidemic of at least 100 cases. 
   <bold>D</bold> As C, but for N
   <sub>V</sub> = 100,000.
