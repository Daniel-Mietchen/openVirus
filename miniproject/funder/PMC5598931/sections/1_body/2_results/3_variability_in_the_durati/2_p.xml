<p>Variability in host exposure duration has remarkable consequences for the outbreak probability, which is generally lower in a highly heterogeneous population, although for low values of R
 <sub>index</sub> the situation could be different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This implies that in situations suggested by the human activity data, epidemics are less likely to start. However, our modeling results show that in highly heterogeneous populations once the epidemic is started, it tends to spread much more quickly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and with a relatively larger peak incidence, especially for low-intermediate values of R
 <sub>index</sub> (approximately lower than 3) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Remarkably, this gives far less time to perform intervention measures such as removal of breeding sites, larval control, and outdoor spraying of adulticides.
