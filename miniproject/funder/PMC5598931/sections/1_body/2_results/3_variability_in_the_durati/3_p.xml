<p>By considering an intervention leading to an instantaneous reduction of the adult mosquito population, we were able to quantify the reduction of the epidemic final size for different levels of heterogeneity, R
 <sub>index</sub>, and timing and efficacy of mosquito control interventions (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our results clearly show that the timing of the intervention is far more important than the achieved reduction of the vector population when the duration of the exposure is highly variable (as is the case of Miami-Dade residents and the U.S. population), especially for high values of the R
 <sub>index</sub>.
