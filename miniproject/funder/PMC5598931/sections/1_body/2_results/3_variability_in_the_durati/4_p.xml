<p>Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate to what extent results are affected by the ratio of hosts and vectors and by mosquito lifespan. The qualitative patterns that we have discussed so far for the baseline scenario (where the ratio of hosts to vectors is 1:1) are confirmed by this sensitivity analysis (

From a quantitative point of view, changing the human to vector ratio has dramatic consequences on the outbreak probability after the introduction of a single infected host. As in the classic modeling theory, larger outbreak probabilities are observed when the human to vector ratio is low [
