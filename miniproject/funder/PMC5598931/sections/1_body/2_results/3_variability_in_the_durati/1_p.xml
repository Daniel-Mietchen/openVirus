<p>The parameter determining the dispersion of the distribution regulating the exposure duration (
 <italic>k</italic>) has a dramatic effect on the final epidemic size, especially for R
 <sub>index</sub>&gt;1.6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). For instance, for R
 <sub>index</sub> = 3 the estimated final epidemic size is 27.2%, 57.1%, and 90.1%, for 
 <italic>k</italic> = 0.1, 
 <italic>k</italic> = 0.5, and 
 <italic>k</italic> = ∞, respectively, suggesting that the higher is the variability in exposure duration (in a given population), the lower is the epidemic size. This can be interpreted by considering that high heterogeneity means that a large fraction of the population spends very little time outdoors and is thus exposed to a small risk of infection. What is of interest here is that the values of the shape parameter best fitting survey data are in the range 0.29–1.68, supporting our hypothesis of a highly variable distribution of the duration of the exposure. In particular, our estimates lie inside a region of the parameter space where the estimated final epidemic size is remarkably different from what is obtained by assuming a homogenous population as in the classic modeling theory (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Such a pattern is not obvious 
 <italic>a priori</italic>. In fact, from one side, a highly variable duration of the exposure implies that only a fraction of the population has a large risk of infection; from the other side, a highly variable exposure duration implies that there is a lower number of human hosts exposed to mosquito bites and thus a higher probability for mosquitoes to blood-feed on infected hosts and become infected. In fact, interestingly, for low values of R
 <sub>index</sub> (approximately lower than 1.4) we observe that the final epidemic size can be larger in heterogeneous populations (0.2&lt;k&lt;1) than in fully homogenous or extremely heterogeneous populations (
