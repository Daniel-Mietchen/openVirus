<p>These results suggest high level of host variability in the time spent outdoors, which can be modeled by skewed gamma distributions with shape parameters lower than 1.5. Next we will present results of the entire spectrum of variability in terms of time spent outdoors. In other words, we did not fix 
 <italic>k</italic> to the values we have estimated. Rather, our model-based evaluation considers 
 <italic>k</italic> in the range 0.1-∞ (and keeps fixed 
 <italic>m</italic> = 109 minutes, as variations in the mean exposure duration embedded in different values of R
 <sub>index</sub>). Note that 
 <italic>k</italic> = ∞ corresponds to a situation where all people spend the same amount of time 
 <italic>m</italic> outdoors, and low values of 
 <italic>k</italic> correspond to skewed distributions (i.e., the majority of persons spend little time outdoors and few persons spend a large amount of time outdoors).
