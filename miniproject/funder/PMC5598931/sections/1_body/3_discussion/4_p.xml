<p>Our study had limitations. First, our analysis does not have the rigor to provide any specific operational indications on vector control measures. There are still many unanswered questions about key aspects of mosquito dynamics, transovarial transmission, spatial variability, presence of standing water, importation of cases, and mobility of the human population. Further work is required to develop and calibrate a detailed model of the infection transmission, accounting for all aspects that could provide quantitative insights on specific mosquito control options. Second, in the analyzed datasets on outdoor time, we did not have data to report the reasons as to why people spend time outdoors. Additionally, the differing contexts underlying time spent outdoors is not distinguished among individual persons, although such difference may exist. For instance, between a person who works outdoors for 4 hours per day and another person who spends 4 hours outside for leisure. Our modeling investigation did not account for such an aspect of differing environmental contexts across people with the same amount of time outdoors, although it might affect Zika transmission as the biting activity of
