<p>Another important public health implication of our study is that vector control operations are usually directed to areas with the highest vector densities on the basis of entomological surveillance. Instead, here we highlight how it is the combination of vector densities and biting rates (as well as other entomological characteristics such as mosquito lifespan), and human exposure time outdoors that is key to Zika infection risk. Consequently, operation control efforts could be prioritized and directed toward areas characterized by high levels of human outdoor activities, such as recreational areas and tourist attractions, rather than, for instance, on residential areas. A clear example of such a phenomenon was the 2016 Zika outbreaks in Miami-Dade County, where the initial two affected areas of Wynwood and Miami Beach neighborhoods [

This highlights the need to derive new indices to be considered by operational mosquito control programs, categorizing neighborhoods on the basis of both mosquito surveillance counts and human outdoor exposure risk.
