<p>In conclusion, our analysis shows the non-trivial role of variability in exposure duration to mosquito bites in the dynamics and control of mosquito borne infections. For instance, in a highly heterogeneous population in terms of exposure time, Zika would cause a lower number of infections than in a more homogenous population. But, at the same time, the epidemic would spread much faster, thus leaving a smaller time window to implement control strategies. Our findings highlight the need to consider host variability in exposure time when dealing with mosquito-borne infections and call for a deeper understanding of time people spend outdoors in terms of duration, time of the day, day of the week and activity/location. Moreover, our results can be instrumental for the definition of new indices triggering vector control activities, accounting for both mosquito density and area-specific human outdoor activity patterns. Our modeling analysis is useful for providing general indications and can be easily applied to other settings and mosquitoes-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. However, it is of particular importance for Zika virus, as more than 80% of infected persons do not show symptoms [
