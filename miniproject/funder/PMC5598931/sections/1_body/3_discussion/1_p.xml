<p>We analyzed both survey activity data of the resident population of Miami-Dade County, Florida collected in July through December 2016, and previously published data on the U.S. population to determine whether the variability in the duration of outdoor exposure is an important factor of the infection transmission process. In particular, we are interested in understanding how it might shape the timing and final size of an epidemicâ€“both important topics in the context of determining the effectiveness of intervention control strategies. We found that time spent outdoors is highly variable, with the large majority of the population spending very little time outdoors. We observed that the final epidemic size decreases as the heterogeneity in exposure time increases. This finding suggests that time spent outdoors is an important variable that should be considered in Zika preventive strategies, particularly in areas where 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes have to find hosts outdoors for blood feeding. Notably, our modeling results also show that when the heterogeneity in exposure duration is large, epidemics spread much faster. This implies that public health decision-makers will need to have the capacity to respond quickly and adequately to sudden mosquito threats (e.g., plan and perform mosquito control interventions such as larval control and outdoor spraying of adulticides in a timely manner). These results seem to correspond well to those reported elsewhere, suggesting that broad-tailed inter-event times slow down spreading phenomena [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the other hand, there is empirical evidence supporting that, in contexts where the transmission mainly occurs outdoors, the distribution of secondary infections and the spatial clustering are linked to human behaviors [
