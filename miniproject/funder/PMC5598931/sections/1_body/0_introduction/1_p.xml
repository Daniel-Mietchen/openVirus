<p>Since Brazil reported its first Zika cases in mid-2015, the epidemic has ramped up to a global scale [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is due to the suitable environmental conditions of tropical and sub-tropical regions around the globe for the highly adaptable arbovirus vectors 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], large outbreaks in western countries are often prevented by socioeconomic factors such as lifestyle, housing infrastructure, and sanitation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nonetheless, these outbreaks do occur in the west. In such a context, identifying specific locations at risk for mosquito-borne infection transmission in urban environments, where transmission events are rare and seemingly unpredictable, poses new challenges for mosquito control and management programs, epidemiologists, and modelers.
