<p>The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the effect of host variability in outdoor time exposure on the epidemic spread. To fulfill this goal, we: i) performed a survey on time spent outdoors in Miami-Dade County, Florida residents; ii) analyzed both the obtained survey results and previously published data on the U.S. population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to quantify the heterogeneity level; and iii) developed a simple dynamical model of the transmission process of a vector-borne disease, explicitly accounting for host variability in the time spent outdoors. The model is calibrated on the basis of the most recent knowledge on the Zika infection timeline [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and transmissibility [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The performed modeling analysis quantifies the effect of host variability in time spent outdoors on epidemiological indicators such as the final epidemic size (i.e., the fraction of the population that becomes infected over the whole course of an epidemic), epidemic timing, and outbreak probability. The 2016 Zika epidemic in the U.S. showed a complicated spatiotemporal pattern, characterized by multiple waves of infections, long tails of the distribution, and dramatic variability in the number of reported human cases at the neighborhood level [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> (e.g., short flight-range, need of specific breeding sites, outdoor resting habitats, and sugar-feeding sources) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, we believe that human behaviors such as mobility at the micro scale (e.g., to seek places for leisure activities) and time spent outdoors exposed to mosquito bites have contributed to the observed complex pattern. Explicitly modeling host variability in exposure time might help shed light on the observed highly heterogeneous pattern of spread and might be useful in informing mosquito control strategies for controlling Zika epidemics in a complex urban environment to maximize efficiency.
