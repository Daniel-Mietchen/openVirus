<p>We developed an individual-based dynamical model of Zika transmission. Each human host is explicitly considered in the model and has associated: i) an epidemiological status (namely, susceptible, latent, infectious, and recovered); and ii) the amount of time that she/he is exposed per day to mosquito bites, corresponding to the amount of time spent outdoors (referred in the following as “exposure duration”). Each mosquito vector has an epidemiological status, namely, susceptible, latent, and infectious. As we are interested only in assessing the effect of the variability in the human population of exposure durations, we deliberately decided to keep the model as simple as possible. For the ease of simplicity, in the absence of interventions, we keep the mosquito population constant over time and omit the complex life cycle of mosquitoes, which depends on environmental factors such as temperature, presence of breeding sites, outdoor resting habitats, and sugar-feeding sources [

Although this is a strong assumption, it will help us in isolating the effect of the variability of the duration of the host exposure from the possible confounding effects of mosquito population dynamics. A schematic representation of the model is presented in
