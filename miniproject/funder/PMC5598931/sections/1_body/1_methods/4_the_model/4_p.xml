<p>Intuitively, the probability of getting the infection is 1 minus the product of avoiding the infection from bites of each mosquito vector. Note that the model assumes a constant biting rate during the exposure time. The ratio N
 <sub>v</sub>/N
 <sub>H</sub> is a consequence of the fact that female mosquitoes only take a fixed number of blood meals per unit of time. As such, the net transmission rate is held to an upper limit, which does not depend on the absolute abundance of mosquitoes and hostsâ€“that is, the biting rate times the number of female mosquitoes per person [
