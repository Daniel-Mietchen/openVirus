<p>We measured the transmission potential of the infection in terms of R
 <sub>index</sub>, which is defined for a vector-borne disease as the average number of secondary hosts infected by the first infected host through the means of infected vectors. As shown in the literature [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], R
 <sub>index</sub> represents a good proxy for the basic reproduction number and, at the same time, it is easier to define for individual-based models.
