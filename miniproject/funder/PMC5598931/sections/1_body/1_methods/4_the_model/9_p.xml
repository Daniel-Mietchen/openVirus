<p>Model simulations are initialized by introducing one infectious host in a fully susceptible population of both hosts and mosquitoes. Given the stochastic nature of the model, results are based on 10,000 realizations. The model is calibrated on the basis of the recent findings on Zika timeline of infection of Ferguson and colleagues [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005851.g001">Fig 1B</xref> where, as baseline scenario we assume a 1:1 ratio between hosts and vectors and 5 days as mosquito lifespan. It is important to note that even across an area as small as a city, there are likely differences both in human activities, with areas characterized by larger probabilities of outdoor activities (for instance because of the presence of parks, beaches, athletic fields) and in mosquito life history traits (e.g., mosquito densities, biting rates and lifespan). However, properly characterizing these differences is a hard task that would require the collection of highly specific environmental, socio-economic, and entomological data. In order to explore the effects of such variability, we performed an in-depth sensitivity analysis on the shape parameter of the distribution regulating host exposure time to mosquito bites, R
 <sub>index</sub> (which entails differences in the biting rate), the ratio between hosts and vectors, and mosquito lifespan.
