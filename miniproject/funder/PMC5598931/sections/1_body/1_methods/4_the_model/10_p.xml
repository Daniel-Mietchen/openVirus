<p>We simulate the effect of simple interventions aimed at reducing adult mosquitoes abundance. Specifically, we assume an instantaneous reduction of 80%, 90%, or 99% of the mosquito adult population (irrespective to the infection state) at the day of interventionâ€“namely, 0, 30, 60, or 90 days after the introduction of the first infectious person. The explored range for the magnitude of the vector control strategies is in line with empirical studies estimating a 91% decrease in the density of
