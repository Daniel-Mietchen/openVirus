<p>Together with our survey data for Miami-Dade County, Florida, we also analyzed previously published data on time spent outdoors by the U.S. population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A gamma distribution was fitted to each of the available datasets. We used a gamma distribution as it is a suitable broad tailed distribution, which can arise from multiplicative type models and scheduling; similarly broad distributions have been observed in human activity times in other areas of life [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005851.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which lends support to this particular choice. However, the use of other flexible distributions would lead to similar general conclusions. The posterior distributions of the parameters of the gamma distributions were determined by exploring with a MCMC (Metropolisâ€“Hastings) algorithm [
