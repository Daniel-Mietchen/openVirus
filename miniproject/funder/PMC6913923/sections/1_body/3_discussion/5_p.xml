<p>Currently, orthohantavirus commercial serological kits are based on nucleoprotein detection however the cross-reactivity among hosts infected by HCPS and/or HFRS-associated orthohantavirus could not be discarded. In our study, we experimentally immunized mice with recombinant nucleoprotein from Juquitiba genotype, a HCPS-associated orthohantavirus that mainly circulates in Brazil [

 </bold>). Based on this cross reaction and considering that Juquitiba genotype nucleoprotein is highly conserved among ANDV and SNV (95% and 86% of similarity, respectively), both orthohantavirus associated to HCPS in Americas, we believe that Juquitiba genotype could be used as HCPS model. Remarkably, despite the cross reaction among JHNP and SHNP, we identify epitopes specific to 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic>. SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> epitopes were only recognized by sera from SHNP immunized mice, suggesting that these epitopes are non-conserved among HCPS-associated orthohantavirus and corroborating their potential as HFRS target. This strategy, based on experimental immunization assays using recombinant proteins, have been used to confirm

 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], however, considering the probable misdiagnose of 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic> in Americas and the necessity of differential diagnosis of HFRS in New world, experiments using samples of naturally infected hosts (human and/or rodents) should be conducted in order to fully support the present data and to confirm the real potential of these epitopes as differential diagnostic tools.
