<p>Recently, Kalaiselvan and collaborators suggested that 20-mers peptides 
 <italic>in silico</italic> identified as B-cell linear epitopes may be used for development of geographic region-specific immunoassays [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], however, the experimental validation of predicted epitopes remains pending. Based on this study, we explored the nucleoprotein of 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic>, using a combination of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches to predict antigenic B-cell linear epitopes, non-conserved among hantaviruses associated to HCPS, and to validate its immunogenicity by the reactivity of serum samples from mice immunized with the recombinant protein. Initially, we predicted nine sequences as immunogenic epitopes, in which eight (88.9%) were, entirely or partially, inserted on sequences described in Kalaiselvanâ€™s study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our point of view, the differences observed between our and his study about predicted epitopes were due the use of BepiPred 1.0, by Kalaiselvan, and BepiPred 2.0, by us. However, the high congruence of both studies reinforces the use of prediction algorithms to identify B-cell epitopes on proteins and remarks the necessity of experimental validation of these results.
