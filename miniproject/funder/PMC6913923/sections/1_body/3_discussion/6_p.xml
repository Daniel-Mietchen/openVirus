<p>In summary, we 
 <italic>in silico</italic> identified and experimentally validated the sequences (72)GKNIGQDRDPTGVEPGDHLKERSALSYGNTLDLNSLDID(110) and (251)PIAGSLSGNPVNRD(264) as linear B-cell epitopes on SHNP, which could be helpful to improve the development of novel immunodiagnostic tools against HFRS-associated orthohantavirus species. These epitopes, as synthetic peptides, could be anchored on solid surface or membranes for enzyme immunoassays; or used in the development of monoclonal antibodies, applicable to tools like sandwich ELISA, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence tests, which may be relevant to better and more specific HFRS-associated orthohantavirus diagnose, especially in the New World.
