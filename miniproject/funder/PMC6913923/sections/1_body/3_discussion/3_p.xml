<p>Aiming to identify epitopes non-conserved among HCPS orthohantavirus, we compared the conservation of each predicted sequence among orthohantaviruses associated to HFRS and HCPS. The epitopes SHNP
 <sub>(K30-E48)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>, and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub> were highly conserved just among species associated to HFRS, presenting a conservation level ranging from moderate to low, when compared to HCPS orthohantavirus species. Besides, the epitope SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> was considered specific epitope of 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic>, presenting a very high similarity when compared with Gou (100%) and low conservancies (&lt;36%) in comparison with species associated to HCPS or HFRS. Remarkably, all epitopes considered non-conserved among HCPS orthohantavirus (SHNP
 <sub>(K30-E48)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(G72-D110)</sub>, SHNP
 <sub>(P251-D264)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(I266-A283)</sub>) presented low to moderate conservation degrees, ranging from 17% to 59%, when compared with Puumala nucleoprotein sequence. Despite of the association of this orthohantavirus specie with HFRS [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 
 <italic>Puumala orthohantavirus</italic> was also associated with HCPS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and is considered the most prevalent pathogen associated with nephropathia epidemica [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], a mild form of HFRS. This epidemics is characterized by acute kidney injury (AKI) and thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], suggesting differences among species associated to HFRS. Besides, we observed that major of predicted sequences were highly conserved among orthohantavirus associated to both syndromes, HFRS and HCPS. Our data corroborate Kalaiselvan’s previous studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], in which epitopes conserved between both orthohantavirus species, HFRS and HCPS, were 
 <italic>in silico</italic> predicted with prevalence in C-terminal region of the nucleoprotein.
