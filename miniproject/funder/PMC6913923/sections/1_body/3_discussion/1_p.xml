<p>Orthohaantavirus species associated with hemorrhagic fevers are worldwide spread; however, they could be misdiagnose as viral or bacterial hemorrhagic diseases, like dengue, yellow fever or leptospirosis, especially in countries where these diseases are endemic. In this context, the development of novel, specific and broader diagnostic tools, able to recognized HFRS-associated orthohantavirus species, have become an urgent demand to public health. Immunodiagnostic tools are vital in the study of orthohantavirus infections due to the limited success with molecular detection as the viremia will be short-lived. Based on this, our study allowed the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> identification and experimental confirmation of two B-cell linear epitopes on SHNP. These data could be helpful to improve the development of new diagnostic tools, resulting in a better and more specific HFRS-associated orthohantavirus diagnose, especially in the New World.
