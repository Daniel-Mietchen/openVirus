<p>To predict linear B-cell epitopes with potential antigenicity, the full sequence of SHNP (NCBI ID: AAT45728.1) was analyzed by the BepiPred 2.0 and Vaxijen algorithms. As showed in

 <sub>(E5-V29)</sub> and SHNP
 <sub>(D231-G141)</sub> were predicted as non-antigenic epitopes by Vaxijen and were excluded of further analyzes.
