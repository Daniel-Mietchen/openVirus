<p>From the alignment of the target sequence with the template sequences, 200 models were built and the lowest energy model was selected. The Molprobity server and WinCoot software was used to evaluate the stereochemical quality of the selected model from Ramachandran plots. After energy minimization, it was possible to reach 97.19% (415/427) of residues in preferred regions, 2.58% (11/427) in allowed regions and only 0.23% (1/427)– 114 GLY—outliers in Ramachandran graph. The 3D structure of the model presented a score of 75.52% on Verify 3D, which demonstrates the quality of the model obtained.</p>
