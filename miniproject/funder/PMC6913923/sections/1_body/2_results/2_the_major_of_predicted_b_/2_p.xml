<p>Based on this variable degree of conservation of nucleoprotein and aiming to identify immunodominants B-cell epitopes specific to orthohantaviruses related to HFRS, we compare the similarity level of SHNP predicted epitopes among nucleoproteins of HFRS Hantavirus and HCPS Hantavirus. The levels of similarity were classified as very low (&lt;25%;); low (25%&gt;X&gt;50%), intermediary (50%&lt;X&lt;75%) and high (75%&lt;X&lt;100%).</p>
