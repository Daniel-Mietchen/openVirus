<p>Nucleoprotein is a conserved protein among orthohantavirus, presenting similarity level ranging from 60% to 99%. However, when compared to orthohantavirus related to HCPS (Juquitiba genotype, Andes virus, Laguna-Negra virus and Sin Nombre virus), the nucleoprotein from orthohantavirus related to HFRS (Gou, Hantaan, Amur, Dobrava-Belgrade and Puumala) were only intermediary conserved, ranging from 62% to 74% of similarity (
