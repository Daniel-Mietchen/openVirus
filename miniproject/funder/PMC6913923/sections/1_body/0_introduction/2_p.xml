<p>Orthohantavirus infections are a neglected global health problem, affecting approximately 200,000 people/year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and are associated with serious and fatal diseases in humans, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). The clinical manifestations of the disease are correlated to orthohantavirus species/genotypes and also it is intimately associated with rodent reservoirs that have a specific geographical distribution worldwide. HFRS is caused by Old World orthohantaviruses such as Hantaan, Amur and Gou virus in Asia and by 
 <italic>Seoul orthohantavirus</italic> (SEOV) worldwide. Besides, orthohantavirus New World species such as 
 <italic>Sin Nombre orthohantavirus</italic> in North America, and Andes, 
 <strike>Juquitiba,</strike> Laguna Negra, and other related virus in Latin America, such as Juquitiba genotype are responsible for the more severe HCPS [
