<p>In this context, the orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (NP) is the major antigen that elicits early serological responses in infected humans and has been used as a biomarker to develop antibodies for epidemiological surveillance in regions where various orthohantavirus species cocirculate [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This protein consists of about 429-amino acid residues, is largely expressed in initial infection and is highly conserved among orthohantavirus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since the aminoacid sequence of HFRS-associated orthohantavirus are not identical, previous works tried to develop immunochromatographic antibody tests using a combination of different orthohantavirus nucleoproteins [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or a combination of nucleoprotein and other peptides [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in order to detect all Eurasian pathogenic orthohantavirus infections. Recently, Kalaiselvan and collaborators suggested that 
 <italic>in silico</italic> predicted B-cell epitopes on NP could be used to identify specific markers to the HFRS [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and HCPS-associated orthohantavirus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the experimental validation of these epitopes remains unexplored. By this way, this study aimed to predict B-cell epitopes on Seoul orthohantavirus nucleoprotein (SHNP), that are exclusively conserved among HFRS-associated orthohantavirus, using a combination of the three most used prediction algorithms, and to validate the epitopes predicted as specific to SEOV or as conserved among HFRS orthohantavirus, against sera of mice immunized with recombinant SHNP.
