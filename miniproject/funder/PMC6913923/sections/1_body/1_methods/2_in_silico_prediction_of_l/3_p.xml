<p>VaxiJen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It was developed to allow antigens classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment. Bacterial, viral and tumour protein datasets were used to derive models for prediction of whole protein antigenicity, showing prediction accuracy from 70% to 89% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To evaluate the antigenicity of predicted epitopes, we used the default cut-off (0.4), suggested to viral antigens. Therefore, sequences with BepiPred score above 0.5 and Vaxijen score above 0.4 were considered potential linear B-cell epitopes and evaluated to specificity.
