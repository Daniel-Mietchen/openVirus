<p>The cDNA codifying the Seoul or Juquitiba orthohantavirus genotypes nucleoprotein (429 and 428 amino acids, respectively) were cloned into plasmid pET21a(+) to express the nucleoprotein with a six-histidine tag on its C-terminus (Genscript, USA). This construct was used to transform into BL21DE3 strain from 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> and the protein was expressed during 4 h upon the addition of 1 mM IPTG. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 
 <sup>o</sup>C and stored at -80 
 <sup>o</sup>C until use. The cellular pellet was resuspended using the following buffer composition: 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6,0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazol, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany). The cellular lysis was obtained by the addition of 1 mg/mL lysozyme under stirring at 4°C for 30 min, Next, 20 μg/mL DNase and 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> were added and the solution was incubated for more 30 min. The lysate was sonicated 15 times, alternating 15-seg on-and-off cycles at 4°C. After sonication, the lysate was then centrifugated at 27000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 20 min to obtain the protein pellet inclusion body. This pellet was dissolved in buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6,0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazol and 8 M urea, overnight stirring at 4°C. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column connected to the Äkta Purifier HPLC. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole (10–500 mM) prepared in the same buffer composition and the purified nucleoprotein was refolded by dialysis using a cut-off pore of MWCO of 3,500 Da and the same buffer composition during overnight at 4°C, making three changes using 1-L buffer each time. Recombinant SHNP or JHNP (rSHNP and rJHNP, respectively) were obtained with high purity and yield as analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and, as expected, a unique band of about 50 kDa was observed. The refolding process of the rSHNP or rJHNP was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy, which was used to monitor the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the buffer containing 8M urea and after the dialysis process.
