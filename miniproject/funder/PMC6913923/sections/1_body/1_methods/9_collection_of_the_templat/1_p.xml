<p>The rationale used for template selection and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> homology modeling of SHNP was described by Lima et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and carried out with some adaptations. Briefly, for the selection of templates, a search with BLAST and HHBlits [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] using the amino acid sequence of SHNP (GenBank: AAT45728.1) was performed against the expasy SWISS-MODEL template server [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>][
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>][
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Three structures were selected (PDB ID: 5E04, 5FSG, 4FI5) with the view to obtain as close as possible complete coverage of the amino acid sequence. The server-generated models, which were built and based on the target-template alignment with ProMod3 Version 1.2.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], were used to perform the 2D alignment with the sequence of SHNP and comparative modeling using MODELLERv9.19 by satisfaction of spatial restraints [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The lowest energy model was selected using PyMOL Version 1.8 and your 3D structure evaluated with Verify 3D [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and MolProbity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The energy minimization and correction of Ramachandran outliers was performed manually using COOT Version 0.8.6 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007915.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
