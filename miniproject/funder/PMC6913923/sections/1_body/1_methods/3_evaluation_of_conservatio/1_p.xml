<p>Sequences identified as potential linear B-cell epitopes were aligned to nucleoprotein sequences of orthohantavirus associated to HFRS or HCPS for similarity comparison. Gou virus (GOUV, Uniprot ID: Q8V6A4); Hantaan virus (HTNV, Uniprot ID: P05133); Amur virus (AMRV, Uniprot ID: A1YQ86), Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV, Uniprot ID: D2IFH1) and Puumala virus (PUUV, Uniprot ID P19475) were the HFRS selected species for the similarity evaluation. Orthohantavirus Juquitiba genotype (JUQV, Uniprot ID A0A248QEV0), Andes virus (ANDV, Uniprot ID: O36307), Laguna Negra virus (LANV, Uniprot ID: C5IAR6) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV; Uniprot ID: Q89462) were the HCPS selected viruses for the conservation degree comparison of the predicted epitopes. All NP sequences were aligned and compared to SHNP and the degree of conservation among them were evaluated by BioEdit Sequence Alignments Editor, Version 7.0.9.0 [
