  <title>Dispersal of cassava brown streak viruses in Nakasongola district over 10 years when infection pressure is high (70% of fields infected with 100% infection) and clean planting material is distributed to 10% of growers every season.</title>
  <p>Material is distributed in a variable manner, to different growers each season, expanding outwards from an initial cluster. Nakasongola district is shown in cream, where each circle represents a growerâ€™s field, while triangles represent fields planted using certified clean planting material from a clean seed system. The legend describes the infection level in a field.</p>
