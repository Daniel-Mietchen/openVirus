  <title>The effect of grower loyalty.</title>
  <p>Model predictions for the percentage of fields in Nakasongola district that are infected after 30 seasons, when growers are (a) loyal to suppliers, obtaining material from the same sources every season, or (b) disloyal to suppliers, obtaining material from different sources every season. Legends display the maximum number of suppliers from whom a grower may obtain cuttings, where the number of suppliers is drawn from a uniform distribution. Results are the mean of 100 realisations of the model each. Examples of loyal and disloyal growers are shown in the insets. The black circles represent suppliers of planting material for growers, represented by white circles. Arrows depict trade events, following the movement of planting material to a grower. In (a) the grower is loyal, while in (b) the grower is disloyal; after one season, the grower changes one of the sources of her material (dashed arrow), representing her lack of loyalty to trading partners.</p>
