  <title>The effect of clean seed dispersal mechanism.</title>
  <p>Model predictions for average yield of cassava production in Nakasongola district after 20 seasons, where 70% of fields are infected with incidence of 100%, for varying proportions of growers using certified clean planting material. Clean planting material is distributed in (a) a fixed manner, to the same growers over successive seasons, or (b) a variable manner, to different growers each season. Material is distributed either to a cluster of growers (circles) or at random (open squares). In (b) the material is distributed either to a different cluster of growers each season (filled circles) or to a different group of growers each season expanding outwards from an initial cluster (open circles). Results are from 30 realisations of the model for disloyal trade across the district, but are qualitatively similar for loyal trade.</p>
