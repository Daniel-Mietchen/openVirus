  <title>Number of fields infected.</title>
  <p>Model predicitons for the percentage of fields in Nakasongola district that are infected after 30 seasons. Dispersal of the pathogen between fields occurs through both the trade of infectious planting material and the between-field dispersal of infectious whitefly (solid line), trade only (dashed line, with within-field dispersal of whitefly) or between-field dispersal of whitefly only (dotted line). Light grey areas represent one standard deviation around the mean from 100 realisations of the model, while dark grey areas (cf. 15 seasons) represent the overlap of standard deviations. To the right of the plot a bar represents the source of infection for fields in the case of both trade and between-field dispersal; i.e. the percentage of infected fields after 30 seasons that were initially infected for the first time by the trade of infectious material compared with those that were infected by the between-field dispersal of an infectious whitefly from outside the field.</p>
