  <title>The effect of trade restrictions.</title>
  <p>Model predictions for average yield of cassava production in Nakasongola district after 20 seasons, where 70% of fields are infected with incidence of 100%. Clean planting material from a clean-seed system is used by (a) none of the growers, (b) 10% of the growers, distributed to the same growers over successive seasons or (c) 10% of the growers, distributed to different growers every season. Trade in planting material is allowed to continue as usual (solid lines), is reduced by 50% (dot-dashed lines), completely ceases (dotted lines) or only users of certified clean material are licensed to distribute material (dashed lines). Each line is the mean of 100 realisations of the model.</p>
