  <title>Disease dispersal across the district.</title>
  <p>Model predictions of the dispersal of CBSVs in Nakasongola district after 30 seasons from an initially infected source field located at the white star. Dispersal of the pathogen between fields occurs through (a) both the trade of infectious planting material and the between-field dispersal of infectious whitefly, (b) trade only, with within-field dispersal of whitefly or (c) between-field dispersal of whitefly only, where the scale shows the risk of becoming infected during an epidemic for a field at any given point. The results show the average infection from 100 realisations of the model, where the mean distance refers to the average distance over all realisations from the source of infection to all infected fields. Parameter values are summarised in
