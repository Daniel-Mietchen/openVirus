<p>Separating out the two forms of between-field disease dispersal allows us to evaluate the effect of control on each dispersal type separately, in an approach that could be readily adapted to diseases such as bluetongue disease (see, for example, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Reducing informal trade in conjunction with the introduction of a clean-seed system is only effective when clean planting material is distributed to different growers every season, in which case we would suggest encouraging growers to reduce exchange of planting material by trade (see, for example, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). Practical difficulties with encouraging such a change in practice would be challenging, but a reduction in trade only, rather than a complete cessation, would still be beneficial. However, while a reduction in trade may reduce disease across the district as a whole, it may also lead to local shortages of clean planting material, which would be less likely if trade were allowed to continue as normal. Promoting users of clean planting material to trade their material increases yield the fastest and to a higher level through the secondary dispersal of clean planting material.
