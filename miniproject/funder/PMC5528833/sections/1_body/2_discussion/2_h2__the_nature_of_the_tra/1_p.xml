<p>Our results indicate that the nature of the network of trade interactions is important to disease incidence, as expected for any such disease (see, for example, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Disease incidence is lower when growers consistently use the same suppliers for cuttings, as well as when growers have fewer suppliers (see also [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). If trade is restricted to a few, constant trading partners, it is possible that disconnected sub-networks of growers with highly variable levels of infection could be created, into or out of which the pathogen disperses slowly through between-field whitefly dispersal (see, for example, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). Such restriction in trade, combined with low whitefly numbers and high levels of replanting from the same field, may well be slowing the arrival of CBSVs into areas such as Eastern Zambia. In fact, in areas where growers are aware of the disease, were they to decrease the number of suppliers from whom they obtained material they would decrease their likelihood of acquiring infectious material. We note that this is seldom likely to be the case, however, as growers are often unaware of either the disease or its transmission mechanisms [
