<p>Given the assumptions about the relative magnitudes of trade and vector dispersal, we have shown that trade is the key long-distance pathogen dispersal mechanism, although it also contributes to spreading the pathogen within a community. This is consistent with suggestions that trade has been responsible for introductions of the pathogen to previously uninfected areas [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, trade may also help to eradicate the disease during the early stages of an epidemic if growers actively select healthy planting material from neighbours, but only if whitefly numbers are very low. Our results show that whitefly transmission is of key importance in local amplification, dispersing the pathogen from new sources of infection to fields immediately surrounding them (see, for example, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). The potential for local spread of infection is a particular problem given significant recent increases in whitefly populations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While whitefly dispersal alone spreads the pathogen slowly, it does ensure that the disease remains endemic. This implies that the success of a control strategy in controlling an epidemic depends upon how the strategy interacts with both trade as well as the vector.
