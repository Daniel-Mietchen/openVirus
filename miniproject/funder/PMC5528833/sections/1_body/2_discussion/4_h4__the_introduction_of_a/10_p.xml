<p>A project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in Tanzania, entitled Community Phytosanitation, is currently in the early stages of using a whole-community approach to reduce disease through clean planting material and roguing (which we do not include here, but which could further decrease infection in fields), with continuous expansion outwards from these communities to neighbouring groups [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] are attempting to set up clean-seed systems in Tanzania with a focus on cassava seed entrepreneurs who sell material locally, again aiming to target different entrepreneurs for subsidy each season, which will lead to access to clean planting material for different groups of growers. Our results suggest that both approaches are likely to be effective (in particular, more so than previous strategies) for disease reduction when distributing clean material, but only as long as the strategies focus on continued expansion with infrequent replenishment over continuously resupplying past users.
