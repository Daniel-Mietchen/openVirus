<p>Reaching more growers is vital to preventing a bottleneck in distribution, hence the success of approaches which supply different growers each season. This can be combined with protection through community action, where an entire community is supplied with material, to slow reinfection. The coordination involved in the expanding approach further improves reach by ensuring that every grower is supplied at some point, although it does this at the expense of a certain degree of protection from reinfection through community action. The effect is particularly visible when the number of users is small; growers who receive material later in the program, while they may have neighbours who previously used the clean-seed system and hence have relatively low incidence, are likely to be widely dispersed with few immediate neighbours still using the system.

We note that these general conclusions could be applicable to other vector- and trade-borne infections, highlighting the need for a balance between community action and the prevention of bottlenecks in distribution.
