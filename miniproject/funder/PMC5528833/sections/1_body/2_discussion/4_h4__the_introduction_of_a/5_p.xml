<p>In terms of distributing clean planting material to growers, we relate our proposed strategies to those that are currently implemented by a variety of organisations. A focused community-based project that does not expand with time, is the least effective method of distribution, although it might be the simplest in terms of costs. Distribution of material to the 
 <underline>same</underline> group of dispersed growers in successive seasons describes the traditional approach taken by extension workers, working with particular amenable growers. This traditional approach has the potential to reach a greater number of recipients indirectly, although it does decrease the protection that a community of growers using clean planting material confers. In comparison, distributing uninfected planting material to a number of growers that changes across a widespread area (such as the approach taken by the Great Lakes Cassava Initiative project, see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) or through sale at a market, reaches a still larger number of growers. However, integrating the changing cohort of growers within a community-based approach significantly increases the effectiveness of a clean-seed programme by extending the reach while also reducing transmission of infection via planting material. The approach is similar to the concept of using a travelling salesman who sells clean planting material to a cluster of growers in one season, moving to a new group in the next. When a high proportion of growers use clean material, an expanding community approach to selling material to growers is optimal: each season uninfected planting material is sold to a different group of growers, expanding outward from an initial group of users.
