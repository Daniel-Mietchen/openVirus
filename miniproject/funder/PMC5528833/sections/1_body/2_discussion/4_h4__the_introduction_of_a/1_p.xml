<p>We considered various types of community-based approach for the introduction of a clean-seed programme. Distributing uninfected planting material to different growers each season increases the probability of success in reducing yield loss (see, for example, [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). However, ancillary challenges in encouraging uptake by growers as well as managing logistical constraints associated with bulkiness and perishability of cassava planting material would need to be addressed (see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).
