<p>Our results also show that a community-based approach to manage the exchange of material between different growers over successive seasons would increase the probability of success for the introduction of partially-resistant or tolerant varieties (

Care would need to be taken to monitor the effects of partial resistance on pathogen build-up as well as the risks of unintended consequences such as distributing varieties with increased susceptibility to other cassava diseases such as cassava mosaic disease [
