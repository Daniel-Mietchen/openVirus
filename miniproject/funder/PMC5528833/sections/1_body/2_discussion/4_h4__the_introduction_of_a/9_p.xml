<p>We conclude that trade, informal or otherwise, leads to long-range pathogen dispersal, and whitefly to local amplification. Restrictions on trade can therefore reduce pathogen dispersal. Unrestricted trade via markets favours the spread of the pathogen in a new area by promoting exchange between many, changing partners over time. Combining a general reduction in trade with the encouragement of growers using certified clean planting material to trade is always beneficial. In an example of this, Uganda is currently piloting the establishment of a functional seed system for cassava with the introduction of an “agricultural police service” to monitor the movement of planting material. Were this unit to be effective in reducing trade in infected material, it would aid in significantly increasing yields.</p>
