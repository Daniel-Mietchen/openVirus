<p>Additional uncertainty analyses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>) show that our results are qualitatively robust to model assumptions (such as the nature of the migration and dispersal of whitefly) and also hold for different agronomic situations, including those with high or low whitefly density (and by extension disease pressure), discrete planting and harvesting (commercial growers), discrete planting and continuous harvesting (casual growers) or continuous planting and harvesting (subsistence growers) cycles, different sizes of fields (and by extension commercial, casual or subsistence growers in rural or urban environments) and different densities of fields (areas more or less dependent on cassava). These findings are therefore applicable to other locations across Uganda and the region, although the access for certified seed producers located within the district to basic seed from low disease-pressure areas is important in ensuring that the clean-seed remains disease-free.
