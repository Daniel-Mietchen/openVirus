 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1005654.t001">Table 1</xref>. The model describes a sequence of dynamics within successive growing seasons; any remaining plants not harvested during the season are harvested at the end of each season and cuttings replanted the following season (where initial conditions are based on the incidence of the previous season). For simplicity, we assume that there is one growing season of 300 days per year, ignoring the initial two months of the season when there is no foliage and whitefly cannot transmit the pathogen, although we note that in reality there may be some transmission between 1 and 2 months. Of course, in reality many different cropping systems are possible across the continent, from subsistence to commercial farming, and from rainy season(s) determining when cassava is planted to continuous planting and harvest. Growing seasons may be staggered in some areas, and fields may be ratooned at different stages. During the initial two months we assume that all whitefly lose infectiousness, due to the brevity of their period of infectiousness [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and plants progress to a fully infectious state before the disease dynamics become relevant. Hence, all latently infected or infectious cuttings that have been planted are assumed to be fully infectious at the start of each season, and the number of initially infectious whitefly is zero.
