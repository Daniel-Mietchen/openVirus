<p>We assume that the majority of growers are subsistence farmers, as is generally the case across the district. This implies that fields are harvested continuously at a constant rate over a period of months during the season, commencing after the first two months, with one replanting event at the start of each season (
 <italic>μ</italic> = 0, h&gt;0). During this event, every field is replanted with planting material from one of three sources (from a grower’s own field, from material traded with neighbours, each informed by the level of infection in the previous season, or from uninfected material obtained from a clean-seed source). Additionally, roguing, while included for generality, is unlikely to be practiced by subsistence growers in the area and is therefore presumed to be absent. For alternative harvesting and replanting strategies, describing casual or commercial growing systems, we include additional results in
