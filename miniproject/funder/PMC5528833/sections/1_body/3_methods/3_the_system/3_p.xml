<p>The size of a cassava field is taken to be 1.5 hectares (see, for example, [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), and we presume an increase in affinity for whitefly of cassava fields over other areas. We presume that whitefly are a third again as likely to land on a cassava field as on a bare patch of land (see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). We base the cassava field density of our model on the area of cassava harvested in Nakasongola district (10,000 hectares,

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for details, where the modal distance of trading events is 500–1000 m). For the effect of changes in cassava field density see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>. Whitefly migration is calculated from [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], using the total population to find the immigration rate at equilibrium, which we presume to be identical to emigration. To simulate the dispersal of the vector we use data from [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for the dispersal of the sweet potato whitefly (on average, 50–700 m). We do not include the long-distance dispersal of whitefly that [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] observe in a second peak of migration, as this is not consistent with the exponential dispersal kernel that we have assumed. More importantly, however, whitefly may not remain infectious, or even survive, for the duration of these journeys [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, we do show in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref> that the nature of our results is robust to the inclusion of this long-distance migration through a significant increase in the average distance travelled or the use of a fat-tailed dispersal kernel.
