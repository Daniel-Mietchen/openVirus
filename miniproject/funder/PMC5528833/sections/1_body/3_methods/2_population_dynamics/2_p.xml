<p>During each discrete season, plants are harvested or rogued and cuttings potentially replanted, while infection occurs through infected cuttings or infectious whitefly. Whitefly are infected upon contact with infectious plants and lose infectivity, die or migrate. We use a density-dependent approach as the contact rate between whitefly and cassava increases with the density of both; the whitefly is more likely to encounter cassava rather than a different plant, while the plant is more likely to encounter a whitefly. This approach also allows for different whitefly population sizes in different fields, which may affect disease dispersal, particularly at the infection front.</p>
