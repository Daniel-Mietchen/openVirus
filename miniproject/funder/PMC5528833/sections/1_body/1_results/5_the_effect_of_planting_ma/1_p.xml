<p>We begin in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g001">Fig 1</xref> by removing either trade or between-field whitefly dispersal as a means of pathogen dispersal, and see that under current estimates trade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) is important in effecting long-range dispersal of the pathogen. By contrast, between-field whitefly dispersal alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) does not result in epidemics on a large scale. However, without between-field whitefly dispersal, nearly half (47%) of all epidemics fade out, as the pathogen fails to take hold in the district. This is a result of stochasticity in the network of trade interactions, and reflects the disappearance of the pathogen from the system when incidence is low and all infected cuttings are removed but not replanted at the end of a season. Although the results displayed are conditioned on a lack of fade out, to avoid skewing the data, it is important to bear these failed epidemics in mind. Our result show that, while trade alone results in many more infected fields than between-field whitefly dispersal alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g001">Fig 1</xref>), when both means of pathogen dispersal are taken together, local transmission between fields by whitefly movement accounts for nearly 50% of newly infected fields (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is likely due to the fact that whitefly movement is faster on a small spatial scale; in our model whitefly disperse continuously between fields while trade is seasonal (see, for example, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>, where new infections through trade events occur over large distances followed by multiple new infections over small distances through whitefly movement). See
