<p>We now change the loyalty of growers to suppliers of planting material, as well as varying the maximum number of suppliers for a grower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The rate of pathogen spread is reduced when growers continue to trade over successive seasons with the same partners, and when the number of trading partners is reduced. Hence, as connectivity in the trade network increases, and the average path length (average shortest number of steps between any two growers, in terms of trading events) decreases, so does the rate of spread of the pathogen. This further influences the risk for an individual grower of obtaining infected material, which follows a similar pattern to that of the population (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref> for further details).
