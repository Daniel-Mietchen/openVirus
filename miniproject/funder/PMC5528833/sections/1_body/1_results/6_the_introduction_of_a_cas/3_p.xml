<p>Our results show that clean-seed systems can work and increase yield; every case where the system is implemented results in higher yields than where it is not (cf 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref> with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The effect of restrictions on trade, however, depends on how the clean planting material is distributed. If the virus-free material is distributed to the same growers every season, restricting trade (i.e. reducing the frequency of trading events and numbers of trading partners) decreases the yield throughout the district (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This is because only a few growers benefit from the clean material while any remaining uninfected fields are susceptible to infection from dispersal of infectious whitefly. In comparison, if trade were to continue as usual, neighbours of users of the clean-seed system would benefit from the system indirectly by trading for relatively clean material from those users. When virus-free material is distributed to different growers every season, restricting trade increases the yield throughout the district (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), as the material still reaches a large number of growers, while the rate of pathogen dispersal is also decreased through the trade restrictions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Finally, restricting trade such that only the beneficiaries of clean planting material may sell the planting material that they obtain at the end of a season always increases the yield throughout the district (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Effectively, this strategy promotes the trade of relatively clean material from seed system users, but discourages trade in potentially diseased material from growers that do not use the system. The result holds even if the seed system material contains some infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005654.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>).
