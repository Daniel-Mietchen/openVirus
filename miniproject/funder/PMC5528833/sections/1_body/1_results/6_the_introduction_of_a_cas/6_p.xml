<p>Note that when material is distributed to the same group of clustered growers every season, our model shows that decreasing the number of individuals in each cluster increases the yield, until each cluster consists of a single grower only and the material has essentially been randomly dispersed. The reverse is true if the material is distributed to different growers each season. Yield increases faster to a higher equilibrium level when clean planting material is distributed to different growers every season, extending the reach of the material rather than ensuring the success of only a few growers (see
