<p>We consider the introduction of a clean-seed system as well as restrictions on trade to Nakasongola district when CBSD is both endemic and near-ubiquitous (a 2013 survey showed that 70% of fields had CBSD with 100% incidence in a field). While trade between growers could promote the spread of clean material, this has to be balanced against the potential for trade to favour the spread of the pathogen. Here we compare yield, as opposed to the number of fields infected or the average infection, as this is a more relatable measure of success for a control strategy. Yield is measured as the percentage of uninfected or latently infected plants harvested, together with a percentage (here 30%) of each infectious plant that is undamaged by necrosis (and therefore usable). Hence, yield decreases linearly with the increase of infection in the district (see, for example, [
