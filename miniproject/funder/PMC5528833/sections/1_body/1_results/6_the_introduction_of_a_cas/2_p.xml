<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005654.g004">Fig 4</xref> we consider the introduction of a clean-seed system, with planting material either distributed to the same growers each season or to different growers. We also introduce a set of trade restrictions: trade in planting material is allowed to continue as usual; trade is reduced by 50%; trade completely ceases (with between-field transmission restricted to whitefly dispersal); trade is restricted so that only users of certified clean material in a particular season are licensed to distribute material at the end of that season.
