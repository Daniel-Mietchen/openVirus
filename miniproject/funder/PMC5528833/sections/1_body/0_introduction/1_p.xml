<p>The scales over which pathogens are transmitted are of vital importance in disease control [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005654.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], particularly when multiple modes of transmission are possible. The simultaneous use of different control strategies targeting different transmission modes could have an antagonistic effect, whereby one control undermines another. For example, a restriction on movement of planting material to reduce the spread of infection may impact the distribution of disease-free material, affecting efforts to reduce dissemination of pathogen by a vector. Control strategies, therefore, need to be carefully matched to all modes of transmission in order to optimise the effectiveness of disease reduction.
