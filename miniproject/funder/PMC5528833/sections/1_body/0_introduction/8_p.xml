<p>We model the spread of a single strain of non-evolving CBSV both within and between growersâ€™ fields, where the host distribution is characterised by that of Nakasongola district in central Uganda. The district suffers from high levels of CBSD infection, where a clean-seed system might have a positive impact. We firstly consider pathogen dispersal from one initially infected field when the district was disease-free, and secondly when the disease is endemic within the district and a clean-seed system is introduced.</p>
