<p>Clean-seed systems for CBSD are currently at an empirical stage of planning, and data have yet to emerge on their effectiveness. Accordingly, we use modelling to integrate current knowledge about the disease and its control in order to compare the effectiveness and risks of failure of different strategies for the introduction of clean-seed systems. Results of this study can then be used to guide the selection of strategies likely to be successful and to avoid those that carry a significant risk of failure.</p>
