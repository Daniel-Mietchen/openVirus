<p>In order to explore scenarios for the introduction of a clean-seed system effectively, it is first necessary to understand the dynamics of the disease. Cassava is grown on a spatial network of fields, where the pathogen is spread through the movement of whitefly and planting material. We consider two hypotheses: the first is that the movement of planting material through trade is more important than dispersal of the vector in affecting long-range dispersal of the pathogen (H1). Our second hypothesis is that the nature of the network over which planting material is moved affects the rate of dispersal: in particular, fewer connections and greater consistency of connections over time is expected to slow dispersal (H2).</p>
