<p>We address the optimisation of the introduction of a clean-seed system within a trade network to maximise disease reduction. Our use of ‘trade network’ in this context refers to a simple summary of where growers access cassava cuttings from, determined by a stochastic dispersal kernel. We do not analyse here the social drivers that determine grower behaviour. We hypothesise that restrictions or reductions in trade slow the dispersal of the pathogen more than the distribution of clean planting material, and so reduce the rate of pathogen spread overall (H3). We also hypothesise that a community-based approach to clean-seed use, where an entire group receives material rather than a number of spatially-dispersed individual growers, protects fields from reinfection from neighbouring fields and hence decreases disease incidence to a greater extent than a random approach to the distribution of clean planting material throughout the landscape (H4).</p>
