 <p>Cassava brown streak disease affects yields of cassava, an important subsistence crop in Uganda. Relatively little is known about the disease and how it spreads across a landscape, especially regarding the importance of trade in moving infected planting material. Despite this, a number of different strategies are being implemented in order to control the disease. However, the interaction between these strategies has not been considered and failure to do so could have detrimental consequences; for example, restricting trade may reduce the spread of disease through planting material, but may simultaneously reduce the spread of improved, disease-free planting material. Here we use mathematical models to assess the potential importance of trade in spreading cassava brown streak disease. We consider what happens to infection levels when trade is restricted, and how trade restrictions can be combined with the use of clean seed systems, which distribute disease-free planting material to growers. The results and recommendations from our work are of practical use to inform strategies for the control of cassava brown streak disease, and more generally in assessing the effectiveness of clean seed strategies.</p>
