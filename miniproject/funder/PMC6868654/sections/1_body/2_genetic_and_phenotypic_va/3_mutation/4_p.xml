<p>G‐protein‐coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cell membranes represent a major family of molecular targets for a variety of different drugs. Recently, it has been shown, on the basis of an analysis of UK National Health Service drug prescription and sales data from 68 496 individuals, that an average of 3% of these individuals carry at least one allele with a mutation at the active site of a GPCR drug target.

Thus, over 86% of individuals carry at least one missense mutated allele at the active site of the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) and 69% in the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor, respectively. These two GPCRs are targets of the common antiemetic, nabilone, and several antidiabetic drugs such as exenatide, respectively. For these and other classes of drugs, the incidence of mutations suggests that there is an extensive propensity in the population for genetically induced, differential or even absent responses to drugs acting on GPCRs. The authors actually tested experimentally some variants of mu‐opioid and cholecystokinin‐A receptors and confirmed that different responses to actions at the variant receptors, compared to those on the wild‐type receptor, were obtained for a full agonist (morphine), a partial agonist (buprenorphine), an antagonist (naloxone) and the endogenous agonist endomorphine‐1.
