<p>If the target is not specific and the use of the therapeutic armament is too indiscriminate, like a shotgun, the long‐term therapeutic outcome can be potentially worse than the disease originally targeted. This was the case in the 1960s, when the indiscriminate use of dichloro‐diphenyl‐trichloroethane (DDT), as highlighted in the milestone 1962 book “Silent Spring” by Rachel Carson, resulted in extensive environmental damage and spawned the ecology movement. In many ways, we are facing a similar situation with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, particularly for nutritional livestock or for viral infections, which is actually promoting bacterial resistance mechanisms, such as drug efflux and methylation.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> Warnings about the global increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the consequent loss of treatment options for many infections are now common and governments and industry have started joint efforts to combat the problem.
