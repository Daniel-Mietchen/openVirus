<p>Gene mutation is one of the most widely appreciated sources of variability in response to drugs. It occurs relatively infrequently because of the effective deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair mechanisms in most cells and competent immune surveillance, but under environmental and selection pressure, the mutation rate is increased. For immune defense, this can mean that epitope drift occurs, together with loss of antigens for host immune attack. Viruses are probably the champions at mutating

With global concern awakened by recent epidemics of influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola and Zika viruses, the need for effective antivirals has become more urgent. The most promising way forward with the most capricious of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), appears to be to hit the virus at different sites with multivalent vaccines.

With a combination of drugs, including non‐nucleotide and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, and viral entry inhibitors, the introduction of Highly Active Anti‐Retroviral Therapy, composed of at least three different drugs, has effectively reduced the mutation rate and enabled many chronically HIV‐infected patients to live relatively normal lives.
