<p>Together with infectious diseases and lifestyle disorders, cancer is a major global indication for drug development. Plastic changes in tumors have long stymied specific therapeutic targeting strategies. These changes include uncoupling of homeostatic regulation of growth in tumor cells, their resistance to drug therapy, for instance, by overexpressing efflux transporters such as P‐glycoprotein, and aggressive invasion of surrounding tissue. Although new approaches, such as kinase inhibition and immune checkpoint therapy are beginning to have an impact, use of cytotoxic drugs remains a mainstay of oncological treatment.

Adverse effects of cytotoxic drugs, particularly on the gastrointestinal system are pronounced, but more sinister long‐term genetic effects can arise. For instance, treatment of mice with the chemotherapeutic agents, cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C, or procarbazine caused apparent genome‐wide instability with significant elevation of simple tandem repeat mutation frequencies in the sperm and bone marrow of their offspring.

As with infectious diseases, the collateral damage caused by nonspecific cytostatic therapy could well be a health threat to future generations and highly specific multi‐targeting could well be a better option. In fact, the most recent information‐based research suggests that a variety of different tumor types exhibit a recurrent regulatory structure consisting of functional master regulator proteins which are dysregulated in a posttranslational manner.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> Multiple targeting of this network of master regulator proteins, potentially starting also with screens in vitro, may be a way ahead for cancer therapy.
