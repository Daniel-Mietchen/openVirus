<p>Often the epigenetic modifications seen in healthy and transformed cells are studied experimentally only for a few hours or days. In this case, their effects should be viewed rather as cell signaling responses than as inheritable changes. Assessment of long‐term changes is a better way of assessing epigenetic inheritability. This can be done quite effectively in zebrafish or insects, because the generational turnover is much more rapid than in mammals.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> Many drugs, particularly the anticancer agents discussed above, modify posttranslational changes. But other types of drugs, including analgesics, are able to modify epigenetic markers such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation.

In this respect, a warning note is raised by the finding discussed earlier that treatment of male mice with standard chemotherapeutic drugs results in transgenerational instability in their offspring.
