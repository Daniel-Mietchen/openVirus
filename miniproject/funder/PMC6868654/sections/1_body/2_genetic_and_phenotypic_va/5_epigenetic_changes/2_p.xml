<p>Gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation or methylation or DNA methylation, has been widely reported in many cells. Such mechanisms have been reported to play important roles in the etiology of cancer and have led to the introduction of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, vorinostat, romidepsin, belinostat, and panobinostat, as inhibitors of tumor proliferation in several types of cancer.

Moreover, in addition to histones, other proteins that are subject to acetylation might also be affected by HDAC activity. Interestingly, it appears that concomitant inhibition of cancer‐associated inflammation with an inhibitor of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NFκB), may act synergistically with HDAC inhibitors and reduce side‐effects—a further indication of the potential benefit of combined drug therapy of disease.
