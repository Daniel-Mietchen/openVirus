<p>Even if the underlying genetic background is similar, what happens to gene expression when a different cell medium is used, the cell lines are taken after varying times of passaging or the incubation conditions used result in differing rates of growth? Many cell biologists are familiar with the fact that cell lines can become unresponsive due to some form of gene silencing when cultured for prolonged periods. But recent discoveries clearly show that cells respond very differently when the pH or oxygen concentration alters, as occurs, for instance during inflammation or ischemia. As a consequence, the effects of tested drugs change (

In addition, cell stimuli are often grouped together by scientific investigators on the basis that they ultimately result in the generation of the same cell product with a similar outcome. For instance, prostaglandin (PG) E
 <sub>2</sub> production by macrophages has been used for decades as an experimental readout for a response to an “inflammatory stimulus.”
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> This is in keeping with the pathological situation, but PGE
 <sub>2</sub> generation following stimulation of macrophages by antigen‐antibody complexes, calcium ionophore or phagocytosis occurs under the influence of different signaling pathways and from cells with different phenotypes. Most importantly, PGE
 <sub>2</sub> also exerts anti‐inflammatory effects. These include suppression of phagocytosis and triggering of the resolution phase, when acute inflammation subsides. Thus, this lipid inhibits its own production via a negative feedback loop or by inducing generation of proresolving mediators and thereby modulates subsequent adaptive immunity.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> So the type of inflammatory stimulus, the time and inflammatory phase during which cells are collected, as well as the type of response measured can markedly alter the effect of the compound tested (see also section 
 <xref rid="prp2532-sec-0010" ref-type="sec">5</xref>. Time, age, and the resolution of disease). The use of a defined stimulus to elicit a particular pharmacological or phenotypic response from a standardized cellular or biological test system would seem to be a solution to many of the issues outlined above. Across a variety of laboratories, responses to pharmacological intervention can then be compared much more easily. The problem is that Nature does not play fair and a disease syndrome can be the result of a whole range of different triggering agents. As far as possible, drug screening, therefore, should be carried out in a milieu that reflects the target disease environment.
