<p>Macrophages are remarkably plastic, depending on the stimulus applied and the expression of macrophage genes is highly susceptible to post‐translational epigenetic modifications, with silencing of some genes and activation of others.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Consequently, macrophages can express a wide range of phenotypes, from classical inflammatory M1 to anti‐inflammatory, alternatively activated M2 macrophages. Some researchers consider the cells to be in a continual dynamic state, altering their phenotype according to the conditions of the extracellular milieu.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Moreover, the polarization of macrophages to a particular phenotype is under tight metabolic regulation, so changes in glucose, pH and other nutrients can change the genetic expression profile of the cells.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> This appears to be related to a “rewiring” of the citric acid (Krebs) cycle by inflammatory stimuli, simple products of the cycle such as citrate, succinate, and fumarate exerting remarkable changes in macrophage and dendritic cell function.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> We have also shown recently that the resting polarization state of primary human macrophages and the THP‐1 macrophage cell line differs, the latter being more polarized to an M1 state, with the relevant modifications in gene expression profile.

To be able to gain a more accurate assessment of the effects of pharmacological agents on this type of cell, it is therefore, crucial to select a variety of cell phenotypes under different physiologically relevant stimuli, with evaluation of gene expression, cell signaling, and surface molecule expression changes, as well as the determination of secreted products. A variety of drugs have been reported to change the phenotype of macrophages, both in vitro and in vivo

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> so careful dissection of a spectrum of responses is needed to identify differences in pharmacological mechanisms.
