<p>For a color blind marksman, the use of red or green in delineating a target would clearly present him with difficulties in aiming. The genetic variation in a target molecule presents a far more complex challenge to the pharmacologist. Under many experimental conditions, the use of hybridoma cell lines or inbred laboratory animal species goes some way to ensure that the genetic background of the cells or organisms is similar, wherever the experiment is performed. The expectation is that by ensuring that the genetic background remains reasonably constant, the cellular and physiological responses under standardized conditions will also remain relatively constant. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.</p>
