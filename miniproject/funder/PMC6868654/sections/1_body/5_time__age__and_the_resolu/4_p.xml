<p>Most marketed drugs have been introduced because of a specific mechanism of action, often involving a single major target. During the development of the drug, the pathophysiological roles of the relatively novel target mechanism may be inadequately understood. Only later, often as a result of the clinical use of the drug, does the pathological role of the target mechanism in the disease process become clearer. This clarification also includes the time or phase of the disease process during which the target mechanism is most intimately involved and therefore, most susceptible to pharmacological intervention. Unfortunately, this improved understanding of the optimal timing for drug administration does not always lead to a modification of disease therapy since established drug use tends to be modified more as a result of limiting side‚Äêeffects than as a result of optimization of efficacy based on improved understanding of pharmacology. Two examples of the importance of timing for drug efficacy can be cited.</p>
