<p>Not only do underlying biorhythms alter the properties of drug targets, but physiological and pathological processes also change with time. Biomolecules, in particular proteins are very dynamic and interactive, alter their location and undergo modification.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">87</xref> Their movement generally slows down with time and they become less flexible or dysfunctional, as with tau proteins and prions in neurodegenerative disorders and lipoproteins in atherosclerosis, predominantly due to increasing oxidative stress.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref> As time progresses, tachyphylaxis, the loss of drug efficacy, can occur probably because of protein receptor desensitization or because of cellular senescence, so that even if the target is hit, an effect is no longer observed.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">91</xref> Using our traffic metaphor, some of the traffic starts moving slowly or breaks down, causing increased congestion. Thus, the most obvious effect of time is seen in the effect of aging, a major issue in societies with an aging population.
