<p>Acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin has been used for anti‐inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic therapy for nearly 150 years and it is now being used as an antiplatelet and potentially anticancer agent. It has been estimated that 2000 tons of acetylsalicylic acid are synthesized annually, though in many cases, together with other nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), it is clearly overused. This is particularly the case in the elderly, as the many thousands of deaths due to drug‐induced gastrointestinal bleeding attest.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0098" ref-type="ref">98</xref> What most patients and presumably prescribing physicians are unaware of is the fact that NSAIDs generally provide only symptomatic relief from pain and inflammation and have little effect on the time course of acute inflammation. This is certainly true of the common cold, a viral infection, in which only the inflammatory symptoms are reduced.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0099" ref-type="ref">99</xref> In this case, only short‐term use of the NSAIDs is advisable to reduce initial inflammatory symptoms and avoid their potential inhibition of actively generated, endogenous proresolving lipid mediators.
