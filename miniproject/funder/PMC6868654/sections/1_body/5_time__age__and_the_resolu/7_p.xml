<p>The duration of drug action is a further factor in assessing the interaction with its target. We have avoided more than passing consideration in this article of intramolecular dynamics of drug target molecules, but it is worth mentioning one aspect of drug‐ligand binding that can affect duration of drug action. The drug‐target residence time model has gained increasing acceptance over the last decade in describing the interaction of a drug with its molecular target.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0104" ref-type="ref">104</xref> While the affinity of a drug for its receptor has dominated theoretical considerations in the past, the new theory assesses drug‐receptor interactions in terms of the time for which the drug engages its receptor. The slower the drug dissociates from the target receptor, the longer its duration of action. Potentially, this would mean that retention of a drug at its site of action should prolong its effect. With azithromycin, this could indeed be the case, as it accumulates rapidly in leukocytes but it is only slowly released from the cells, allowing it time to exert proresolving, immunomodulatory effects.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0106" ref-type="ref">106</xref> It would definitely be of great interest—in particular for chronic disease therapy ‐ to compare drugs with moderate intrinsic activity at receptors but with prolonged duration of action with the efficacy of potent, short‐acting drugs with high intrinsic activity. There could be some surprises!
