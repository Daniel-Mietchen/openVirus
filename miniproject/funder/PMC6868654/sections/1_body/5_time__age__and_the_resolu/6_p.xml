<p>Drugs which do facilitate resolution of inflammation are the macrolide antibiotics such as azithromycin which promotes the generation of the proresolving macrophage M2 phenotype. Macrolides are known to be particularly effective in the treatment of respiratory infections such as community acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as the rare inflammatory lung disorder, diffuse panbronchiolitis. The macrolide antibiotics accumulate in leukocytes, causing an initial stimulation of neutrophil function and thus, antibacterial activity. Subsequently they promote the generation of the M2 macrophage phenotype and the resolution of inflammation.

Macrolides without antibacterial activity are also being developed for their immunomodulatory properties.

The timing and stage of the disease to be treated is also crucial for successful therapy.
