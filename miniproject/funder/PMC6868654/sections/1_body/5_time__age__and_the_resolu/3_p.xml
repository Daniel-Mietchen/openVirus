<p>Elderly people are far more susceptible to disease, partially because of the slowing and deterioration of normal physiology (especially of renal function), but also because of dysfunctional defense and repair mechanisms. There is a gradual decrease in the barrier function of the mucosa in the elderly with development of innate immune senescence, which affects all the cells of the innate immune system.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">92</xref> Polypharmacy in these patients is very common and the heterogeneity of studies on drug use in this group of patients hinders the development of approaches toward risk reduction.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">94</xref> In a cross‐sectional analysis of community‐dispensed, prescribing data obtained for 310 000 adults over a period of 15 years in Tayside, Scotland, 81% of patients receiving ≥ 15 dispensed drugs per day experienced serious interactions compared with only 11% of those to whom two to four drugs were prescribed.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0095" ref-type="ref">95</xref> Often, additional drugs are prescribed to combat the side‐effects of other previously prescribed drugs. This situation is akin to the example described above of taking a shotgun to hit a small target, resulting in unnecessary collateral damage. For the good of many elderly patients, a regular reassessment of the number and doses of drugs administered is highly advisable. The authors are personally aware of several elderly patients whose condition improved considerably when drug treatments were markedly reduced! Less is sometimes more. In fact, a recent report describes the improvement in glycemic control in diabetic patients following reduction of the complexity of their medication regimen.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">96</xref> Nevertheless, the authors are well aware that in elderly patients with multiple morbidities, “appropriate polypharmacy” may be needed to treat these patients adequately.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0097" ref-type="ref">97</xref> The problem is that there are only a couple of guidelines dealing with the situation of comorbidity. In most cases, in patients suffering concurrently from several diseases, it is inappropriate to simply combine the drugs that are recommended by the respective guidelines which cover only the individual diseases.
