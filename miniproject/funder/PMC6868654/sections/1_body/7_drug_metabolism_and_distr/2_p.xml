<p>The most well‐established source of plasticity in responses to drugs and a major reason for drugs to miss their targets is their kinetic fate within the body. For instance, sex hormones affect not only the pH and motility of the gastric intestinal tract, but also the expression of oxidative metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporter proteins.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0118" ref-type="ref">118</xref> More broadly, genetic polymorphisms in many drug metabolizing enzymes complicate considerably the determination of suitable dosing in clinical studies. Polymorphisms in oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) are very well documented and are the basis for clear guidelines on the assessment of potential drug‐drug interactions in terms of metabolic interference between concomitant drug therapies.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0120" ref-type="ref">120</xref> As considered earlier, such metabolic interactions become even more important in the elderly, in whom polypharmacy is common and rate of metabolism decreases, making interactions much more likely.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0094" ref-type="ref">94</xref> Exercise and sport on the one hand, but factors such as smoking on the other hand, can have profound effects on the expression of metabolic enzymes. These effects include discrete modification of the methylation of the key metabolic regulatory enzyme adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase in blood and skeletal muscle cells.
