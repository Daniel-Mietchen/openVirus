<p>Polymorphisms in drug transporter proteins are a more subtle source of concern, since these differences affect not only metabolic behavior of drugs but also their specific distribution to organs, tissues, and cells. On the one hand, efflux transport of drugs out of tumors and bacteria is a major reason for drug resistance,

For instance, organic anion‐transporting polypeptide (OATPs) regulate intestinal absorption of macrolide antibiotics.
