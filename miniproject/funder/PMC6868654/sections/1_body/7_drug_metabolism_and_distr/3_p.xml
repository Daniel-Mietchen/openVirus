<p>The gut microbiome can exert profound effects on drug metabolism. Thus, metabolism by gut microbiota of uremic solutes, bile acids and steroid hormones can lead to modification of both phase I CYP‐mediated oxidative reactions, as well as phase II drug conjugating enzymes, such as glutathione‐S‐transferases or sulfotransferases, affecting the metabolism of a number of drugs.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0122" ref-type="ref">122</xref> Conversely, bacterial enzymes can directly metabolize some drugs, thereby affecting their efficacy. Bacterial azoreductase in the colon, for instance, degrades sulfasalazine, a drug used in the inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, to the active metabolites 5‐aminosalicylic acid (5‐ASA) and sulfapyridine. Nevertheless, in the rat 2,4,6‐trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)‐induced colitis model, sulfasalazine itself is able to restore the TNBS‐induced gut dysbiosis, as reflected by increasing counts of short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA)‐producing and lactic acid‐producing bacteria, as well as decreasing counts of proteobacteria, thereby ameliorating colitis.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">123</xref> Enhancement of SCFA production by gut bacteria is also thought to be one of the mechanisms by which the anti‐diabetic type 2 drug, metformin, modifies glucose metabolism and cardiovascular responses.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">56</xref> Indeed, an extensive sequence analysis of the gut microbiome in three different mouse strains from two suppliers, revealed considerable differences in bacterial composition between the same strains from different suppliers.
