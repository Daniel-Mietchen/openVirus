<p>A variety of technological approaches can be taken to prolong duration of drug action, particularly in their formulation and thus, to combat variation in drug metabolism. These include delaying absorption or using excipients which allow slow release of active ingredient from the formulated drug or hijacking transport mechanisms.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">132</xref> In this respect, an interesting new approach has recently appeared. Incorporation of deuterium (the heavy hydrogen atom) in place of hydrogen into a drug molecule creates stronger bonds with carbon and is widely used to synthesize reference compounds for drug analysis by mass spectrometry. The dopamine‐depleting drug, tetrabenazine has also long been used for the treatment of hyperkinesia, as well as Huntingdon's disease. By introducing deuterium into the tetrabenazine molecule, it was shown that the metabolism of the molecule at that site can be slowed down, and both peak plasma concentrations and potential side‐effects reduced.
