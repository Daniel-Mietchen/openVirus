<p>Pain also underlies a circadian rhythm and most importantly, melatonin itself is thought to exert analgesic activity.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref> Similarly, respiratory disorders, allergic responses and gastrointestinal disturbances are subject to changes in light. There is growing evidence that in patients with severe sepsis, kept in an intensive care unit for days, the circadian rhythm is disturbed. Modification of the light and dark cycle by intensifying the contrast and minimizing light‐dark disruption or treating with melatonin can exert beneficial effects on the outcome of the condition.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">83</xref> At least in immuno‐inflammatory disorders, it is worth pointing out that the cyclical circulating concentrations of melatonin, itself a potent antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory agent, may exert a direct effect on immunopathology.
