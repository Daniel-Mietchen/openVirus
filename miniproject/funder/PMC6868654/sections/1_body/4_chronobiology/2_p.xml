<p>The flexibility and mobility of molecules and cells certainly does not explain all types of pharmacological plasticity. Changes in the external environment, in addition to modifying the epigenetic profile, nutritional condition, and gut microbiome, can also modify targets and their responses to drugs. The modern propensity for travel, for instance, carries with it additional constraints. Most of us are aware of the physical challenges of intercontinental air travel: jetlag, sleeplessness and lack of concentration and difficulty in adjusting to seasonal and daylight alterations. The reason is that our whole organism, including individual cells, is regulated by body clocks and autoregulatory products of cellular clock genes which regulate transcription factors and control our daily circadian and seasonal rhythms.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref> Jetlag results predominantly from light‐induced modification in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master body clock, which governs subsequent changes in the periphery. These include alterations in the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland which govern the sleep/wake cycle.
