<p>An example is the common symptom of rheumatic diseases, morning stiffness, resulting from disturbance in patients of the diurnal modulation of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis and endogenous anti‐inflammatory cortisol levels, as seen also with corticosterone in experimental arthritis in rats.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">76</xref> Cortisol levels are inappropriately low in patients in the early morning and are mirrored by changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts and proinflammatory cytokines which have the opposite circadian cycle.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> Restoration of normal circadian rhythms may well be the reason why in years past, patients with rheumatic diseases improved considerably when sent to sanatoria in sunny countries and helps to explain some of the regenerative effects of sleep in various disorders. The expression of receptors for glucocorticoids in peripheral cells and tissues also varies with the circadian rhythm of the HPA‐axis, so that sensitivity of tissues to therapeutic corticosteroids also changes. Since receptor sensitivity is low in the morning and high in the evening, it has been proposed that this may be a basis for adjusting the timing of corticosteroid therapy to reduce side effects.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> Similar circadian rhythms have been observed in the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of NSAIDs, probably because of the changes in circulating leukocytes.
