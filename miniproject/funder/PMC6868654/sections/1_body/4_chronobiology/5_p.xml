<p>Such cyclic changes may not just be diurnal, occurring over a 24‐hour light‐dark period, but seasonal (circannual) changes arise as a result of shortening and lengthening of the daylight time. This is not of great significance in laboratory animals, as they are kept under controlled conditions. It is highly likely that the pharmacological responses to many drugs in humans, however, depend on both circadian and circannual rhythms. It was shown recently that 400 genes associated with the immune system in white blood cells and adipose tissue show very marked circannual variations.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">85</xref> In Europe, the peak expression of anti‐inflammatory genes, such as the anti‐inflammatory circadian transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator‐like, and the nadir of inflammatory genes such as interleukin‐6, occurs in July and the reverse in December. The opposite pattern is seen in Oceania.
