 <italic>Sequential</italic>—slowing down the target, before moving in to the hit/kill, by aiming sequentially at one or more targets upstream and then one or more targets downstream, using single drugs with multiple actions or a combination of drugs with varied actions. This is illustrated by the long‐established combination in a single dosage form of the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, an inhibitor of dihydropteroate synthetase, and trimethoprim, an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. Together they act synergistically to inhibit the bacterial synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid. A further example of this approach is the sequential combination of drugs acting at different stages of cell signal pathways. Several growth factors act through the phosphoinositol‐3‐kinase/protein kinase B pathway which is crucial for cell proliferation and angiogenesis. A downstream effector of this pathway is the regulatory protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Addition of the anticancer drug, docetaxol to adenocarcinoma cells in vitro for 24 hours, followed by the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus was highly synergistic in suppressing phosphorylation of mTOR as well as in suppressing proliferation in lung cancer cell lines.

Using a similar rationale, a phase 2 study was carried out in which the tubulin polymerization inhibitor, BNC105P was administered together with the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who were refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
