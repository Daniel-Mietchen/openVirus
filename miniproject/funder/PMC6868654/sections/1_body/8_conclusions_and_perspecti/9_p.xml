<p>Alternatively, a wide range of assays and readouts can be used and a systems biology approach taken to assess the data for patterns. This approach is also taken in our laboratories, using different test models with a range of functional, molecular, biochemical, and imaging methods, at various stages of compound testing, to reflect the clinical conditions.
