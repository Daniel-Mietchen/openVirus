<p>Apart from highly specific drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, it may be worth reconsidering the rational approach to drug therapy, namely of using a single specific drug to hit a single target, like Ehrlich's magic bullet. Rather, we should consider the multiple factors which make the target difficult to hit and try using a progressive, multifactorial, multitargeting approach. There are enough examples of this technique in the natural world. When lionesses hunt a fast moving and gyrating antelope, they do so in a group. This initially reduces the space within which the antelope can move and then one of the attackers may be able to injure and slow down the prey before the others come in for the kill. The same approach is used in military actions, to slow down or damage a superior opponent and thereby, it becomes easier to destroy. To use the metaphor we started with in the introduction, the sometimes crazy movement of cars at a major road intersection is best controlled by forcing the cars into specific lanes and introducing co‚Äêordinated traffic lights. The potential for traffic jams is markedly reduced.</p>
