<p>In view of the immense variability and plasticity of the mammalian organism in response to pharmacological agents, it is not entirely surprising that drugs do not always provide the benefit we expect. In fact, it has to be admitted that even when a new drug is marketed we know relatively little about its efficacy in a large population and subsequently, many drugs are prescribed too often for unsuitable conditions and patients are too willing to take medicine for conditions which may not require such treatment. Aside from this, nonadherence is also a big problem.</p>
