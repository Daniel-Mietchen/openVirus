<p>Screening conditions, in addition, should reflect, as closely as possible, those occurring in the immediate environment of the putative disease target. A recent review has drawn up a generic set of principles—including genomic context, cellular heterogeneity, incubation conditions and relevant stimuli—by which a suitable in vitro screening cell system can be established.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">139</xref> Even repurposing of known drugs for new indications can be more specific. In this context, a set of guidelines has been proposed to facilitate in vitro test selection for kinase inhibitors—which have a variety of off‐target effects—in order to define potentially therapeutically beneficial off‐target pharmacological effects.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0140" ref-type="ref">140</xref> Stratification of animal and clinical systems, based on biomarkers or genetic clustering, as well as age, sex, and disease stage, even diet, with consideration of circadian and circannual rhythms, should also improve specificity. To gain a hold on some of these less easily controllable variables, it is essential to make effective use of reference compounds. This involves checking whether their responses remain the same under all conditions and whether the pharmacological response from the test situation is as expected. Since the reference compound may also have some off‐target effects, a biomarker of its mechanism of action should be included.
