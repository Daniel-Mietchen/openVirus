 <italic>Specific</italic>—whether aiming a drug at a single or multiple targets, the aim should be precise, providing a greater chance of avoiding off‐target effects. Despite the long history of drug targeting and years of improvements, there is still room to enhance chemical specificity at the drug design stage. Intriguingly, recent detailed docking studies with over 3 million compounds revealed it is possible to bias the effect of a compound acting on a single receptor toward one or the other downstream signaling processes. Docking to the μ‐opioid‐receptor led to the identification of a compound which preferentially activated signaling through the G protein Gi, with clear analgesic activity, avoiding signaling through the β‐arrestin pathway, associated with the side‐effects of respiratory depression, constipation, and tolerance.
