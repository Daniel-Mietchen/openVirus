<p>In pharmacological terms, this can be achieved by the co‐ordinated use of different drugs. A comparable concept has been proposed in relation to drug doses used for the treatment of disease.

 <sub>2</sub> [on release of substrate by phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub>, metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclo‐oxygenase and microsomal PGE synthase and finally action of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> on its different receptors] could be used. In this way, the adverse gastric and cardiovascular effects arising from pronounced inhibition of cyclo‐oxygenase with NSAIDs could be markedly reduced. Alternatively, an immune reaction or neurological deficiency could potentially be regulated by light or melatonin to make the final target more accessible to treatment. The growth of a dysregulated cancer or other cell could be slowed so that more time is available to target a more specific mechanism. In this way, the serial use of two to three pharmacological agents, preferably with long drug‐target residence times, would probably have greater efficacy than a single potent agent that only proves to be effective in a limited number of patients because of the inherent instability of the target mechanism. This approach is already taken to good effect in the treatment of hypertension in which a diuretic, for instance, is combined with a sartan and/or a calcium antagonist to consistently decrease blood pressure.
