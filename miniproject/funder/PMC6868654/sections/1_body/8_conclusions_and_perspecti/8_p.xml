 <italic>Simultaneous</italic>—multitargeting several mechanisms at once. Currently, this usually involves treating diseases with multiple drugs. We have already seen how in the elderly this can cause problems. It is preferable if individual drugs can be developed with multiple relevant actions. Recent studies suggest that single small molecule compounds may be developed to hit several targets simultaneously. Thus, glitazone compounds have been described recently for metabolic disorders with partial PPARγ agonist, potent COX‐2 antagonist (nanomolar IC50 values) and moderate 15‐LOX inhibitor (micromolar IC50 values) activities. These compounds were anti‐inflammatory on macrophages in vitro and in acute inflammation in vivo.

Other approaches to multi‐targeting include network targeting, as with optogenetics in which neuronal circuits are modulated by marking of specific genes with rhodopsin which responds to light,

Considerable interest has arisen in the use of phenotype assays, both in primary cellular or stem cell systems in vitro and in animal models of disease.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0144" ref-type="ref">144</xref> For instance, it was reported that NSI‐189, a benzylpiperizine‐aminiopyridine that stimulates general neurogenesis of human hippocampus‐derived neural stem cells in vitro, is able to exert multidomain effects on cognition and depression, suggesting that phenotypic multitargeting may also be viable for CNS disorders.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0145" ref-type="ref">145</xref> The challenge is to identify, possibly by reverse pharmacology through extrapolation backwards from the clinical condition, a phenotype or set of symptoms to use as potential functional targets for initial screening. Subsequently, when an active hit or lead compound is identified, target deconvolution has to be carried out to investigate potential mechanism(s) of action. Recently, proposals have been made for establishing a “chain of translatability,” starting with the identification of a disease‐associated molecular characteristic or signature such as a disease‐associated gene expression profile.
 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0146" ref-type="ref">146</xref> This is then succeeded by cellular models which aim to reconstruct a cellular phenotype as similar as possible to that of the disease condition and subsequently, use of relevant animal models of disease.
