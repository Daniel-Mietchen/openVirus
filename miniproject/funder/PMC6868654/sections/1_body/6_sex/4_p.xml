<p>Pharmacological actions of drugs are also subject to sex differences and some of these, particularly in relation to cardiovascular effects, have recently been reviewed.

The distinction between males and females is especially pronounced in pharmacokinetic processes, since the expression of many drug metabolizing enzymes and the occurrence of adverse drug effects is subject to modification by female sex hormones.
