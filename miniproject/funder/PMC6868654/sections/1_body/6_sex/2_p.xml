<p>In the past, preclinical studies on drug candidates were performed exclusively on male animals, to avoid the “inconvenient” alterations in sensitivity resulting from endogenous hormonal changes. But it has now long been clear that female responses to drugs often vary from those in males. These differences start with sex differences in disease susceptibility, possibly in part because of sex chromosome linkage, but also due to hormonal and metabolic distinctions, physical constitution and gender‐specific lifestyles. This is obvious in autoimmune diseases which are often more prevalent in females than in males. Systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's disease occur mainly in females, while systemic sclerosis is fourfold, rheumatoid arthritis two‐ to threefold and multiple sclerosis twofold more frequent in females than males.

In females, the ratios of CD4 and IL‐17‐producing T cells to Treg cells were raised and the production of Ig2a immunoglobulins increased in females in comparison to males.
