<p>Surprisingly, although the presence or absence of food is well‐known to affect oral drug absorption, few studies have been carried out to investigate effects of different dietary constituents on responses to drugs. Dietary supplementation with sodium selenite during pregnancy in the rat was reported to increase survival from embryotoxicity induced by concomitantly administered sodium salicylate, though the mechanism was unclear.

In nude mice with experimentally induced pulmonary tumors placed on a high fat (12% wt/wt linoleic acid) diet, co‐administration of the NSAID indomethacin was found to significantly reduce tumor growth.

Perhaps such steps could be viewed as an attempt to modify the fuel used by the biological traffic to a more “environmentally friendly” form.
