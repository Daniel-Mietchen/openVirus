<p>In the meantime, it has been well established that changing the type of dietary fatty acid can have marked effects on the structural type of eicosanoid generated. For example, increasing dietary intake of omega‐3 fatty acids, which occur in high quantities in fish, reduces the amounts and conversion of the n‐6 fatty acid arachidonic acid to metabolites such as PGE2 and leads to synthesis of metabolites that either have different or limited biological activities, as well as exerting inhibitory effects

SFB promote mucosal IgA production and the formation of Th17 effector cells in the gut Peyer's patches. This results in exacerbation of inflammation in murine models of colitis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and arthritis, but protection from diabetes.
