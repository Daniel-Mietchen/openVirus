<p>Variability is an essential characteristic of the immune response, enabling adaptive immunity to be directed toward a vast repertoire of antigenic determinants. The expression of cell surface molecules, the cell phenotype, and subpopulations frequently change and the cells are continuously moving within the body, not only in blood and lymph fluid, but also across mucosal membranes and into and out of organs and tissues. In addition, though, a number of poorly considered factors also cause unexpected variation and jeopardize the investigation of autoimmune disease conditions. Taking our recurrent traffic metaphor, immunotherapeutics may be seen as traffic signals introduced to stop, slow down or redirect immune responses.</p>
