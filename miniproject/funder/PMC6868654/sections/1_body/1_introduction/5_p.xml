<p>Positively, off‐target effects have contributed in part to the growing interest in repurposing of known drugs for novel therapeutic indications.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In the last few years, another aspect of this sort of collateral damage has been revealed by the fact that so many studies—many published in highly reputable journals—are poorly reproducible,

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> so the target does not seem to be in the same place in every lab! This may be due, among other things, to poor experimental design and methods, inadequate sampling, false use of statistics, lack of suitable controls or simply too much haste to get the data published. In this case, the set‐up of the target is incorrect and it becomes wobbly or falls over completely. A number of measures to counter this superficial science are being taken by various organizations, including the National Institutes of Health in the United States, the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research and the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, as well as several leading journals.

Varied conditions or differences in gene expression in the organism or cells studied, the time of day of dosing or differences in the metabolic fate of the chemical agent, though, also contribute to contradictory findings.
