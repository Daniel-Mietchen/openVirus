<p>Drawing to some extent on personal experience, particularly in the field of inflammation and (auto)immunity, we review here some of the reasons for the mobility of drug targets and their interactions with ligands (Figure 
 <xref rid="prp2532-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) that result in pharmacological plasticity. We do not take into consideration the inherent chemical dynamics of target molecules themselves nor do we address neuronal plasticity. The CNS is inherently highly plastic. New neuronal connections and pathways are generated or lost in response to emotional experiences, environmental stress or learning, disease, trauma, or conditioning and this subject has been extensively addressed.

 <xref rid="prp2532-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> We do suggest, however, ways in which the drug target can be made to stand still or at least become easier to hit. Many of the approaches are already known. We emphasize the importance of taking most or all of the varied conditions into account, in a holistic manner, when developing drugs or explaining their effects in an attempt to tackle the “biological traffic melee” which most chronic diseases present.
