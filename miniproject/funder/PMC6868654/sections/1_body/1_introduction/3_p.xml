<p>Scientific research is an essentially rational occupation and phenomena are frequently reduced to the simplest system that can be studied. Look in any leading biomedical journal and the attractive colored diagrams of simplified interactive processes are among the first to catch the eye. We easily forget that living organisms are in a continual state of dynamic interactions and adaptations, biochemicals are being synthesized in bursts and dissipate, cells are growing and dying and remain almost continually on the move. Molecules both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, if visualized simultaneously, would probably look like a speeded‚Äêup video of Time Square, Piccadilly Circus or the Place de l'Etoile in the rush hour. This mesmerizing mobility has to be taken much more into account when considering the effects of pharmacological agents, particularly if the dynamic homeostatic balance is to be maintained under treatment.</p>
