<p>In August 2015, we commemorated in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the 100th anniversary of the death of Paul Ehrlich, founder of the first Institute of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at Frankfurt University and the first Director of the Chemotherapeutic Research Institute, Georg‐Speyer‐House, now the home of the Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy (Figure

He suggested that a chemical compound could be used as a magic bullet (Zauberkugel) to selectively kill a disease‐causing organism, an idea which has been partially realized by the explosive development in recent years of monoclonal antibody therapeutics.

Much as we should like to be able to hit a target with the accuracy and speed of a chemical bullet, the therapeutic target has an irritating habit of moving around.
