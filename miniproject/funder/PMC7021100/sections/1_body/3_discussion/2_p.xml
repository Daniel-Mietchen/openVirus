 </xref> For HIV network analyses, we used a 2% threshold to be able to assess transmission of low frequency (2%–19%) variants, with 2% being a methodological detection limit associated with our experimental design. Given a read coverage IQR for all positions associated with HIVDR of 1126–5053 (median 2333), and considering that all participants had plasma viral loads &gt;1000 copies/mL, our acceptance criteria to detect DRMs at 2% within-host frequency threshold varied between 23 and 101 high-quality reads (median 47), giving us high confidence that the mutations observed were not spurious.
