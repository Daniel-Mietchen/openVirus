<p>Our study has limitations that need to be acknowledged. Even though the Condesa Clinic diagnoses a large proportion of all the new cases of HIV in Mexico City annually, inclusion of other clinics in Mexico City is warranted to increase network density and representativeness. Our study may also suffer from enrolment bias, as only ∼50% of persons diagnosed at the Condesa Clinic were enrolled due to logistical complications such as materials stock-outs, laboratory closures due to maintenance and the availability of counsellors and project personnel, who were mainly present during the morning shifts. Additionally, as previously suggested,

 </xref> incomplete sampling may increase the chance of linking individuals who are not direct transmission partners in the network and thus bias age assortativity analyses. Also, in this study, the contribution to the network of important risk groups was not assessed, including persons failing ART, adolescents under 18 years and migrants. Future molecular surveillance in the region will greatly benefit from more detailed metadata, including specific sexual practices, venues and apps for finding sexual partners, use of recreational drugs, etc.
