 </xref> remains a controversial issue. Here, sharing of specific DRMs at low within-host frequency (2%–19%), mainly RT D67N/G/E and P225H, between putative transmission pairs was observed relatively frequently (25 out of 66 clusters including persons sharing DRMs). However, sharing of low-frequency DRMs was not consistent among all persons belonging to the cluster. As most participants in the present study were detected in the chronic phase of HIV infection, it is not possible to distinguish actual transmission versus

 </xref> DRMs with low transmission fitness due to high replicative impairment such as M184V/I and K65R were not shared within the Mexican network, and were observed mostly at low within-host frequencies in the study population. This suggests different transmission, persistence, emergence and reversion mechanisms for different HIVDR variants.
