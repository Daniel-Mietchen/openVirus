<p>Interestingly, DRM sharing patterns within Mexico City’s HIV network were closely associated with both age and geographical place of residence. The presence of at least three municipalities with strong evidence of higher odds of harbouring putative transmission chains sharing drug-resistant variants is noteworthy. Indeed, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero and Álvaro Obregón in Mexico City and Ecatepec (together with Nezahualcóyotl) in Mexico State are the most highly populated municipalities in the metropolitan area.

 </xref> Gustavo A. Madero and Iztapalapa also encompassed a high number of PLWH included in the study cohort. Whether this observation simply reflects higher sampling density of local networks or a real unequal geographical distribution needs further follow-up and observation. It is important to note that there are no municipality-specific clinics in the area, and ART is provided by centralized care centres. Thus, we are unable to look at municipality-specific treatment factors that could explain our findings. Our observations suggest an opportunity for social research to study specific socioeconomic, cultural or geographic determinants that could influence HIVDR spread, and enrich our understanding of the local epidemic. Moreover, the higher odds of sharing K103N between younger persons and in smaller clusters also suggests important groups for intervention. Whether the decreasing trend of K103N sharing observed in the network is due to enrolment bias or to a real epidemiological effect remains to be explored.
