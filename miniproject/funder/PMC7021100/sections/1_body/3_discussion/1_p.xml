<p>HIV pretreatment drug resistance to efavirenz/nevirapine in ART initiators in the largest HIV clinic in Mexico City was similar to that observed at the national representative survey in Mexico,

 </xref> Leveraging on a policy window provided by administrative changes in the Mexican Government, Mexican ART Guidelines were modified, recommending dolutegravir- and bictegravir-based single-tablet regimens as preferred options, and moving efavirenz- and lower genetic barrier INSTI-based regimens to the ‘alternative’ category.

 </xref> This transition period warrants continuous HIVDR surveillance and a better understanding of HIVDR transmission dynamics, especially when no specific additional programmes to strengthen adherence and viral load monitoring have been enforced, and drug stock-outs may occur due to purchase and distribution adjustments. This is relevant given the remarkable increase in NNRTI-transmitted HIVDR during the last decade in Mexico City from 2% to 10%, which can in part be linked to programmatic weaknesses including suboptimal viral load monitoring, but also to epidemiological factors including low education, marginalization, discrimination and poverty.
