<p>After quality filtering, considering all positions associated with HIVDR, the median read coverage was 2333 (IQR 1126–5053). At the Sanger-like threshold of ≥20% and considering WHO definitions,

 </xref> pretreatment HIVDR reached 14.8% (95% CI 13.4%–16.2%) to any antiretroviral, 9.6% (8.5%–10.8%) to NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine) and 4.5% (3.6%–5.3%) to NRTIs. As expected given their less common use in first-line ART regimens, pretreatment HIVDR to boosted PIs (lopinavir, atazanavir, darunavir; 1.7%, 1.2%–2.2%) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs; 0.8%, 0.5%–1.2%) was low (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F1">1</xref>a). HIVDR to single drugs was highest for efavirenz (8.7%) and nevirapine (9.6%), and lowest for dolutegravir (0.1%) and darunavir (0.4%) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F1">1</xref>b). K103N was the most frequent surveillance DRM with 6.6% frequency (7.1% K103N/S) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F1">1</xref>c). Other commonly observed NNRTI DRMs included G190A, Y188L, Y181C and K101E (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F1">1</xref>c). Both M184V and M184I were observed mainly as low-frequency variants in approximately 0.6% of the participants. K65R was very rare and only observed as a low-frequency variant. Frequent NRTI DRMs included the thymidine analogue mutations M41L, L210W and T215S. The most frequent PI mutations included M46I/L and L90M. INSTI mutations were rare (Figure
