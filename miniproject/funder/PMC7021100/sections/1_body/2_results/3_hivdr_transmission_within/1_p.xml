<p>Among clustering individuals, 175/963 (18%) shared DRMs involving 66 clusters. Of these clusters, 25 included persons sharing only low-frequency DRMs. Among all individuals sharing DRMs, 66/175 (38%) shared K103N/S involving 24 clusters (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F3a">3</xref>a and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F3a">3</xref>b). Other frequently shared DRMs included: reverse transcriptase (RT) Y188L (11/175), RT T215S/C (24/175) and protease M46I (19/175), mostly at ≥20% within-host frequency; and RT D67N/G/E (56/175) and RT P225H (16/175) as low-frequency variants. Persons sharing DRMs were more frequently enrolled after 2016 (2017 aOR = 1.7, 1.0–2.7,

 <italic> </italic>0.02) (Table 
 <xref rid="dkz502-T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Indeed, the odds of sharing DRMs increased with time (0.15, 0.23 and 0.31 for 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively; test for trend

 <italic> </italic>0.04), observing 12%, 19% and 24% of persons sharing DRMs (among clustering individuals) participating in 3, 46 and 66 clusters, in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F4">4</xref>). Young persons ≤21 years old participated in 19 out of 66 clusters including persons sharing DRMs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F2">2</xref>b). As expected, low-frequency DRMs were less commonly observed in all members of the cluster than when using the ≥20% threshold (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F3a">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F4">4</xref>). Analysing the geographical distribution of persons within the network, eight municipalities (out of 75)—six in Mexico City (Gustavo A. Madero, Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Álvaro Obregón, Benito Juárez and Iztacalco) and two in Mexico State (Ecatepec and Nezahualcóyotl)—encompassed the places of residence of 65% of all persons sharing DRMs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F3a">3</xref>c). Of note, the Gustavo A. Madero municipality had 3.2 times the odds (95% CI 1.7–5.8, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001) of including persons sharing DRMs than other municipalities within Mexico City (Table 
 <xref rid="dkz502-T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A similar trend was also strongly significant for Iztapalapa (aOR = 2.6, 1.4–4.9, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.002) and Ecatepec (aOR = 3.5, 1.5–8.1,

 <italic> </italic>0.004) (Table 
 <xref rid="dkz502-T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
