<p>In our phylogeographic diffusion model, the municipalities of Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Benito Juárez (in Mexico City) and Ixtapaluca (in Mexico State) were the most strongly supported (BF &gt;20) sources of HIV, while Nezahualcóyotl, Ixtapaluca (in Mexico State), Iztapalapa, Benito Juárez and Venustiano Carranza (in Mexico City) were commonly recipients (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F5">5</xref>a). This analysis identifies a ‘core HIV diffusion area’ across the northern part of Mexico City and the neighbouring municipalities to the east (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F5">5</xref>b). Interestingly, Gustavo A. Madero was not included in any strongly supported transition, suggesting local persistence and spread of drug-resistant viruses.
