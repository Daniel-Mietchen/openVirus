<p>Putative links with at least one other sequence were found for 963/2447 (39%) sequences, forming 326 clusters ranging in size from 2 to 20 individuals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S1</xref>). Clustering individuals were younger [adjusted OR (aOR) per 1 year increase = 0.96, 95% CI 0.95–0.97, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001], less likely to include women (aOR = 0.46, 0.28–0.75, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.002) and less likely to reside outside of the central metropolitan area (aOR = 0.12, 0.03–0.51, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.004) (Table 
 <xref rid="dkz502-T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Persons 20–24 years old were over-represented and persons ≥40 years old were under-represented within clustering individuals (
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001; Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S5</xref>). Young persons (≤21 years old) comprised 14% (139/963) of clustering individuals, belonging to 103 clusters (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dkz502-F2">2</xref>a). Of all putative links (1158), 24% (278) included at least one person ≤21 years old. Of these links, 42% (117/278) included one 22 to 25 year old, 38% (106/278) one 26 to 40 year old, 6% (16/278) one person &gt;40 years old, and 23% (63/278) another person ≤21 years old, suggesting frequent putative links between persons of diverse age groups. Persons ≤21 years old were not more prone to link with persons of their same age group compared with persons &gt;40 years old (11.8% versus 9.5%, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.6), while persons ≤30 years old were more prone to link with persons of their same age compared with persons &gt;30 years old (47.6% versus 26.2%, 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.0001). Moreover, persons &lt;25 years old were more likely to belong to larger clusters (size &gt;2: OR = 1.3, 1.03–1.8, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.003; size &gt;9: OR = 1.7, 1.06–2.7, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.02). When estimating Newman’s coefficients, the inferred transmission network was assortative by age (0.0867; 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.0001) and municipality of residence (0.0077; 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.001) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">S2</xref>). Considering centroids of municipalities, genetically linked individuals were more likely to live closer (13 km median observed distance versus 65 km expected distance; 
 <italic>P </italic>&lt;
 <italic> </italic>0.01). The proportion of persons harbouring major DRMs in protease was slightly higher in clustering individuals (3.3% versus 2.0%; OR: 1.7, 1.0–2.8, 
 <italic>P </italic>=
 <italic> </italic>0.045), but significance was lost after adjusting for age, sex, year of enrolment and location of residence (Table
