<p>Near full-length genome HIV sequences (HXB2 positions 538–9642) were generated for all newly diagnosed individuals at Condesa participating in the study, using in-house-developed amplification protocols and deep sequencing.

 </xref> For this study, only the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene region was aligned and analysed. Briefly, purified viral RNA from 1 mL of plasma (QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit; QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) was reverse transcribed using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and primer 1.R3.B3R 5′-ACTACTTGAAGCACTCAAGGCAAGCTTTATTG-3′ (HXB2 positions: 9611–9642) at 50°C for 1 h and 55°C for 1 h. A long-range single-round PCR was then performed with primers 1.U5.B1F 5′-CCTTGAGTGCTTCAAGTAGTGTGTGCCCGTCTGT-3′ (538–571) and 1.R3.B3R, using Expand Long Template Enzyme Mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with the following conditions: 94°C for 4 min; 15 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 68°C for 30 s and 68°C for 9.2 min; 23 cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 65°C for 30 s and 68°C for 9.2 min; and 68°C for 10 min. Genetic libraries for sequencing were generated with the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocols, and sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were then assembled using HyDRA (Public Health Agency of Canada),

Consensus sequences were quality filtered, and a local BLAST was performed to exclude sequences &lt;0.1% different from historical sequences with the same associated birth date. HIVDR prevalence was estimated using the Stanford algorithm (v8.4) with the HIVdb tool,
