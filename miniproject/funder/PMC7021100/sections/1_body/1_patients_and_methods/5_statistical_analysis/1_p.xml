<p>Available demographic metadata were explored, curated and checked for missing data and errors. Crude ORs and 95% CIs between outcome and exposure variables were estimated independently and significance of associations was assessed by χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests for OR = 1. For ordered categorical variables, we obtained stratum-specific odds and tested for trends. To account for confounding and effect modification, multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to explore associations of sociodemographic variables (including age, sex, municipality of residence, cluster size and sampling year) with belonging to clusters or with sharing DRMs within the network. All analyses were performed using STATA (v15).
