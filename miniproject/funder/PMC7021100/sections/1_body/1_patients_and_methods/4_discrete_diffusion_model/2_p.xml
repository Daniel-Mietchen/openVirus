 </xref> To investigate whether support for transition rates was associated with sampling heterogeneity, analyses were repeated while randomly permuting location states between tips during Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

 </xref> Migration links with good BF support in the ‘as is’ analysis and poor BF support in the ‘tip-state-swap’ analysis were considered for further analysis. We refer to this as the adjusted BF. MCMC chains were run to ensure adequate mixing. Maximum clade credibility trees were obtained with TreeAnnotator 1.10,
