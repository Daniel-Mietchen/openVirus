  <p>Cluster growth and geographic residence of persons sharing DRMs. (a) Clusters with shared DRMs at ≥20% sensitivity threshold. (b) Clusters with shared DRMs at ≥2% threshold. Nodes are coloured by HIV gene. Node shapes denote gender. All edges represent a genetic distance of &lt;1.5% separating nodes. Red edges denote putative sequence pairs sharing DRMs. Sequences sharing K103N are shown. Annual growth of the network is shown from left to right. (c) Geographic residence of individuals sharing DRMs. Maps of Mexico City metropolitan area divided into municipalities are shown. Eight municipalities are shown, which accounted for 65% of persons sharing DRMs. IN, integrase. This figure appears in colour in the online version of
