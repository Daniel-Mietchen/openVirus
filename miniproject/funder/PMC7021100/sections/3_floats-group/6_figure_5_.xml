  <p>Lineage dispersal events between municipalities in the Mexico City metropolitan area. (a) Sankey plot showing the proportion of transition events from each source municipality (left) toward the recipient municipality (right). Only strongly supported transitions (adjusted BF &gt;20) are shown and are coloured by source. The size of the boxes is proportional to the number of transitions observed. (b) Number of lineage dispersal events between municipalities. The thickness of the arrows corresponds to the average number of strongly supported, inferred migration events between locations (BF &gt;20). This figure appears in colour in the online version of 
   <italic>JAC</italic> and in black and white in the print version of 
   <italic>JAC.</italic>
