  <p>Contribution of young persons in Mexico City’s HIV genetic network, 2016–18. Clusters are coloured by age group. (a) All clusters are shown; age at enrolment is included within each node. (b) Only clusters with putative sequence pairs sharing DRMs at ≥2% threshold are shown; shared K103N is identified. Node shapes denote gender. All edges represent a genetic distance of &lt;1.5% separating nodes. Red edges denote putative sequence pairs sharing DRMs. This figure appears in colour in the online version of 
   <italic>JAC</italic> and in black and white in the print version of 
   <italic>JAC</italic>.
