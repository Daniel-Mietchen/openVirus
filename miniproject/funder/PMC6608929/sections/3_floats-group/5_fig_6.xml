  <title>The probability that a particular intervention scenario provides the greatest net benefits (i.e., the probability for each of the different scenarios that they are most effective at that level of effort) along a range of investment thresholds (the number of persons that have to be covered by larval control in order to avert a single case), by location.</title>
  <p>A scenario without larval control was used as the reference case. The upper panel shows outcomes when the efficacy of larval control was low (&lt;50%), while the lower panel shows the outcomes for simulations where efficacy was high (â‰¥50%).</p>
