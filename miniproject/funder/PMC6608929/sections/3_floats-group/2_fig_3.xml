  <title>Top: Scatter plots of the number of infections averted per iteration plotted against the total number of people covered in that simulation run for the four intervention scenarios (individual, targeted, radius, collective) and three settings (San Juan, Recife, Jakarta).</title>
  <p>Bottom panels: Scatter plots of the number of infections averted (compared to the scenario without interventions) in relation to the level of induced larval mortality (i.e., efficacy of the larval control at the neighborhood level) for the four scenarios and three settings.</p>
