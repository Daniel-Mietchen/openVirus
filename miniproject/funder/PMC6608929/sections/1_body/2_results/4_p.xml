<p>All three settings displayed similar relationships between the level of investment (number of persons covered per infected case averted) and the net benefits of control. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007479.g006">Fig 6</xref>). We analyzed these relationships separately for low (&lt;50%) and high (â‰¥50%) levels of efficacy of larval control. There is a striking difference in which interventions provide the best value. At high levels of efficacy, despite having to cover all patches at once in response to a trigger, the collective response is most likely to provide the best outcome for a given level of effort. When control is less efficacious, the results are more variable between the sites. At low investment thresholds, the focal response provides the best outcome. In San Juan, the focal response is the most effective for any level of investment threshold, while in the other locations the radius, targeted, and collective approaches become more appealing at higher levels of investment.
