<p>In general, all four control scenarios substantially limited the severity of the outbreak, with the collective response in particular having a greater impact. In terms of infections averted over the two-year period, compared to the scenario without larval control, the focal and targeted responses were consistently the least effective. The relative impact of the intermediate area-wide scenario depended on the urban center (e.g., its size, the number of neighborhoods and the distribution of humans across the locality) in which the epidemic took place (

In Recife, the focal and targeted response were only slightly worse than the intermediate area-wide response in terms of impact, while the collective response was significantly more effective. In contrast, in Jakarta, the three limited responses were much closer to each other in terms of impact.
