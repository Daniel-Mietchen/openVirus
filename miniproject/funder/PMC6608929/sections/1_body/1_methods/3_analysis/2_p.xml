<p>As a measure of the level of investment or effort associated with each scenario, we kept track of the total number of persons covered (number of inhabitants per patch x number of days that patch initiated control, summed over all patches). Although assessing the financial and economic costs associated with the different larval control strategies were beyond the scope of this analysis (and we therefore likewise ignore complications such as economies of scale), we draw upon health economic methods to estimate the net benefits of each of the four control strategies, using the ‘no control’ scenario as our reference case. We calculated the net benefit of each simulation as the number of infections averted multiplied by an investment threshold value, which here represents the number of persons a city or control program is willing to cover in order to avert one infected case, minus the number of persons covered in the control scenario [
