<p>For each scenario in each of the three localities, we performed sets of 2000 simulations. Each simulation had a 50-day burn-in period to allow mosquito population sizes to reach stable values, after which a single infected human was introduced to a randomly chosen patch. The infection dynamics were then followed for a two-year period, to capture both the major epidemic peak after initial (re)emergence and a significant stretch of time afterwards to allow the system to stabilize beyond transient dynamics. To gain insight into the usefulness of various control strategies, we compare the number of infected and recovered humans at the end of the two-year period for each of the 4 intervention scenarios to the scenario without any control, based on simulations where the initial introduction spread. We also investigated how the dynamics of control depend on assumptions regarding the efficacy of the control effort and the location of neighborhoods participating in the control effort by performing additional sets of simulations where a randomly chosen 20% of neighborhoods were assumed to not participate. For these particular sets of simulations, we assumed efficacy of larval control per patch was 60%.</p>
