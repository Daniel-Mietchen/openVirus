<p>Our results illustrate that, as might be expected, collective (city-wide) responses are considerably more effective at limiting total outbreak size than are the more focal strategies. In general, the number of infections averted (compared to a control scenario without any intervention) increased with increasingly ambitious strategies. However, the relative impact of the two intermediate strategies (treatment based on a radius around the focal neighborhood, and treatment in both the focal and the most strongly connected neighborhood) differed between the three cities. The targeted approach in particular appeared to offer no benefit over the focal response.</p>
