<p>An important question in vector-borne disease control is how to structure prevention and/or control interventions optimally in space and time. This is particularly relevant for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted arboviruses such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, which tend to be highly focal both temporally and spatially [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The fact that a large proportion of infected humans (at least in the case of dengue) remains asymptomatic yet contributes to ongoing transmission only complicates effective focal test and control strategies for such pathogens [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Given the tremendous burden on human health associated with 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-transmitted viruses, and the fact that the majority of this burden is experienced in tropical, often resource-constrained settings, there is a clear need for insight into what would constitute the most effective control strategy for a given amount of investment of effort. An example of this tension is provided by Liebman et al [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who suggest that while the current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend implementing vector control in a 400 m radius around a detected human case [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], control responses in Iquitos, Peru tended to be limited to a radius of 100 m, as a 400 m radius could involve treating hundreds of houses, overly straining time and resources. Yet even the 400 m boundary suggested for perifocal responses would not limit transmission if responses are not immediate or the case in question has travelled outside the targeted area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007479.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In other words, control responses to outbreaks could be vastly improved by taking the extent of movement into account. Here, we explored this topic using coarse models of human populations and their movement modelled after three different urban tropical centers by investigating the relative impact of different control implementation strategies that ranged from focal to collective, area-wide approaches.
