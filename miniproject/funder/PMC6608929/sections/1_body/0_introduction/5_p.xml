<p>Understanding how different human contact structures and mixing patterns based on human movement can affect outbreak prevention and control outcomes has recently been receiving increasing attention via the use of network models. For instance, the efficacy of contact tracing has been shown to depend both on whether individuals mix assortatively or disassortatively, as well as the rate of contacts [

Likewise, for pathogens spread through close contact, such as influenza, vaccination strategies can potentially be optimized based on knowledge of the contact network in an area, such that strategies that make use of various aspects of this network can perform better than random immunization [

However, the exact role played by human movement and its impact on control strategies may vary based on the distribution and density of human populations, as well as socioeconomics or culture. For instance, commuting flows within urban centers can differ drastically between cities, based on their size and distributions of residential and work places. The resulting differences in mobility patterns can likewise affect epidemic spread [
