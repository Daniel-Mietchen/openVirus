  <title>Hierarchy of factors that influence ZIKV transmission, illness, and social consequences.</title>
  <p>Climate suitability, mosquito abundance, and humanâ€“mosquito contact partly determine rates of ZIKV transmission, which causes illness in some cases. Social consequences depend on both actual and perceived risks of illness. Arrows indicate environmental (green) and social (red) changes hypothesized to contribute to the shifting ecology of vector transmission in the Americas. Figure inspired by Plowright et al. [
