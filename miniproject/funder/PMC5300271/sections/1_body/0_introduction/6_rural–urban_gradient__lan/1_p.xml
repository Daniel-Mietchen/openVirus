 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We examined the relationship between the per capita rate of confirmed ZIKV-linked microcephaly cases, a proxy for total ZIKV cases, and the percentage of forest cover in each Brazilian state with one or more cases. We used confirmed ZIKV-linked microcephaly cases as a proxy for total cases because they are more likely to be reported than ZIKV cases in the general population (particularly asymptomatic cases), the data were available across states in Brazil, and they are expected to be strongly correlated with total ZIKV cases. We compared confirmed ZIKV-linked microcephaly cases to the percent of light forest cover (percent of hectares with &gt;10% forest cover) and dense forest cover (percent of hectares with &gt;50% forest cover). Both light and dense forest cover were negatively correlated with the prevalence of confirmed ZIKV-linked microcephaly cases (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = -0.27 and Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = -0.35, respectively;
