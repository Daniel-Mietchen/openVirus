How have intensifying environmental and social factors shaped the global ecology of vector transmission to allow ZIKV to emerge in the Americas? Here, we evaluate the evidence for a range of human-induced environmental and social changes that may have led to ZIKV emergence and the social consequences that may arise from the ZIKV epidemic.
