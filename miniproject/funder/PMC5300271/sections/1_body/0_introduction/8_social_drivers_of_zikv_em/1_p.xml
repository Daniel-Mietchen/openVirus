<p>Social changes interact with environmental changes to promote ZIKV emergence and spread. For example, a number of social changes that expose people to a high density of infected mosquitoes emerge during and after natural disasters. In Ecuador, increased local ZIKV transmission occurred following the earthquakes that struck the Manabi province in April 2016 (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Shifting public sanitation policy, vector control efforts, and human movement can exacerbate existing discrepancies in these services. These social drivers have contributed to the shifting global ecology of vector transmission that has enabled ZIKV to emerge in the Americas by dangerously uniting human host, vector, and pathogen.
