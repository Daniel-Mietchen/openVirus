<p>The establishment of autochthonous (local) ZIKV transmission usually occurs in an urban transmission cycle [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Once introduced, ZIKV can begin an urban cycle anywhere with sufficient mosquito and human populations or a sylvatic transmission cycle if it is present in wildlife-feeding mosquito populations. This intimate connection between ZIKV and the mosquito life cycle makes transmission highly sensitive to the environmental conditions that affect
