<p>Though ZIKV generally causes mild, self-limiting febrile illness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it has raised alarm for its link to GBS and microcephaly. Fetal ZIKV cases have been identified in pregnant women in 21 countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], and ZIKV-linked microcephaly has been confirmed in eight countries including Brazil (1,687 cases) and the US (15 cases) as of July 14, 2016 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] will redefine public interest in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. As WHO Director-General Margaret Chan stated, “The response [to ZIKV] now requires a unique and integrated strategy that places support for women and girls of child-bearing age at its core” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Women’s health has taken center stage in the public, the scientific community, and the press. The spread of information (and potentially misinformation) about the risks of ZIKV infection will likely affect women’s reproductive rights, tourism, and beyond.
