 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], it will become an even more effective means of spreading viruses globally. Particularly in asymptomatic cases, viruses can be easily transported globally with human hosts, supporting the hypothesis that ZIKV arrived in the Americas via human air travel.
