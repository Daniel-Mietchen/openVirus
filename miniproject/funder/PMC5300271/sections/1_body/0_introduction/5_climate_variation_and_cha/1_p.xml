 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, climate variation and/or change may have increased year-round temperatures to the optimal levels for ZIKV transmission, lengthening the transmission season in tropical and subtropical regions. For example, in 2015, Brazil’s winter and spring were among the warmest and driest on record due to a strong El Niño and possibly climate change [
