<p>These (re)emerging arboviruses are diseases of global movement and change. They share a primary mosquito vector (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) that lives alongside human settlements, oviposits in household water containers, and feeds preferentially on humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During the 16th and 17th centuries, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and yellow fever virus (YFV; family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic>), also transmitted by this vector, spread from West Africa to the Americas with the slave trade [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. DENV followed, expanding worldwide along shipping routes in the 18th and 19th centuries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and circulating throughout Southeast Asia after World War II. In Latin America, DENV declined with aggressive vector control in the 1950s–1970s but has since resurged, in part as a result of decreased prioritization of vector control efforts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and increased mosquito pesticide resistance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CHIKV and ZIKV were first isolated and described in Africa in the 1940s–1950s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], though extensive continental spread of both viruses likely occurred prior to their discovery [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Like DENV, they spread into Southeast Asia in the 1960s–1970s, then began causing major outbreaks on islands several decades later before sweeping through the Americas starting in 2013 and 2015, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This shared history of widespread circulation in Africa, emergence in Southeast Asia, and recent explosive epidemics in Pacific and Indian Ocean Islands and the Americas suggests a changing global ecology of transmission by the shared 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. vectors, with global change intensifying transmission (
