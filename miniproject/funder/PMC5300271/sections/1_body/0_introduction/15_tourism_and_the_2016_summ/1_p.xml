<p>Perceived risk of ZIKV infection poses a threat to tourism. For example, widespread public apprehension about ZIKV stirred doubts about the safety of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Historically, mass gatherings have been favorable for rapid transmission of infectious diseases [

By contrast, Burattini et al. estimated that there is only a 3.5% chance of foreign tourists being bitten by an

Travel warnings have extended to 59 countries and territories, including Latin America, Pacific Islands, Singapore, Cape Verde, and southern Florida. Perceived ZIKV risk, particularly for couples considering pregnancy, may impact tourism for the next several years.
