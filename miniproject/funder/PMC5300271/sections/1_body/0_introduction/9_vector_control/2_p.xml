<p>In 2002, Brazil instituted a National Plan for Dengue Control (PNCD) to address the recurring threat of DENV using source reduction, ultra-low volume space spraying of insecticides, and larvicide application [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], suggesting that transmission reductions from the ongoing PNCD were short-lived. Despite past success, classical vector control strategies, largely unchanged over the last 50 years, have not kept pace with the modern ecology of vector transmission. New self-limiting and self-sustaining approaches to vector control such as releasing genetically modified virus-refractory mosquitoes have been proposed [
