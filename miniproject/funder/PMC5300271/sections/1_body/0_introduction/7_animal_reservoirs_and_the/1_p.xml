 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], implies a sylvatic cycle. For ZIKV, as with other vector-borne zoonoses, urban and sylvatic cycles are likely maintained by different mosquito species, with occasional spillover by bridge vectors that feed on both animals and humans [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Human activity in areas where a sylvatic cycle is propagating can lead to human infection [
