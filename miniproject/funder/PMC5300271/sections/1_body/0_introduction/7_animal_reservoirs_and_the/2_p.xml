<p>If ZIKV emerged from an animal reservoir into human populations, then significant contact between humans and infected animals may have preceded the human epidemic. We examined published seropositive rates of ZIKV in animal species in relation to their phylogenetic relatedness and physical proximity to humans. Despite living in close proximity to humans, all livestock species studied had low prevalence of ZIKV antibodies (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). By contrast, some African primates, rodents, and birds—particularly those living in intact forest—had relatively high ZIKV seroprevalence, indicating an ongoing sylvatic cycle (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The highest risk of spillover to humans may be from coinhabiting primates, which are both phylogenetically and physically close to humans. Two such Brazilian primate species sampled between July and November 2015—capuchin monkeys and common marmosets—had high rates of ZIKV seroconversion (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While increased contact between wild animal reservoirs, sylvatic mosquitoes, and human populations as a result of land use change may have supported ZIKV emergence, the most important role of the sylvatic cycle going forward may be in maintaining a virus reservoir between human epidemics.
