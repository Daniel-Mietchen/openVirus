Across Brazilian states, higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is correlated with lower per capita rates of confirmed ZIKV-linked microcephaly cases, a proxy for ZIKV incidence (

In 2014, before ZIKV emerged in the Americas, Brazil fell into a recession and the unemployment rate jumped from 6.8% to 8.5% [
