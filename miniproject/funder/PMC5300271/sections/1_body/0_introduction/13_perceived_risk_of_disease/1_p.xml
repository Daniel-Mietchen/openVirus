<p>Perceived risk of disease likely influences people’s behavior, beliefs, and health outcomes. In St. Martin and Brazil, where CHIKV and ZIKV emerged for the first time in the Americas, respectively, the onset of symptoms is a major sign of illness and thus a major indicator of disease risk [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. ZIKV, which is highly asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], does. We examined the influence of risk perception of CHIKV and ZIKV on public interest over time using Google Trends data for “Zika” searches in Brazil and “chikungunya” searches in St. Martin. CHIKV and ZIKV share similar transmission ecology and emerged in countries with similar perceptions of disease, but differ widely in their rate of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases. As a result, we hypothesized that relative to the Google search volume in each country, searches for CHIKV in St. Martin would be consistently high, while searches for ZIKV in Brazil would be relatively low. CHIKV received more immediate attention than ZIKV, likely because it was initially perceived to pose a higher risk (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005135.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Beyond the impact of the perceived risk of ZIKV on public interest, the magnitude and intensity of public health responses to the ZIKV epidemic may also be linked to symptomatology and risk perception.
