<p>The threat of microcephaly has expanded the cultural implications of ZIKV because women at risk of ZIKV infection may wish to postpone or terminate pregnancies. Outbreaks of viruses that cause birth defects are relatively rare, but an epidemic of rubella in the US in the 1960s caused congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the babies of infected mothers. This example may be illustrative as a model for social responses to teratogenic viruses during the current ZIKV epidemic. Though abortions were strictly regulated, in a study of rubella-infected pregnant women, most chose to terminate their pregnancy [

Using rubella as a model for ZIKV, we would expect that (potentially illicit) abortion rates, including miscarriages, in the Americas could increase above typical rates during the ZIKV epidemic; however, inadequate collection of abortion data in Latin America limits the scope of this hypothesis.
