<p>Safe abortions are not readily accessible for most women in Latin America. In Brazil, the United Nations has supported efforts to increase access to abortions, but some government officials have sought to restrict it further [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005135.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], likely due to limited access to contraceptives, lack of sex education, and high rates of sexual assault [

Access to contraception and safe (legal or illegal) abortions will inevitably vary by socioeconomic status, potentially further exacerbating the differential impact of ZIKV on the urban poor. Because religious beliefs dictate most abortion policies, it is unclear if abortion policies will change in the wake of the ZIKV epidemic.
