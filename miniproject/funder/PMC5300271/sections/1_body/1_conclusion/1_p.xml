<p>A suite of concomitant environmental and social changes facilitated global ZIKV emergence by altering the global ecology of vector transmission. In this intensified transmission regime, explosive epidemics of DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV, and other arboviruses are likely to continue to emerge. We showed direct correlations between ZIKV and poverty, deforestation, and natural disasters and circumstantial support for the role of warmer-than-average temperatures, declining vector control, unreliable sanitation access, recession, political corruption, and global travel. Together, these environmental and social changes affect mosquito distribution, habitat availability, human contact, and association with arboviruses, in turn promoting the spread of vector-borne diseases like ZIKV. Further experimental and observational work to measure the effects of environmental and social changes described here (

 <italic>aegypti</italic> abundance and contact with humans, as well as epidemiological studies of risk factors for ZIKV exposure, susceptibility, and morbidity, are critical for responding to ZIKV and future arbovirus epidemics. This research will elucidate the multifactorial “perfect storm” of arbovirus emergence and resurgence, informing more proactive monitoring of existing and yet undiscovered vector-borne diseases.
