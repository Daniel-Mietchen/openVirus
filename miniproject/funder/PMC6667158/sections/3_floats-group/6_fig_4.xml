  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of G2-VP7 strains and representative RVA strains with kimura-2-parameter model in MEGA program 6.0.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>Bootstrap values &lt;60 are not shown.</bold> RVA strains sequenced in this study are represented by the red colour. Pakistani Strains reported in the previous studies are shown in blue. The vaccine strains and an out group strain are represented by purple and orange colour respectively while green shading represent strains isolated in all over the world. The RVA strains sequenced in this study and reference strains obtained from GenBank database are represented by Accession number, Strain Name, Country and year of Isolation. Scale bar: 0.05 substitutions per nucleotide.
