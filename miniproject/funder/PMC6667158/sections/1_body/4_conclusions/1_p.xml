<p>This study concludes the high prevalence of G12 and G3 RVA strains in Pakistan in 2015 and 2016 in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Although it provides an incomplete epidemiological picture of gastroenteritis caused by RVA throughout the country, the results of this study will provide comprehensive knowledge to the researchers and public health authorities to calculate the RVA disease burden in the country. The observed large diversity of RVA genotypes and their yearly fluctuations demand an intensive, large scale surveillance system in the country. This will help to monitor evolving of unusual RVA genotypes and to assess the impact of vaccine introduction on these recently emerged RVA strains in Pakistani population.</p>
