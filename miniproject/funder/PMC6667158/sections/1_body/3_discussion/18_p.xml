<p>Pakistan is one of the countries with the highest disease burden of RVA infections in children of less than five years of age. The introduction of two RVA vaccines has reduced the global mortality rate and number of hospitalizations in many countries [

The hospital based studies regarding efficacy of RVA vaccines and its effects on the country’s specific strains are yet to be determined [

However, in a recent survey conducted by Richard and his colleagues, Sindh and Baluchistan province of Pakistan bear the highest RVA burden which is estimated to be 3.1–3.3 rotavirus deaths/1000 births. The vaccine coverage in these two provinces is estimated to be lowest, particularly in children living in the poorest households conditions. Overall, RVA vaccine introduction in Pakistan could prevent 3061 deaths per year with current routine immunization program with highest coverage in capital city Islamabad that could prevent an additional 1648 deaths per year [
