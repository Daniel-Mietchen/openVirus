<p>The unusual genotypes (G1P[6], G3P[4] and G9P[6]) accounted for 25% of total RVA genotypes in this study, which is lower than previous data reported by Masab and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The unusual genotypes and mixed genotypes arise due to mixed infections that lead to the reassortment and evolution of novel genotypes. Among unusual genotypes, G3P[4] acquire attention, as it is the second time that G3 in combination with P[4] is reported in Pakistan in this study. This genotype emerged most likely after an intergenogroup re-assortment in which G2P[4] strain already circulating in population may have acquired VP7 gene from locally co-circulating G3 human RVA strains. Likewise already circulating G3P[8] and G3P[6] strains in population can be the parental strains of G3P[4] reassortant strain. Similarly OP354-like P[8] strains detected in the present study were found in combination with G1, G3 and G9. This suggests that there is a frequent ongoing reassortment phenomenon in progress.
