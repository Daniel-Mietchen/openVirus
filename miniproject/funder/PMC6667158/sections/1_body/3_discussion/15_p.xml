<p>A distinct subtype of the P[8] genotype, P[8]-4 or OP354-like P[8] has been detected in many countries of Europe, Africa and Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. According to Zeller and colleagues, South and East Asia are the main origin from where OP354-like P[8] strains migrated to Africa, Europe, and North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. In the present study, the P[8] genotype is found to be dominant (39%), and based on our phylogenetic analysis nine Pakistani strains possess an OP354- like P[8], whereas all other strains are closely related to the P[8] strains revolving in other countries of the world in most common P[8] Lineage 3. These results show two distinct P[8] lineages are co-circulating in Pakistan at the same time. Owing to antigenic differences in the VP4 spike of the OP354-like strain, it has been questioned whether or not the P[8] moiety in the vaccines would equally well protect against this divergent variant [
