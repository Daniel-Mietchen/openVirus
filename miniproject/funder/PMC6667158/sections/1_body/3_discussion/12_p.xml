<p>The dominance of G3P[8] genotype in 2014, G12P[6] genotype in 2015 and further re-emergence of G3P[8] as a dominant genotype in 2016 in Pakistan in the current study suggested that the G3 and G12 strains might be competing and excluding one another in the same vulnerable population. Moreover, the increasing implementation of RVA mass vaccination worldwide might be the reason for genotypic fluctuations and emergence of new genotypes that lead to their global spread including Pakistan.</p>
