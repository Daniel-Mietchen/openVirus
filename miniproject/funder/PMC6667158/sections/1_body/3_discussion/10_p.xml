<p>The human G9 RVA genotype has gained epidemiological significance since mid-1990s and is now acknowledged as the fifth main human RVA genotype [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. According to an WHO report in 2013, G9 is most frequently found in combination with the P[8] genotype as is less prevalent with the P[4], P[6], P[11] and P[19] genotypes [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The G9 genotype accounts for 7.4% RVA infections globally and is more commonly present in south Asia and Middle East (20.3%) and is less prevalent in Southeast Asia (5.9%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Many studies have revealed a close genetic relationship between human and Pig G9 RVA strains, suggesting that interspecies transmissions in combination with reassortment has resulted in the emergence of this genotype in humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In Asia, G9 RVA strains are the second most abundant genotype in pigs with a detection rate of 11.4% [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In the present study the G9 prevalence rate is 18% which is more than the previously reported G9 rates in Pakistan [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The G9 isolates detected in this study found in combination with P[6] and P[8] genotypes. G9P[6] was more prevalent (11.9%) than G9P[8] (4.2%). These G9 strains are showing close sequence similarity, suggesting that the frequent reassortment events have occurred. Pakistani G9 RVA strains have clustered very close to each other in lineage 3 with other strains isolated all over the world. One Pakistani G9 strain (PAK102) is showing 98.7 nucleotide identity with a porcine RVA strain found in South Africa (RVA/Pig-wt/ZAF/MRC-DPRU1540/2007/G6G9PX). This sequence was directly submitted to GenBank and was identified in a mixed infected sample [
