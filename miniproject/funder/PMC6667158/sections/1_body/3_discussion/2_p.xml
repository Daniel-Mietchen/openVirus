<p>The prevalence of RVA found in the current study was 27% which is comparable with the results of previous studies (29–34%) reported from Pakistan during 2008–2014 [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which is much lower as compared to current study. There might be several reasons for these observed prevalence differences, such as a different study design, the sampling period (throughout the year or during rotavirus peak season or epidemics), type of health facilities in target hospital, type of used diagnostic procedures, patients age criteria and patient testing criteria. The RVA prevalence in our study was lower when compared with studies reported in other countries like India, Cambodia, Thailand, Mongolia [
