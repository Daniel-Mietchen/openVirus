<p>The G3 genotype is recognized as the third most predominant RVA genotype in humans mostly found in combination with P[8] [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the present study the G3 was detected with the P[4], P[6] and P[8] genotypes. G3P[8] was found to be the dominant genotype in this study which is similar to a previous study conducted by Umair et al in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In recent years, G3P[8] has emerged as a predominant genotype in Asia, Europe and South America. These newly discovered viral strains showed high similarities with equine-like G3P[8] strains and are able to spread rapidly in the human population [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The introduction of rotavirus mass vaccination in many countries of the world might be the reason for the evolution of new variant genotypes. The emergence of G3P[8] as a dominant strain in Pakistan in 2016 was more or less coinciding with the import of new variant G3P[8] strains from other countries to Pakistan.
