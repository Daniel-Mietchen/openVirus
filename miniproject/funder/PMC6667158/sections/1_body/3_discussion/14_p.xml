<p>The RVA P[6] genotype is detected all over the world with many G genotypes (G1-G6, G8-G12, and G25) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In humans the P[6] genotype is considered to be the most prevalent genotype in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In the present study P[6] is the second most dominant (37%) P-genotype found in the Pakistani population. Comparison of RVA genotype P[6] with reference strains from BLAST search reported similarity with human as well as with one bat RVA strain from Kenya (RVA/Bat-wt/KEN/KE4852/2007/G25P[6]), although it is more likely that the bat P[6] was derived from humans, rather than the other way around [
