<p>The rotavirus molecular epidemiology varies from country to country, depending upon the socio-economic status and weather conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The most common G-genotypes affecting humans are G1, G2, G3, G4, G9 and G12 while the most common human P-genotypes are P[4], P[6] and P[8] [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The 6 main epidemiologically significant genotypes combinations prevailing around the globe are G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8] and G12P[8] [
