<p>The P[4] genotype of human RVAs is mostly identified with VP7 genotypes G2 and G8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, in the present study P[4] is found in combination with G2 and G3, and is the third most abundant genotype found in 22% of study cases. Phylogenetic analysis of the P[4] genotype revealed that all Pakistani P[4] strains fall in lineage 5 with other strains isolated from USA, India, Bangladesh, Japan, Russia, China, Canada, Ghana, Belgium, Brazil and previously identified Pakistani strains (
