<p>In the present study, no gender differences were found in RVA infections, which is in accordance with the previous reported cases from Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A large proportion (71.4%) of children with RVA gastroenteritis is in less than 1 year of age which is also in agreement with previous work from Pakistan [

A low incidence (3.5%) of RVA infection is also reported in older children (&gt;5 years) in this study, an age group in which RVA infections are only poorly appreciated worldwide. The similar trends has also been documented in previous studies reported in Pakistan, Angola, Kenya, Nepal, India, Turkey, China and Bangladesh [
