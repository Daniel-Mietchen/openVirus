<p>In Pakistan, the under-five child mortality rate is 67.6 deaths per 100000 children due to RVA diarrhea [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The data on the molecular epidemiology and genotype diversity of RVA in Pakistan is limited [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The previous studies have reported the RVA detection rate of 29–63% with G1P[8], G2P[4] and G9P[8] as the highly prevalent genotypes circulating in Pakistan during 2009–2013 [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 2014 the proportion of G3 increased dramatically, and G3P[8] became the dominant strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To reduce the childhood mortality, Pakistan began a phase RVA vaccine introduction in early 2017 in Punjab province [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In 2018 with the support of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the government of Pakistan has included RVA vaccination in the EPI schedule of each of the four provinces (Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Baluchistan) [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This means, the children who were previously excluded from the benefits of rotavirus vaccines are now included for vaccination.
