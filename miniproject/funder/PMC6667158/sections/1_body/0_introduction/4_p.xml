<p>Our study aimed to investigate the prevalence and diversity of RVA strains in two major metropolitan cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad) of Pakistan in 2015 and 2016. The results of this pre-vaccination study will provide reasonable data set for the researchers and public health authorities for comparative analysis with the post-vaccination studies in the future. That will eventually help to assess the efficacy of vaccination and the potential effect on the strain diversity and evolution due to vaccine selective pressure in Pakistan.</p>
