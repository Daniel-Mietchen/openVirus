<p>The extracted RNA template was denatured for 2 minutes at 95°C followed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using the One-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen/Westburg, The Nederlands). RT-PCR was carried out for both VP7 and VP4 gene fragments using consensus primers Beg9 and End9 [

The RT-PCR was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step of 30 min at 50°C followed by polymerase activation at 95°C for 15 min, 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation: 45s at 94°C; annealing: 45s at 45°C for VP4 and 45s at 50°C for VP7; product extension for 1 min at 72°C), followed by a final extension of 10 minutes at 72°C in a Biometra T3000 thermocycler (Biometra, Westburg). PCR products were run on a polyacrylamide gel along with a 50-bp DNA ladder (Sigma Aldrich), stained with EtBr (Sigma Aldrich) and visualized under UV-light. The sample preparation, amplification and end point analysis were kept physically separated. All steps of experiment i.e Extraction, PCR were done in a bio-safety cabinets. All the PCR runs included positive control, negative control and non-target control (reagent blank) to avoid false positive results. A rotavirus positive sample (Genotype G1P[8] was used as a positive control. Quality control sample were run in each batch to check the instrumental stability (
