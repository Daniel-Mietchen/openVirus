<p>The following two hospitals have been selected to be the sites for the current study. Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) is the major tertiary care hospital of the capital city Islamabad with 9000 cases in outpatient department (OPD) per day and more than 200 hospitalizations each day. The hospital provides health care to more than 10 million individuals from urban, peri-urban and rural settings of the country, and is a referral hospital for patients from all over Pakistan. Similarly, another tertiary care setup in Rawalpindi is the General Hospital (now called Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH). It has up to 2500 patient visits in OPDs per day. It is a public-sector hospital with a dedicated paediatric unit including a diarrhea ward. These are major metropolitan cities in the country with a large population size (4.5 million). Hence, the results obtained will probably reflect a large section of the countryâ€™s population.</p>
