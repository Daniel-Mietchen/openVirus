<p>RVA was detected in 171 samples via ELISA out of the collected 639 diarrheal samples from children less than ten years of age presenting with AGE with an overall positivity rate of 26.8% (25.4% in 2015 and 29.3% in 2016). The RVA prevalence detected in BBH, Rawalpindi was 27.4% (96/350) and in PIMS, Islamabad was 26.0% (75/289). RT-PCR conducted on all ELISA positive samples showed that 83.6% (143/171) of these samples were positive by RT-PCR. There was no statistically significant gender difference in the distribution of RVA genotypes (

However, the highest prevalence was observed in children of 6–11 months of age followed by children of 12–23 months of age, while the lowest number of positive cases were observed in children older than 60 months. There was no significant difference found between anthropomorphic and clinical features (weight, height, temperature, diarrhea duration and episodes, vomiting duration and episodes and dehydration) and RVA infections (
