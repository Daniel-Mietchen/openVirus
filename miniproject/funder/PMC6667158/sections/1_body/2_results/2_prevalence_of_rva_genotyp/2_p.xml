<p>Annual genotypic distribution of RVA strains in 2015 to 2016 is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The most common G/P combination in 2015 was G12P[6] followed by G2P[4], G9P[6] and G3P[8]. The frequency of RVA genotypes due to G3P[8] caused by decrease in G12P[6] from 24% to 14.8% in 2016. (
