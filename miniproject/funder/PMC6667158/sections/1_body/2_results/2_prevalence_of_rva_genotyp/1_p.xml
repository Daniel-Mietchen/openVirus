<p>From the 171 RVA antigen-positive samples, 143(83.6%) were confirmed positive by RT-PCR and the remaining 16.4% were RT-PCR negative. All 143 RT-PCR positive samples were successfully genotyped for VP7 and 140 samples were genotyped for VP4. The most common G type was G3 followed by G12, G9, G2 and G1. A single mixed G-type (G1G3) was detected in one sample (0.7%). The most common P-type was P[8] followed by P[6], P[4] and P[Non-typeable]. The most prevalent genotype combination was G3P[8] followed by G12P[6], G2P[4], G1P[8], G9P[6] and G3P[4], whereas the least prevalent genotypes were G9P[8], G3P[6], G1G3P[8], and G9P[NT] (
