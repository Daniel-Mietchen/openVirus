 <bold>P[8]:</bold> A total of 52 Pakistani P[8] Strains sequenced in this study and representative members of P[8] genotype were selected for the construction of P[8] phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Most of the circulating strain (n = 43) fell into P[8] lineage 3. One subcluster of 39 Pakistani P[8] strains showed 97.1–100% nt similarity with each other and clustered with strains detected in Brazil (QUI-108-F1), Argentina (Res1717), Belgium (BE00061), Canada (RT038-09), Hungry (ERN5613), USA(VU12-13-162), Russia (NN-2932-14) and previously detected P[8] strains from Pakistan (NIH-BBH-4195 and PAK3099) [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another lineage 3 subcluster (97.1–100% nt similarity) contained four Pakistani P[8] strains (PAK623, PAK340, PAK317 and PAK435) as well as strains detected in Belgium (B3458 and B4463), Bangladesh (Dhaka16/2003) and Australia (CK0006). Interestingly another cluster of nine Pakistani P[8] strains (PAK65, PAK593, PAK56, PAK24, PAK439, PAK 622PAK624, PAK274) clustered closely with the divergent OP354-like lineage (lineage 4) strains together with strains detected in Russia (Nov09-D386), India (NIV-07523), Korea (CAU09-383) and one previously detected strain from Pakistan (NIBGE-59) during 2010.
