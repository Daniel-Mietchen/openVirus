 <bold>P[4]:</bold> A total of 28 P[4] strains sequenced in this study and representative members of P[4] genotype were selected for the construction of VP[4] phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g008">Fig 8</xref>), showing that all Pakistani strains belonged to VP4-lineage 5. A clusters of 17 P[4] strains was closely related (99–100% nucleotide similarity) with two Pakistani strains (NIH-BBH-4088, NIH-BBH-4077) isolated in previous studies in 2014 and with another strains circulating in the USA in 2010 (LB-1562). One cluster of four Pakistani Strains (PAK2, PAK156, PAK335, and PAK653) showed close nucleotide identity (99.8–100%) with each other and other strains detected in Australia (CK20051) and Ghana (GHPML1989). Another clusters of six P[4] strains (PAK577, PAK647, PAK502, PAK38, PAK268 and PAK604) showed 99.4–100% nucleotide similarity with each other and form a cluster with P[4] strain detected in India (Kol-040 
 <italic>and Kol-041) and Russia (NN464-16/)</italic>. Finally, a single strain PAK613 formed a separate cluster, most closely related (97.3–97.5% nt similarity) with strains circulating in India, Russia, USA, China, Japan and Brazil and other Pakistani strains isolated in this study. All P4 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
