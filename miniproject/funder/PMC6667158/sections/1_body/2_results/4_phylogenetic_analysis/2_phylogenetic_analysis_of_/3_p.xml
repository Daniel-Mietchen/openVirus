 <bold>P[6]:</bold> A total of 50 Pakistani P[6] strains sequenced in this study and representative members of the P[6] genotype were selected for the construction of P[6] phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g009">Fig 9</xref>). One cluster of 40 PAK P[6] strains showing (98.2–99.8%) nucleotide similarity with five Pakistani strains (NIH-BBH-4283, NIH-BBH-4107, NIH-KGH-5082 and PAK3094) detected in previous studies and with other strains isolated in Thailand (CMHN49-12), Russia (O1299), Japan(sewage_3) and Korea(CAU_214). Similarly one more clusters of ten PAK P[6] strains (PAK7, PAK13, PAK9, PAK3, PAK4, PAK1, PAK46, PAK203, PAK71 and PAK34) are similar to each other at (98.5–100%) nucleotide similarity level and on phylogenetic analysis making cluster with other strains circulating in Brazil (4A1136), South Africa (ZAF/MRC-DPRU9164 and ZAF/MRC-DPRU421), Bangladesh (Matlab13, RV176 and Dhaka12/2003), Australia (RV3) and one Pakistani strain (HF32) detected in previous hospital based study in 2013. Of note, a single P[6] bat rotavirus strain Bat/4852 detected in Kenya in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], was also found in this P[6] cluster. All P6 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
