 <bold>G1:</bold> The G1-VP7 tree was constructed based on 20 Pakistani G1 strains sequenced in this study and representative members of the G1 genotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Ten Pakistani strains (PAK24, PAK41, PAK62, PAK65, PAK77, PAK86, PAK231, PAK439, PAK440 and PAK610) are closely related to each other and cluster in lineage 2. This lineage also contained G1 strains detected in Australia (CK00084), Russia (Omsk08-423) and India (0613158-CA), as well as with three Pakistani strains (NIH-BBH-3988, PAK2883 and PAK93) detected in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with a very high nucleotide similarities (98.1–99.5%). Another subcluster in lineage 2 contained Pakistani strains PAK59, PAK90 and PAK435, closely related to strains identified from the South Africa (MRC/DPRU-1269), Belgium (BE00042) and the Philippines (TGE12-045) (nucleotide similarity of 98.1–99.5%), distinct from the Rotarix vaccine strains (Rotarix-A41CB052A and Rotarix_SSCRTV_00092) [

The VP7 gene of 7 other Pakistani G1 strains (PAK317, PAK36, PAK340, PAK540, PAK88, PAK601 and PAK 623) clustered together with strains reported in India (Niv-06361), Bangladesh (Dhaka16/2003), Mali (Mali-137), Bhutan (BTN-126), and Belgium (BE00015) with a nucleotide similarity of 98.1–99.5%, into lineage 1 [
