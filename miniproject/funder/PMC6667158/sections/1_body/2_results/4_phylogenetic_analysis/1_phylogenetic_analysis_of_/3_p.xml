 <bold>G2:</bold> The G2 tree was constructed using the nucleotide sequences of 15 Pakistani G2 strains sequenced in this study and representative members of the G2 genotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g004">Fig 4</xref>). All Pakistani strain fell into lineage 4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Ten strains (PAK6, PAK12, PAK43, PAK49, PAK70, PAK147, PAK167, PAK205, PAK347and PAK350) were closely related to Pakistani strains NIH-BBH-3975 and PAK3085 detected in previous studies conducted in Pakistan during 2010 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with high nucleotide similarities (98.4–99.2%). Furthermore, the clustered closely to G2 strains from Korea (Seoul1602), Russia (Nov12-N5000), Taiwan (07-96s-498), Thailand (CMH070), and Belgium (BE-34). On the other hand 5 Pakistani strains (PAK2, PAK268, PAK335, PAK653 and PAK 577) were closely related to strains from Indian (RV/1122) and the, Philippines (TG012-007) with a nucleotide identity of 97.3–99.8%. All G2 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
