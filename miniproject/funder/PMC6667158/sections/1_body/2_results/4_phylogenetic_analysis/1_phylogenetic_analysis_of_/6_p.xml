 <bold>G12:</bold> A total 30 Pakistani G12 strains sequenced in this study and representative members of the RVA G12 genotype were included in the construction of VP7-G12 phylogenetic tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g007">Fig 7</xref>). All Pakistani G12 strains belong to lineage 3 and are closely related to each other with 99â€“100% nucleotide similarity, clustering with other strains isolated in Bangkok (CU-B1373), Ethiopia (MRC-DPRU5002), Belgium (B4633), Italy (PA539), Bangladesh (Dhaka/12/2003), Thailand (T152), Philippine (L26) and with two Pakistani strains (PAK2880, NIBGE-15) isolated in previous studies during the years 2010 and 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g008">Fig 8</xref>). All G12 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
