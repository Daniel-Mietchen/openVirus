 <bold>G9:</bold> A total of 24 Pakistani G9 strains sequenced in this study and representative members of the G9 genotype were selected for the phylogenetic analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g006">Fig 6</xref>). All Pakistani strain fell into G9 lineage 3. Twenty-tree of these G9 strains showed a high nucleotide identity (99â€“100%) with other strains detected in Pakistan (PAK100, NIBGE-42 and NIH-BBH-4433) in 2010 and 2014 [

 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], as well as with other strains circulating in Turkey (28GENTEP), Russia (omsk08-381, Nov5-114), Egypt (AS997), and Korea (CAU09-371 and CAU10-84). On the other hand PAK102 showed 98.7% nucleotide similarity with the South African pig rotavirus strains MRC-DPRU1540 and human RVA strains from India (Kol-105-10), Africa (ZAF/MRC-DPRU2343), Bhutan (BTN-22) and Bangladesh (Bang-062). All G9 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (USA/Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
