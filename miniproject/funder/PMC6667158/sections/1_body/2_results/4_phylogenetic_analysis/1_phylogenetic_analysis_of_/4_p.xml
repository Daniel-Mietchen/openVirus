 <bold>G3</bold>: A total of 17 Pakistani G3 strains sequenced in this study and representative members of G3 strains were selected for phylogenetic analyses of the G3 genotype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0220387.g005">Fig 5</xref>). All Pakistani G3 strains, including NIH-BBH-4257, previously isolated in Pakistan in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0220387.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], clustered closely together (99â€“100% nucleotide similarity) with each other and strains detected in Taiwan (105-701-D042), Russia (Nov11-N2510), Brazil (RS16838) and Argentina (Arg6795). All G3 strains i.e reference strains and strains isolated in this study included in the tree diverge considerably from USA G1 strain (Wa/1974/G1P[8]) used as an outgroup.
