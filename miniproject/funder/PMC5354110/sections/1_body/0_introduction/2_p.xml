<p>There are no vaccines or specific therapies against ZIKV; therefore, the current approaches to alleviate disease burden are limited to personal protection and mosquito control (
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr">Wong, Poon &amp; Wong, 2016</xref>). These approaches require that the correct vectors are identified and targeted (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Pates &amp; Curtis, 2005</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> have been implicated as competent vectors of ZIKV (

 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Grard et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Aliota et al., 2016a</xref>), but there may be other mosquito species that contribute to the transmission cycle. ZIKV has been identified from over 25 species of mosquitoes, including field-collected 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Diallo et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Althouse et al., 2015</xref>). To address this knowledge gap, we evaluated the ability for 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> to become infected with and transmit ZIKV after feeding on a viremic blood meal.
