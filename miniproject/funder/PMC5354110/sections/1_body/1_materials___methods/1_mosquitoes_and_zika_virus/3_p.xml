<p>Two ZIKV strains were used in our experiments. The ZIKV strain MR766 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Diamond) is the original-type strain of the virus and was isolated from an infected rhesus macaque in 1947 in Uganda, Africa. The ZIKV strain PRVABC59 was isolated from infected human serum in Puerto Rico in 2015 (provided by BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA). Both viruses were passed in Vero cells two (MR766) or three times (PRVABC59), and the supernatant stored in aliquots at −70 °C until used for mosquito infections.</p>
