<p>Single use ZIKV aliquots were thawed briefly at 37 °C and were added to whole human blood (Biological Specialty Corporation, Colmar, PA, USA) 1:1 (final blood meal titers are in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>). For biological relevance, we chose ZIKV blood meal titers similar to those reported in humans (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Aliota et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Aubry et al., 2016</xref>). We also chose a high titer to test whether titer could be a barrier to competence for some mosquito species. Adult female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV-infected blood 3–5 days post-emergence via a glass feeder jacketed with 37 °C distilled water. Mosquitoes were allowed to feed for approximately 1 h, then partially- and non-bloodfed females were discarded. An aliquot of each blood meal was archived for ZIKV titer verification by plaque assay on Vero cells (ATCC) as described below.
