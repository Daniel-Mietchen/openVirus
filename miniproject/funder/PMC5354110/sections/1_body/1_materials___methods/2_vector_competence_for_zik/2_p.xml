<p>ZIKV infection, dissemination and transmission was assessed at five, seven, and 14 days post-blood feeding (

 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> due to lower numbers of fully-bloodfed females obtained for this species. Female mosquitoes were anesthetized with triethylamine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), legs from each mosquito were removed and placed separately in a 2-mL tube filled with 1 mL mosquito diluent (MD: 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, 50 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 50 ug/mL gentamicin, and 2.5 µg/mL fungizone) with a single zinc-plated, steel, 4.5 mm BB (Daisy, Rogers, AR, USA). The proboscis of each mosquito was positioned in a tapered capillary tube containing approximately 10 µL of a 1:1 solution of 50% sucrose and FBS to induce salivation. After 30 min, the contents were expelled into 0.3 mL MD, and bodies were placed individually into a 2-mL tube filled with 1 mL MD and a single zinc-plated, steel 4.5 mm BB. Mosquito body, legs, and salivary secretion samples were stored at −70 °C until tested for ZIKV presence. Mosquito bodies and legs were thawed briefly at 37 °C, homogenized for 30 s with TissueLyser (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) at 24 cycles/s, followed by centrifugation for 1 min. Mosquito samples were tested for ZIKV infectious particles by plaque assay on Vero cells. For the duration of the plaque assay, mosquito samples were stored on ice or at 4 °C to prevent any possible loss of viral infectivity. All mosquito experiments with infectious ZIKV were completed in the Eva J. Pell ABSL3 Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University according to established biosafety protocols.
