<p>We tested for ZIKV infectious particles in blood meals and mosquito samples by using Vero plaque assays (
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Payne et al., 2006</xref>). Vero cells were grown to a confluent monolayer in 6-well plates at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Complete media (1X Dulbecco’s modified-essential media, 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum) was removed and monolayers were inoculated with 100 µl of each sample. Plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h and were rocked every 30 min to prevent cells from desiccating. After adsorption, monolayers were overlaid with equal amounts of complete media and 1.2% agarose, and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for three days. After the incubation period, a secondary overlay was applied that consisted of equal amounts of complete media and 1.2% agarose, as well as 1.5% neutral red solution. Plates were incubated again at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 day. Then, plates were placed on a white light transilluminator (Hall Productions, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA), each well was assessed by eye as positive or negative for infectious ZIKV particles, and plaques were counted if applicable. Positive and negative controls were included with every assay to confirm that the assay worked as expected and to ensure cell viability (positive: diluted ZIKV-infected blood meal and diluted ZIKV stocks; negative: complete cell culture media and MD).
