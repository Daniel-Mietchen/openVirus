<p>In conclusion, our data emphasize the importance of exploring the vector competence of diverse mosquito species for emerging pathogens. Our results suggest that 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> are unable to become infected with ZIKV, even at high titers. We also suggest that studies examining vector competence of mosquitoes for ZIKV and other viral pathogens be performed using infectious virus plaque assays, and that the use of PCR-based detection methods be avoided.
