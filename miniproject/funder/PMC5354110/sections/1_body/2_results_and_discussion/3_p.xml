 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes most notably transmit malaria parasites, but could also be responsible for epidemics of O’Nyong-nyong virus (

 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> were refractory to ZIKV infection even at a high titer (&gt;7 logs). Isolation of ZIKV from whole field mosquitoes is insufficient to prove that the mosquito is competent to transmit the virus to a new host. Field mosquitoes may be positive for ZIKV simply because of an infectious, undigested blood meal. Isolation of infectious particles from the tissues as legs, wings or head and from the saliva is necessary to show that the mosquito has the ability to replicate/disseminate and transmit the virus, respectively.
