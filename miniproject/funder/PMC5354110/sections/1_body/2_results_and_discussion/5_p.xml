<p>Although our results suggest that 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> do not contribute to ZIKV transmission to humans, we cannot rule out that there are other members of those genera that could serve as vectors. Future studies should continue to explore novel vectors for ZIKV, especially given that species other than 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> have been implicated in the spread of arthropod-borne viruses into novel environments (
