<p>After quarantine, camels may be transported to markets or slaughterhouses throughout Egypt. Those movements within Egypt would contribute the spread of RVFV in the event of introduction of the virus, as evidenced in other countries [

The EVS characterized the network of animal markets by collecting information on the location, but also on several characteristics of 273 animal markets distributed throughout Egypt. That combined with the slaughterhouse data allows having a basic picture of the animal movement patterns within the country, which offers an alternative approach in countries without the resources to have a comprehensive recording of animal movements. That information is very useful for planning risk-based surveillance strategies (i.e. target those markets where detection of a particular disease is more likely), with the advantage the criteria may be adapted to each specific disease. The collection of more comprehensive information on for example the number of animals by species or the origins and destinations of the animals that went across those markets, would allow a much clearer picture of the animal movement network, and is therefore recommended The animal market network in Egypt is mainly composed of small markets, which basically operate once a week. Interestingly, almost 40% of the markets traded animals from different governorates, which means that infectious diseases are likely to spread efficiently once introduced into the country. In relation to the species, 2% of markets traded exclusively camels, and a 17% further traded camels plus other species susceptible to RVFV. Most of the markets are located in the areas beside the Nile river and its delta, but there are also animal markets alongside the Mediterranean coast, or even in the Sahara desert (Farafra market). Of the 273 markets, only 17 were in the governorates bordering Sudan, where smuggling of small ruminants was considered more likely. The risk-ranking score for markets varied between 5 and 15, with a mean value of 7.9. The markets with the highest risk of RVFV transmission were in the proximities or within the main cities (e.g. Cairo, Minya or Aswan), while most of the camel slaughterhouses were near Cairo. That proximity to urban areas results in an increased risk of RVFV transmission to humans (zoonotic risk). In contrast to camels, all cattle imported into Egypt are slaughtered within the quarantines to which they arrive, which are located in remote areas, far from populated areas.
