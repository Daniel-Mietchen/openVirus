<p>Even though we focused on the risk posed by the legal trade of animals, other mechanisms for RVFV introduction into Egypt are also possible. Illegal trade of animals through the borders is likely to occur, but its relevance in relation to the risk of RVFV introduction is difficult to assess, and would require further studies. On the other hand, the possibility of RVFV spread (potentially to distant areas) through the movement of infected (viraemic) humans and subsequent infection of competent vectors remains controversial. While for some authors humans infected by RVFV may develop a viremia sufficient to infect na√Øve mosquitoes [
