<p>The evaluation of the seasonality of 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> indicated that in general there was not much variation in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability between the different months. Therefore the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the suitable areas of Egypt seem to be more or less constant throughout the year. However, results also indicate that in some specific locations there may be significant variations in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> density. Zayed and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that in the areas where the seasonal flooding of the Nile Delta occurred, the population of vectors changed significantly, mainly in late summer-early fall.
