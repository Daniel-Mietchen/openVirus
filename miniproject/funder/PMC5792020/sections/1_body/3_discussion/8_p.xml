<p>On the other hand, to prevent the transmission of RVFV within Egypt, all the animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year. However, the analysis of the vaccination data evidences a great heterogeneity in the level of vaccine coverage among species and governorates. Despite the increase in the number of vaccine doses administered in 2015 as compared to 2014, the level of vaccine coverage (30% in sheep and goats, 35% in buffaloes and 60% in cattle) would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country, in particular in those governorates where the level of vaccination is below average. Differences in the density of susceptible species throughout the country combined with the heterogenous application of vaccination programs among areas and species results in the identification of some areas of high density of susceptible hosts of RVFV, which is where efforts should be focused. Failures in the local application of vaccination programs were identified as one of the causes of previous epidemics of RVFV in Egypt [

There were also areas where high levels of vaccine coverage were reached resulting in a significant reduction of the risk of RVFV transmission. Conclusions in relation to vaccine coverages should be taken with caution, as the censuses used for their calculation may not be totally accurate/updated.
