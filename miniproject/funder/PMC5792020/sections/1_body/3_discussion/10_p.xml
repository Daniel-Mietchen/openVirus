<p>The map of RVFV transmission by vectors in Egypt evidences that the majority of the country surface has a risk of zero, as it corresponds to bare soil land cover (i.e. desert), which is not suitable for the presence of neither hosts nor vectors. Therefore, RVFV transmission by vectors is basically restricted to the wet areas surrounding the Nile River and its delta. Within that area there is a great variability on the risk depending on the density of vectors and hosts. Transmission via mosquitos is considered the most important mode of transmission during the enzootic cycle [
