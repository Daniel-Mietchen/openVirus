<p>During the first RVF epidemic in Egypt in 1977, mortality and abortions were reported in camels in Aswan governorate (in the south of the country), and RVFV was isolated from this species [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, even though the source of the outbreak could not be determined, the possibility of introduction of the disease from Sudan by camels was considered the most likely explanation. In the following epidemics (1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003), importation of camels, mainly from Sudan, was also considered as a possible source of introduction, although no proper epidemiological investigations were carried out, and alternative mechanisms were considered [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a result, the role of camels in the epidemiology of RVFV remains unclear. In fact, it has been suggested that camels may be essential for RVFV transmission in some ecosystems where their density is high, which would allow viral amplification and transmission to alternative hosts, but not in others [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, data on factors such as duration of viraemia, infectiousness to mosquitos, or the risk of infection of humans from contaminated products remain unknown, and further studies on camels would be required. Despite those uncertainties, camels are considered susceptible to RVFV, and the virus has been isolated from blood from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While RVFV infections in camels are usually mild or asymptomatic, abortion waves were observed in RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt [

In the 2010 epidemic in Mauritania, clinical signs other than abortions were observed in camels, either a peracute form with sudden death within 24 hours; or an acute form with fever and systemic lesions, that resulted in death when haemorrhagic signs occurred [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RVFV infections in camels have been recorded in most sub-Saharan African countries, with prevalences ranging from 3.0 to 51.9 percent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, RVF is thought to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with large epidemics occurring after heavy rainfall and flooding [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses carried out in Sudan with RVFV strains from the 2007 and 2010 epidemics, indicated that they were the result of multiple introductions from eastern Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since then, there were evidences of circulation of RVFV during the inter-epidemic period: in 2014â€“2015, 9.6% of camels in Khartoum State (Sudan) had RVFV antibodies, including at least one positive born after the last reported epidemic [
