<p>The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the surroundings of the five quarantines available in Egypt was estimated to be quite low except in the case of Al Qata (where some of the camels imported from Ethiopia arrive). There is no data on the duration of viraemia in camels, but as camels imported from Sudan stay in the quarantine for only 3 days, it seems possible that they may remain infectious after being released from the quarantine, even if RVFV transmission by vectors within the quarantine was not possible. On the other hand, RVFV transmission within those quarantines may also occur by direct contact with tissues, body fluids or fomites of infected animals.</p>
