<p>Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus which belongs to the 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic> genus, within the family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>). It is the causative agent of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that may affect both humans and animals, mainly ruminants, but also camels. In livestock RVF causes large number of abortions (abortion storms) and high mortalities in young animals. In humans, RVFV infection generally causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness, although in some cases disease progresses to more severe forms, with neurological disorders, blindness, hemorrhagic fever or thrombosis [

 <italic>Culex</italic> or 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genera) or through direct contact with infected animal tissues or fluids [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Infection via mosquito bites is considered the primary mode of transmission in the first stages of the epidemic, while contact with contaminated material is more relevant during the amplification stage. RVFV within infected tissues is quite resistant to inactivation and may remain infectious for a few days [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, the majority of human cases are likely to occur in farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse employees due to contact with infected material [
