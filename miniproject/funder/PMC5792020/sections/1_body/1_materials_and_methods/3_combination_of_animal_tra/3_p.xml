<p>Studies on the dispersal of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> in urban habitats found maximum flight ranges of 1.98 km [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 2.48 km [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, given the low probability of recapturing a marked mosquito at large distances from the point of release, we used a conservative radius of up to 5km for the buffer area. We also assessed the effect of changing the size of the radius on the risk of RVF transmission.
