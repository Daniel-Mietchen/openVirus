  <p>Animal species traded: Camels was considered the key species in relation to the risk of RVFV introduction. In addition, the simultaneous presence of camels with animals of other species susceptible to RVFV (i.e. cattle, sheep and goats), which potentially had different origins, was also considered a risk factor. Therefore, a score of 4 was given to markets with camels plus other susceptible species, 3 to markets exclusively for camels, 2 to markets with 2 or more susceptible species (excluding camels) and 1 to markets with just one species susceptible to RVFV.</p>
