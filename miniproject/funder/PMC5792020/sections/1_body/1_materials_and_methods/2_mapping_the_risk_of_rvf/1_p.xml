<p>The spatial risk of RVFV transmission within Egypt was estimated using a GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which allows to combine the (spatial) data on the different factors that may influence the risk of a given disease. In the case of RVF it is essential to account for the distribution of both the susceptible hosts and the vectors of RVFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All layers were transformed into a raster format, with 1 km Ã— 1 km spatial resolution and the common UTM 35N projection. R software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was used for both the analyses and generation of maps.
