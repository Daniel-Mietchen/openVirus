 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> has been traditionally considered the main vector of RVFV in Egypt [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and recent entomological studies seem to confirm that [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In fact the competence of Egyptian 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> for RVFV transmission was demonstrated experimentally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other species potentially involved in RVFV transmission is 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>antennatus</italic>, considered by Gad and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as an important secondary vector of RVFV in Egypt. 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>antennatus</italic> is found in every governorate of Egypt, and their primary breeding include flooded areas, rice fields and irrigation channels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
