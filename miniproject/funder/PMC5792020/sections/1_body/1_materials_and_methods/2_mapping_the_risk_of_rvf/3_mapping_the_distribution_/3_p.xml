<p>Given that estimates by Tran and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were based on Corine land-cover categories, which are not available for Egypt, the corresponding categories from FAO-GeoNetwork land cover were extrapolated from the South of Europe, and used to map the distribution areas of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> in Egypt. If a FAO-GeoNetwork land cover category corresponded to a single Corine land cover category, its value for the presence of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> was that of Corine land cover category (0 or 1). If a FAO-GeoNetwork land cover category corresponded to more than one Corine land cover category, its value for the presence of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> was the mean value for the corresponding Corine land cover categories.
