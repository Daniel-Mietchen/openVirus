<p>We mapped 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> presence in Egypt based on the expected suitability of the land cover categories for the presence of this vector (values of 1 for presence and 0 for absence) estimated on the basis of a literature review and the opinion of experts [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given that the same data was not available for 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>antennatus</italic>, we used the distribution 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> to represent the distribution of vectors competent for RVFV transmission. Even though other species may also be involved in RVFV transmission, in particular 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>antennatus</italic>, which was the most abundant species in Kafr el Sheikh governorate in the 2003 epidemic, its primary breeding areas coincide with those of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic>, and therefore would be included in the vector distribution map [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
