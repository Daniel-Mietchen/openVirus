<p>Besides, in a recent study modelling the distribution of

 <italic>pipiens</italic> in arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa, Conley and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] evidenced that human population density and seasonality of vegetation indexes were powerful predictors of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> occurrence in those areas. In particular, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> occurrence evidenced a strong negative association with the standard deviation (SD) of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), that is, with the variation (seasonality) of the EVI. This suggests that 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> habitat consists mainly of areas of high primary productivity, maintained with very little change throughout the year [

 <italic>pipiens</italic> presence in Egypt. On the other hand, data on human population was obtained from the Gridded Population of the World version 4 [
