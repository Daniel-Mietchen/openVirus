<p>The map of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> presence based on land cover, the map of human population and the maps of SD of the EVI (monthly values and also average for the whole year) were all standardized and combined to produce the map of the overall vector suitability (either monthly values or average for the whole year). Combination of layers was carried out with the criteria that when

 <italic>pipiens</italic> presence based on land cover was 0, the overall vector suitability was also 0 (regardless of the values of human population and SD of the EVI).
