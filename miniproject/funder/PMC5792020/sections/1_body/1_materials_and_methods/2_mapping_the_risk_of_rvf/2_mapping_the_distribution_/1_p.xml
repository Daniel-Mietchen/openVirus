<p>Cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels were considered as the species susceptible for RVFV. Cattle, sheep and goats density maps were obtained from the FAO-Gridded Livestock of the World modelled data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For buffaloes and camels, as density raster maps were not available, the data on the number of animals by governorate was obtained from OIE-WAHID, densities were calculated and maps were rasterized. Density maps for the different species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g001">Fig 1</xref>-upper row. All animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year (MALRE personal communication). Data on the number of vaccine doses administered the first and second semesters of 2014 and 2015 by animal species and governorates were provided by the ED-MALRE. For the year 2015, the vaccine coverage (i.e. the proportion of animals correctly vaccinated, that is, that received two vaccine doses) by species and governorates were calculated taking into account the censuses by species for the different governorates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g001">Fig 1</xref>-middle row). By multiplying the animal density data layer by the vaccine coverage layer, we obtained a layer of the density of susceptible animals by species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g001">Fig 1</xref>-lower row). Then, the weights for the relative susceptibility of the different host species (see below the determination of weights) were applied, and the results combined to produce a map to represent the density of all susceptible hosts. Finally, that map was standardized, i.e. put in a continuous scale from 0, equivalent to the minimum value (density), to 1, equivalent to the maximum value (density). Standardization allows the combination of layers with different characteristics/units to produce the final risk maps.
