<p>The weights of the different factors that influence the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors were determined by means of the paired comparison method developed by Saaty [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The relative importance of each of the 
 <italic>n</italic> factors relative to every other factor was evaluated using a 9-point reciprocal scale, in which 1 represents equal importance and 9 extreme importance, while 1/9 would represent of extremely low importance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. That results in a 
 <italic>n</italic> x 
 <italic>n</italic> matrix of pairwise comparisons, and the dominant eigenvector of that matrix corresponds to the vector of relative weights for the 
 <italic>n</italic> factors.
