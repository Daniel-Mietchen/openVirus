<p>In order to evaluate the effect of a change in the weights applied to each of the risk factors on the risk of RVFV transmission, a sensitivity analysis was carried out [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For each of the factors, its weight was increased and then decreased by a certain proportion (+/-10%, +/- 20% and +/-30%), while the weights for the other factors were proportionally increased or decreased (so that the sum of weights added to 1), and the values of the risk of RVFV transmission as a consequence of those changes were measured at 10,000 random locations. Then, a linear regression model was fitted to the data, and the contribution of each factor to the variation of the risk of RVFV transmission was calculated as the ratio of the sum of squares related to that factor on the total sum of squares of the model.
