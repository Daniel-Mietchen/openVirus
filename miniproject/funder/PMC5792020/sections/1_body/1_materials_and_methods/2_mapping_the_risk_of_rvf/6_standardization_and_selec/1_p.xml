<p>As in Stevens and collaborators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the risk was assumed to be proportional to the density of animals up to a certain level, above which risk was assumed to remain constant. That assumption avoids the underestimation of all the remaining values of density. Therefore, the relationship between density and risk was described with a monotonically increasing membership function shape, and a linear membership function type. The upper density limit was set at the percentile 99 of the density. The same type of relationship was established between human population density and suitability of vectors.
