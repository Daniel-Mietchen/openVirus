<p>In order to evaluate the seasonal variability in the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic>, monthly vector distribution maps were created using the monthly estimates of the SD of the EVI for the year 2015. Then, 10,000 random sampling points were generated, and the estimates of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> distribution for the different months, as well as the average value for the year, were obtained. As in Egypt for most of the country the probability of vector presence will be zero (desert areas), for most of the 10,000 random points the value would be zero, and that will compromise the probability of detecting a seasonal changes of the risk in the areas where risk is not zero. To avoid that, the areas of very low probability of vector presence (lower than 0.02) were excluded for the selection of the random points. Besides the 10,000 random points selected, the seasonal variability in the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> was also evaluated in the areas around (buffer of 5 kilometers) the quarantine premises, the main markets (the 51 riskiest markets) and the camel slaughterhouses, i.e. the specific locations where the risk of RVFV introduction and further transmission is expected to be highest.
