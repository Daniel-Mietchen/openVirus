<p>As the density of animals and the level of vaccine coverage vary among species and areas, their combination results in a heterogeneous density of susceptible animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Cattle has the highest density, but also the highest vaccine coverage, so other species, for example sheep and goats in Sohag, or goats and buffaloes in Asyut, contribute more to the risk of RVFV transmission.
