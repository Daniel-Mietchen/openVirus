<p>Sheep and goats are traditionally considered more susceptible for RVFV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and therefore those species were assigned a value of 3 (i.e. moderate importance) in relation to the other species. The weights for the relative susceptibility of the different host species, determined by the paired comparison method developed by Saaty [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] were 0.32 for sheep and goats and 0.12 for cattle, buffaloes and camels. The standardized distribution of susceptible hosts of RVFV (all species) shows a pattern which is mainly coincident with the areas surrounding the Nile river, although there are some significant variations in density (
