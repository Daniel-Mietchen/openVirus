<p>The linear regression model indicates that the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was mainly explained by the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> (
 <italic>β</italic> coefficient = 0.42; 
 <italic>p-value</italic>&lt;0.001) and to a lesser extent by the density of susceptible goats (
 <italic>β</italic> coefficient = 0.14; 
 <italic>p-value</italic>&lt;0.001). The remaining host species (cattle, sheep, buffaloes and camels) were not significantly associated with the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors.
