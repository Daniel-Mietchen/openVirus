<p>The location of RVFV-positive cases in humans and animals, as well as RVFV-positive vectors from previous RVFV epidemics (for which the location was available) were used to validate the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The risk obtained at the location of outbreaks (considering a radius of 1 kilometer around each point) varied between 0.18 and 0.85, with a mean value of 0.49. Variation of the size of the radius (up to 5 kilometers) resulted in general in little variation of the risk, although there were some exceptions in which the risk could vary more than a 20%.
