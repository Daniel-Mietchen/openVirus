<p>In order to evaluate whether there was a seasonal component in the distribution of

 <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability were extracted at 10,000 random locations from areas where values were not zero, as well as in buffer areas around the quarantines, the main animal markets and the camel slaughterhouses. The results (

 <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability throughout the year (mean variability for random points of 0.014), although there were some specific locations where 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability more than doubled. In risky locations (quarantines, markets and slaughterhouses) there was not much variability in 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability throughout the year: mean variability of 0.027 for markets, 0.026 for camel slaughterhouses, and 0.012 for quarantines. The maximum variability was found in markets (0.15) and camel slaughterhouses (0.12), while the maximum variability in quarantines was only 0.05.
