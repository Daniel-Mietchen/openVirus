In 2014 and 2015 the pattern became more regular, and there was also a progressive increase in the number of animals imported, from about 2000 cattle per month in 2013, to about 3500 in 2014 and 4000 in 2015. That increase coincided with the intensification of the trade with Sudan and the decrease of the trade with Ethiopia (
