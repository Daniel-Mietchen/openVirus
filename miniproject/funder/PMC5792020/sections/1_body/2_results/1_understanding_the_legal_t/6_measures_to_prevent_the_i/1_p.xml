 <bold>Camels.</bold> Camels from Sudan are quarantined in Abu Simbel or Shelateen facilities. On arrival they receive one dose of vaccine against RVFV. They are maintained in quarantine for 3 days, after which they are transported to animal markets or to slaughterhouses. Camels imported from Ethiopia arrive to Adabiya port from where they are transferred to Al Qata or to Adabiya quarantines. They arrive via Djibouti, where they receive a first dose of vaccine 7 days prior to shipment. A second dose of the vaccine is administered once they are in the quarantine facility in Egypt, where they are maintained for 10â€“16 days. In addition, about 10% of the camels were tested against RVF by RT-PCR. All the camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia tested in the last 5 years were negative (QID personal communication).
