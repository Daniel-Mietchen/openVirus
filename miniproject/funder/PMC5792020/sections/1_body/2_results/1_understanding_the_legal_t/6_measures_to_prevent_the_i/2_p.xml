 <bold>Cattle</bold>. Cattle imported from Sudan receive the first dose of RVFV vaccine in Sudan under the supervision of the EVS. Cattle imported from Ethiopia arrive via Djibouti, where they receive the first dose of vaccine. And once in the corresponding quarantine in Egypt, about 75% of cattle receive a second dose of the vaccine to prevent transmission in case quarantine is prolongued (QID-MALRE, personal communication). Cattle remain in the quarantines just for a few days, until they are slaughtered.
