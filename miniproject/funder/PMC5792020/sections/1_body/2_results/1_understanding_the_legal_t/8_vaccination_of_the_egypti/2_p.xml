<p>The estimation of the vaccine coverage of the Egyptian camel population is complicated because the data provided by the ED-MALRE includes also the vaccine doses used on imported camels. However, that would not have a significant effect on the results as the resident camel population in Egypt is really small as compared to the imports. In 2015, the year we used to account for the vaccine coverage in our model, 7.3 million doses of vaccine were administered as compared to 5.9 million in 2014. The analysis of the vaccine coverage data evidences a great degree of heterogeneity in the vaccination among species and areas (

Taking into account that 2 doses of vaccine are needed, cattle had the highest level of vaccine coverage with about 60%, while the coverage was about 35% for buffaloes and about 30% for sheep and goats. There were also significant differences among areas, including some governorates with a high census of domestic ruminants and very low vaccine coverages. For example vaccine coverages in cattle were 20% in Asyut, 30% in Sharqia, 30% in Beheira, or 30% in Beni Suef, while in other species coverage was even lower (
