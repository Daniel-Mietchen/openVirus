<p>Of the quarantines (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), Abu Simbel, where a significant proportion of the camels and all the cattle imported from Sudan arrived, seemed to have a low risk of RVFV transmission by vectors (between 0.04 and 0.08 depending on the buffer considered). For Shelateen quarantine, where camels imported from eastern Sudan arrived, the risk was 0. For Sahl Hasheesh, where cattle from Ethiopia arrived, the risk was extremely low (between 0 and 0.01 depending on the buffer). For Adabiya, where camels from Ethiopia arrived, the risk was also relatively low (between 0.07 and 0.14). In contrast, for Al Qata, where also camels from Ethiopia arrived, the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was quite high (between 0.70 and 0.83).
