<p>The camel slaughterhouses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g010">Fig 10A</xref>) are mostly located in the proximities of Cairo, where conditions are favourable for RVFV transmission and therefore their risk are relatively high (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006143.t003">Table 3</xref>). Of the three slaughterhouses that killed the most animals, Elbasateen had a risk 0.49 regardless of the buffer distance, while Elwarak had a risk between 0.47 and 0.50, and Kerdassa between 0.57 and 0.69.
