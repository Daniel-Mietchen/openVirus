Egypt has been repeatedly affected by RVF epidemics, mainly associated to the importation of animals from sub-Saharan countries, where the disease is endemic. The objective of our study was the improvement of the surveillance and control strategies implemented in Egypt. In order to do that, first we evaluated the legal trade of live animals into and within Egypt. Then, we assessed the risk of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) transmission within the country using a multi-criteria evaluation approach. Finally, we combined the animal trade and the risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely. Our results indicate that the main risk of RVFV introduction is posed by the continuous flow of large number of camels coming from Sudan. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is restricted to the areas surrounding the Nile river, and does not vary significantly throughout the year. Imported camels are taken to quarantines, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors is generally low. Then, they are taken to animal markets or slaughterhouses, many located in populated areas, where the risk of RVFV transmission to animals or humans is much higher. The measures currently implemented (quarantines, vaccination or testing) seem to have a limited effect in reducing the risk of RVFV introduction, and therefore other (risk-based) surveillance strategies are proposed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-transmitted disease, which may affect animals (ruminants and camels) and cause severe disease.

It is the causative agent of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) that may affect both humans and animals, mainly ruminants, but also camels. In livestock RVF causes large number of abortions (abortion storms) and high mortalities in young animals. In humans, RVFV infection generally causes a self-limiting, acute and febrile illness, although in some cases disease progresses to more severe forms, with neurological disorders, blindness, hemorrhagic fever or thrombosis [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. RVFV infection of animals may occur by the bite of an infected mosquito (mainly of the <italic>Culex</italic> or <italic>Aedes</italic> genera) or through direct contact with infected animal tissues or fluids [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Infection via mosquito bites is considered the primary mode of transmission in the first stages of the epidemic, while contact with contaminated material is more relevant during the amplification stage. RVFV within infected tissues is quite resistant to inactivation and may remain infectious for a few days [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, the majority of human cases are likely to occur in farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse employees due to contact with infected material [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>RVF may have a dramatic consequence on producers and livestock industries, including the impact on international trade [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The public health impact of RVF may also be severe, as demonstrated by the 200,000 people infected and 600 fatal cases reported in the 1977 epidemic in Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Besides that epidemic, Egypt has been affected by RVF in 1993, 1994, 1997, and finally in 2003 [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, Mroz and collaborators [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have recently reported the low level circulation of RVFV in some areas of Egypt.</p><p>The continuous importation of viraemic ruminants or camels, mainly from Sudan, was considered the main source of introduction of RVF into Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, those importations may also result in the introduction of other exotic diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. RVF is considered to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with major outbreaks associated with periods of heavy rainfall and flooding [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Socio-economic changes, with human population growth and the associated increased demand for meat, or changes in the meat market prices could result in greater controlled and uncontrolled transboundary movements of livestock. A consequence of all those changes would be an increase of the risk of introduction of RVFV into areas of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While surveillance and diagnostic methods for RVFV are available, RVFV control is hindered by the difficulties of vector control, and the fact that vaccines are only available for ruminants, with either inactivated vaccines (with a limited efficacy) or live attenuated vaccines (with a residual pathogenic effect) [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, the best strategy to protect countries at risk of RVFV introduction is the implementation of regional monitoring and control programmes in endemic countries, as well as the establishment of early warning systems in the countries at risk. The Egyptian authorities implement both measures to prevent the introduction of RVFV (vaccination of imported animals, quarantines and testing of a proportion of imported animals) and measures to prevent the spread (vaccination of the Egyptian susceptible population). If those measures were effective, there would be no risk of RVFV introduction and spread, however, their efficacy has not been evaluated, and some deficiencies have been identified in the past [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Given the limitation of resources, risk-based methods (i.e. focusing on those areas and/or practices that pose the highest risk) may be considered as a cost-effective alternative for the surveillance of RVF in Egypt. Many of those risk-based methods are data-driven, which rely on comprehensive information about disease-associated events. In a data-scarce context, knowledge-driven methods, which rely on the previous information on the factors associated with disease occurrence, offer an alternative approach to identify areas at risk [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The <bold>main objectives of this study</bold> were:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To understand the structure and patterns of the legal trade of live animals into Egypt, and then how those animals are distributed throughout the country.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To evaluate the risk of RVFV transmission within Egypt (risk-mapping) by means of a geographical information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) approach.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To combine animal trade data and risk of RVFV transmission data to identify those areas and periods in which the introduction of RVFV is more likely.</p></list-item></list><p>That will allow the improvement of the surveillance and control measures currently being implemented by the Egyptian Authorities, and make a better use of the resources available. Improvement of RVFV surveillance should allow the early detection of the disease, while the improvement of control measures should help prevent cases of RVFV infection in both animals and humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Understanding the legal trade pattern of live cattle and camels into and within Egypt</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Legal trade of live animals into Egypt</title><p>Animal trade data, including date (month and year), number of animals, and country of origin, for all the batches of cattle and camels legally imported into Egypt between 2012 and 2015 was provided by the Quarantine &#x00026; Inspection Department (QID) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of Egypt (MALRE).

In contrast, camels, once released from the quarantines, may be sent to slaughterhouses or to animal markets. Data on the location of slaughterhouses and animal markets were provided by the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of Egypt (DE-MALRE). For animal markets, the DE-MALRE also provided information on the characteristics of the 273 animal markets present in Egypt, collected with the objective of ranking their risk in relation to the potential presence of exotic diseases, and allow for targeted surveillance and control. This ranking was initially developed for Foot and Mouth disease, but was adapted for RVF as follows:</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Characterization of animal markets</title><p>The ranking of animal markets in relation to their risk of RVFV introduction was carried out according to a set of criteria.

Of the remaining high-risk markets there are 10 with risk of RVFV transmission by vectors estimates above 0.7. Of them, 7 are located in risk-area 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g008">Fig 8</xref>, in the governorates of Gharbia (3), Qalyubia (3) and Monofia (1). The other 3 are located in Minya governorate (risk-area 2). In risk areas 3 and 4, there is only one high-risk market in each with risk of RVFV transmission by vectors above 0.5, in Qena and Aswan governorates, respectively.</p><p>The camel slaughterhouses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006143.g010">Fig 10A</xref>) are mostly located in the proximities of Cairo, where conditions are favourable for RVFV transmission and therefore their risk are relatively high (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006143.t003">Table 3</xref>). Of the three slaughterhouses that killed the most animals, Elbasateen had a risk 0.49 regardless of the buffer distance, while Elwarak had a risk between 0.47 and 0.50, and Kerdassa between 0.57 and 0.69.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec035"><title>Discussion</title><p>Camel meat is an important source of cheap protein for the Egyptian people. However, as the resident camel population in Egypt is really small, 66,233 animals in 2015 (according to OIE data) and located mainly in remote areas, large number of camels need to be regularly imported into Egypt, the majority of which come from Sudan (86% of the total in 2015) and the rest from Ethiopia. The flow of camels is continouos throughout the whole year and the number of animals imported per year seem to have an increasing trend. In 2015, an average of 18,000 camels were imported per month.</p><p>During the first RVF epidemic in Egypt in 1977, mortality and abortions were reported in camels in Aswan governorate (in the south of the country), and RVFV was isolated from this species [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, even though the source of the outbreak could not be determined, the possibility of introduction of the disease from Sudan by camels was considered the most likely explanation. In the following epidemics (1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003), importation of camels, mainly from Sudan, was also considered as a possible source of introduction, although no proper epidemiological investigations were carried out, and alternative mechanisms were considered [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a result, the role of camels in the epidemiology of RVFV remains unclear. In fact, it has been suggested that camels may be essential for RVFV transmission in some ecosystems where their density is high, which would allow viral amplification and transmission to alternative hosts, but not in others [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, data on factors such as duration of viraemia, infectiousness to mosquitos, or the risk of infection of humans from contaminated products remain unknown, and further studies on camels would be required. Despite those uncertainties, camels are considered susceptible to RVFV, and the virus has been isolated from blood from healthy, naturally infected camels in Egypt and Sudan [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. While RVFV infections in camels are usually mild or asymptomatic, abortion waves were observed in RVF outbreaks in Kenya and Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the 2010 epidemic in Mauritania, clinical signs other than abortions were observed in camels, either a peracute form with sudden death within 24 hours; or an acute form with fever and systemic lesions, that resulted in death when haemorrhagic signs occurred [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RVFV infections in camels have been recorded in most sub-Saharan African countries, with prevalences ranging from 3.0 to 51.9 percent [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, RVF is thought to be endemic in sub-Saharan African countries (including Sudan), with large epidemics occurring after heavy rainfall and flooding [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses carried out in Sudan with RVFV strains from the 2007 and 2010 epidemics, indicated that they were the result of multiple introductions from eastern Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since then, there were evidences of circulation of RVFV during the inter-epidemic period: in 2014&#x02013;2015, 9.6% of camels in Khartoum State (Sudan) had RVFV antibodies, including at least one positive born after the last reported epidemic [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Besides, camels may be involved in the introduction of other diseases such as MERS-CoV, which may cause severe disease in humans. MERS-CoV was detected in Egypt in camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and seems to still be present in Ethiopian camels [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Camels provide food (milk and meat), fibre (wool and leather) and draft power (for transportation and cultivation) to human communities located in dry environments [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As a result, in some societies they are essential from a cultural and socio-economic point of view. The world camel population has steadily increased in recent years to reach almost 28 million heads in 2014 (according to FAO). Besides, camel farming practices are changing, with a significant increase of intensive production in peri-urban areas, which results in a closer contact with the human population [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As camels are used for trade allowing the connection distant populations, in particular in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, they may play a role in the large-scale dissemination of pathogens.</p><p>The number of cattle legally imported into Egypt, 4074 on average per month in 2015, is small as compared to camels. The flow of cattle became more regular by the second half of the 4-years period, coinciding with the intensification of the trade with Sudan. In contrast to camels, the data revealed a more seasonal pattern, with an increase of importations in the months of July, August and September, just before the major Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha (&#x0201c;Sacrifice Feast") in those years. Importation of cattle also poses a threat for Egypt, in fact, the epidemics of foot and mouth disease (serotype A) and of lumpy skin disease that affected Egypt in 2006 were both linked to the importation of animals from Ethiopia [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Increase of importations of cattle and camels into Egypt may be explained by the growing demand of meat. While between 2006 and 2015 the human population in Egypt grew a 19.9% [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the population of ruminants and camels in the country only grew a 3.2% [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. According to the World Bank projections, the human population in Egypt is expected to continue growing at a rate of almost 2% per year in the following decade, and therefore legal (and potentially illegal) trade of animals into Egypt is expected to increase.</p><p>After quarantine, camels may be transported to markets or slaughterhouses throughout Egypt. Those movements within Egypt would contribute the spread of RVFV in the event of introduction of the virus, as evidenced in other countries [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The EVS characterized the network of animal markets by collecting information on the location, but also on several characteristics of 273 animal markets distributed throughout Egypt. That combined with the slaughterhouse data allows having a basic picture of the animal movement patterns within the country, which offers an alternative approach in countries without the resources to have a comprehensive recording of animal movements. That information is very useful for planning risk-based surveillance strategies (i.e. target those markets where detection of a particular disease is more likely), with the advantage the criteria may be adapted to each specific disease. The collection of more comprehensive information on for example the number of animals by species or the origins and destinations of the animals that went across those markets, would allow a much clearer picture of the animal movement network, and is therefore recommended The animal market network in Egypt is mainly composed of small markets, which basically operate once a week. Interestingly, almost 40% of the markets traded animals from different governorates, which means that infectious diseases are likely to spread efficiently once introduced into the country. In relation to the species, 2% of markets traded exclusively camels, and a 17% further traded camels plus other species susceptible to RVFV. Most of the markets are located in the areas beside the Nile river and its delta, but there are also animal markets alongside the Mediterranean coast, or even in the Sahara desert (Farafra market). Of the 273 markets, only 17 were in the governorates bordering Sudan, where smuggling of small ruminants was considered more likely. The risk-ranking score for markets varied between 5 and 15, with a mean value of 7.9. The markets with the highest risk of RVFV transmission were in the proximities or within the main cities (e.g. Cairo, Minya or Aswan), while most of the camel slaughterhouses were near Cairo. That proximity to urban areas results in an increased risk of RVFV transmission to humans (zoonotic risk). In contrast to camels, all cattle imported into Egypt are slaughtered within the quarantines to which they arrive, which are located in remote areas, far from populated areas.</p><p>In order to prevent the introduction of RVFV by camels, the EVS implement a series of measures that include vaccination of imported animals, quarantines and testing of a proportion of them. However, the vaccination strategy is unlikely be effective, as camels imported from Sudan receive a single dose and camels imported from Ethiopia receive two doses, but with only 7 days difference. The inactivated vaccines against RVFV require a booster 3&#x02013;6 months after initial vaccination, followed by yearly boosters [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Besides, the efficacy of the inactivated vaccine has not been tested in camels [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and further research on that field would be needed. While it has been argued that the long distance that the camels from Sudan need to walk to reach the Egyptian border would be enough to prevent the importation of infected animals, there are still many uncertainties in relation to RVFV infection in camels, and in any case, that measure does not comply with OIE rules for importation of live animals [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, means of transportation seem to be changing as at least some of the camels are currently transported on trucks rather than on foot (MALRE personal communication) and transmission (either direct or indirect) during the transport of camels cannot be ruled out. Seroconversions in Madagascar highlands evidenced the local circulation of RVFV in periods in which mosquitoes were rare or inactive, suggesting that other forms of transmission seem likely [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Even though camels are quarantined, for 3 days if coming from Sudan and 10&#x02013;16 days if coming from Ethiopia, the efficiency of clinical detection of RVFV infection is limited by the fact that infections in camels are often unapparent. Besides, about 10% of the camels imported from Sudan and Ethiopia in the last 5 years were tested against RVF by RT-PCR, and were negative (MALRE personal communication). However, the sensitivity of such non-statistically based testing protocol for detecting the infection, if present, is questionable. While the measures currently implemented in camels are likely to reduce some of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt, their effect is likely to be limited. Similar conclusions may be drawn from the strategies implemented in cattle with the particularities that all cattle are slaughtered within the quarantine premises, where the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was estimated to be very low. Therefore, vaccination of imported cattle is unlikely to have a significant effect on the reduction of the risk of RVFV introduction into Egypt.</p><p>On the other hand, to prevent the transmission of RVFV within Egypt, all the animals of the susceptible species (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes and camels) are meant to be vaccinated twice a year. However, the analysis of the vaccination data evidences a great heterogeneity in the level of vaccine coverage among species and governorates. Despite the increase in the number of vaccine doses administered in 2015 as compared to 2014, the level of vaccine coverage (30% in sheep and goats, 35% in buffaloes and 60% in cattle) would not be enough to prevent the transmission in the event of RVFV introduction into the country, in particular in those governorates where the level of vaccination is below average. Differences in the density of susceptible species throughout the country combined with the heterogenous application of vaccination programs among areas and species results in the identification of some areas of high density of susceptible hosts of RVFV, which is where efforts should be focused. Failures in the local application of vaccination programs were identified as one of the causes of previous epidemics of RVFV in Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There were also areas where high levels of vaccine coverage were reached resulting in a significant reduction of the risk of RVFV transmission. Conclusions in relation to vaccine coverages should be taken with caution, as the censuses used for their calculation may not be totally accurate/updated.</p><p>Even though we used the distribution of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> to map vector distribution, we believe it is an accurate representation of the RVFV transmission by vectors. Entomological surveys indicate that <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> is the most common mosquito species in Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and was considered the primary vector of RVFV in previous epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Besides, the primary breeding areas of other RVFV vectors (e.g. <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>antennatus</italic>) coincide with those of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The map of RVFV transmission by vectors in Egypt evidences that the majority of the country surface has a risk of zero, as it corresponds to bare soil land cover (i.e. desert), which is not suitable for the presence of neither hosts nor vectors. Therefore, RVFV transmission by vectors is basically restricted to the wet areas surrounding the Nile River and its delta. Within that area there is a great variability on the risk depending on the density of vectors and hosts. Transmission via mosquitos is considered the most important mode of transmission during the enzootic cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The evaluation of the seasonality of <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> indicated that in general there was not much variation in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> favorability between the different months. Therefore the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the suitable areas of Egypt seem to be more or less constant throughout the year. However, results also indicate that in some specific locations there may be significant variations in <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> density. Zayed and collaborators [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated that in the areas where the seasonal flooding of the Nile Delta occurred, the population of vectors changed significantly, mainly in late summer-early fall.</p><p>The validation of the risk map evidenced that the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors obtained at the location of human and animal cases and RVFV-positive vectors from the previous RVFV epidemics in Egypt, varied between 0.18 and 0.85, with a mean value of 0.49. That would indicate that RVFV transmission by vectors is not restricted only to the areas with the highest risks, but that transmission may occur also in areas where the risks estimated were moderate or even low. In other words, in Egypt RVFV transmission would be possible in areas where the density of vectors or susceptible hosts is far from their maximum values. However, the limitations of the model should also be taken into account. Model results may be influenced by the accuracy of some model inputs (e.g. vaccine coverage), or the uncertainty about some model parameters (e.g. susceptibility of the different species). Besides, knowledge-driven models are always subject to some sort of subjectivity, for example in relation to the factors (layers) chosen. On the other hand, the location of outbreaks used for model validation was not exact, and given that some of them were as old as 1979, the landscape, and therefore the suitability for <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> may have changed since then.</p><p>As expected, the linear regression analysis indicated that the distribution of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>pipiens</italic> was the most determinant factor in the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors. The only other statistically significant parameter was the density of susceptible goats. Relevance of goats in the risk of RVFV transmission is probably linked to their higher susceptibility, and therefore higher weight, as compared to other species (cattle, buffaloes and camels), as well as with the fact that the areas with the highest density of goats coincided with very low levels of vaccine coverage (7% and 14%, respectively).</p><p>The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors in the surroundings of the five quarantines available in Egypt was estimated to be quite low except in the case of Al Qata (where some of the camels imported from Ethiopia arrive). There is no data on the duration of viraemia in camels, but as camels imported from Sudan stay in the quarantine for only 3 days, it seems possible that they may remain infectious after being released from the quarantine, even if RVFV transmission by vectors within the quarantine was not possible. On the other hand, RVFV transmission within those quarantines may also occur by direct contact with tissues, body fluids or fomites of infected animals.</p><p>While all cattle are slaughtered within quarantine facilities, imported camels (potentially infected) may be taken to animal markets or to slaughterhouses after the quarantine period, and those would be the places where RVFV transmission would be more likely. The risk of RVFV transmission by vectors at the 273 animal markets was rather variable (between 0 and 0.84), but the mean risk was quite high, 0.60. In the case of the 18 camel slaughterhouses, the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors was quite high (mean risk of 0.59&#x02013;0.60), and there was in fact less variability than in the case of animal markets. Establishment of an effective surveillance system in the areas surrounding key markets and camel slaughterhouses may allow the early detection of RVF and the timely establishment of control measures. That may include improving passive surveillance by raising farmers&#x02019; awareness for the reporting of any symptom compatible with RVF and providing the mechanisms that allowed a prompt laboratory confirmation of any suspected case. Also, the establishment of some active (sentinel) surveillance in the locations identified as having the highest risk would be essential. Besides the risk of RVFV transmission by vectors, the slaughtering of animals, which in the case of cattle is carried out within quarantine premises, poses an important risk for humans by exposure to body fluids or tissues of infected animals. Infectivity of blood during the acute phase of infection in mammals is high [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, given that RVFV is quite resistant to inactivation, infected tissues may remain infectious for a period of a few days [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In fact, Nicholas and collaborators [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] concluded that practices such as skinning or slaughtering animals were significantly associated with the risk of RVFV infection. A cross-sectional survey on 1181 abattoir workers in 15 governorates of Egypt after the 1993 RVFV epidemic evidenced a 2% prevalence of anti-RVF IgM antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Antibodies were found in 9 of 31 slaughterhouses and 8 of 15 governorates, including several areas where no clinical disease had been reported. Therefore, Egyptian abattoirs in which imported cattle or camels are slaughtered should implement measures (e.g. use of personal protective equipment) to prevent the infection of the personnel.</p><p>Even though we focused on the risk posed by the legal trade of animals, other mechanisms for RVFV introduction into Egypt are also possible. Illegal trade of animals through the borders is likely to occur, but its relevance in relation to the risk of RVFV introduction is difficult to assess, and would require further studies. On the other hand, the possibility of RVFV spread (potentially to distant areas) through the movement of infected (viraemic) humans and subsequent infection of competent vectors remains controversial. While for some authors humans infected by RVFV may develop a viremia sufficient to infect na&#x000ef;ve mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], others consider humans as dead-end hosts [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, wind-borne transportation of infected mosquitos has been proposed [<xref rid="pntd.0006143.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but not demonstrated scientifically.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the personnel at the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation of Egypt for their contribution providing all the data needed for the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0006143.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
