Acute symptomatic infections are typically associated with the onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/polyarthritis. In this study, a systems biology approach was adopted to analyze the blood transcriptomes of adults acutely infected with the CHIKV. Gene signatures that were associated with viral RNA levels and the onset of symptoms were identified. Among these genes, the putative role of the Eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF) family genes and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC3A) in the CHIKV replication process were displayed. We further compared these signatures with signatures induced by the Dengue virus infection and rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, we demonstrated that the CHIKV <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages induced IL-1 beta production in a mechanism that is significantly dependent on the inflammasome NLRP3 activation. The observations provided valuable insights into virus-host interactions during the acute phase and can be instrumental in the investigation of new and effective therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people worldwide and presents a serious public health issue. Acute symptomatic infections caused by contracting this mosquito-transmitted arbovirus are typically associated with an abrupt onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/ polyarthritis, as well as prolonged periods of disability in some patients. These dramatic effects call for a careful evaluation of the molecular mechanisms involved in this puzzling infection. By analyzing the blood transcriptome of adults acutely infected with CHIKV, we were able to provide a detailed picture of the early molecular events induced by the infection. Additionally, the systems biology approach revealed genes that can be investigated extensively as probable therapeutic targets for the disease.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo &#x000e0;

Corroborating with these findings, the exclusive up-regulation of inflammasome-related genes was also observed. Additionally, the induction of inflammasome activation in macrophages infected with CHIKV <italic>in vitro</italic> was observed. These data explain our previous demonstration that NLRP3 inhibitors can interfere with the pathogenesis of CHIKV virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Here, we used BMDM from C57BL/6 wild type and Casp1/11<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In our previous work, we and others showed that the CHIKV infection in wild type mice induced important musculoskeletal diseases and proved it to be an appropriate murine model to study human pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the negative and significant correlation between CHIKV RNA levels and most eIF family member genes observed here have not been described previously in research regarding CHIKV infections. Furthermore, it is speculated whether the down-regulation of other eIF family members observed in these results in response to the infection could be an important host defense mechanism against the virus replication. Moreover, the protein levels may differ from the gene RNA levels detected in this work. We consider the eukaryotic translation initiation factors as potential markers of the CHIKV arthralgia chronicity and can be better exploited as novel broad-spectrum antiviral targets.</p><p>The CHIKV-related arthralgia symptom is significantly similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but there are some important clinical and immunological characteristics that differ between these diseases and the different molecular signatures between both CHIKV and RA can be indicated here. Previous data showed significant concordance between rheumatoid arthritis gene signatures and a mouse model of CHIKV infection/arthritis [<xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here, we are presenting a more detailed comparison between both diseases in humans. It is well known that the CHIKV-related polyarthralgia affects joints and presents high inflammatory mediators that release locally as a result of the infiltration of mononuclear cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, a study comparing the macrophage transcriptome in synovial fluid of both RA and CHIKV infection patients would be highly informative and enriching.</p><p>Contrariwise, when compared to the differential gene expressions of DENV infected patients, the data in this study shows specific molecular gene signatures in response to CHIKV. It is interesting to note in this context that although previous infections with ZIKV and DENV were detected in the group of non-CHIKV-infected volunteers, specific responses for CHIKV infection were still identifiable.</p><p>Moreover, the comprehensive molecular data in this study showed novel molecules that could play a key role in the acute infection of CHIKV infection and thereby provide new candidates as targets for therapy against this incapacitating disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec011"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample collection and clinical information</title><p>Blood samples were collected from subjects reporting arbovirus-like symptoms in the Brazilian states of Sergipe (n = 39 infected and n = 15 controls) and S&#x000e3;o Paulo (n = 5 controls).
