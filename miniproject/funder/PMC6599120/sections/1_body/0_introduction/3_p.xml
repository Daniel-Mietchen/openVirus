<p>Systems biology approaches have been successfully applied to identify molecular signatures associated with infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this study, a systems approach was performed to investigate subjects who were naturally infected with CHIKV during the 2016 epidemics in the state of Sergipe, Brazil. The blood transcriptome analyses performed revealed key genes and pathways involved in acute CHIKV infection, thereby providing important insights into how CHIKV interacts with the hostâ€™s immune system. These analyses helped uncover potential drug targets for improving CHIKV therapy.
