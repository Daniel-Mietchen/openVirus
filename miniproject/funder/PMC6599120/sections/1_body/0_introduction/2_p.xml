<p>The CHIKV acute infection typically results viremia for 5–7 days. The symptoms are characterized by fever, rash and severe polyarthralgia/polyarthritis that can become chronic and persist from months to years [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Mortality rates are estimated to be approximately 0.1% [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; however, the high attack rates (up to 30–75%) can result in considerable economic burden [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several studies have sought to understand the CHIKV disease pathogenesis and virus-host interactions better [
