<p>The individuals of our cohort were most likely infected with the CHIKV monophyletic group ECSA (East-Central-South Africa) as previously reported [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other lineages can be located although CHIKV is relatively conserved. CHIKV can be genetically classified as West African or Asian, or as belonging to the Indian Ocean (IOL) or ECSA, but the pathogenesis and virulence variation in humans, among these different lineages have not been further investigated [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, we believe that in Brazilian regions with different CHIKV strains, the virulence and pathogenesis of the disease may vary.
