<p>Systems biological approaches can provide comprehensive and unbiased dissections of the complex interactions between genes and proteins in infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or of children infected with the virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Since it is extremely difficult to acquire sufficient data from naturally infected individuals for use in systems biological models of analysis, this kind of study is relatively new. The aim of the present study was to investigate the early host response to acute CHIKV infection in adults using a systems biological approach.
