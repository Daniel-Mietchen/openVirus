<p>Moreover, the negative and significant correlation between CHIKV RNA levels and most eIF family member genes observed here have not been described previously in research regarding CHIKV infections. Furthermore, it is speculated whether the down-regulation of other eIF family members observed in these results in response to the infection could be an important host defense mechanism against the virus replication. Moreover, the protein levels may differ from the gene RNA levels detected in this work. We consider the eukaryotic translation initiation factors as potential markers of the CHIKV arthralgia chronicity and can be better exploited as novel broad-spectrum antiviral targets.</p>
