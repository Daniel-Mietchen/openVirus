<p>Consistent with other reports, it was observed that the up-regulation of several genes play a role in the antiviral immune response, and many of them are ISGs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] support the findings of this study regarding the most abundant up-regulated genes being related to neutrophils and myeloid populations and especially dendritic cells and monocytes. The monocytes have been reported recently as important inflammatory and regulatory mediators of the innate immune response to different arboviruses [

 <sup>−/−</sup> mice. In our previous work, we and others showed that the CHIKV infection in wild type mice induced important musculoskeletal diseases and proved it to be an appropriate murine model to study human pathogenesis [
