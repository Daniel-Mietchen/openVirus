<p>The CHIKV-related arthralgia symptom is significantly similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but there are some important clinical and immunological characteristics that differ between these diseases and the different molecular signatures between both CHIKV and RA can be indicated here. Previous data showed significant concordance between rheumatoid arthritis gene signatures and a mouse model of CHIKV infection/arthritis [

It is well known that the CHIKV-related polyarthralgia affects joints and presents high inflammatory mediators that release locally as a result of the infiltration of mononuclear cells [
