<p>We next performed single sample GSEA analysis using the log2 fold-change values of each patient compared to the group of healthy controls as ranks and the BTMs as gene sets (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we observed that the up-regulated BTMs were related to innate immunity and antiviral responses involving dendritic cells and monocytes activation. This is highly consistent with the work of Michlmayr et al [
