On each interaction, the 59 infected patients and healthy control samples were split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. We subsequently applied different machine learning models (CART, kNN, SVM, RF, xgBoost, bayesglm, adaboost, ada, rpart, nnet, plr, regLogistic and dnn) on the training set to predict the testing set. Among all the models, the RF (Random Forest) model displayed better performance (
