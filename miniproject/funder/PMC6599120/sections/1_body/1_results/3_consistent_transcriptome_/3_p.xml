<p>Through literature curation of the CHIKV gene signature, we created a network that provides novel insights into CHIKV immunobiology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g004">Fig 4c</xref>). CHIKV infection could induce the expression of several ISGs, as well as the activation of TLRs, EIF2AK2 and IkBs. Up-regulation of 
 <italic>STAT1</italic>, 
 <italic>STAT2</italic>, 
 <italic>IRF9</italic>, 
 <italic>IRF1</italic> and 
 <italic>IRF7</italic> can induce the expression of ISGs, which are important antiviral effectors. Interestingly, the CHIKV infection led to the up-regulation of several proinflammatory genes such as IκBs-related genes that are important to NFκB activation and proinflammatory cytokines production when phosphorylated. It is integral to mention here that we also detected the up-regulation of 
 <italic>REL</italic>, which is a subunit of NFκB.
