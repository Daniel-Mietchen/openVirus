<p>DEGs related to the NLRP3 inflammasome were also detected. Chemotherapeutic inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome was recently shown to inhibit CHIKV arthropathy in a mouse model [

 <italic>Nlrp3</italic> is transcriptionally regulated to guarantee high protein levels for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its activation could lead to autophagy (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], apoptosis of the infected cells and the production of other cytokines (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in response to the infection (
