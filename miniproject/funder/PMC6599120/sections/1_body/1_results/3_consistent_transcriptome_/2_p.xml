<p>Due to the natural heterogeneity in human cohorts, we also performed differential expression analyses between each infected patient and the group of healthy controls. The patients whose blood samples were collected in the initial days post the onset of symptoms revealed higher numbers of DEGs (differentially expressed genes) detected by RNA-seq analysis and higher mean CHIKV RNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g004">Fig 4a</xref>). The DEG list for each patient was subsequently combined into a meta-volcano plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g004">Fig 4b</xref>). This plot displays the number of genes whose expression was consistently altered in most patients. Approximately 70% of the CHIKV-infected patients showed down-regulation of 123 genes and up-regulation of 382 genes (

 <italic>APOBEC3A</italic>, 
 <italic>IFI44</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and 
 <italic>OAS3</italic> were the most represented up-regulated genes and 
 <italic>NT5E</italic> (also known as CD73), 
 <italic>PTGS2</italic>,

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Vascular leakage and shock have also been reported as a severe manifestation of CHIKV [
