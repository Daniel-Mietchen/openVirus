<p>In an endemic area for the Chikungunya, Zika and Dengue viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in the northeast of Brazil, whole blood samples were collected from 39 adult patients with symptoms consistent with arboviral infection, including fever, arthralgia, headache and/or muscle pain. Most patients (n = 22) reported that the onset of the symptoms had occurred on the same day or one day prior to the blood collection (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Eight patients reported having had symptoms for two days, and seven reported symptoms surfacing three to four days prior to the blood collection. Two patients reported pain for the past 20 days or more (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g001">Fig 1a</xref>). The presence of CHIKV RNA (as determined by real-time RT-PCR) or CHIKV-specific IgM (as determined by serodiagnostic ELISA) was confirmed in serum samples of all except five patients (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These five patients had borderline levels of CHIKV RNA (n = 4) or had no serum available (n = 1) and were included in the study based on their clinical symptoms (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s001">S1 Table</xref>). All samples were negative for Zika and Dengue RNA (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The most frequent symptoms in CHIKV-infected patients were fever, arthralgia, headache and myalgia (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the highest levels of CHIKV RNA were found in serum samples from patients in whom the onset of the disease was recent (
