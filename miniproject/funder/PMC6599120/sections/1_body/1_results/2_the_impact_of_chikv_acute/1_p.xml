<p>The peripheral blood transcriptomes of CHIKV patients were compared with those from healthy controls to understand the transcriptional changes associated with acute CHIKV infections. Although the CHIKV RNA levels had a small contribution to the variance observed in the transcriptomes, individuals were not grouped by the days post the onset of symptoms or by their infection status (i.e., healthy individuals and CHIKV patients) (
