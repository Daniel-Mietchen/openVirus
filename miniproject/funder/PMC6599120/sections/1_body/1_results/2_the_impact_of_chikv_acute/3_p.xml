<p>The expression of several eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) was negatively correlated with the level of CHIKV RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g003">Fig 3</xref>), indicating that these genes can play a major role in viral replication. The eIFs are important proteins for controlling the translation initiation processes involved in host and viral protein syntheses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A network with eIF genes was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g003">Fig 3b</xref>) among which 
 <italic>EIF4B</italic>, 
 <italic>EIF3L</italic>, 
 <italic>EIF3E</italic> and 
 <italic>EIF2AK2</italic> presented the highest negative correlation with levels of CHIKV RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). Only the 
 <italic>EIF2AK2</italic> gene (also known as PKR) had a positive correlation with CHIKV RNA levels. This protein is activated by alphavirus infections and contributes to the characteristic shut-down of host cell protein synthesis, thereby allowing the preferential translation of capped viral RNA [
