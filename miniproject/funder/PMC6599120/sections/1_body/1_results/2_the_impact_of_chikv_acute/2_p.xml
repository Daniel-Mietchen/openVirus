<p>Correlation analysis of gene expression and the levels of CHIKV RNA in the peripheral blood of the infected individuals revealed approximately 3,500 genes associated with CHIKV infection. The expression of most of these genes (&gt; 85%) was negatively correlated with CHIKV RNA levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). Using the correlation values as rank and Blood Transcription Modules (BTM) as gene sets, we ran a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to reveal the BTMs related to the levels of CHIKV RNA. BTMs associated with innate immune cells (dendritic cells and neutrophils), antiviral response, inflammation and toll-like receptor signaling (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s005">S4 Fig</xref>) were positively associated with the level of CHIKV RNA. BTMs negatively associated with the level of CHIKV RNA (i.e., with a negative normalized enrichment score, NES) were related to adaptive immune response, such as cell proliferation, activation and differentiation of B and T lymphocytes, as well as chemokines and cytokines that could be due to the CHIKV infection-related lymphopenia (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A gene network was subsequently constructed by connecting the genes related to BTMs with a negative NES score (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g002">Fig 2b</xref>) by utilizing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from InnateDB. Genes related to adaptive immune response and cell recruitment such as

 <italic>CD8A</italic> and 
 <italic>CD8B</italic>, 
 <italic>CD3D</italic>, 
 <italic>CD19</italic>, 
 <italic>CCR7</italic> and 
 <italic>TCF7</italic>, among others, appeared in the network (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g002">Fig 2c</xref>). Several of these genes are related to the homing/recruiting of the effector/memory T lymphocytes as well as the activation and induction of memory cells. The same process was performed for BTMs with positive NES scores (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Almost all the genes in this network were human type I ISGs (as defined by Interferome V2), which is entirely consistent with the stimulation of the type I IFN response by CHIKV dsRNA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. IRF7 is a central highly inducible transcription factor for driving the type I IFN responses to CHIKV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and OAS3, IFIT1, MX2 and RSAD2 (viperin) are key antiviral effectors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SERPING1 (C1 inhibitor) is a novel finding since this inhibitor of the classical pathway of the complement system has not been associated with arthritogenicalphaviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], although it is up-regulated in monocytes in HIV infections [
