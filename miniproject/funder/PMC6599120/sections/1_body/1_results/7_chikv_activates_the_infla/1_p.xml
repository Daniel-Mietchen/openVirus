<p>Since the inflammasome-related genes are exclusively up-regulated in CHIKV infection and were described before in this context [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we decided to provide a deeper proof-of-concept related to these findings. The murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected with CHIKV virus and the readouts of the inflammasome activation were measured. A specific dye was used that binds to active caspase-1 (FAM-YVAD) to assess caspase-1 activation with CHIKV-induced caspase-1 activation measured as a percentage of FAM-YVAD+ cells as well as the integrated mean of fluorescence (iMFI) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g007">Fig 7a</xref>). Caspase-1 activation was further assessed by western blot and detected caspase-1 cleavage as indicated by the presence of Casp1 p20 in cells infected with PFU/cell of 5 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g006">Fig 6d</xref>). IL-1β production was dependent on inflammasome activation since Casp1/11 deficient macrophages failed to trigger IL-1β production in response to the infection (
