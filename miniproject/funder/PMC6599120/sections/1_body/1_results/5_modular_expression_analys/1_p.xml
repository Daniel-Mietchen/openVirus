<p>We performed a gene co-expression network analysis using the expression profiles of all the patients and healthy controls. CEMiTool [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] identified eight co-expression modules containing 74 to over 2,000 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). The expression activity of some of these modules were altered in healthy controls or in patients that had different days post the onset of symptoms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). Module M8, which shows higher activity in patients with two to four days of symptoms was enriched for monocytes and neutrophils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). A monocyte centric response in peripheral blood from pediatric CHIKV patients has previously been documented [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and a protective role was observed in murine models [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Neutrophil responses have hitherto not been described for alphaviral infections, with granulocytosis in non-human primates being predominantly unremarkable [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and a pathogenic role for neutrophils only evident in CCR2
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, although previously thought to characterize bacterial infections, neutrophil responses are now recognized in a range of acute viral infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
