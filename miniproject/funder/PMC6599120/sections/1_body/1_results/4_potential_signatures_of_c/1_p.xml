<p>The patients (n = 13) who agreed to return for clinical follow-up examinations were split into those with chronic and those with non-chronic arthralgia (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Methods</xref>). These two groups showed no significant difference in the mean levels of CHIKV RNA in the serum (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5a Fig</xref>). Compared to the healthy controls, a total of 1,262 and 1,862 genes were consistently differentially expressed in most of the chronic and non-chronic patients respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5b Fig</xref>). Of them, 514 genes were commonly up-regulated and 337 were down-regulated in both groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5c Fig</xref>). Additionally, a high positive correlation was observed between the mean log2 fold change of chronic and non-chronic patients when compared to healthy controls (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5d Fig</xref>). However, few genes presented an expression profile that differed between chronic and non-chronic patients (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5d Fig</xref>). 
 <italic>HLA-DRB5</italic> was up-regulated in most non-chronic patients and down-regulated in most chronic patients (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s006">S5d Fig</xref>). However, such changes may merely be associated with the diminishing of the acute adaptive T cell responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Of considerably greater interest are the genes that are up-regulated in most chronic patients relative to non-chronic patients. The 
 <italic>EIF1AY</italic> gene belongs to the family of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (and are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, the 
 <italic>DDX3Y</italic> is an RNA helicase that was described as an important effector of the herpes virus replication and propagation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] but has not been described in the context of the CHIKV. However, our analyses might simply be a reflection of a greater number of males in the chronic group since several of the genes identified were Y linked. This analysis, thus, provides no support for the notion of the onset of new pathological processes in chronic diseasesâ€”an observation in agreement with murine studies [
