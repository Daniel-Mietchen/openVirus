<p>Although no gene was down-regulated in all the three conditions, genes such as 
 <italic>IL7R</italic>, 
 <italic>ESYT1</italic>, 
 <italic>PCYOX1</italic> and 
 <italic>LRRN3</italic> were commonly down-regulated in CHIKV infection and RA samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g006">Fig 6b</xref>). The cytokine IL-7 is crucial for the survival of naïve and memory T cells, which are important effectors against several pathogens including viral infections. The receptor IL-7R is expressed on the surface of these cells and was shown in an animal model to prevent the chronicity induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus due to the enhancement of CD8 T cells’ response and prevention of its exhaustion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We identified a specific CHIKV signature composed of 107 down-regulated genes that includes 
 <italic>CX3CR1</italic>, 
 <italic>BTLA</italic>, 
 <italic>BCL2</italic>, 
 <italic>GZMK</italic> and three genes that encode Fc receptor-like glycoproteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007880.g006">Fig 6b</xref>) that could be related to the lymphopenia induced by CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The down-regulation of CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (
 <italic>CX3CR1</italic>) seems to be in agreement with the results of this study that showed that several T cell effector/differentiation genes were down-regulated in CHIKV infection. CX3CR1 has been considered as an important marker of CD8 memory cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>BCL-2</italic> down-regulation could be a mechanism of CHIKV host response to induce apoptosis of infected cells.
