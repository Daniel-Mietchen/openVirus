<p>The CHIKV signature was compared with signatures from another viral infection (Dengue virus) and from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to check the extent to which the gene signature was specific to CHIKV infection. We re-analyzed two publicly available blood transcriptome datasets and identified the genes whose expression was altered in the Dengue infected patients and RA patients compared to healthy controls. A total of 949, 632 and 302 genes were identified as being up-regulated only in RA, Dengue infection and CHIKV infection, respectively (

 <italic>NLRP3</italic> genes, NFÎºB-related genes and genes that belong to the Th2 response (
