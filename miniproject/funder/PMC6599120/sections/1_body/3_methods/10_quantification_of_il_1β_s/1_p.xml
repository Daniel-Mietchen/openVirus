<p>For 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytokine determination and LDH assay, BMDMs were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 48-well plates and pre-stimulated with 500 ng ml
 <sup>−1</sup> of LPS (tlrl-peklps; InvivoGen) for 3h, and subsequently infected with CHIKV. The cytokines in the supernatants were measured using a mouse IL-1β ELISA kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. LDH measurements were performed with CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The positive control for complete cell lysis and normalization was 9% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific); it was incubated with cells for 15 min. The percentage of LDH release was calculated as (mean OD value of sample / mean OD value of Triton X-100 control sample) × 100 and is shown in the figures as the percentage of cell death compared to TritonX-100 (%).
