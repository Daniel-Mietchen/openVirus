<p>Raw paired-end reads were preprocessed for quality control. The Trimmomatic software version 0.36 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] has been used to remove adapters and contaminants from UniVec database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/UniVec/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/UniVec/</ext-link>), trim the 5′ and 3′ ends with mean quality score below 25 (Phred+33), and discard reads shorter than 40 bp after trimming. We used the parameters “TRAILING:5 HEADCROP:0 LEADING:5 MINLEN:40 ILLUMINACLIP:NextGenPrimerAdaptersUniVec.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:25:25”. Paired-end reads mapping to PhiX Illumina spike-in were removed using Bowtie 2 version 2.2.5 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], with the parameter—very-sensitive-local. The processed forward and reverse read files were then paired using Pairfq software (

 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, version GRCh38.p10 build 38 with the TopHat2 program [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] based on 57,685 genes from 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, excluding the rRNA and globin genes. For the TopHat2 alignment, we considered the following parameters: minimum intron size (30pb), number of mismatches per read (3pb), number of gaps per read (3pb),—very-sensitive, maximum insertion size deletion (3bp), maximum paired-reads distance (200pb) and only concordant uniquely mapped reads (approximately 92% of the mapped reads) were used for further analyses. To quantify the gene abundance of the mapped paired-end reads in each sample, we used the featureCounts tool from the Bioconductor Rsubread package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] with the following parameters: GTF.featureType = “exon”, GTF.attrType = “gene_id”, isPairedEnd = TRUE, requireBothEndsMapped = TRUE, minOverlap = value 1, allowMultiOverlap = FALSE, countMultiMappingReads = FALSE. The total number of read counts per gene was obtained from the RNA-seq expression. Normalization of the gene counts was performed with counts per million normalization (CPM), which accounts for differences in library size and adjusts for GC content and gene length. An unsupervised analysis was performed with the R package “PVCA” to estimate the source of variability of experimental effects [
