<p>The identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed comparing each CHIKV patient to all the healthy controls, and following three steps: (1) only genes with counts per million (CPM) &gt; 1 in at least two samples were used in the analyses; (2) differential expression test was carried out using the Bioconductor package edgeR; and (3) DEGs were identified with an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and fold change &gt; 2. The DEGs shared among CHIKV patients were found using the MetaVolcano web tool (
