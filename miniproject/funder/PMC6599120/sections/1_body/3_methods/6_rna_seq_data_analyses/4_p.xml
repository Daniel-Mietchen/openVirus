<p>Regarding the pathways that may be related to the progression of the disease, a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using as ranks the correlation between the genes and inverse Ct as ranks. A set of Blood Transcriptional Modules (BTM), previously identified by our group [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] through large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptome, were used as the gene sets.
