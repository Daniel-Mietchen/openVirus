<p>Real-time RT-PCR was performed to test for CHIKV, ZIKV and DENV as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007880.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Nucleic acid extraction was performed using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Molecular detection of DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV was performed by using the SuperScript III Platinium One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). We performed the samples’ amplification of the RNAse P in parallel to evaluate the extracted RNA quality. RNA Real-Time RT-PCR reactions consisted of a step of reverse transcription at 50 °C for 15 minutes of the enzyme activation at 95 °C for 2 min, and 45 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for hybridization and extension with the use of ABI 7500 equipment (Applied Biosystems). A cut-off value of Ct (Cycle Threshold) 37 was chosen as the CDC reference assay.
