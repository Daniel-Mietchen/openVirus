<p>For the western blot 10
 <sup>6</sup> BMDMs were seeded in 6-well plates overnight and subsequently primed with 500 ng ml−1 LPS (InvivoGen, tlrl-peklps) for 3 hours prior to infection with CHIKV. The supernatants were collected, and the precleared supernatants were concentrated thrice in speedvac. They were boiled in a Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred (Semidry Transfer Cell, Bio-Rad) to a 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked in a Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.01% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. The rat monoclonal antibody to caspase-1 p20 (1:250, Genentech, 4B4) and specific horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies (1:3,000, KPL, 14-16-06 and 14-13-06) were diluted in blocking buffer for the incubations.
