<p>Data were plotted and analyzed with the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, California). Multiple groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni’s post-test. The differences in values obtained for the two different groups were determined using an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test with a 95% confidence interval. Differences were statistically significant when the p-value was less than 0.05.</p>
