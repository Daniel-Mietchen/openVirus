<p>In order to measure active caspase-1 we used a FLICA assay. Briefly, 10
 <sup>6</sup> BMDMs were seeded in 12-well plates overnight, and then infected with CHIKV at a PFU/cell of 5 for 24 hours. As a positive control, we used 20 μM of nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 40–60 minutes. Following this, the cells were harvested and stained for 1 h with a green fluorescent dye that binds specifically to active caspase-1, FAM-YVAD-FMK (Immunochemistry Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The data were acquired on a FACS ACCURI C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star).
