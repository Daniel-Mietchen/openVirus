<p>Blood samples were collected from subjects reporting arbovirus-like symptoms in the Brazilian states of Sergipe (n = 39 infected and n = 15 controls) and São Paulo (n = 5 controls). Clinical and socio-demographic data were collected through a questionnaire filled out by the patients. Total peripheral blood was collected in Tempus tubes or in heparin-treated tubes that were subsequently transferred to tubes containing RNAlater (Thermo Fisher) and stored at -80°C. A subset of the patients (n = 13) agreed to return for a clinical follow-up. These CHIKV-infected patients were under treatment and their joint manifestations were monitored quarterly. Patients who presented joint pain associated or not with joint or periarticular edema at the onset or significant worsening (in cases of previous joint disease) of the acute febrile syndrome after three months were considered chronic patients.</p>
