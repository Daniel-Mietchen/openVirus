<p>Serum samples were evaluated with a commercial semi-quantitative ELISA kit (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) that detects anti-CHIKV IgM and anti-CHIKV, Zika and Dengue IgG antibodies. All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Briefly, sera were diluted in the sample buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in a microplate well together with a calibrator and the positive and negative controls provided by the manufacturer. The optical density (O.D.) was measured in an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek, Vermont, USA) and the results were calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples with ratio values (Extinction of the control or patient sample / extinction of calibrator) below 0.8 and above 1.1 were considered negative and positive samples, respectively. Samples with ratio values between 0.8 and 1.1 were considered inconclusive.</p>
