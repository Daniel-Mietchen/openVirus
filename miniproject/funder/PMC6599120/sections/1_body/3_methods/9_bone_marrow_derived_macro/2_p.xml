<p>The virus strain CHIKV BzH1 was used and virus stocks were produced by infecting Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) with a PFU (plaque forming units)/cell of 0.1. Conditioned media used for mock infections was prepared from uninfected Vero cells in a similar manner. The PFU/cell of 5 and the time point of 24 hours of infection was used in most of the
