<p>For RNA-seq preparation, the constructed libraries from 39 infected and 20 control samples were barcoded with dual-indexes of 8bp sequence, multiplexed in 6 technical replicates for each infected sample and 2 technical replicates for each control sample. The prepared libraries were sequenced in two HiSeq Illumina runs (one high-output and another one rapid run mode) where each one of the replicates were sequenced on separated lanes to assess inter-run variability.</p>
