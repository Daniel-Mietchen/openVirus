<p>Total RNA from Tempus tube samples were purified with the Tempus Spin RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA from the samples collected in heparin vacutainer tube and maintained in RNAlater were purified using the Ribo Pure blood isolation kit (Invitrogen). Removal of rRNA and globin-encoding mRNA, RNA fragmentation, cDNA generation, adapter ligation and PCR amplification were performed using the TruSeq stranded total RNA with ribo-zero globin sample preparation kit (Illumina). The sequencing of transcriptome libraries was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded RNA Sample Preparation kit with Poli(A)+ selection quantified through qPCR and sequenced using HiSeq SBS V4 kit (2 x 125 bp paired-end reads).</p>
