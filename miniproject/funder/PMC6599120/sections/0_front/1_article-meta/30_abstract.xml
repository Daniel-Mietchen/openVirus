 <p>The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has infected millions of people worldwide and presents a serious public health issue. Acute symptomatic infections caused by contracting this mosquito-transmitted arbovirus are typically associated with an abrupt onset of fever and often debilitating polyarthralgia/ polyarthritis, as well as prolonged periods of disability in some patients. These dramatic effects call for a careful evaluation of the molecular mechanisms involved in this puzzling infection. By analyzing the blood transcriptome of adults acutely infected with CHIKV, we were able to provide a detailed picture of the early molecular events induced by the infection. Additionally, the systems biology approach revealed genes that can be investigated extensively as probable therapeutic targets for the disease.</p>
