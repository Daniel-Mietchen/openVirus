  <title>Transcriptome changes in chronic and/or non-chronic subjects compared to healthy individuals.</title>
  <p>(a) Comparison of the levels of CHIKV RNA (inverse of Ct) between chronic (n = 6) and non-chronic (n = 7) subjects. (b) The number of genes consistently differentially expressed in chronic (brown) and non-chronic (green) subjects. The x-axis represents the number of CHIKV-infected subjects used in each analysis and the y-axis indicates the number of DEGs consistently identified. The green and brown circles represent the number of DEGs in at least 70% of the samples in each group. (c) Representation of DEGs in at least 70% of the chronic and/or non-chronic patients compared to healthy subjects. (d) Genes that overlapped in (c) but that present an inverse behavior depending on the group. (e) Pearson correlation between mean log2 fold-change of chronic patients and non-chronic patients relative to the health controls.</p>
