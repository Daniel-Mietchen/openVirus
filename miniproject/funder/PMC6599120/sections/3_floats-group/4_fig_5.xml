  <title>Modular analysis of CHIKV infection.</title>
  <p>(a) Expression profile of all the eight modules obtained through the CEMiTool analysis. The colors of rectangles represent the days post the onset of symptoms, and the black line represents the mean expression of all the genes inside the module. (b) Results of the gene set enrichment analysis showing the module activity for each subgroup. The size and color of the circles represent the normalized enrichment score (NES). (c) Over-representation analysis of module M8 using BTM pathways as gene sets. The pathways were ordered by significance as indicated on the x-axis. (d) Gene network of module M8 for the top ten most connected genes (hubs) represented as nodes and their protein-protein and co-expression interactions as edges. The size of the node represents its degree of connectivity.</p>
