  <title>The network of genes whose expression is positively correlated with the levels of CHIKV RNA.</title>
  <p>Minimum networks constructed using the gene sets that presented a positive NES score with the NetworkAnalyst tool. The red nodes represent genes that are positively correlated with CHIKV RNA, and the color scheme indicates its strength. The gray nodes were added by NetworkAnalyst and are not a part of the correlated genes.</p>
