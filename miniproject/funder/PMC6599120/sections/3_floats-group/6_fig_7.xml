  <title>CHIKV activates inflammasome in murine macrophages.</title>
  <p>(a) Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with CHIKV with a PFU/cell of 5 or not infected (NI); after 24 hours of infection, the cells were stained for active caspase-1 with FAM-YVAD. The percentage (left) and the integrated mean of fluorescence (iMFI) of the activated cells (right) is shown. (b) After 24 hours of infection, supernatants were harvested from non-infected (NI) or CHIKV-infected BMDMs treated with LPS as depicted and levels of cleaved caspase-1 (p20) were detected by western blotting in the supernatant. (c) LPS-primed BMDMs were infected with CHIKV with a PFU/cell of one or five. After 24 hours of infection, the levels of IL-1β (left) and LDH (right) in the cell-free supernatants were measured. (d) Production of IL-1β by BMDMs from wild type (C57BL/6) or Casp1/11 deficient mice 24 hours post-CHIKV infection. Data from (a), (c) and (d) are represented as the mean ± SD of the triplicate samples and are representative of the three independent experiments that yielded similar results. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s t-test. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. *P &lt; 0.05.</p>
