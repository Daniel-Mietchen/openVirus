  <title>Gene set enrichment analysis of BTM pathways.</title>
  <p>GSEA was performed for each infected sample against the healthy control to retrieve results from the BTM pathways that were most consistently altered. The BTMs were used as gene sets and their respective log2 fold-change results were considered as rank. Each column represents the results from the GSEA comparison of each infected sample with the healthy control. The pathway names are indicated in the right side of the heatmap. The pathwaysâ€™ profiles were ordered according to the mean of the NES scores across all patients.</p>
