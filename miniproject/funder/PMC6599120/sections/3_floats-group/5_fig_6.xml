  <title>Comparing CHIKV signatures with those from rheumatoid arthritis and Dengue infection.</title>
  <p>(a) Genes up-regulated in patients infected with either CHIKV or Dengue or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients compared to their respective controls. The size of the bar represents the quantity of up-regulated genes detected in one or more groups (indicated as a gray circle in the graph below). Representative up-regulated genes are displayed. The gray circles below the bars indicate the groups that share the same up-regulated genes. (b) The same approach as in (a) but for the down-regulated genes.</p>
