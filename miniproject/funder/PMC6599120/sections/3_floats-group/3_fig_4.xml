  <title>Differentially expressed genes in CHIKV patients.</title>
  <p>(a) The profile of each infected patient was compared with all of the healthy controls to indicate the number of up- and down-regulated genes. The colors represent the number of up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (blue) genes and the respective number of genes in each group. The bar graph to the right indicates the CHIKV RNA levels for each patient. (b) The meta-volcano analysis showed genes that were consistently differentially expressed (log2 fold change &gt; 1 and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) in at least 70% of the comparisons from CHIKV patients versus healthy controls. The x-axis represents the number of consistent differential expressions of each gene while the y-axis represents the number of studies in which the genes were classified as a DEG. (c) Graphical representation of the putative relationship between some of the genes that were classified as consistently up-regulated in (b).</p>
