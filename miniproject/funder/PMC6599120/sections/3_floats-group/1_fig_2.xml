  <title>Gene signatures associated with levels of CHIKV RNA.</title>
  <p>(a) Representation of genes whose expression were correlated (Pearsonâ€™s r) with the levels of CHIKV RNA (inverse Ct). The respective number of genes positively (red) or negatively (blue) correlated with the levels of CHIKV RNA are shown (p-adjusted value &lt; 0.01 and |R| &gt; 0.5). (b) Results of GSEA conducted using the correlation values between expression and inverse Ct as ranks and BTMs as gene sets. The stars correspond with the gene sets used to construct the networks shown in panel C (negatively correlated pathways) and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007880.s003">S2 Fig</xref> (positively correlated pathways). (c) Minimum network constructed using the gene sets that presented a negative NES score with the NetworkAnalyst tool. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) data was based on InnateDB and the graph was generated with the Cytoscape tool. Blue nodes represent genes that are negatively correlated with levels of CHIKV RNA and the color scheme indicates its strength. The gray nodes were added by NetworkAnalyst and are not a part of the correlated genes.
