<p>The double typing of questionnaires was performed using EpiData version 3.1 (Lauristen JM (Ed.), Odense, Denmark), SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R software (R Core Team, 2018) for statistical analyses. Categorical variables are expressed as proportions, and continuous variables are expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs; 75
 <sup>th</sup> and 25
 <sup>th</sup>). Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to verify that the data were normally distributed. We used non-parametric tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U-test, to compare the medians, and the chi-squared test to compare the proportions, with a significance level of 5% (p&lt;0.05).
