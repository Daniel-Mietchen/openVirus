<p>In the multivariate analysis model, we observed the best model that fit the assumptions and obtained a better AIC score (lower AIC). The highest adjusted R-squared (R
 <sup>2</sup>) using hospital stay (days) and costs as the dependent variable is shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0219287.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. These models explained approximately 33.4% (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.334) of hospitalisation time and 79.3% (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.793) of hospitalisation costs.
