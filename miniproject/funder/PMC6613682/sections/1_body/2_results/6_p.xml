<p>Regarding the hospital stay and costs, although nonsignificant (p = 0.107), the length of hospitalisation was higher in patients transfused with criteria. However, when we analysed the cost, these values were lower in patients transfused with criteria (median US$ 478.0) than in patients transfused without criteria (median US$ 674.3) (p = 299). In the non-transfused patient group (with criteria vs. without criteria), both time (p = 0.022) and cost (p = 0.225) were higher in non-transfused patients with WHO criteria for transfusion (
