<p>Surprisingly, among the non-transfused group, 4.4% (12/271) should have received transfusions. Additionally, in the non-transfused group (not transfused with criteria), the median hospitalisation time (4 IQR 5–2) was significantly higher (p = 0.022) than that in the non-transfused group without criteria (3 IQR 4–2). Although nonsignificant, the median costs were 34.1% higher for not transfused with criteria (US$ 220.4 IQR 571–137.5) than for not transfused without criteria (US$ 164.4 IQR 403.4–136.9), demonstrating that not performing transfusion when indicated may compromise proper patient recovery and increase costs.</p>
