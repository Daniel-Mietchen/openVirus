<p>No references were found to compare the hospitalisation time in cases of transfusion in Brazil for patients without WHO criteria. However, our result was similar to a study conducted by 
 <italic>Lye</italic> et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0219287.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] in Singapore; in this study, patients who received platelet transfusions had a median hospital stay of 6 days (4–8 days), while patients who did not receive a transfusion had a median stay of 5 days (4–7).
