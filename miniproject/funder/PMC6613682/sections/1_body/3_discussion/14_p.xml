<p>Unfortunately, the design of the present study was limited; we could not evaluate the costs according to a societal perspective or determine why physicians did not follow the WHO recommendations, including why blood transfusions decreased from 2010 to 2017. Additionally, we could not determine whether the deaths were directly related to the use of blood products. However, this study analysed and quantified the costs of dengue cases that involved the use blood products, including platelets, FFP or Packed Red Cell (PRC), with or without adherence to WHO recommendations.</p>
