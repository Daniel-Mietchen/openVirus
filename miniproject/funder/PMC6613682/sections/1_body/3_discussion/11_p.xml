<p>Although only 4 of 52 patients (7%) experienced side effects, 75% (3/4) of these side effects could have been avoided as they resulted from transfusion in patients without criteria. In addition, the side effects occurred in a greater proportion of patients who were transfused without criteria (3/27; 11%) than that of those with criteria (1/25; 4%); however, this difference was nonsignificant (p = 0.3363). Moreover, the number of cases (n = 4) was too small to allow for a robust assertion that patients transfused without criteria had a higher likelihood of presenting side effects.</p>
