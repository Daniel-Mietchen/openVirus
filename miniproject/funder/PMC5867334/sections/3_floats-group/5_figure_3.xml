  <p>Effect of two comprehensive intervention packages on 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> incidence among people who inject drugs (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content>) 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and their heterosexual sex partners 
   <bold>(B)</bold> in all seven Middle East and North Africa (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">MENA</styled-content>) countries. The package with the less optimistic scenario includes reducing sharing by 25%, reducing the number of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content> by 10% and reducing injecting frequency by 10% (effect of opioid substitution therapy), increasing 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> coverage to 50%, and increasing condom use by 25%. The package with the more optimistic scenario includes reducing sharing by 75%, reducing the number of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content> by 10% and reducing injecting frequency by 30%, increasing 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">ART</styled-content> coverage to 81%, and increasing condom use by 75%. The graphs display the number of new 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> infections and the number of infections averted in comparison with baseline (current year) estimations of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> incidence among 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content> and their heterosexual sex partners.
