   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> transmission pathways in the population arising from injecting drug use. Panel 
   <bold>(A)</bold> displays the various 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">HIV</styled-content> transmission pathways that are due to injecting drug use, starting among people who inject drugs (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content>) and percolation of infection to the wider non‐injecting community – mainly sexual partners of current and ex‐
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content>. The blue oval refers to the 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case">PWID</styled-content> population, while the white space around it refers to the general population. Black arrows refer to transmission chains. Panels 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> provide one example from Pakistan for the number of incident 
   <bold>(B)</bold> and prevalent 
   <bold>(C)</bold> infections that are caused by these transmission pathways and that affect the different members of the injecting and non‐injecting communities.
