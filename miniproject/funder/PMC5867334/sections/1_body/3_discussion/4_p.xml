<p>We also found that a substantial number of HIV infections in the general population are linked to infections among PWID, due to individuals who acquired the infection in the past through drug injection, but are no longer injecting, and due to onward transmission to sexual partners. We estimated that about 30% of incident HIV infections that are due to injecting drug use are among sexual partners of current/ex‐PWID, and about half of prevalent infections are among ex‐PWID and sexual partners of current/ex‐PWID (Figure

Our findings agree with recent Mode of Transmission analyses in the region that estimated a substantial number of HIV infections among sexual partners/spouses of persons engaging in HIV high‐risk behaviour such as PWID, clients of female sex workers and MSM
