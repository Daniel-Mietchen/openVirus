<p>Also, as with all modelling work, the robustness of our findings depends on the quality of input data. While we used the best‐available data in the region, including many quality integrated bio‐behavioural surveillance surveys (IBBSS) 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, the availability and quality of data varied between countries, and there were no MENA‐specific data on some parameters. Noticeable decrease in Global Fund funding for the conduct of IBBSS in the region, as well as rising conflicts with competing national priorities in several countries, have contributed to some of these data gaps. To accommodate for the uncertainty in input parameters, we conducted uncertainty analyses with wide ranges for parameters.
