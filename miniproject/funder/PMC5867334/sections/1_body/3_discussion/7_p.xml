<p>Furthermore, estimations were possible in only seven MENA countries with sufficient epidemiological data indicating HIV transmission among PWID. In a number of countries, there are no data about HIV prevalence in PWID, and these countries were naturally not included in our analysis. In others such as Lebanon and Jordan, some studies have been conducted but, in the samples collected, there were no HIV‚Äêpositive cases. While there might be hidden HIV epidemics among PWID, or some small background transmission, these were not captured by available studies. This, however, may also truly reflect that HIV has not yet been sufficiently introduced to PWID networks to start epidemic transmission in these countries.</p>
