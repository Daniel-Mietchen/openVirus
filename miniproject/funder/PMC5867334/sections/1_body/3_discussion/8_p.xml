<p>We also assumed that available HIV bio‚Äêbehavioural data in each included country is representative of the epidemic at national level and also assumed that current HIV prevalence is the same as most recent representative HIV prevalence. However, these assumptions are only approximately valid. In countries where HIV prevalence data came from only a few geographical localities, our estimates can be biased if these available data are not representative of HIV prevalence among PWID at the national level. For example, in Libya, the HIV prevalence data came from one city, Tripoli

Running our model separately in the two localities generated an incidence of 0.1% ppy in Tanger and 7.4% ppy in Nador, highlighting the diversity of the epidemic within Morocco (data not shown). There is however solid epidemiological evidence that the HIV PWID epidemic in both Iran and Pakistan has reached high levels at the national level
