<p>In addition to providing estimates of incidence, our study provided insights into HIV epidemic dynamics among PWID. Our analyses indicated that current levels of injecting risk behaviour could not explain observed prevalence nor the speed at which these epidemics rose. While it could be partially due to underreporting of risk behaviour, this suggests that the epidemic was initially spreading among PWID sub‐groups with higher levels of risk behaviour. These findings agree with the contextual understanding of these epidemics. For example, the HIV PWID epidemics in Iran and Pakistan started in prisons

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, with one study measuring a very high HIV incidence rate of 17.2% ppy among incarcerated PWID in a Tehran prison in 2002 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. In Libya, assuming even extreme levels of risk behaviour at epidemic onset could not retrace the course of the epidemic. Since PWID have relatively short injecting careers and high turnover, it is difficult to understand how HIV prevalence has reached such high level. Possibly, this may reflect a very recent HIV sub‐epidemic among the PWID group that was sampled in Tripoli.
