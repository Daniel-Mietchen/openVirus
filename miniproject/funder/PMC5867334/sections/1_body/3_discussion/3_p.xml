<p>Our estimates of HIV incidence among PWID are overall consistent with our epidemiological understanding of the HIV epidemic among PWID in each country 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, and are congruent with the estimated size of the epidemic in the whole population per UNAIDS Spectrum estimates 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. For example, PWID contributed the vast majority of HIV infections in Iran, a country with an established HIV epidemic among PWID

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> and where injecting drug use is the main driver of the epidemic at the national level

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>. Similarly, a small contribution of PWID to total incidence was found in Tunisia and Morocco; two countries where the HIV epidemic is mainly focused among men who have sex with men (MSM) and commercial sex networks respectively
