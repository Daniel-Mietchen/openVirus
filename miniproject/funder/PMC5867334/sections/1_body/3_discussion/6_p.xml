<p>There were several limitations in our study. Though we used an elaborate mathematical model structure, our results may depend on the model structure used. For example, we did not account for sexual transmission of HIV among PWID, for anal sex with same‚Äêsex partners, and for further onward transmission beyond the direct spouses/sexual partners. This implies that the impact of PWID as drivers of HIV infection in the population is even larger than what we have estimated with our model. The model also assumes essentially a static structure of injecting groups and does not strictly factor in the full dynamics of partnership formation and dissolution.</p>
