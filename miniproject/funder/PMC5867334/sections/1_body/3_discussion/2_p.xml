<p>A relatively high HIV incidence rate among PWID was found in most MENA countries with at least 1% prevalence among PWID (range: 4% to 8% ppy), supporting recent analyses indicating concentrated and at times rapidly growing HIV epidemics among PWID 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. A lower incidence rate of about 1% ppy was estimated in Afghanistan, where epidemiological data points to a nascent localized HIV epidemic among PWID

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Libya stood out with an estimated incidence rate of 25% ppy. This reflects the very high 87% HIV prevalence among PWID found in the best study in this country â€“ one of the highest prevalence ever reported among PWID globally, a figure difficult to interpret and generalize for all of Libya in view of the limited data in this country
