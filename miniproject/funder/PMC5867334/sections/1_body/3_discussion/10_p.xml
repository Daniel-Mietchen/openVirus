<p>Despite these limitations, this study fills an important gap in estimating HIV infection levels in MENA. HIV‐related estimates in MENA are typically produced through established mathematical models applied globally such as UNAIDS Spectrum 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> and the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) models 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. While these models provide two different approaches for HIV estimations, their focus is on total population‐level estimates

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, which may overlook the dynamics of infection among hidden KPs such as PWID. In this study, we model HIV transmission specifically among PWID, and use quality input data derived from this same population. Such ‘microscopic’ approach could potentially offer more realistic estimations, and may explain some of the inconsistencies observed between our estimates and those of UNAIDS and GBD. One example is the lower than expected contribution of PWID to total incidence we estimated in Afghanistan and Pakistan – two countries where the epidemic is apparently largely driven by injecting drug use 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. In Afghanistan, a similar HIV incidence rate of 1.5% ppy was measured among PWID in a cohort study 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Under‐reporting of injecting risk behaviour, hidden HIV epidemics among PWID in sites not covered by the IBBSS, and emerging and/or hidden HIV epidemics among other KPs such as MSM in Pakistan, could be potential explanations to the observed lower contribution of PWID to total incidence. Another example is the exceeding number of incident infections we estimated among PWID in Egypt compared to UNAIDS estimated total number of infections in the population, which could be due to the fact that the concentrated HIV epidemic among PWID may be limited to the two cities where the IBBSS studies were conducted. Careful triangulation of multiple sources of evidence is needed to alleviate some of these apparent contradictions, which in truth may reflect incomplete understanding of HIV epidemiology
