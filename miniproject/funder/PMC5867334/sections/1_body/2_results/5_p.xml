<p>The impact of interventions on HIV incidence among PWID and/or their sexual partners is in Table

 <xref rid="jia225102-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Reducing sharing by 25%, 50% and 75% respectively was associated with a similar proportional reduction in the number of incident infections among PWID. Reducing sharing by 25% would avert 20 to 53 infections per year in Afghanistan, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia; over 800 infections in Egypt; and about 1700 infections in Iran and Pakistan each. A reduction in sharing by 75% would avert over 5000 infections per year in each of Iran and Pakistan (Table
