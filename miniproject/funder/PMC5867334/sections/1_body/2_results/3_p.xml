 <xref rid="jia225102-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref> features also results of the uncertainty analysis with 25% variation around model parameters, whereas the impact of a 50% variation on our estimations can be found in Additional File

 <xref rid="jia225102-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>. The estimated incidence rate among PWID was lowest in Tunisia and Afghanistan at 0.7% (95% UI: 0.4% to 1.4%) and 1.2% (95% UI: 0.8% to 2.4%) per person‐year (ppy) respectively, and highest in Pakistan at 7.8% ppy (95% UI: 4.3% to 13.4%). Libya, at an HIV prevalence of 87% among PWID 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, was an outlier with an estimated incidence rate of 24.8% ppy (95% UI: 13.3% to 41.3%). The incidence rate in remaining countries was around 4% ppy. The estimated number of incident infections for the current year was lowest in Tunisia (n = 79) and Morocco (n = 99), and highest in Iran and Pakistan (around 6700 each). These PWID incident infections represent over 90% of all incident cases in the total population in Iran, 39% in Pakistan, 16% to 21% in Tunisia and Afghanistan, and 8% in Morocco. In addition, 20 to 2208 and 5 to 837 new infections were estimated at country‐level among sexual partners of current and ex‐PWID for this year respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225102-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>).
