<p>Increasing ART coverage to 25%, 50% and 81% of all infected PWID would reduce incidence among PWID and their sexual partners at country‐level by 5% to 14%, 12% to 32% and 40% to 54% respectively (Table

 <xref rid="jia225102-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In all seven countries combined, 50% ART coverage would result in 5100 and 1400 infections averted per year among PWID and their sexual partners respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225102-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Increasing condom use by 25%, 50% and 75% would result in 11%, 21% and 32% reduction in the number of annual infections among sexual partners of PWID (Table
