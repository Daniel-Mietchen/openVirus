<p>In total, we estimated that about 82,000 to 90,000 infections happened among PWID since the start of the PWID HIV epidemic in Iran and Pakistan each; over 12,250 happened in Egypt; 1753 happened in Afghanistan; and over 760 happened in Morocco and Tunisia each (Table

Similarly, up to 18,244 and 4360 HIV infections were among sexual partners of current and ex‐PWID respectively, in each of Iran and Pakistan since the start of the PWID HIV epidemic. After accounting for stopping injection and mortality, we estimated that there are currently, at country‐level, 347 to 32,279 prevalent HIV infections among current PWID, 119 to 16,540 among ex‐PWID, and 67 to 10,752 and 12 to 2863 among sexual partners of current and ex‐PWID respectively. The lowest numbers of prevalent infections were in Morocco and Tunisia, while the highest were in Iran and Pakistan (Table
