<p>The model uses input data on HIV prevalence, number of times a needle/syringe is reused, and levels of effective syringe cleaning to estimate number of HIV transmissions per sharing event. The model then estimates HIV incidence in the total PWID population using data on size of the PWID population, frequency of injecting, and levels of sharing. We extended the model by adjusting for the effect of ART (ART efficacy and country‐specific coverage levels in Tables

 <xref rid="jia225102-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref> respectively) and allowing heterogeneity in injecting risk behaviour. We also allowed the number of times a needle/syringe is reused to be a function of the sharing group size (model structure and equations in Additional file
