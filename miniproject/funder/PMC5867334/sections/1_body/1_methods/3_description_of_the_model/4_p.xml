<p>To account for heterogeneity in risk behaviour, we assumed that the size of the sharing group in each country follows a gamma distribution. This is a widely used probability distribution to model heterogeneity in diverse biological, ecological and physical phenomena. Since the gamma distribution is right skewed, it assumes that the majority of the PWID population share injections in smaller groups whereas a small fraction shares in larger groups (such as at shooting galleries), as suggested by behavioural and qualitative studies

In the absence of clear data to parameterize this variability in injecting risk behaviour, the parameters of the gamma distribution were informed by available data on the variability in sexual risk behaviour and networking, and assumed that the variance of the gamma distribution is equal to its mean
