<p>We adapted the Kwon 
 <italic>et al</italic>. mathematical model of parenteral HIV transmission among PWID to estimate HIV incidence 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. This is a cohort‐type model that assumes that sharing of needles/syringes occurs in groups of specific size, where PWID share in random order, and where each PWID injects once per sharing event. HIV transmissions through sharing needles/syringes can then occur in groups containing an infected person.
