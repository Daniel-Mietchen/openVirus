<p>We also examined the impact of two packages that include a combination of the above‐mentioned interventions. These packages bracket the realm of plausibility for interventions within the MENA context and have been reached, at least in part, in other regions, such as the impressive scale‐up of ART in resource‐limited settings in sub‐Saharan Africa. The less optimistic scenario includes reducing sharing by 25%, reducing the number of PWID by 10% and the frequency of injecting by 10% (effect of OST), increasing ART coverage to 50%, and increasing condom use by 25%. The more optimistic scenario includes reducing sharing by 75%, reducing the number of PWID by 10% and the frequency of injecting by 30%, increasing ART coverage to 81%, and increasing condom use by 75%.</p>
