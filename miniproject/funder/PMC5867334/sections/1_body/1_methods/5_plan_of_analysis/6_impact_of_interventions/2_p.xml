<p>We examined the effect of select interventions targeted at PWID: (1) Reducing current sharing of needles/syringes by 25%, 50%, and 75% on HIV incidence among PWID, (2) Introducing opioid substitution therapy (OST) resulting in 10% reduction in the number of PWID and a 10%, 20%, or 30% reduction in the frequency of injecting, on HIV incidence among PWID, (3) Expanding ART coverage among PWID based on most recent test‐and‐treat World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines

Of note, that the impact of ART is dependent on adherence and existing coverage levels in each country.
