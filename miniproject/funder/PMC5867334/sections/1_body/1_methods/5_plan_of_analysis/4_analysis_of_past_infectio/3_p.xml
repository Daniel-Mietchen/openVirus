<p>Iterating this process over time provides an estimate for HIV prevalence in the last year. As the observed HIV prevalence tended to be higher than the estimated prevalence in the last year, we increased the level of risk behaviour in the first iteration, accounting for higher risk behaviour in earlier years of the epidemic, and used linear interpolation to reach observed HIV prevalence levels at the last year. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in one country, Iran, assuming an exponential, rather than linear, decrease in injecting risk behaviour over time. In Libya, the measured HIV prevalence (87%
