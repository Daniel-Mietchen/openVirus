<p>We estimated the number of HIV infections that have ever been acquired among PWID in each country (past infections; that is infections that occurred before the current year) by retracing the course of the HIV epidemic among PWID starting from the year of epidemic emergence, informed by epidemiological data 
 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225102-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>). We started with 1% HIV prevalence among PWID at the start of the epidemic HIV transmission and, in each country, ran the model the number of times equal to years since HIV epidemic emergence. HIV prevalence in each year was recalculated by adding the number of incident infections in this year to the number of prevalent infections from previous years, while adjusting for PWID who (a) stopped injecting, or (b) died from “natural” mortality (all causes, including overdose), or (c) died from HIV disease mortality.
