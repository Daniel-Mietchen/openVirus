<p>We conducted, in each of the seven countries included, the following estimations that capture the different HIV transmission pathways arising from injecting drug use in the population (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225102-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). They include estimations of incident and/or prevalent infections among PWID, ex‐PWID, and sexual partners of infected current and ex‐PWID. We estimated incidence due to heterosexual sex between infected PWID and their partners. HIV incidence was defined as the number of new infections per year, and incidence
