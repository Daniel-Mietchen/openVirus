<p>Multivariate uncertainty analysis was conducted to specify the range of uncertainty in the estimated HIV incidence for the current year among PWID and their sexual partners. Two sets of uncertainty analyses were conducted, one where model parameters were varied within 25% of their point estimates, as a reasonable variation based on existing similar modelling studies

 <xref rid="jia225102-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, and another more conservative analysis with 50% variation around model parameters values. In both, HIV prevalence was varied within its measured 95% confidence interval (TableÂ
