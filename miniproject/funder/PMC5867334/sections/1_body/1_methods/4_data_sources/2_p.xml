Data from integrated bio‐behavioural surveillance surveys were preferred over prevalence data generated through other convenience cross‐sectional studies. National‐level estimates from these studies, when available, were used. In countries with specific location (such as city‐based) prevalence measures, the mean HIV prevalence was calculated across these measures. In four out of the seven countries included in our study (Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Tunisia), HIV prevalence data came from multiple cities/provinces, and in two of these countries (Iran and Pakistan), the studies had a national coverage with 10 to 16 cities/provinces included
