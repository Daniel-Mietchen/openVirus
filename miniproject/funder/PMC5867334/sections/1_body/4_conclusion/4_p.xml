<p>HIV surveillance among PWID must be expanded in MENA, mainly through the conduct of repeated rounds of IBBSS. Inclusion of sexual partners of PWID should be considered, as well as population size estimations. Generating such epidemiological data will help monitor HIV epidemics, improve quality of input data for estimation studies, guide policy and programmes, and track PWID through the HIV treatment cascade.</p>
