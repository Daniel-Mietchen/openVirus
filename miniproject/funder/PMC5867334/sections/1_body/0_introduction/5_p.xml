<p>In this study, we use mathematical modelling to estimate, at country‐level in MENA, HIV incidence among PWID due to non‐sterile drug injections. We also estimate HIV incidence among their sexual partners due to heterosexual sex with infected PWID, and delineate the role of injecting drug use as a driver (that is the factor behind direct and onward transmission) of the HIV epidemic in the population. Our approach is comprehensive and aims to explore and quantify the different HIV transmission pathways in the population that are initiated by injecting drug use.</p>
