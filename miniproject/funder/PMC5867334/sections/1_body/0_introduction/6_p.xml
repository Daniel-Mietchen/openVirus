<p>Specific objectives are to estimate: (1) the number of incident HIV infections among PWID and their sexual partners, (2) the total number of HIV infections that were acquired among PWID and their sexual partners since the emergence of the PWID HIV epidemic, (3) the number of HIV infections among ex‐PWID and their sexual partners, where ex‐PWID are individuals who acquired HIV infection while injecting but have stopped injecting in the past year, and hence could be missed by programmes targeting current drug users, and (4) the impact of select interventions on HIV incidence among PWID and their sexual partners.</p>
