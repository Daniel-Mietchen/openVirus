<p>This is the first study characterizing a mosaic H1 hemagglutinin as a broadly-reactive immunogen for the prevention of H1N1 influenza virus infections. Our mosaic design is even more unique than other published strategies because we used only the unique full-length H1 HA sequences in the database to create the mosaic gene. This excluded repeated sequences that would have biased the immunogen and reduced the overall coverage of protection. The mosaic HA immunogen was expressed in an Adenovirus type 5 replication-defective virus. The H1 mosaic immunogen induced strong cellular and humoral immune responses against divergent H1N1 influenza virus strains. In addition, the H1 mosaic immunogen also provided complete protection against a sublethal infection with the A/Nanchang/1/1999 influenza virus. More impressively, the mosaic H1 immunogen provided complete protection against death when challenged with lethal doses of A/Fort Monmouth/1/47 and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 influenza viruses. Our data indicate that mosaic immunogens can induce broadly-reactive immunity and warrant further investigation as a universal influenza vaccine strategy. </p>
