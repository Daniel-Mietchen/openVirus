<p>In addition to being superior to the inactivated vaccine at inducing antibody responses, another benefit of adenovirus vectored vaccines is their ability to induce T cell responses. We detected T cell responses in all adenovirus immunized animals with the Ad5-mosaic vaccine able to induce robust responses to each of the H1 HAs measured. While we determined cross-reactive immune responses only to H1 antigens, it is likely that protection against other influenza viruses will require multiple immunogens. Co-administration of mosaic immunogens representing different influenza HA subtypes including H2, H3, and H5, as well as neuraminidase types N1 and N2, may have promise as universal influenza vaccine immunogens. Previous work has shown that multiple synthetic immunogens can be combined into a multivalent vaccine without losing efficacy of the individual components [

In this study we show that our mosaic immunogen is able to elicit broad levels of humoral and cellular immunity and cross-protection against divergent H1N1 influenza virus strains. Based on these data we believe that this strategy should be further explored as a strategy for the development of universal influenza vaccine immunogens.
