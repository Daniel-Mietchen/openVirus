<p>Mosaic immunogens have been explored over the past decade as a vaccination strategy to protect against viruses with high population diversity, such as influenza H5 and HIV [

The synthetic mosaic protein localizes towards the pre 2009 H1 population due to the higher degree of diversity in these viruses relative to the post 2009 pandemic viruses. This is important since the mosaic immunogen is designed to provide the greatest level of protection against the most diverse strains. Clearly, the greatest level of genetic diversity exists outside of the Pdm09 cluster. The mosaic HA was cloned into an Adenovirus type 5 vector and used to vaccinate mice in order to evaluate the cross-protective immune responses. Mice immunized with Ad5-mosaic induced high antibodies across the diverse H1 population when measured by ELISA, but minimal responses when measured by HAI assay. This difference could be due to the sensitivity of each assay or due to the ability of ELISA to detect a broader range of HA antibodies, especially antibodies to the HA stalk region [
