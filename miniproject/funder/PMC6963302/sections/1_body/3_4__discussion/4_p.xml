<p>Mice immunized with Ad5-mosaic showed protection against both highly lethal influenza challenges conducted. The A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 challenge viruses are both similar to the A/PR/8/34 HA included in the Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine. For both 100MLD
 <sub>50</sub> challenges, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were protected at comparable levels to the matched Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccinated animals. Importantly, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated animals only showed detectable antibodies against A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 when measured by ELISA, but no detectable antibodies when measured by HAI assay. In contrast, the mismatched Ad5-Pdm09 vaccinated mice showed severe weight loss and death for both the A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 challenges.
