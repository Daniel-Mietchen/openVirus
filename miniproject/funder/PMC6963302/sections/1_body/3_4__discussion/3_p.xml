<p>Using a sublethal A/Nanchang/1/99 challenge we were able to show greater cross-protection from the adenoviral vectored vaccines than the inactivated Fluzone vaccine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f006">Figure 6</xref>). All mice immunized with adenovirus expressing HA, including the divergent Ad5-Pdm09 vaccinated mice, were protected from weight loss. In contrast, the Fluzone vaccine, which contains a similar HA to the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine, was unable to provide protection (weight loss in this group was comparable to the PBS negative control). The stronger cross-protection from adenovirus vectored vaccines than inactivated virus vaccines has been previously shown for IAV [
 <xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, the reduced effectiveness of the inactivated vaccine corresponded to lower antibody and overall T cell responses. Despite increased immunogenicity, adenoviral vectored vaccines are currently not licensed for human vaccine use. Therefore, additional vaccine platforms could be investigated to maximize the immune response to vaccination.
