<p>The mosaic vaccine induced strong cellular responses across diverse influenza strains. Previous studies show that inactivated vaccines induce much weaker cellular responses than other vaccine strategies [

 <xref rid="B36-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As expected, the Fluzone vaccinated mice elicited low T cell responses to all four influenza HA virus strains. In contrast, Ad5-vectored vaccines induced robust T cell responses with the Ad5-mosaic vaccine generally inducing stronger responses across the breadth of tested HAs with responses focused on two areas of HA1 and HA2 (

Since epitope mapping is specific to the MHC complex of BALB/c mice, we wanted to explore whether these epitopes have been previously linked to immune responses in other models. Immunostimulatory peptide sequences were submitted to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource to identify additional published immunological information (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref> have been reported for multiple mouse, human, and non-human primate MHC types. In addition, most of the immunostimulatory peptides have been linked to B and T cell immune responses. Importantly, the database does not reflect a complete report for each peptide and additional biological relevance may be discovered in future studies.
