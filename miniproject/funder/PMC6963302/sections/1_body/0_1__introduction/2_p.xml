<p>Many universal influenza vaccine strategies have been investigated. Surface viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the most common targets for vaccines, however, they provide limited cross-protection. Recent studies have targeted the HA stalk region which is more conserved than the HA head domain [
