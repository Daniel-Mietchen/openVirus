<p>In this study, a mosaic HA vaccine was designed to contain the most potential B and T cell epitopes (PBTE) across a spectrum of human H1 influenza viruses using the mosaic vaccine designer tool which predicts the sequence containing the most linear PBTE [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, this is the first published study that applies the mosaic vaccine immunogen approach to human H1 influenza virus. This is important since the majority of circulating IAV strains are of the H1 and H3 subtypes. Here we analyzed the immune response and protection induced by a monovalent H1 HA mosaic immunogen expressed in an adenoviral vector.
