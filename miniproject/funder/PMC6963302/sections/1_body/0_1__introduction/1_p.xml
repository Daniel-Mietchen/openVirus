<p>Annually, influenza A virus (IAV) infects ~5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children worldwide, resulting in up to 650,000 deaths each year [

 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ability of IAV to mutate, reassort, and infect multiple hosts results in a diverse viral population that causes annual epidemics and occasionally pandemic outbreaks. One of the most prominent examples is the 2009 influenza pandemic (Pdm09). A triple reassorted swine, avian, and human H1N1 influenza virus infected 24% of the global population [

 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current influenza vaccine approaches are not well equipped to protect against novel strains as they induce a strain-specific immune response and matching vaccines can take up to six months to develop [
