<p>Serum samples were treated with a 1:3 dilution of serum: receptor destroying enzyme (370013; Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C overnight, heat inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min, and tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay with 0.5% chicken red blood cells. Briefly, serum was serial diluted two-fold in a 96 well V-bottom plate starting at a 1:10 dilution. An equal volume (25 uL) of 4 HAU dilution of virus was added to each well and incubated for 30 min before adding 50 μL of 0.5% chicken red blood cells and incubating 30 min before reading hemagglutination pattern.</p>
