<p>The human influenza H1 mosaic (mosaic) hemagglutinin (HA) immunogen was designed using the Mosaic Vaccine Designer (Los Alamos National Laboratories Database, Los Alamos, U.S.A.). All unique full-length human H1 influenza HA sequences from 1918 to 2018 were downloaded from the Influenza Research Database (duplicate sequences and laboratory strains excluded). The resulting 6908 sequences were submitted to the Mosaic Vaccine Designer in fasta format with the following parameters: Cocktail Size: 3, Epitope Length: 9, Rare Threshold: 1, Run Time: 10 h, Population size: 200, Cycle Time: 10, Stall Time: 10, Internal Crossover Probability: 0.5. The first mosaic immunogen was used for this study.</p>
