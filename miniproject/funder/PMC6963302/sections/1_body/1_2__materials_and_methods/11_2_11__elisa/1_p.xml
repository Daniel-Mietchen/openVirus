<p>Immunolon 4 HBX microtiter 96-well strips (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) were coated with 200 ng/well of recombinant HA protein from BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA NIAID (A/California/04/2009, NR-15749; A/PR/8/34, NR-19240; A/Brisbane/59/07, NR-28607; A/New Caledonia/20/99, NR-48873) in bicarbonate/carbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and incubated for two hours at RT. Sera was serial diluted two-fold in PBS with 1% BSA starting with a 1:100 dilution in 100 μL per well. After two hours of incubation at RT, plates were washed 4× with phosphate buffered saline with Tween 20 (PBST) and 2× with PBS before incubation with 1:5000 goat anti-mouse-HRP antibody (sc-47724; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) in 1% BSA at RT for one hour. Plates were washed 4× with PBST and 2× with PBS prior to development with 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Development was stopped with the addition of 2M sulfuric acid. The OD450 was measured using SpectraMax i3x Multi-Mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Responses ≥2 times the negative control absorbance were considered positive and used to calculate the geometric mean titer (GMT). </p>
