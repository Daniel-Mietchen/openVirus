<p>HA protein expression from recombinant Adenovirus 5 (rAd5) was confirmed by Western blot. Confluent 293 cells were infected with 500 virus particles (vp) per cell of rAd5 and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h prior to harvest. Laemmli buffer plus 2-mercaptoethanol was used to denature cells before inactivation at 100 °C for 10 min. The samples were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and separated by electrophoresis before transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat powdered milk in tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) for 30 min before incubation in goat polyclonal anti-influenza virus H1 (H0) hemagglutinin (HA) A/PR/8/34 antibody (NR-3148; BEI resources, Manassas, VA, USA) at 1:2000 and mouse anti-GAPDH (sc-47724; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) at 1:2000 in TBST 1% milk overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed 3× in TBST before incubation with goat anti-mouse-HRP conjugated antibody (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA) at 1:2000 and goat IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (HAF109; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 1:2000 in TBST 1% milk for one hour at room temperature (RT). After three washes with TBST, membrane was developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
