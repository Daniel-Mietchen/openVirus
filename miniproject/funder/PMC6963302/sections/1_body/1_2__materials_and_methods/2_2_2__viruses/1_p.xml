<p>Influenza strains (A/New Caledonia/20/1999 NR-41799; A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 NR-348; A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 NR-15568; A/California/07/2009 NR-13663; A/WS/33 NR-2759) were provided by Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository NIAID (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA, USA). Mouse-adapted viruses were obtained from ATCC (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (VR-95), A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 (VR-1754)), and St Jude Children’s Research Hospital (A/Nanchang/1/1999). These viruses were passaged 4, 0, and 12 times, respectively, and the MLD
 <sub>50</sub> was determined through serial dilution in BALB/c mice for lethal viruses. Viral stocks were grown in specific pathogen-free (SPF) research quality eggs provided by Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA), inoculated on day 10 of incubation, and harvested after three days. Allantoic fluid was harvested from infected eggs and centrifuged at 200× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Aliquots of supernatant were stored at −80 °C. Viruses were quantified based on HAU and TCID
 <sub>50</sub>.
