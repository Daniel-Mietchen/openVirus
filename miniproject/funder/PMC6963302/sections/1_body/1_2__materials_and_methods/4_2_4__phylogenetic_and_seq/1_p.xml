<p>The 6908 unique H1 HA sequences used for the mosaic immunogen design were aligned with ClustalX2.1 [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with fast-approximate pairwise parameters: gap penalty: 3; k-tuple size: 1; top diagonals: 5; window size: 5. The output nexus file was used in PAUP version 4.0a165 [
 <xref rid="B28-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to design a neighbor joining tree. The mosaic and relevant HA strains are labelled on the phylogenetic tree. The percent similarity using Blosum62 with threshold 1 and percent identity between the HA protein sequences was calculated using Geneious 11.0.5.
