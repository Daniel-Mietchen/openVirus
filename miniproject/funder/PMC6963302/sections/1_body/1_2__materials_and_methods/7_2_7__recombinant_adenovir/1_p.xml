<p>The recombinant Ad5 genomes with HA inserts (Ad5-Mosaic; Ad5-A/PR/8/34; Ad5-Pdm09) were linearized and buffer exchanged with Strataprep PCR purification kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Polyfect transfection reagent was used to transfect this linearized DNA into 293 cells. After cytopathic effects (CPE) and plaque formation was observed, cells were harvested and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles to release virus. Recombinant virus was amplified through passages in 293 cells up to a Corning 10-cell stack flask (~6300 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). Virus was purified with 2 consecutive CsCl gradients and desalted though Econo-Pac 10DG Desalting Columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) before storage at −80 °C in Ad-tris buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•</sup>6H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 10% glycerol). The virus particle quantity was measured with a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) at OD260.
