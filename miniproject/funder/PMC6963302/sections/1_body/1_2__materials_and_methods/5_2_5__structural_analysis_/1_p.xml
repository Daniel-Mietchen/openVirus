<p>The mosaic, A/PR/8/34, and A/TX/05/09 (Pdm09) HA amino acid sequences were submitted to the SWISS-MODEL web server (Basel, Switzerland) [
 <xref rid="B29-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The models with the highest Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE), ranging from 0 to 1, and Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) scores below 4 were selected as the most reliable structures [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mosaic, A/PR/8/34, and Pdm09 models used template 6n41.1.B with GMQE values of 0.81, 0.82, 0.79, and QMEAN values of −0.39, 0.25, −0.29, respectively. All models were uploaded to PyMOL (PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 2.3.2, Schrodinger LLC, New York, NY) for further visualization.
