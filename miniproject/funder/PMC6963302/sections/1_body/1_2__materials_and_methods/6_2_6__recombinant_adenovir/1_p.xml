<p>The mosaic, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_040980.1), and A/Texas/05/09 (Pdm09) (GenBank: ACU13094.1) HA genes were codon-optimized for human gene expression. Each DNA fragment was synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and cloned into pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector with directional restriction enzymes sites for downstream cloning. The AdEasy Adenoviral Vector System (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to make recombinant Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) lacking the E1 and E3 genes. The HA genes were cloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector from the AdEasy kit using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Ipswitch, MA, USA). The plasmids were linearized and transformed into BJ5183 electrocompetent cells along with the pAdEasy-1 vector (Adenovirus type 5) for homologous recombination. During recombination, the HA gene is inserted into the E1 region of the Ad5 genome. Recombinants were confirmed by restriction digest and sequenced prior to transformation into XL1 cells for midiprep with the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).</p>
