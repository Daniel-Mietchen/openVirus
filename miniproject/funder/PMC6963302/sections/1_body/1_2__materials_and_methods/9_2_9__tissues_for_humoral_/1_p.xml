<p>Female BALB/cJ mice were immunized with 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp of indicated recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5), 600 ng of Fluzone (approximately 30× a human dose), or control phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Mice were immunized with a prime or prime-boost of the same dose three weeks after initial vaccination. All immunizations were performed intramuscularly using a 29.5-gauge needle to administer 25 µL in both quadriceps. At three weeks post-prime or eight days post-boost, animals were terminally bled via cardiac puncture and spleens were harvested. Blood was centrifuged at 6000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for two minutes in BD microtainer blood collection tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) to collect sera which was used for ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays. Spleens were passed through a 40 µm nylon cell strainer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), red blood cells lysed using ACK lysis buffer (150 mM NH
 <sub>4</sub>Cl, 10 mM KHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, 0.1 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA), and spleenocytes were resuspended in RPMI with 5% FBS before analysis by ELISpot assay.
