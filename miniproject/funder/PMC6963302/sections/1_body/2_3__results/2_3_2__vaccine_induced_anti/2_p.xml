<p>Previous studies have suggested that enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are more sensitive than HAI assays to detect antibodies against HA, especially those against the HA stalk region [

Importantly, the Ad5-mosaic vaccine was able to induce significant antibody titers against all four divergent influenza strains, including the distant A/California/04/07 (Pdm09) strain. Indeed, the mosaic HA induced higher antibody titers than all other groups except when the wild-type HA vaccines matched the influenza strain. When all vaccines and HA strains were mismatched, the Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice showed significantly higher antibody titers than other vaccine groups (
