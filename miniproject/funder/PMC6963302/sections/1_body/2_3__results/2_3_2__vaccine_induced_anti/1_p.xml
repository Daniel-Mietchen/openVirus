<p>Mice were immunized with a prime or prime-boost strategy of 10
 <sup>10</sup> virus particles (vp) of recombinant Adenovirus per immunization. Sera from vaccinated mice three weeks post-prime or eight days post-boost was analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays using various H1 influenza strains (

Mice immunized with recombinant Ad5 expressing wild-type HAs were able to induce robust antibody responses against matched IAV strains. Both the Ad5-Pdm09 and Fluzone vaccines include a Pdm09 immunogen and displayed antibodies against the matched A/CA/07/09 (Pdm09) strain (
