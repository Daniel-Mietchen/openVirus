<p>The mosaic vaccine was designed to maximize the PBTE across the viral population, thus biasing the immune response towards greater cross-protection. To determine if this was the case, cellular responses from vaccinated mice were measured by IFN-Î³ ELISpot assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Overlapping peptide libraries spanning the entire HA gene for each strain were used for the ELISpot assays. Mice vaccinated with Adenovirus expressing a wild-type HA were able to induce strong T cell responses against matched strains (

However, the Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were able to generate strong T cell responses across all four divergent influenza strains. Encouragingly, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were able to produce similar levels of T cells against the A/PR/8/34 strain as did those immunized with the matched Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine. These data suggest that the mosaic immunogen induces strong cross-reactive T cell responses.
