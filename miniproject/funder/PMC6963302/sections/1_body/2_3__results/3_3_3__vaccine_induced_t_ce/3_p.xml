<p>Peptide mapping is an important indicator of T cell immunity, but there are many other factors involved in cellular responses including proteasome cleavage, antigen processing and presentation, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>, sequences of positive peptides were submitted to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. This database contains published reports of epitopes studied in multiple hosts. Many of the peptides identified by IFN-Î³ ELISpot were reported to bind multiple MHC complexes, qualitatively bind B cells, induce cytokines, stimulate T cell cytotoxicity, as well as induce other immune responses (
