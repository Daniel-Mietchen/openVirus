<p>The breadth of the cellular response to vaccination was analyzed by epitope mapping. All immunostimulatory peptides identified from A/Brisbane/59/07, A/New Caledonia/20/99, and A/California/07/09 (Pdm09) HA were mapped using IFN-Î³ ELISpot assays (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). All vaccines induced cellular immunity against two HA2 epitopes that were broadly cross reactive for all three HA peptide pools. The Pdm09 vaccine induced cellular responses against additional epitopes in the matching HA1. The mosaic vaccine induced responses against HA1 epitopes in all three peptide pools.
