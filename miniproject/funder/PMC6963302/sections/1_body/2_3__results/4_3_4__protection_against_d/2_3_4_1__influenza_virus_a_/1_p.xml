<p>All mice were challenged intranasally three weeks after vaccination with a sublethal dose of A/Nanchang/1/99. All Adenovirus vectored vaccines provided strong protection against weight loss for both vaccination doses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Even the divergent Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine showed minimal weight loss for this sub lethal A/Nanchang/1/99 challenge. In contrast, mice immunized with whole inactivated Fluzone or PBS displayed severe weight loss. Interestingly, the A/TX/05/09 HA included in the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine is almost identical (99.47% similar) to the A/Michigan/45/15 HA included in the whole inactivated Fluzone vaccine, but only the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine was protective against weight loss. This suggests that gene delivery and/or dose of immunogens can impact vaccine cross-protection.
