<p>Vaccinated mice were challenged at three weeks post-immunization with lethal A/PR/8/34 virus. As expected, mice immunized with either dose of the matched Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine showed minor weight loss and 100% survival against the A/PR/8/34 challenge (

 <sup>8</sup> vp of Ad5-mosaic showed minimal weight loss and 100% survival. This outlier could be due to individual variation between mice or suboptimal vaccination. However, mice vaccinated with the high dose of Ad5-mosaic showed minor weight loss and 100% survival. Both the adenovirus (Ad5-Pdm09) and inactivated (Fluzone) Pdm09 vaccines did not provide protection against weight loss and death for this divergent lethal challenge. Overall, the Ad5-mosaic vaccine was able to protect mice from the lethal A/PR/8/34 challenge.
