<p>To further investigate the protection of Ad5-mosaic, vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/FM/1/47 virus. Mice vaccinated with 10
 <sup>10</sup> vp Ad5-mosaic were completely protected against weight loss and death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Even at the lower vaccination dose, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice showed 100% survival and minor weight loss. The A/PR/8/34 HA included in the Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine is closely related (94.35% similar) to the A/FM/1/47 challenge strain. Mice vaccinated with the either dose of Ad5-A/PR/8/34 showed minor weight loss and 100% survival. In contrast, mice vaccinated with a distant Pdm09 immunogen (Ad5-Pdm09 or Fluzone) showed increased weight loss and death for the lethal A/FM/1/47 virus challenge. These data show that the mosaic vaccine was able to protect mice against the A/FM/1/47 strain at comparable levels to the similar A/PR/8/34 immunogen. Furthermore, the mosaic vaccine provided better protection than mismatched Pdm09 immunogens or Fluzone.
