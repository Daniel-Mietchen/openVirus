<p>Based on the support of the SWISS-MODEL analyses we next wanted to test the expression of the mosaic HA. The mosaic gene was cloned into a replication defective Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) viral vector and subsequent protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. As controls we compared the mosaic HA expression with that of two wild-type HA genes expressed in an Ad5 vector, A/Texas/05/09 (Ad5-Pdm09) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Ad5-A/PR/8/34) (
