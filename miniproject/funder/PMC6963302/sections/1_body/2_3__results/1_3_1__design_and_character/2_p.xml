<p>Since the mosaic HA sequence was generated de novo, there was concern for the structure and folding of the encoded protein. To help alleviate these concerns we submitted the mosaic protein sequence to the SWISS-MODEL web server to predict its structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition to the mosaic gene, the wild-type HA genes from A/PR/8/34 and A/Texas/05/09 pdm09 were submitted. The SWISS-MODEL server uses homology modelling between the submitted sequence and a similar template sequence with known structure to predict folding [
 <xref rid="B30-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mosaic HA was predicted to fold into a conformation similar to the template and wild-type HA proteins.
