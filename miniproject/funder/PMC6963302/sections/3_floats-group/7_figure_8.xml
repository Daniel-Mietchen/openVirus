  <p>Protection Against A/PR/8/34 lethal challenge. Mice were immunized with either 10
   <sup>8</sup> or 10
   <sup>10</sup> virus particles of recombinant Ad5-Mosaic, Ad5-A/PR/8/34, Ad5-Pdm09, 600 ng Fluzone, or PBS and challenged with 100MLD
   <sub>50</sub> of a A/PR8/34 virus three weeks later (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5). Mice were monitored daily after challenge and humanely euthanized if 25% weight loss was recorded. (
