  <p>Structural and sequence analysis of the mosaic immunogen. (
   <bold>A</bold>) All unique human H1 HA protein sequences were used to make a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. Representative strains are labelled and pandemic 2009 strains are shown in dark blue. (
   <bold>B</bold>) HA proteins of strains used throughout this study were analyzed based on phylogeny, percent identity (upper right), and percent similarity (lower left). (
   <bold>C</bold>) A/PR/8/34, A/TX/05/09 (Pdm09) and Mosaic HA sequences were submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server and visualized with PyMOL software to predict the protein structure. The HA head (dark) and stalk (light) regions are shown along with a merged image of all three HA immunogens. (
   <bold>D</bold>) A/PR/8/34, Pdm09, and the mosaic HA were expressed in recombinant Adenovirus type 5 (rAd5). Cells were infected with 500 virus particles per cell of rAd5 and HA expression was detected by western blot. The western blot detected the HA0 (85kDa) and HA1 (65kDa) bands at similar levels for all rAd5.
