  <p>T Cell mapping after single shot vaccination. Mice were immunized with Ad5-Mosaic, Ad5-A/PR/8/34, or Ad5-Pdm09 and splenocytes were harvested three weeks later (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8). T cell epitopes were mapped using overlapping peptide libraries spanning the entire HA gene. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Responses greater than 50 spot-forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes were considered positive and are shown in relation to the HA gene location. Positive peptides for (
   <bold>B</bold>) A/Brisbane/59/07, (
   <bold>C</bold>) A/New Caledonia/20/99, and (
   <bold>D</bold>) A/California/07/09 (Pdm09) are quantified. Numbers correspond to the peptide number in each peptide library. Data is expressed as the mean spot forming cells (SFC) per million splenocytes with standard error.
