The primary resource to protect against infection is by vaccination. However, vaccination only induces strain-specific and transient immunity. Vaccine strategies that induce cross-protective immunity against the broad diversity of IAV are needed. Here we developed and tested a novel mosaic H1 HA immunogen. The mosaic immunogen was optimized in silico to include the most potential B and T cell epitopes (PBTE) across a diverse population of human H1 IAV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the mosaic HA localizes towards the non-pandemic 2009 strains which encompasses the broadest diversity in the H1 IAV population. We compared the mosaic H1 immunogen to wild-type HA immunogens and the commercial inactivated influenza vaccine, Fluzone. When analyzed by ELISA, the mosaic immunogen induced stronger antibody responses against all four diverse H1 HA proteins. When analyzing T cell responses, again the mosaic immunogen induced stronger cellular immunity against all 4 diverse HA strains. Not only was the magnitude of T cell responses strongest in mosaic immunized mice, the number of epitopes recognized was also greater. The mosaic vaccinated mice showed strong cross-protection against challenges with three divergent IAV strains. These data show that the mosaic immunogen induces strong cross-protective immunity and should be investigated further as a universal influenza vaccine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>universal</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>mosaic</kwd><kwd>epitope-based vaccine</kwd><kwd>t-cell</kwd><kwd>cross-protection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-vaccines-07-00195"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Annually, influenza A virus (IAV) infects ~5&#x02013;10% of adults and 20&#x02013;30% of children worldwide, resulting in up to 650,000 deaths each year [<xref rid="B1-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ability of IAV to mutate, reassort, and infect multiple hosts results in a diverse viral population that causes annual epidemics and occasionally pandemic outbreaks. One of the most prominent examples is the 2009 influenza pandemic (Pdm09). A triple reassorted swine, avian, and human H1N1 influenza virus infected 24% of the global population [<xref rid="B4-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current influenza vaccine approaches are not well equipped to protect against novel strains as they induce a strain-specific immune response and matching vaccines can take up to six months to develop [<xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Over the past decade, licensed seasonal influenza vaccines have shown variable efficacy (10&#x02013;60%) and limited cross-protection against drifted IAV strains [<xref rid="B8-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for better vaccine strategies that will protect against the diverse influenza virus population.</p><p>Many universal influenza vaccine strategies have been investigated. Surface viral glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the most common targets for vaccines, however, they provide limited cross-protection. Recent studies have targeted the HA stalk region which is more conserved than the HA head domain [<xref rid="B10-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

HA and NA approaches rely on the induction of antibody responses to provide protection against IAV. However, increasing evidence suggests that cellular immunity may be key to better vaccine cross-protection [<xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and T cell depletion studies have shown that cellular immunity plays a significant role in protection against influenza [<xref rid="B20-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we investigate a mosaic HA immunogen which is computationally designed to induce strong cellular and humoral immunity.</p><p>In this study, a mosaic HA vaccine was designed to contain the most potential B and T cell epitopes (PBTE) across a spectrum of human H1 influenza viruses using the mosaic vaccine designer tool which predicts the sequence containing the most linear PBTE [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This mosaic strategy has shown promise for multiple pathogens including H5 influenza, Dengue, and HIV [<xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, this is the first published study that applies the mosaic vaccine immunogen approach to human H1 influenza virus. This is important since the majority of circulating IAV strains are of the H1 and H3 subtypes. Here we analyzed the immune response and protection induced by a monovalent H1 HA mosaic immunogen expressed in an adenoviral vector.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-vaccines-07-00195"><title>2.

Results</title><sec id="sec3dot1-vaccines-07-00195"><title>3.1. Design and Characteristics of the Human H1 HA Mosaic Immunogen</title><p>We sought to design and test a mosaic hemagglutinin (HA) immunogen representing as much of the H1 influenza virus population as possible. Briefly, we submitted all 6908 unique full-length human H1 HA to the Mosaic Vaccine Designer server in order to predict an immunogen with the most PBTE [<xref rid="B31-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The resulting full-length human H1 mosaic (mosaic) HA was analyzed based on its phylogeny and structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When compared to all unique human H1 HA sequences, the mosaic sequence clustered with pre 2009 seasonal influenza viruses on the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Strains used throughout this study were compared based on amino acid percent identity and percent similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The mosaic HA is closely related to A/Brisbane/59/07 and least genetically similar to the pandemic 2009 strains.</p><p>Since the mosaic HA sequence was generated de novo, there was concern for the structure and folding of the encoded protein. To help alleviate these concerns we submitted the mosaic protein sequence to the SWISS-MODEL web server to predict its structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). In addition to the mosaic gene, the wild-type HA genes from A/PR/8/34 and A/Texas/05/09 pdm09 were submitted. The SWISS-MODEL server uses homology modelling between the submitted sequence and a similar template sequence with known structure to predict folding [<xref rid="B30-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mosaic HA was predicted to fold into a conformation similar to the template and wild-type HA proteins. </p><p>Based on the support of the SWISS-MODEL analyses we next wanted to test the expression of the mosaic HA. The mosaic gene was cloned into a replication defective Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) viral vector and subsequent protein expression was confirmed by Western blot. As controls we compared the mosaic HA expression with that of two wild-type HA genes expressed in an Ad5 vector, A/Texas/05/09 (Ad5-Pdm09) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (Ad5-A/PR/8/34) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f001">Figure 1</xref>D).

Vaccine-Induced Antibody Responses</title><p>Mice were immunized with a prime or prime-boost strategy of 10<sup>10</sup> virus particles (vp) of recombinant Adenovirus per immunization. Sera from vaccinated mice three weeks post-prime or eight days post-boost was analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays using various H1 influenza strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Mice vaccinated with Ad5-mosaic showed a strong antibody response against the genetically similar A/NC/20/99 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). When boosted, vaccinated mice also induced antibodies against the mismatched A/WS/33 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Mice immunized with recombinant Ad5 expressing wild-type HAs were able to induce robust antibody responses against matched IAV strains. Both the Ad5-Pdm09 and Fluzone vaccines include a Pdm09 immunogen and displayed antibodies against the matched A/CA/07/09 (Pdm09) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). The Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine induced antibodies against the matched A/PR/8/34 strain and the similar A/WS/33 strain. However, none of the wild-type HA or Fluzone showed detectable antibodies against mismatched strains.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are more sensitive than HAI assays to detect antibodies against HA, especially those against the HA stalk region [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To further characterize the humoral response to vaccination we also analyzed the sera from immunized mice by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f003">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, mice vaccinated with Adenovirus expressing wild-type HA were able to induce high antibody titers against matched strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). However, the wild-type immunogens were unable to produce high antibody titers when mismatched recombinant HA proteins were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). Importantly, the Ad5-mosaic vaccine was able to induce significant antibody titers against all four divergent influenza strains, including the distant A/California/04/07 (Pdm09) strain. Indeed, the mosaic HA induced higher antibody titers than all other groups except when the wild-type HA vaccines matched the influenza strain. When all vaccines and HA strains were mismatched, the Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice showed significantly higher antibody titers than other vaccine groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D).</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-vaccines-07-00195"><title>3.3. Vaccine Induced T Cell Responses</title><p>The mosaic vaccine was designed to maximize the PBTE across the viral population, thus biasing the immune response towards greater cross-protection. To determine if this was the case, cellular responses from vaccinated mice were measured by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Overlapping peptide libraries spanning the entire HA gene for each strain were used for the ELISpot assays. Mice vaccinated with Adenovirus expressing a wild-type HA were able to induce strong T cell responses against matched strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B). However, the Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were able to generate strong T cell responses across all four divergent influenza strains. Encouragingly, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were able to produce similar levels of T cells against the A/PR/8/34 strain as did those immunized with the matched Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine. These data suggest that the mosaic immunogen induces strong cross-reactive T cell responses.</p><p>The breadth of the cellular response to vaccination was analyzed by epitope mapping. All immunostimulatory peptides identified from A/Brisbane/59/07, A/New Caledonia/20/99, and A/California/07/09 (Pdm09) HA were mapped using IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>). All peptides and their relative location in the HA gene are shown for the mosaic (green), A/PR/8/34 (dark blue), and Pdm09 (light blue) vaccines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). All vaccines induced cellular immunity against two HA2 epitopes that were broadly cross reactive for all three HA peptide pools. The Pdm09 vaccine induced cellular responses against additional epitopes in the matching HA1. The mosaic vaccine induced responses against HA1 epitopes in all three peptide pools. </p><p>Peptide mapping is an important indicator of T cell immunity, but there are many other factors involved in cellular responses including proteasome cleavage, antigen processing and presentation, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type [<xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To further investigate the biological relevance of the immunostimulatory peptides identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>, sequences of positive peptides were submitted to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. This database contains published reports of epitopes studied in multiple hosts.

All Adenovirus vectored vaccines provided strong protection against weight loss for both vaccination doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Even the divergent Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine showed minimal weight loss for this sub lethal A/Nanchang/1/99 challenge. In contrast, mice immunized with whole inactivated Fluzone or PBS displayed severe weight loss. Interestingly, the A/TX/05/09 HA included in the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine is almost identical (99.47% similar) to the A/Michigan/45/15 HA included in the whole inactivated Fluzone vaccine, but only the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine was protective against weight loss. This suggests that gene delivery and/or dose of immunogens can impact vaccine cross-protection. </p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot2-vaccines-07-00195"><title>3.4.2. Influenza Virus A/Fort Monmouth/1/47 challenge</title><p>To further investigate the protection of Ad5-mosaic, vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with a lethal dose of A/FM/1/47 virus. Mice vaccinated with 10<sup>10</sup> vp Ad5-mosaic were completely protected against weight loss and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Even at the lower vaccination dose, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice showed 100% survival and minor weight loss. The A/PR/8/34 HA included in the Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine is closely related (94.35% similar) to the A/FM/1/47 challenge strain. Mice vaccinated with the either dose of Ad5-A/PR/8/34 showed minor weight loss and 100% survival. In contrast, mice vaccinated with a distant Pdm09 immunogen (Ad5-Pdm09 or Fluzone) showed increased weight loss and death for the lethal A/FM/1/47 virus challenge. These data show that the mosaic vaccine was able to protect mice against the A/FM/1/47 strain at comparable levels to the similar A/PR/8/34 immunogen. Furthermore, the mosaic vaccine provided better protection than mismatched Pdm09 immunogens or Fluzone.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4dot3-vaccines-07-00195"><title>3.4.3.

All but one mouse immunized with 10<sup>8</sup> vp of Ad5-mosaic showed minimal weight loss and 100% survival. This outlier could be due to individual variation between mice or suboptimal vaccination. However, mice vaccinated with the high dose of Ad5-mosaic showed minor weight loss and 100% survival. Both the adenovirus (Ad5-Pdm09) and inactivated (Fluzone) Pdm09 vaccines did not provide protection against weight loss and death for this divergent lethal challenge. Overall, the Ad5-mosaic vaccine was able to protect mice from the lethal A/PR/8/34 challenge. </p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-vaccines-07-00195"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Mosaic immunogens have been explored over the past decade as a vaccination strategy to protect against viruses with high population diversity, such as influenza H5 and HIV [<xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B34-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. By maximizing the PBTE coverage across the population, mosaic immunogens are designed to induce stronger immune responses [<xref rid="B22-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Here we designed a mosaic HA immunogen for human H1 influenza. The synthetic mosaic protein localizes towards the pre 2009 H1 population due to the higher degree of diversity in these viruses relative to the post 2009 pandemic viruses. This is important since the mosaic immunogen is designed to provide the greatest level of protection against the most diverse strains. Clearly, the greatest level of genetic diversity exists outside of the Pdm09 cluster. The mosaic HA was cloned into an Adenovirus type 5 vector and used to vaccinate mice in order to evaluate the cross-protective immune responses. Mice immunized with Ad5-mosaic induced high antibodies across the diverse H1 population when measured by ELISA, but minimal responses when measured by HAI assay. This difference could be due to the sensitivity of each assay or due to the ability of ELISA to detect a broader range of HA antibodies, especially antibodies to the HA stalk region [<xref rid="B32-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. </p><p>The mosaic vaccine induced strong cellular responses across diverse influenza strains. Previous studies show that inactivated vaccines induce much weaker cellular responses than other vaccine strategies [<xref rid="B35-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As expected, the Fluzone vaccinated mice elicited low T cell responses to all four influenza HA virus strains. In contrast, Ad5-vectored vaccines induced robust T cell responses with the Ad5-mosaic vaccine generally inducing stronger responses across the breadth of tested HAs with responses focused on two areas of HA1 and HA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Since epitope mapping is specific to the MHC complex of BALB/c mice, we wanted to explore whether these epitopes have been previously linked to immune responses in other models. Immunostimulatory peptide sequences were submitted to the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource to identify additional published immunological information (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-07-00195">Supplemental Table S1</xref>). The results show that the immunostimulatory peptides identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f005">Figure 5</xref> have been reported for multiple mouse, human, and non-human primate MHC types. In addition, most of the immunostimulatory peptides have been linked to B and T cell immune responses. Importantly, the database does not reflect a complete report for each peptide and additional biological relevance may be discovered in future studies. </p><p>Using a sublethal A/Nanchang/1/99 challenge we were able to show greater cross-protection from the adenoviral vectored vaccines than the inactivated Fluzone vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00195-f006">Figure 6</xref>). All mice immunized with adenovirus expressing HA, including the divergent Ad5-Pdm09 vaccinated mice, were protected from weight loss. In contrast, the Fluzone vaccine, which contains a similar HA to the Ad5-Pdm09 vaccine, was unable to provide protection (weight loss in this group was comparable to the PBS negative control). The stronger cross-protection from adenovirus vectored vaccines than inactivated virus vaccines has been previously shown for IAV [<xref rid="B37-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In our study, the reduced effectiveness of the inactivated vaccine corresponded to lower antibody and overall T cell responses. Despite increased immunogenicity, adenoviral vectored vaccines are currently not licensed for human vaccine use. Therefore, additional vaccine platforms could be investigated to maximize the immune response to vaccination. </p><p>Mice immunized with Ad5-mosaic showed protection against both highly lethal influenza challenges conducted. The A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 challenge viruses are both similar to the A/PR/8/34 HA included in the Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccine. For both 100MLD<sub>50</sub> challenges, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated mice were protected at comparable levels to the matched Ad5-A/PR/8/34 vaccinated animals. Importantly, Ad5-mosaic vaccinated animals only showed detectable antibodies against A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 when measured by ELISA, but no detectable antibodies when measured by HAI assay. In contrast, the mismatched Ad5-Pdm09 vaccinated mice showed severe weight loss and death for both the A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47 challenges. </p><p>In addition to being superior to the inactivated vaccine at inducing antibody responses, another benefit of adenovirus vectored vaccines is their ability to induce T cell responses. We detected T cell responses in all adenovirus immunized animals with the Ad5-mosaic vaccine able to induce robust responses to each of the H1 HAs measured. While we determined cross-reactive immune responses only to H1 antigens, it is likely that protection against other influenza viruses will require multiple immunogens. Co-administration of mosaic immunogens representing different influenza HA subtypes including H2, H3, and H5, as well as neuraminidase types N1 and N2, may have promise as universal influenza vaccine immunogens. Previous work has shown that multiple synthetic immunogens can be combined into a multivalent vaccine without losing efficacy of the individual components [<xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00195" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study we show that our mosaic immunogen is able to elicit broad levels of humoral and cellular immunity and cross-protection against divergent H1N1 influenza virus strains. Based on these data we believe that this strategy should be further explored as a strategy for the development of universal influenza vaccine immunogens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-vaccines-07-00195"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study characterizing a mosaic H1 hemagglutinin as a broadly-reactive immunogen for the prevention of H1N1 influenza virus infections. Our mosaic design is even more unique than other published strategies because we used only the unique full-length H1 HA sequences in the database to create the mosaic gene. This excluded repeated sequences that would have biased the immunogen and reduced the overall coverage of protection. The mosaic HA immunogen was expressed in an Adenovirus type 5 replication-defective virus. The H1 mosaic immunogen induced strong cellular and humoral immune responses against divergent H1N1 influenza virus strains. In addition, the H1 mosaic immunogen also provided complete protection against a sublethal infection with the A/Nanchang/1/1999 influenza virus. More impressively, the mosaic H1 immunogen provided complete protection against death when challenged with lethal doses of A/Fort Monmouth/1/47 and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 influenza viruses. Our data indicate that mosaic immunogens can induce broadly-reactive immunity and warrant further investigation as a universal influenza vaccine strategy. </p></sec><sec id="sec6-vaccines-07-00195"><title>6.
