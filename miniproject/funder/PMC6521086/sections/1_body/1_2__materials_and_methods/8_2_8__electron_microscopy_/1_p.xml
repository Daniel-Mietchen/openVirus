<p>Formvar/Carbon 200 Mesh Cu grids were glow-discharged in air and loaded with 3.5 µL of the sample from ChAdOx1 sCHIKV vaccine stock or purified VLP of CHIKV by sucrose gradient (10–60%). Excess liquid was removed, and the grids were washed 3 times with MilliQ water. Finally, grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s, excess uranyl acetate was carefully removed using filter paper.
