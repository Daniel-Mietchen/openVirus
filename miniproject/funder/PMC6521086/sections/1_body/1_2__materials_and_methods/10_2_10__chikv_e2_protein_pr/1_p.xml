<p>For expression and purification of the CHIKV E2 protein, the codon-optimised gene of E2 (a.a. 1–346) was cloned into the pHLsec vector [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. which is flanked by the chicken β-actin/rabbit β-globin hybrid promoter with a signal secretion sequence and a Lys-His6 tag. In order to improve secretion of the E2 protein, the C-terminal region of E2 (a.a. 347–423) was deleted. The pHLsec CHIKV E2 plasmid (500 µg) was transfected in HEK-293T cells using polyethyleneimine (PEI) in roller bottles (surface area of 2,125 cm2) under standard cell culture conditions. Five days after transfection cells were discarded and media was filtered through 0.22 µM disposable filters. The secreted protein was purified from the supernatant by Ni Sepharose affinity chromatography (HisTRAP
 <sup>TM</sup>, GE Healthcare), using the Äkta Start chromatography system and eluted with Imidazole 500mM. Finally, the eluted protein was dialysed using Slide-A-LyzerTM cassette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) against 1× PBS.
