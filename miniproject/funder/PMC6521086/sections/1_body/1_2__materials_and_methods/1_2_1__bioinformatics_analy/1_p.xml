<p>Full length structural polyprotein sequences for CHIKV from all lineages were collected from the NCBI protein database (txid37124), aligned using Clustal Omega [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and a neighbour-joining tree created (Juke-Cantor, 100 bootstraps). Conservation within clades (intra-clade) and subsequently between clades was calculated using our in-house developed software based on a sliding window approach with a sequence weighting method to enable equal representation of all lineages and variants (manuscript in preparation).
