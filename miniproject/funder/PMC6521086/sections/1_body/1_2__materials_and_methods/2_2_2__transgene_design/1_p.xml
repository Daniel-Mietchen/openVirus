<p>The structural cassette CHIKV sequence derived from various CHIKV lineages was codon optimised. To improve initiation of translation a Kozak consensus sequence was included before the 5∲ end of the transgene. Finally, the transgene design included the required enzymatic restriction sites to allow the in-frame cloning of the transgene between the CMV promoter and the PolyA sequence region contained in our shuttle and expression vector (pMono). A synthetic gene cassette was produced by GeneArt
 <sup>®</sup> (Fisher Scientific, Regensburg, Germany) and was named sCHIKV. The sCHIKV plasmid was used as DNA template to further generate the E3,E2,6K,E1 cassette with no capsid by PCR-cloning; this variant was named sCHIKV ∆C. Forward primer: 
 <underline>ATG</underline>GAGGAATGGTCCCTGGCTATC. Reverse primer: TCATCAGTGCCGGCTGAAG.
