<p>To generate ChAdOx1 vaccines, the shuttle plasmids containing attL regions sequences were each recombined with those attR regions contained in the destination vector ChAdOx1 using an in vitro Gateway reaction (LR Clonase II system, Invitrogen
 <sup>TM</sup>, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Successfully recombined ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing using flanking primers (forward promoter primer and Poly-(A) reverse primer). Standard cell biology and virology techniques were performed to generate the non-replicative adenoviral vectors [

To generate MVA based vaccines both the sCHIKV and the sCHIKV cassette ∆C were digested with KpnI and XhoI to allow in-frame ligation between the P7.5 promoter and the TKR locus, contained in the entry plasmid MVA. Ligated DNA plasmids were expanded in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and a midiprep (Qiagen) was used for plasmid purifications. Resulting plasmids were verified by restriction analysis and 5∲ and 3∲ flanking sequencing, and co-transfected to produce MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV ∆C, using the methodology as previously described [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Control ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors comprised non-structural (NS) regions from CHIKV and they were named ChAdOx1 NS and MVA NS, respectively.
