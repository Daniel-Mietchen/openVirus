<p>The plasmid containing the sCHIKV cassette (C,E3,E2,6K,E1) and the sCHIKV ∆C (E3,E2,6K,E1) were digested with KpnI and NotI restriction enzymes (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) to allow in-frame ligation between the CMV promoter and the Poly(A) regions contained in the shuttle plasmid (pMono). The recombinant DNA plasmids were expanded and purified from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> using the midiprep kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Resulting plasmids were verified by restriction analysis and 5∲ and 3∲ flanking sequencing.
