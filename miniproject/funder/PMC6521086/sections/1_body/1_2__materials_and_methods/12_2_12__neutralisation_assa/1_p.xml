<p>Titres of neutralising antibodies were determined as described previously using CHIKV replicon particles (VRPs) expressing Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, BHK-21 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well. The next day, VRPs (MOI of 2.5) were preincubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of serum samples for 1 h at 37 °C before the mixture was added to the 96-well plates. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was added. Readout of secreted Gaussia was performed at 24 h post infection using a Renilla luciferase assay system (Promega, Southhampton, UK). Neutralisation potency was determined as a percentage of measured Gluc activity compared to the Gluc readout after VRP application without serum. Results are presented as 50% neutralisation (NT50) titres.
