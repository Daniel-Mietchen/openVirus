<p>Vero cell were grown following the ATCC conditions. HEK-293 cells (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup>, CRL-1573TM) were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids. Baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells were maintained in Glasgow´s Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cell number and viability were calculated by trypan blue staining using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell lines are described in the NCBI Biosample database.
