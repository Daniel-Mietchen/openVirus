<p>The expression screening was carried out in Vero cells by transduction of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, using a MOI = 10. Three days after transduction, the cells and supernatants were harvested, the supernatant was concentrated with a 100 kDa Amicon
 <sup>®</sup> spin column (Millipore UK, LTD). The 5x concentrated fraction, the non-concentrated fraction (input) and flow through fraction was also recovered. Cells and supernatants samples were boiled at 100 °C for five minutes in Laemli buffer. Equal amounts of total cell extract and cell supernatants were resolved by SDS/PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were blocked with 1X PBS-Tween- 5% milk and incubated with an anti-CHIKV E1 antibody (AZ 1253, Aalto BioReagents, Dublin, Ireland) at 1:500 dilution, and anti-CHIKV envelope seropositive mice sera (1:500), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). Chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA, USA) was visualised using the ChemiDoc SRS device (BioRad, Watford H., UK).
