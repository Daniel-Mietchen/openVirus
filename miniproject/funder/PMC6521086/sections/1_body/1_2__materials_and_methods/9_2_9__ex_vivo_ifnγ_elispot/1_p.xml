<p>ELISpots were carried out using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Briefly, MAIP ELISpot plates (Millipore UK, LTD) were coated with anti-mouse IFNγ antibody (mAb AN18, Mabtech), after 1h blocking with complete DMEM media (10% FCS). Isolated PBMCs (using ACK buffer solution) were plated alongside with 20-mer specific CHIKV structural peptides overlapped by 10 a.a. (10 μg/mL) and 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> splenocytes from naïve mice per well. After 16 h incubation, cells were discarded, and plates washed with PBS. Following this, 50 μL of biotinylated anti-mouse IFNγ mAb (mAb R4-6A2, Mabtech) (1:1000 in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. After washing, plates were incubated with 50 μL of Streptavidin-ALP (Mabtech) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 1 h. After another washing step, developing solution (BioRad, Watford H., U.K.) was used. Once spots were visible, the reaction was stopped by rinsing the plates with water. Spots were acquired using an ELISpot reader. Spot Forming Cells (SFC)/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs producing IFNγ were calculated.
