<p>We tested BALB/c mice sera obtained after an early prime time-point and in a prime-boost vaccination to assess CHIKV antibody neutralisation activity in vitro. The method we used is based on the virus replicon particle-based (VRP) chikungunya virus neutralisation assay to determine NT50 values [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Naïve and control ChAdOx1 NS sera were included alongside the assay. At two weeks post-vaccination, sera from the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C-vaccinated groups showed high neutralisation activity against VRP CHIKV with a NT50 titre of 5.39x10
 <sup>3</sup> and 3.18 x10
 <sup>3</sup> respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f006">Figure 6</xref>b), ChAdOx1 sCHIKV/MVA sCHIKV showed a further 2.8-fold increase of the NT50 titter (1.53x10
 <sup>4</sup>), in comparison to the prime vaccination regime of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV. A similar increase of NT50 titre was found in the sera from mice vaccinated with a prime-boost ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C/MVA sCHIKV ∆C, with a 6-fold increase (1.87x10
 <sup>4</sup>), when compared to that of the NT50 titre from single ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C vaccinated animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). These results indicate that when the capsid is deleted from the CHIKV structural genes, a decrease in the antibody NT50 titre is observed, upon a single ChAdOx1 vaccination. Conversely, when a prime-boost regime is used, the deletion of the capsid is beneficial to increase the CHIKV NT50 antibody titres. Taken together, our results confirm that our viral-vectored vaccines elicit functional neutralising antibodies against CHIKV-infective particles, tested by an in vitro model.
