<p>To assess the specific immunogenicity of our viral-vectored vaccines, we immunised groups of BALB/c animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) with a single and non-adjuvanted vaccine dose of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C, and control ChAdOx1 NS, respectively. Two weeks after immunisation, T cell responses were quantified by ex vivo IFNγ ELISpot, using a specific pool of overlapping peptides spanning the full CHIKV structural cassette, as well as a pool of overlapping peptides related to the control NS vaccines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f004">Figure 4</xref>). BALB/c mice receiving vaccines encoding sCHIKV antigens showed high T cell frequencies after stimulation with the sCHIKV peptide pool (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV = mean of 6013 spot-forming cells (SFC)/10
 <sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C = mean of 6,422 SFC/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs); with no statistical difference between both groups, using one-way ANOVA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The control group ChAdOx1 NS showed low specific T cell responses against the NS peptide pool and no responses to specific sCHIKV peptide pool. In addition, we analysed the responses towards specific peptide sub-pools for C, E3, E2, 6K, E1 and NS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). sCHIKV peptide deconvolution ELISpot allowed the identification of an immunodominant region located in the 6K region which is induced upon ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C vaccination (4,325 and 5,177 SFC/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs, respectively). As expected, we detected specific cellular responses towards the capsid in animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV (mean=984 SFC/10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs) in comparison with those animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C in which low background responses were recorded (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Modest responses were detected in PBMCs against the E2 and E1 peptide pools. Taken together, we conclude that a single injection of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C is immunogenic and able to induce specific T cell responses in BALB/c mice.
