<p>To assess humoral responses, 96-well plates were coated with CHIKV-E2 protein. We performed ELISA assays to identify the immunogenic properties of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C, upon a single and unadjuvanted vaccination strategy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). Two weeks after a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C vaccination, specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV E2 protein was detected in sera from vaccinated animals (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, right) all the animals increased the levels of OD405 binding to the E2 protein. Of particular interest, 10 months after a single immunisation, sera from vaccinated animals showed specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV E2, similar to that of six weeks prime group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, bottom). ChAdOx1 NS was used as control as it does not generate antibody responses towards the sCHIKV antigens. Log reciprocal antibody titre analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f005">Figure 5</xref>b) showed that levels of anti-E2 antibodies increased over time for both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C prime-vaccinated animals and remarkably they were maintained after 10 months upon a single vaccination strategy. Interestingly, our results indicated that the deletion of capsid in the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C- vaccinated group did not impair the ability to elicit anti-E2 CHIKV antibody titres. Finally, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral-vector technology has been shown to be a potent booster of immune responses [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we have constructed MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV ∆C to test their boosting immunogenic potential in a prime-boost heterologous strategy. Mice immunised with either ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C were boosted with MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV ∆C at six weeks after prime, respectively; and sera was collected two weeks after boost. Prime-boost vaccinated mice showed high endpoint titters of &gt;4 of anti IgG-E2 antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f005">Figure 5</xref>b, Prime-Boost section). MVA NS was used as control to boost animals vaccinated with ChAdOx1 NS vaccines. Taken together, we conclude that a single vaccination with no adjuvant strategy is able to induce early, specific and long-lasting B responses in BALB/c mice towards CHIKV-E2 protein.
