<p>After cloning and production of ChAdOx1 vaccines encoding the genomic sCHIKV cassette, we verified the formation of adenoviral particles by transmission electron microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). Because it has been described that cellular expression of the full structural CHIKV cassette is capable to self-assemble VLPs for CHIKV, as well as for other alphaviruses [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we collected supernatant from HEK293 cells expressing the sCHIKV antigen. The supernatant was then subjected to sucrose gradient showing a characteristic sedimentation band, which is representative of VLP accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, left). Further electron microscopy preparations revealed particles of approximately 70 nm in size (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>b, right), which resembled wild-type CHIKV particles. Alternatively, we transduced Vero cells with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C, and verified their expression in cells and supernatants. Specific detection was achieved by western blot, using an anti-CHIKV mice serum and an anti-E1 monoclonal antibody (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c,d, respectively). In cells transduced with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, we detected bands at approximately 55 kDa in the supernatants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, lane 1,2,3), with a band of approximately 35 kDa only in the concentrated supernatant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, lane 3). In cellular extracts, we detected specific bands of 35 and 18 kDa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, lane 4). In cells transduced with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C we also detected bands at approximately 55 kDa in supernatants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, lane 5,6,7), but no bands of 50 kDa or 18 kDa were found in the concentrated supernatant nor in the cell extracts. Therefore, it is suggested that the 35 kDa or 18 kDa band may represent the capsid protein, as previously demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which are not present in ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C-transduced cells. As a positive control, we used a commercially available CHIKV E1 protein (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, lane 9); therefore, it is suggested that the 55 kDa band detected in our blots is E1 protein. In addition, a western blot was performed using a monoclonal antibody against CHIKV E1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>d); we detected a specific band in the positive control E1 protein (lane 9), as well as a 55 kDa band in all the supernatant fractions from both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C-transduced cells. No signal in cell extracts was detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f003">Figure 3</xref>d, lane 4,8), probably due to conformational epitope masking. Taken together, our results suggest that our adenoviral-vectors are able to express the sCHIKV antigens which are able to induce the formation of chikungunya viral-like particles. Thus, we aim to mimic a real antigen exposure of CHIKV particles.
