<p>In order to generate a structural gene cassette (C,E3,E2, 6k, E1) from CHIKV, a protein sequence mosaic was constructed using 252 full-length structural polyprotein sequences collected from the NCBI protein database. A neighbour-joining tree was created which identified three distinct clades (A, B, C; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). Subsequently conservation was assessed within each clade (intra-clade; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f001">Figure 1</xref>b) using a sliding window approach, in which a conservation value between 0 and 1 was assigned, 0 being fully conserved. Anything lower than the first quartile (Q1) was classed as conserved. Lastly, the number of windows conserved across each clade and the degree of conservation were identified and used to create a normalised mosaic consensus. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00322-f001">Figure 1</xref>c illustrates the level of shared conservation between clades, from 0 to -100, with -100 being fully conserved. The resulting sequence mosaic sCHIKV was synthesised (

We constructed chimpanzee adenoviral vector vaccines expressing the full structural cassette (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV), the capsid-deleted structural cassette (ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C) and a non-structural sequence from CHIKV (ChadOx1 NS), the latter being used as a control vaccine (
