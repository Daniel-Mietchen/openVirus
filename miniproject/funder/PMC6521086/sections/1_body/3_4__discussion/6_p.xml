<p>Conversely, we have tested the neutralisation capacity upon a booster vaccination using MVA sCHIKV and MVA sCHIKV ∆C, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our ChAdOx1 CHIKV and ChAdOx1 CHIKV ∆C were able to induce &gt;10
 <sup>3</sup> NT50 titres. Since the NT assay presented here has been used in several vaccine development studies for CHIKV, we are able to afford a comparative assessment between our NT50 titters and other vaccine developments. Garcia-Arriaza et al. reported a MVA-CHIKV vaccine expressing the full structural cassette, in which the mean of NT50 titters were &lt;10
 <sup>3</sup> in a 6-week prime post-immunisation strategy [

 <sup>4</sup> when using the vaccine ∆5NsP3 [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Finally, CHIKV neutralisation titres have been assessed in human sera yielding NT50 titres of 2.6x10
 <sup>4</sup>, 1.8x10
 <sup>4</sup> and 1x10
 <sup>4</sup> in three different CHIKV patients returning from Mauritius, La Reunion and Seychelles, [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] respectively. Therefore, the mean of the NT50 titres we have achieved in both prime (&gt;10
 <sup>3</sup>) and prime-boost regimes (&gt;10
 <sup>4</sup>) reflect the capacity of our viral-vectored vaccines to induce physiologically relevant NT50 titres.
