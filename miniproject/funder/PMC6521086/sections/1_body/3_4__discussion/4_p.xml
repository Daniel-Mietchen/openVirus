<p>Although we have used an ELISA assay to detect anti-E2 antibodies, we are possibly detecting only antibodies against monomeric E2. However, our vaccine platform assembles VLP for CHIKV, in which conformational epitopes might be physiologically relevant to confer protective efficacy in pre-clinical models. Finally, we do not rule out the possibility of inducing responses other structural components.</p>
