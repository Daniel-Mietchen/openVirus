<p>In terms of humoral responses, we have assessed the binding of antibodies from vaccinated mice by ELISA, coating with E2 protein. E2 protein has been shown to be a primary target for neutralising antibodies, since E2 functions for recognition and attachment to cellular receptors. Here, we have demonstrated that our vaccines are able to mount anti-E2 antibody responses. The level of antibody responses after a single immunisation of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV âˆ†C were maintained for up to 10 months, highlighting the suitability of our vaccine approach to promote long-lasting immune responses against CHIKV. Nonetheless, we have tested a boosting strategy using MVA chikungunya vaccines to further increase the anti-E2 antibody titres.</p>
