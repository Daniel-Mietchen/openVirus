<p>The ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C prompt responses in both, B- and T-cell compartments. In vitro neutralisation assays are an excellent standard to test the capacity of CHIKV sero-positive serum to neutralise CHIKV. Here we utilised a widely used neutralisation assay, using a non-infectious CHIKV particle which is fully capable of packing CHIKV replicon RNA, which carries the Gaussia Luciferase (Gluc) gene located in the subgenomic RNA region [

In this study, we tested a rather early time-point after a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C prime vaccination, with the hope to demonstrate efficacy of neutralisation after two weeks post-vaccination, as vaccines should be aimed to guarantee protection in a shortest window of time between vaccination and pathogen exposure.
