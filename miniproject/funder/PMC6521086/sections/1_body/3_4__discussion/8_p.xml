<p>In the ideal CHIKV vaccine development, safety and immunogenicity should be achieved by a single vaccine dose and no adjuvant requirement. Such a simple and robust development could benefit low-income settings, in which affordability and simplification of logistics are essential to deliver the vaccine to a target population. However, in the event that a booster vaccine is needed, an MVA-based vaccine for CHIKV could be used. Given the suitably of ChAdOx1 in the clinical setting, the capability to produce millions of doses in a cost-effective background, its immunogenic and safety profile in humans, and its suitability to be produced under good manufacturing practices (GMP); ChAdOx1 sCHIKV vaccines are relevant candidates to be further explored in pre-clinical and clinical trials.</p>
