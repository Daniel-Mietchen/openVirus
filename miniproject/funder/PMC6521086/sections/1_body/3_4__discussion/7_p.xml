<p>No licensed vaccine is yet available to prevent CHIKV infection. From &gt;20 experimental vaccines, only 4 have reached clinical trials and three are still active and leading the field [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A leading vaccine consists of a virus-like particle that presents antigens similar to CHIKV but without replicating, stimulating immune responses but requiring multiple injections to induce antibody titres [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], thus increasing costs and logistics for its use in in low-income countries. Another development consists of a recombinant live attenuated measles virus (MV) expressing surface CHIKV antigens [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The vaccine was immunogenic and safe in humans, but it also requires &gt;2 doses. Regarding adenoviral vectors, only one human adenovirus expressing CHIKV structural antigens has been published [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Unfortunately, human adenoviral-vectored vaccines are not suitable to vaccinate humans, due to the widespread presence of wild-type adenovirus eliciting anti-adenovirus immunity and thus decreasing vaccine efficiency [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; hence the use of chimpanzee adenovirus circumvent this problem.
