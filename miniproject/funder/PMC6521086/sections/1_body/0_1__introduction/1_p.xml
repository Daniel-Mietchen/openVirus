<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and it is an important growing human health concern in many countries, causing significant outbreaks of acute febrile illness and long-term arthropathy [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Its origins are traced to Africa as an enzootic spillover, belonging to the Semliki Forest Complex of the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> (Togaviridae) [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and was first isolated from a human patient in Tanzania in 1952 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It currently exists as four lineages. The two African enzootic lineages are the West African (WA) and the East Central South Africa (ECSA) lineages. The additional two lineages originated from the ECSA lineage and are called the Asian and the recently emerged Indian Ocean lineage [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CHIKV is composed of a positive, single-stranded genomic RNA of 12 kilobases, encoding four non-structural (ns) and five structural (s) proteins [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The non-structural proteins, nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4, are required for virus replication [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A sub-genomic RNA encodes the structural proteins: capsid (C), E3, E2, 6k and E1, and thus a polyprotein is produced which is then processed by the capsid auto-proteinase and signalases [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The CHIKV surface is mainly composed by E1â€“E2 heterodimers [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] where E1 glycoproteins mediate fusion [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and E2 glycoproteins interact with the host receptor [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Since its discovery the virus has spread to Asia, Oceania/Pacific, Europe, and mostly recently to the Americas, where there have been more than a million reported cases since its detection in late 2013 [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], whilst major outbreaks continue to be recorded in the Asian and African continents. Although chikungunya vaccines have been under development for several decades, no licensed option is yet available and CHIKV still causes substantial morbidity, overwhelming public health systems and contributing to poverty [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the meantime, current control strategies rely on reducing human exposure to potentially infected mosquito vectors. Several institutions are now engaged in the development of a safe and cost-effective CHIKV vaccine; such vaccines [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] are based on live-attenuated or inactivated CHIKV, chimeric CHIKV, DNA, subunit, virus-like particle (VLP) and viral-vectored platforms. They are mainly designed to induce humoral responses against the structural viral protein E2, as well as E1, due to strong correlates of protection with neutralising antibodies against structural CHIKV proteins in asymptomatic cases [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition to that, passive transfer of sera from convalescent humans to mice prevented infection [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] whilst neutralising antibodies against E1 and E2 were able to protect immunocompromised mice [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In humans, an early IgG3 neutralising response is associated with reduced clinical symptoms [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and asymptomatic cases have been associated with high neutralising antibody titres [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here, we describe the design and development of CHIKV vaccines based on the clinically relevant adenoviral vector, ChAdOx1 and the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) platforms [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00322" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Viral vector expression of the sCHIKV proteins is able to form chikungunya viral particles, thus mimicking a real exposure of CHIKV, whilst being an in silico designed mosaic protein, aiming to represent all four CHIKV lineages. In mice, ChAdOx1 vaccines candidates expressing sCHIKV antigens are able to induce strong humoral and cellular responses upon a single and non-adjuvanted immunisation approach. Importantly, we present evidence of in vitro neutralising activity in sera from vaccinated mice. Finally, whilst durability of humoral responses was achieved upon a single immunisation, MVA vaccines expressing sCHIKV were produced to be used as an alternative heterologous booster regime (ChAdOx1/MVA), in order to increase neutralising antibody titres. Taken together, a viral vectored vaccine for CHIKV, based on the ChAdOx1 platform is a good candidate for further pre-clinical and clinical studies.
