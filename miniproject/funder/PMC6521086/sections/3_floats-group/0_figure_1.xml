 <caption>
  <p>Design of mosaic chikungunya virus (CHIKV) structural polyprotein sequence. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Neighbour-joining tree of full-length CHIKV structural proteins. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Intra-clade conservation (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) assessed by in-house sliding window algorithm. Conservation scaled between 0 and 1 with 0 being fully conserved within respective clades. Q1 cut-off for conservation of each clade indicated by coloured dashed line. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Inter-clade conservation (between A, B and C) across the three clades. Degree of conservation between either all three clades (blue) and only two clades (orange) indicated by cumulative conservation between 0 to −100.
