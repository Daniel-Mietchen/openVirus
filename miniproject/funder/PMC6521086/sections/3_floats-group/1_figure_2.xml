  <p>Genome organisation of CHIKV and generation of vaccine candidates. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic figure of the full genomic RNA of CHIKV depicting the non-structural and structural coding regions. Full structural antigens (sCHIKV), capsid-deleted structural antigens (sCHIKV âˆ†C) and non-structural antigens (NS) from CHIKV were synthesised. (
   <bold>B</bold>) ChAdOx1 vaccines were produced to encode the stated candidate genes under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV). The antigen cassette is located within the Early gene E1-deleted region. Grey boxes are a graphical representation of the adenoviral genome, with the E3 deletion. ITR (inverted terminal repeat), Bovine growth hormone (BGH) poly adenylation region. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccines were produced to encode the stated candidate genes, driven by the p7.5 promoter. Marker GFP is driven by the FP4b promoter. Antigenic cassette is inserted between the thymidine kinase (TK) locus. Non-structural regions were used to generate the control vaccines ChAdOx1 NS and MVA NS.
