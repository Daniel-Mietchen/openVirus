  <p>Humoral immune responses elicited by viral-vectored vaccines. (
   <bold>A</bold>) BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) with a dose of 10
   <sup>8</sup> I.U. of ChAdOx1 vaccines. CHIKV E2 ELISA was performed with sera obtained from vaccinated mice at week 2, week 6 and 10 months after a single ChAdOx1 vaccination in which the OD405 values are represented over several 3-fold sera dilutions. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Reciprocal log E2 ELISA titters were calculated for all groups shown in A. In addition, a heterologous prime 1.5 month-boost 0.5 month is presented. Colours and shapes represent groups vaccinated with each vaccine.
