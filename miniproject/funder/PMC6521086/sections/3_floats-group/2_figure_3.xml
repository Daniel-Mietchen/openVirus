  <p>Characterisation of recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAdOx1)-based vaccines for CHIKV. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Electron microscopy from a ChAdOx1 sCHIKV vaccine preparation, white line is 100 nm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Sucrose gradient purification from the supernatants after expression of CHIKV structural cassette (left). Transmission electron microscopy showing CHIKVLP formation from the isolated gradient band, the white line is 200 nm. (
   <bold>C,D</bold>) Transduction of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV ∆C in Vero cells; supernatant and cellular extracts were probed against anti-CHIKV serum (
   <bold>C</bold>) or anti-E1 monoclonal antibody (
   <bold>D</bold>). Blue arrowhead in sCHIKV blot shows bands that were not present in sCHIKV ∆C.
