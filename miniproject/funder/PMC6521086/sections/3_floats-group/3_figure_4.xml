  <p>Cellular immune responses elicited by ChAdOx1 vaccines. (
   <bold>A</bold>) BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6 per group) were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) with a dose of 10
   <sup>8</sup> I.U. of ChAdOx1 vaccines. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured with a peptide pool containing the CHIKV structural antigens by ELISpot for IFNγ producing cells. (
   <bold>B</bold>) ELISpot from the same mice, using deconvolution of peptides spanning the C, E3, E2, 6k and E1 regions, respectively. Values represent the spot-forming cells (SFC) per million PBMCs. 20-mer peptides spanning the CHIKV structural polyprotein (10 µg/mL) were used for stimulation. Line colours and shapes represent mice vaccinated with each vaccine.
