  <p>CHIKV neutralisation assay. NT50 titres were assessed upon incubation of BHK-21 cells with CHIKV virus replicon particle-based (VRP) in the presence or absence of serially diluted sera from BALB/c mice, vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 sCHIKV (red line) or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV âˆ†C (green line) vaccines at 2-week post prime (
   <bold>A</bold>) and 1-week post-boost (
   <bold>B</bold>). NT50 titres were calculated using a non-linear fit of the log-dose versus response.
