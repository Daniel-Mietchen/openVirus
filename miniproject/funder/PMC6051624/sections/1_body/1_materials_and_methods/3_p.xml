<p>After providing written informed consent, participants completed the Neighborhood Locator Questionnaire (NLQ) with study staff. This questionnaire collected information on the location of 4 neighborhoods: home (where they lived), social (where they socialized most often) and sexual (where they most recently had sex and where they most often had sex in the last 3 months). The men identified the neighborhoods by utilizing Google Earth on a computer to ‘drop a pin’ at the closest intersection. Geospatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the pin drop for each type of neighborhood were recorded. Next, the participants completed an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview Software (ACASI) questionnaire. Next, a social and sexual network questionnaire (SSNQ) was completed with an interviewer with data entry into a computer system. Participants were asked, using a name generator, to name up to 10 people with whom they have had a social relationship and up to 15 sexual partners with whom they have had anal or vaginal sex in the last 3 months.</p>
