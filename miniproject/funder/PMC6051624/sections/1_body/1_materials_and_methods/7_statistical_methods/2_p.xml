<p>HCV infections based on laboratory testing on stored serum samples of NYC M2M participants were classified as follows: (1) recent HCV infection (HCV antibody and RNA positive, and recent infection by HCV antibody avidity assay), (2) chronic HCV infection (HCV antibody and RNA positive, no recent infection by HCV antibody avidity assay), (3) resolved HCV infection with clearance (HCV antibody positive, RNA negative; either those who were successfully treated for HCV infection or had spontaneously cleared HCV), and (5) no HCV exposure. Prevalence of HCV antibody seropositivity (recent, chronic, and resolved HCV infections) was computed and stratified by HIV serostatus (positive, negative/indeterminate) based on testing and self-report at the study visit; 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.</p>
