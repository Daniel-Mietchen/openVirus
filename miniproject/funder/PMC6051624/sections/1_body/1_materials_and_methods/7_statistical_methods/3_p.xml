<p>To determine factors that were independently associated with HCV antibody seropositivity (recent, chronic, and resolved HCV infections) among MSM in NYC, the following variables were included: sociodemographics (age, race/ethnicity, education, annual household income, employment), HIV serostatus, history of IDU in last 3 months and ever in the past, general alcohol use, IDU and non-IDU [from ACASI], self-reported STIs [from ACASI], alcohol and substance use during condomless sex [from SSNQ], and sexual risk behaviors such as number of male, transgender, and female partners, having an anonymous sex partner, having a sex partner met on the internet or mobile application, any condomless insertive anal intercourse with a male partner, and any condomless receptive anal intercourse [all from SSNQ]. Differences in HCV seropositivity were compared by sociodemographic, HIV serostatus, and risk behavior variables using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. Characteristics that were significant with p-value ≤0.10 in the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were included in multivariable logistic regression models to determine factors associated with having HCV seropositivity. A forward selection process was used to identify variables to include in the final multivariable models. A two-sided p-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>
