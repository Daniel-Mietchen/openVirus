<p>To determine clusters of genetically linked HCV variants among recently and chronically HCV-infected MSM in NYC using phylogenetic analysis, HCV genotypes of recently and chronically HCV-infected individuals were determined based on alignment of Core/E1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment 432 basepairs. Nucleotide Pairwise Distance (NPD) was performed in Geneious and included reference sequences for subtype 1a and 1b using 21 sequences sampled in NYC from 2001â€“2005[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A phylogenetic tree was created using maximum likelihood estimates to identify clusters of genetically linked HCV variants. Phylogenies were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach and those sequences linked by nodes with bootstrap support &gt;70 considered clustered.
