<p>The identification of individuals with recent infection was based on a HCV antibody avidity assay using diethylamine (DEA) as a chaotropic agent[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. An avidity index was calculated by determining the percentage that the DEA reduces in optical density of the sample in comparison to a paired non-treated well. An avidity index &lt;30% was considered recently infected. The algorithm for defining recent HCV infection was an avidity index &lt;30% and a positive HCV RNA viral load. We used a method where individuals appeared recently infected for a mean of 147 days after seroconversion and &lt; 1% of 579 chronically infected individuals (&gt;2 years post infection) were misclassified[
