<p>HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted and amplified to generate a 432 base-pair region of Core/E1 for sequencing. HCV genotype was determined. All sequence data generated from participants, reference sequences for subtype 1a and 1b, and unrelated sequences from NYC study of people who inject drugs[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] were used to generate a maximum likelihood tree using PhyML with 200 bootstraps. Phylogenies were estimated using a maximum likelihood approach and those sequences linked by nodes with bootstrap support &gt;70 considered clustered.
