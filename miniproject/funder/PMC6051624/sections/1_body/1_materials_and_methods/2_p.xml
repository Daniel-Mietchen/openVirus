They were eligible for the study if they self-reported biological male sex at birth; engaged in anal sex with a man in the past 3 months; at least 18 years of age; resided in New York City; communicated in English or Spanish; and were willing and able to give informed consent for the study. Interested participants were referred to the study website and screened for preliminary eligibility. Study staff made attempts to contact preliminarily eligible participants to further screen for eligibility and schedule an on-site study visit.
