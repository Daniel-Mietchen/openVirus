<p>In multivariate analyses in our study, we found that HCV antibody seropositivity was significantly associated having reported any STI in the last 3 months, along with older age, IDU ever history, and HIV-positive serostatus. In contrast to other studies, methamphetamine use was not significantly associated with HCV seropositivity. This may be due to a Type II error given the low number of HCV antibody-positive participants found in our study. In a study comparing prevalence of HCV infection among IDU MSM and non-IDU MSM in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, HCV antibody seroprevalence among IDU MSM was 42.9%, significantly higher than 4.0% among non-IDU MSM; in addition, HCV clearance was lower among IDU MSM compared to non-IDU MSM. In both IDU and non-IDU MSM, HIV infection, older age, and Black race were associated with higher HCV antibody seroprevalence. In contrast, our study did not find race/ethnicity to be a significant factor, which may be due to a Type II error given the low number of HCV antibody-positive participants found in our study. In this same study, syphilis infection was associated with HCV seroprevalence among non-IDU MSM only[

 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In light of our study findings, we agree with annual testing of HCV infection among HIV-positive MSM, given the higher rates of HCV infection seen among HIV-positive MSM compared to HIV-negative MSM. Rather than universal HCV testing in all HIV-negative MSM, we recommend testing of HCV infection among HIV-negative MSM if they report having a recent STI and past IDU use.
