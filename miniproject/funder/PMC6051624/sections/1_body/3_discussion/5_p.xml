<p>There are limitations to this study. First, the mode of HCV acquisition, either via IDU, sexual, or other means such as via blood product transfusions, could not be confirmed in our participants, as the ACASI did not ask specific questions about HCV infection and mode of acquisition. In addition, the ACASI and SSNQ did not specifically ask about use of sex toys, fisting, or bleeding during sex, which have been reported to be associated with sexual transmission of HCV[

Second, our sample size, with a total of 1,028 participants, might have not have been adequate and might have limited a full analysis of the factors associated with HCV serostatus Third, we were not able to determine prevalence of HCV reinfection in our study population; high rates of HCV reinfection have been reported among MSM, especially HIV-infected MSM, in the literature[

 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, in those MSM with HCV seropositivity and undetectable HCV viral load, we were not able to differentiate between those with HCV spontaneous clearance vs. successful HCV treatment, since HCV treatment history was not specifically asked during the study. Though the use of a systematic sampling scheme in the main NYC M2M study should minimize selection bias, the participants might not be representative of all MSM living in NYC, with high education level and low past injection drug use history reported in our sample as well as the inclusion criteria of the NYC M2M study specifying that they had to report having anal sex in the last 3 months. In addition, the data might not be generalizable to MSM living in other urban areas in the U.S. Furthermore, self-reported data on the ACASI and data reported to interviewers on the SSNQ might not accurately reflect the actual risk behaviors of the participant and of their partners as a result of socially desirable responding. In addition, in this study we defined recent HCV infection using an HCV antibody avidity index &lt;30% and a positive HCV RNA viral load. This definition is not supported by all studies to date[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], though the implications on our findings are limited given the small number of HCV RNA positive samples found in our study. Lastly, there are limitations inherent to the statistical methodology, with cautious interpretation of findings suggested. The lack of association with variables such as methamphetamine use and race/ethnicity might be due to Type I and II errors resulting from the small number of HCV antibody seropositivity and relatively small sample size.
