<p>A unique feature of our study was the use of the NLQ to map the geographic distribution of HCV infections among MSM at the level of specific NYC neighborhoods in which the individuals lived, socialized, and had sex. To date, epidemiologic research on the sexually transmitted HCV epidemic among MSM in NYC has been based on health department surveillance and vital statistics data[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or on referral of suspected HCV infections in HIV-infected MSM from physicians to an referral academic medical center[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Public health department and vital statistics data often lack detailed information on where HCV infections are occurring, such as specific NYC neighborhoods, to ascertain whether there is geographic variance in HCV infections within NYC, while referral data are limited by selection bias and by the exclusion of HIV- negative MSM. Although our study did not find evidence of a cluster of recent HCV infections and the geographic distribution of HCV infections differed only slightly based on home, social, and sexual neighborhoods, probably limited by small number of detected HCV infections, we encourage future studies to examine not only home neighborhoods but also social and sexual neighborhoods to help identify NYC areas with the highest HCV prevalence to guide prioritization of HCV screening and prevention interventions. In addition, by combining these studies with phylogenetic analysis to determine clusters of genetically linked HCV infections, unexpected HCV transmission networks not recognized by geospatial mapping and behavioral data might be discovered.
