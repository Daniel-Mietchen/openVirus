<p>In our study, using HCV antibody avidity testing, we detected recent HCV infection in only two participants, with no evidence of a clustered HCV epidemic based on phylogenetic analysis. This finding differs from a previous finding of an HCV epidemic cluster in NYC, perhaps because our study encompassed a community-recruited sample of mostly HIV-uninfected MSM, with a proportion of HIV-infected MSM, whereas the other study focused solely on HIV-infected MSM who reported no injection drug use. In the NYC study among HIV-infected MSM using phylogenetic analysis, 74 cases of recent sexually acquired HCV infection were reported from 2005–2010, with five clusters of genetically linked HCV strains documented among the men[

In this study, condomless receptive anal intercourse and sex while high on methamphetamines were independent risk factors for recent HCV infection. The predominant HCV subtype in our study was subtype 1a, followed by subtype 1b. Several different HCV genotypes have been documented in sexual transmission among MSM. In the NYC study described above, a vast majority (90%) of the sexually-transmitted HCV infections among HIV-infected MSM were genotype 1a, with 6% being genotype 1b[

In another Dutch study among MSM attending an STI clinic from 2007–2008, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated at least 4 distinct clusters of HCV infection, suggesting sexual transmission of HCV, with most of the HCV isolates being genotype 1a (71%) and 4d (17%), with the remainder being 3a (8%) and 1b (4%)[
