 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200269.g001">Fig 1</xref> depicts the maps of HCV seroprevalence by neighborhoods at the NTA level, with home (where the men live), social (where the men socialize), and sexual neighborhoods (where they most often have sex in the last 3 months and where they most recently had sex). NTAs in solid colors represent number of HCV seroprevalence as indicated in the legend of each map, while NTAs outlined in red and blue depict recent and chronic HCV infections, respectively. HCV seropositivity was found in all five NYC boroughs, with most concentrated in mid/lower Manhattan for home, social, and sexual neighborhoods. The two recent HCV infections were detected in two different NTAs in Brooklyn for home neighborhoods, with change to Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Bronx NTAs for social and sexual neighborhoods.
