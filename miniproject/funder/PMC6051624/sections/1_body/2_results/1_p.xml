<p>Of 1,458 men enrolled in the NYC M2M study between 2010 and 2013, 1,030 (71%) consented to serum storage. Excluding two samples with insufficient serum volume for HCV lab analysis, 1,028 men were included. Of these 1,028 men, 79.7% were HIV-negative and 20.3% HIV-positive by testing and self-report (
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); 62 (6%) refused HIV testing, of whom 42% (26/62) self-reported being HIV-positive. Of 1,028 men tested, 29/1028 (2.8%) were HCV antibody-positive. Of these 29 who were HCV antibody-positive, 12/29 (41%) were HCV RNA-positive (11 subtype 1a and 1 subtype 1b). Two of 12 HCV RNA-positive participants had low antibody avidity values, suggesting recent HCV infection.
