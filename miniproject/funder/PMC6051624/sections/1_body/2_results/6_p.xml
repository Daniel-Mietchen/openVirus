 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200269.g002">Fig 2</xref> depicts the phylogenetic tree comparing sequence data generated from the 11 NYC M2M participants with subtype 1a HCV infection (labelled “NYC” and in red) and 1 NYC M2M participant with subtype 1b HCV infection (labelled “NYC” and in green), as well as reference sequences for subtype 1a and 1b including 21 sequences sampled in NYC from 2001–2015 from Kuntzen et al[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The average nucleotide pairwise distance (NPD) among 11 NYC M2M study subtype 1a was 90.1%; the average NPD among Kuntzen et al. subtype 1a was 89.4%; the average NPD among Kuntzen et al. subtype 1b was 92%. The average NPD among NYC M2M study and Kuntzen et al. subtype 1a was 90.2%, while the average NPD among NYC M2M study subtype 1b and Kuntzen et al. subtype 1b was 89.9%. The two recent HCV infections in the NYC M2M study (denoted with italics) were not clustered together.
