<p>In conclusion, in a large community recruited sample of HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM in NYC with low prevalence of IDU, overall HCV seroprevalence was 2.8%. A higher HCV prevalence was found among HIV-positive MSM compared to HIV-negative MSM. Of the 29 men who were HCV antibody-positive in our study, 12 or 41% were HCV RNA-positive, indicating chronic HCV infection. Only 2 recent HCV infections were detected based on HCV avidity testing, with no clustering of genetically linked HCV infections based on phylogenetic analysis. HCV antibody seropositivity was significantly associated having reported any recent STI, older age, IDU ever history, and HIV-positive serostatus. Our results support testing of HCV infection among HIV-negative MSM if they report having a recent STI and IDU ever in the past rather than universal HCV testing in all HIV-negative MSM.</p>
