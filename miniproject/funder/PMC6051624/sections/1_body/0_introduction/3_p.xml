<p>Given the benefits of early compared to late HCV treatment, accurate diagnosis of recent HCV infection is important. Clinical diagnosis of recent HCV infection can be challenging since newly infected individuals are frequently asymptomatic[

 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].HCV antibody avidity assays are research tools that measure the binding strength of anti-HCV antibodies in infected individuals. These assays can be used in research to distinguish recent infection from chronic and resolved HCV infections[

HCV antibody avidity increases gradually over the course of HCV infection: antibodies produced early in infection have weak antigen-binding ability while mature antibodies generated later in infection have strong antigen-binding capacity. HCV antibody avidity assays can provide advantages over traditional laboratory diagnosis of recent HCV infection and can be important for estimating HCV incidence using cross-sectional research data[
