<p>Untreated HCV infection leads to chronic hepatitis in 60–80% of cases. Spontaneous clearance of HCV without treatment is seen in approximately 25% of exposed individuals in the first 6 months. Serious complications of chronic hepatitis include liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma[

 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], with the use of direct acting antiviral drugs under investigation for recent HCV infection. Early treatment has public health implications by potentially decreasing the risk of onward sexual and parenteral transmission of HCV to partners. Cost-effectiveness studies show that early HCV treatment after diagnosis maximizes medical costs savings and gains in quality-adjusted life years[
