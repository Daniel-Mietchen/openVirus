<p>Although primary transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is through the parenteral route[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], epidemics of sexually transmitted HCV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in Europe, Australia, Asia, and North America, with blood remaining the likely medium for sexual transmission of HCV in these outbreaks[

 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These sexually transmitted HCV outbreaks have mostly involved HIV-infected MSM, with lower HCV infection rates in HIV-negative MSM[

In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) study of HCV infections among HIV positive and HIV negative MSM in four U.S. metropolitan areas from 1984–2011, 115 cases of incident HCV infection were reported (incidence rate of 2.08/1,000 person-years [PYs]). In multivariate analysis, condomless receptive anal sex with more than one male partner, older age, HIV infection, heavy alcohol use, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, and syphilis infection were significantly associated with incident HCV infection[
 <xref rid="pone.0200269.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. High rates of HCV reinfection of up to 15/100 PYs have been reported among HIV-infected MSM who had previously received successful HCV treatment or had spontaneously cleared their HCV infections[
