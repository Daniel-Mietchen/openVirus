<p>Based on current understanding of relationships between temperature and transmission parameters, our result that 
 <italic>r</italic> consistently peaks around 33°C (95% CI: 32.6–33.2°C) led us to examine which populations globally could remain below, newly exceed, or further surpass this temperature under future climate change scenarios. We found that most people currently living in areas at risk for DENV transmission could be subject to increased epidemic growth rates by 2050 under a range of scenarios about future temperature increases. For most DENV-endemic areas, this would have little effect on the overall burden of disease, which is already high, but it could affect transmission dynamics, making epidemics more intense. At the same time, there are a number of important caveats to bear in mind about these projections. First, transmission depends not only on temperature but also other abiotic variables, such as rainfall, in complex ways [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Third, long-term projections of dengue are highly variable and conflicting [
