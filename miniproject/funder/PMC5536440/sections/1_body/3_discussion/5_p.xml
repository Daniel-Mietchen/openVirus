Independently validating our calculations with epidemic data could be one way to address these uncertainties, but epidemic growth rates based on case reports can be difficult to compare across sites. Even if factors such as temperature are consistent across sites, still others may vary and have major impacts on epidemic growth rates, including mosquito abundance [
