<p>Although 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is important for quantifying threshold conditions for pathogen persistence, it is not well suited for characterizing temporal dynamics of transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. By combining temperature-dependent descriptions of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the generation interval, our results offer a new way to characterize the intensity of dengue epidemics as a function of temperature. One common concern about analyses based on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, and estimates of 
 <italic>r</italic> based on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, is whether they are relevant beyond the context of a novel pathogen in a fully susceptible population. Estimates of 
 <italic>r</italic> based on the effective reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], offer a more generalizable alternative to estimates of 
 <italic>r</italic> based on 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, which is what we have considered in this study. To consider how the distinction between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic> might impact our results, we note the relationship 
 <italic>R</italic> = 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>
 <italic>S</italic>, where 
 <italic>S</italic> is the proportion of a population that is susceptible. This linear relationship between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic> implies that extrapolating our results below 
 <italic>S</italic> = 1 should result in behavior similar to how our temperature-dependent estimates of 
 <italic>r</italic> vary with changes in 
 <italic>λ</italic>, given that 
 <italic>λ</italic> also affects 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> linearly. Perhaps most importantly, this reasoning implies that the temperature at which epidemic growth rates peak should be applicable across contexts in which either the susceptible fraction 
 <italic>S</italic> or the mosquito-human ratio 
 <italic>λ</italic> vary. Still other factors affecting 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>r</italic> could vary across contexts—e.g., species or strain differences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]—that could be important for some future applications.
