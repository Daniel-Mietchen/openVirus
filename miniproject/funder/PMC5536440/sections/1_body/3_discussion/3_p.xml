<p>Our calculations of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> are consistent with the notion that temperature plays an important role in determining optimal conditions for transmission (i.e., peak 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> at 32.5°C) and for delimiting conditions where transmission is sustainable (i.e., 
 <italic>R</italic>

 <italic>λ</italic>, which we allowed to vary within a plausible range due to the fact that it depends on a wide range of factors other than temperature. In particular, 
 <italic>λ</italic> depends on the availability and quality of aquatic habitats for mosquitoes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Some studies have used temperature-based

 <sub>0</sub> calculations to delimit geographic ranges of other vector-borne diseases such as malaria [

 <sub>0</sub> solely as part of an intermediate step to link the generation interval with epidemic growth rates.
