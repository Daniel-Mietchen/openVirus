<p>The central advance that we have made is the development of a probabilistic description of the generation interval for dengue virus (DENV) that is based on first principles of transmission, synthesizes pertinent data for DENV and

Although there is little data with which to independently validate our calculations, the mode of our generation time distribution at optimal temperatures for transmission (approximately 16 days at 28–32°C) accords with independent estimates of this quantity based on statistical analyses of spatiotemporal dengue case data from Thailand (15–17 days) [
