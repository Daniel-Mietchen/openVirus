<p>The generation interval has a wide range of applications in epidemiology, including the identification of sources of infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the establishment of causal linkages between cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and the characterization of temporal variation in transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These and other studies have typically assumed a static generation interval of either fixed length [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or with some standard statistical distribution [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our result that the generation interval for DENV is not static but is instead highly dynamic with respect to temperature highlights that transmission models for DENV and other arboviruses could be systematically inaccurate by excluding temperature-dependent effects. Future work will be needed to address the existence and significance of any such inaccuracies, but our results about the sensitivity of 
 <italic>r</italic> to the form of the generation interval and temperature dependency therein suggest that these effects could be substantial.
