<p>Although 
 <italic>r</italic> will vary across different regions for different reasons, our finding that temperature changes under future climate change could elevate epidemic intensity of dengue in some areas suggests a categorically new way in which climate change might impact infectious disease transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our quantification of these effects focused on DENV, but these results also offer tentative, but plausible, estimates of how epidemics of other viruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, such as chikungunya and Zika, might be impacted under future climate change. Our qualitative results apply even more broadly, implying that temperature has the potential to shape multiple aspects of vector-borne parasite life history and to influence multiple aspects of the temporal dynamics of associated diseases.
