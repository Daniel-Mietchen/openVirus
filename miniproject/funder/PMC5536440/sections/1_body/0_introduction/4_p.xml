<p>Our goal was to quantify the effects of temperature on DENV epidemic growth rates by first establishing a probabilistic description of DENV generation intervals as a function of temperature. We then combined our generation interval calculations with a temperature-dependent formulation of the basic reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, and solved for the epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> as a function of temperature. This new capability to calculate 
 <italic>r</italic> as a function of temperature allowed us to identify temperature ranges that maximize 
 <italic>r</italic> and to classify regions by their potential for increasing or decreasing epidemic growth rates based on their current and future temperatures. Our results and the accompanying code are made freely available online at
