<p>Analyses of the effects of temperature on vector-borne pathogen transmission have focused primarily on the basic reproduction number

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is a fundamentally important epidemiological quantity, because it is informative about the conditions under which a pathogen can invade, or be eliminated from, a host population. The generation interval, which is the period of time separating sequential infections, is the temporal analogue of

 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the generation interval are related to the epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic>, which is defined as the per capita change in incidence per unit time and characterizes the dynamics of early-stage epidemic growth in a susceptible population. Because the relationship between 
 <italic>r</italic> and temperature has never been characterized for arboviruses, there is little scientific basis for understanding how epidemic growth rates may be related to temperature.
