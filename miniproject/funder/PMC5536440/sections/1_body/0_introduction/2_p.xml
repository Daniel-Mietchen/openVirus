<p>A number of factors can lead to variability in the frequency and severity of arbovirus epidemics, including importation probability [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In particular, temperature is known to be a major driver of spatial and temporal variability in arbovirus transmission, as indicated by empirical studies of relationships between temperature and several epidemiologically important vector and pathogen traits, including mosquito lifespan [
