<p>Allowing for diurnal temperature fluctuations (8°C daily temperature range for all mean temperature values) shortened the mean generation interval and increased its variance relative to a scenario with no diurnal temperature fluctuation (

The combined effect of these changes on epidemic growth rate was a slight decrease, while the temperature at which the epidemic growth rate peaks remained close to its value under a scenario with no diurnal temperature fluctuation (
