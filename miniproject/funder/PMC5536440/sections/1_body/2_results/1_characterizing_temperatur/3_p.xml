<p>Effects of temperature on the DENV generation interval and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> contributed to similar effects on epidemic growth rate, 
 <italic>r</italic>. Under mean estimates of model parameters, 
 <italic>r</italic> increased with temperature until it peaked at 33°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Under 1,000 Monte Carlo samples of model parameters, peak temperature for 
 <italic>r</italic> varied within a relatively narrow band with 95% of values falling between 32.6 and 33.2°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As both 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and the generation interval are temperature-dependent, changes in 
 <italic>r</italic> due to temperature occur through both components. At a constant mosquito emergence rate 
 <italic>λ</italic>, changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> accounted for the majority of changes in 
 <italic>r</italic>, although changes in the generation interval accounted for a greater degree of change near extreme and peak temperature regions (
