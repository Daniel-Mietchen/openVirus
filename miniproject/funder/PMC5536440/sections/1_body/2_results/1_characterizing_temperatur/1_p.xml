<p>We developed a probabilistic description of the DENV generation interval by sequentially summing random variables associated with each phase of the transmission cycle (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) resulted in a description of the generation interval that was itself strongly dependent on temperature and captured variability and uncertainty in the underlying components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For example, mean generation interval halved from 30 to 15 days with a change in temperature from 25 to 35Â°C. Sensitivity of the mean generation interval to changes in temperature was nonlinear, with steeper changes at more extreme temperature values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) due to increasing steepness of the relationships between temperature and the component random variables (
