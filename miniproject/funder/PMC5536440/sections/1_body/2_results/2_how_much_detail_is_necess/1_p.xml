<p>Because a fully detailed generation interval distribution is beyond the capabilities of many commonly used modeling frameworks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we examined the correspondence between epidemic growth rates 
 <italic>r</italic> calculated under our detailed approach and under four less detailed approximations of the generation interval that are commonly used in transmission models. A fixed-length generation interval yielded a consistently better approximation of our detailed calculations of 
 <italic>r</italic> as a function of temperature than did an exponentially distributed generation interval (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g005">Fig 5A</xref> vs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g005">5B</xref>). Calculations of 
 <italic>r</italic> under the fixed-length approximation tended to match calculations of temperature-dependent 
 <italic>r</italic> under the detailed generation interval distribution particularly well in temperature ranges of significance to epidemics (i.e., where 
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 0) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). For both fixed-length and exponential generation interval distributions, allowing their mean values to follow the temperature-dependent model improved their correspondence with our detailed formulation of temperature-dependent 
 <italic>r</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g005">Fig 5A &amp; 5B</xref> vs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g005">5C &amp; 5D</xref>). These differences in 
 <italic>r</italic> resulting from different assumptions about the distribution and temperature dependence of 
 <italic>r</italic> could be of significance to epidemic projections, given that differences in 
 <italic>r</italic> as small as 0.01 can lead to differences in incidence projections of an order of magnitude only a few months into an epidemic (
