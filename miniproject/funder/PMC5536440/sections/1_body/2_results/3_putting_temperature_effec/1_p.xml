<p>Our result that the temperature threshold for maximum 
 <italic>r</italic> was relatively constant around 33°C (95% CI: 32.6–33.2°C) offers a useful reference point. In a given area and with other factors held constant, an increase in temperatures beyond this threshold would imply first a rise and then a fall in 
 <italic>r</italic> between present and future. An increase in temperatures that never exceeds this threshold would imply an increase in 
 <italic>r</italic> between present and future. At most times of year in most regions of the world that are suitable for DENV transmission, temperature increases by 2050 are expected to fall into the latter category (i.e., remaining below 33°C), suggesting that temperature changes could increase epidemic growth rates in those areas (

On the other hand, temperature increases by 2050 in regions such as India and the African Sahel are expected to exceed 33°C during April-June, potentially resulting in lower epidemic growth rates in those areas during a portion of the year (
