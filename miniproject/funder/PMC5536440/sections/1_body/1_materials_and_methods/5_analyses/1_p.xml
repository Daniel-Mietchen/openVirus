<p>We first derived a formulation of the generation interval for dengue, stochastic variability therein, and its dependence on temperature based on the assumptions described above. We then performed analyses of the relationship between temperature and 
 <italic>r</italic>, including identification of the temperature that maximizes 
 <italic>r</italic> and how incremental changes in 
 <italic>r</italic> driven by changes in temperature can be attributed to distinct contributions from changes in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> versus changes in the generation interval. For comparison with our detailed formulation of the epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic>, we examined two approximations of the generation interval commonly used in transmission models: a fixed-length generation interval and an exponentially distributed generation interval. For each, we considered two formulations: one with a mean generation interval of 16 days [
