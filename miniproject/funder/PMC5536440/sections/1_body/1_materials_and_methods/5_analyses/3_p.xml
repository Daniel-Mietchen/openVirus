<p>Potential for diurnal temperature fluctuations to influence DENV transmission has been suggested by temperature effects on extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and mosquito survival [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We examined potential effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on the generation interval, basic reproduction number

 <sub>0</sub>, and epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> by introducing an 8째C diurnal temperature range (DTR) around all mean temperatures. We assumed a sinusoidal progression within the day with a decreasing exponential curve at night [

 <italic>aegypti</italic> survival of 37.73째C over three consecutive hours and 40.73째C in any single hour, as well as a maximum temperature of 45.9째C in any hour of the day for DENV incubation to take place, similar to assumptions of another recent model of temperature-dependent viral transmission by
