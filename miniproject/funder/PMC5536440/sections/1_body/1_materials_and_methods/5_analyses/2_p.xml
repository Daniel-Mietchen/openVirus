<p>We next considered how average monthly temperature data at 5 km x 5 km resolution for each month of the year based on historical records (average for 1950–2000) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] may change epidemic growth rates under climate change scenarios. For this analysis, we used three different scenarios for mean temperature in 2050 (average for 2040–2060) corresponding to Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) that describe a set of alternative trajectories for the atmospheric concentration of key greenhouse gases: RCP 8.5, high greenhouse gas concentration scenario; RCP 6.0, medium baseline (or high mitigation) scenario; and RCP 4.5, intermediate mitigation scenario [
