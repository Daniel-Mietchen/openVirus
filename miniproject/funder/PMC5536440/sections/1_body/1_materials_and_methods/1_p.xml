<p>We first describe our formulation of each of three major metrics of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission: the generation interval, the basic reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, and the epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic>. The first two are calculated a priori as a function of many of the same temperature-dependent parameters, whereas the third is derived from the first two using a fundamental mathematical relationship among all three. We then describe analyses that we performed to evaluate the epidemiological significance of these three different measures of how temperature impacts dengue virus transmission.
