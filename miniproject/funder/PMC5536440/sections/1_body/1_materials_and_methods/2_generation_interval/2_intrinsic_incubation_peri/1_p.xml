<p>Defining the intrinsic incubation period (IIP) as “the time between a human being infected and the onset of symptoms,” Chan and Johansson [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] fitted time-to-event models to 204 observations from 35 studies. They concluded that differences in the IIP across serotypes were indistinguishable and that the IIP was best described by a lognormal distribution with mean 5.97 days and standard deviation 1.64 days. Given their comprehensive treatment of data from a broad range of studies, we adopted this best-fit lognormal distribution in our analysis (
