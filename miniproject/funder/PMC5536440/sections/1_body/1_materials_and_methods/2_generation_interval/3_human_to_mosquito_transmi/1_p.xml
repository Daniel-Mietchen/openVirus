<p>We define the human-to-mosquito transmission period (HMTP) as the entirety of the elapsed time between the conclusion of the IIP and when a susceptible mosquito becomes infected. This depends on both the duration of infectiousness and the timing of a personâ€™s infectiousness over the course of their infection. We based our estimates of HMTP on studies in which people were experimentally infected and their infectiousness to mosquitoes assessed over time. These data have been re-analyzed and compiled on a daily basis relative to onset of fever [

To obtain a probabilistic estimate of the period of transmission from a human host to a mosquito vector, we fitted a normal probability density function multiplied by a constant scaling factor to the data presented by Nishiura and Halstead [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using numerical likelihood maximization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g001">Fig 1</xref>, HMTP) and normalized it to yield a description of the probability that an infected mosquito acquired the infection on day 
 <italic>t</italic> relative to the onset of symptoms in its human blood-meal host. This interpretation assumes that mosquito densities and biting rates are constant over the human infectious period.
