<p>We define the generation interval as the elapsed time between a primary human infection and a secondary human infection deriving from that primary human infection via two bites from the same individual mosquito [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To derive a quantitative, probabilistic description of the generation interval for dengue, we adapted an existing framework that defines the generation interval as a sum of random variables for each of four sequential, constituent phases of the transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar to a recent analysis for 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we furthermore quantified each of these phases of the transmission cycle as dependent on temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Following Huber et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we defined these phases as: (1) the intrinsic incubation period (IIP); (2) the period between onset of symptoms in humans and subsequent transmission to mosquitoes (human-to-mosquito transmission period, HMTP); (3) the extrinsic incubation period (EIP); and (4) the period between a mosquito becoming infectious and subsequent transmission to humans (mosquito-to-human transmission period, MHTP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Below, we describe the derivation and parameterization of each of these phases of the transmission cycle as four independent random variables based on available data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To obtain a single random variable describing the generation interval as a whole, we took the sum of the four constituent random variables in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g001">Fig 1</xref> by applying the convolution theorem, which involves taking the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transforms of each random variable [
