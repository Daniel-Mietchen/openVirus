<p>This period covers the time between a mosquito becoming infectious (at the end of the EIP) and it biting a susceptible human host and causing an infection. A probability distribution describing the length of this period could potentially depend on several variables, including mosquito biting and mortality schedules. Although there is some evidence for age-dependent mortality in wild 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], incorporating age-dependent effects in a general model of the mosquito-to-human transmission period would depend not only on knowledge of age-dependent mortality but also age-dependent exposure to infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Because of the extensive variability of these relationships across different ecological settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the difficulty of quantifying these effects based on available data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we restricted our analysis to age-independent mortality, which is a common assumption of dengue transmission models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Conditional on a mosquito surviving the EIP, its lifespan thenceforth can be described as an exponential random variable parameterized by a mean, age-independent daily mortality rate. Following Perkins et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we used the temperature- and age-dependent model by Brady et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], to which we added an additional rate of extrinsic mortality (0.089 d
 <sup>-1</sup>) to match an empirical estimate of overall daily mortality of 0.115 carried out in an experiment in which temperatures ranged 20–34°C [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005797.g001">Fig 1</xref>, MHTP). To match our simplifying assumption of age-independent mortality, we parameterized the mortality rate in our model to yield an average lifespan consistent with that of the model by Brady et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for a given temperature. Although our primary results were calculated based on functions of mean temperature, we also explored the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuations using diurnally varying hazards for mosquito mortality and EIP (see
