  <title>Epidemic growth rates as a function of temperature assuming different values of λ ranging 0.1–0.4.</title>
  <p>Solid lines represent values assuming constant temperatures, while dotted lines assume diurnal temperature fluctuations with a range of 8°C. The large drop in the reproduction number around 34°C is an artifact of the absolute maximum temperature thresholds that are exceeded when temperatures reach 37.73°C for consecutive three hours in a day. The epidemic growth rate peaks within the range 31.6–33.9°C.</p>
