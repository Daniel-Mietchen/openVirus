  <title>Reproduction numbers as a function of temperature assuming different values of λ ranging 0.1–0.4.</title>
  <p>Solid lines represent values assuming constant temperatures, while dotted lines assume diurnal temperature fluctuations with a range of 8°C. The large drop in the reproduction number around 34°C is an artifact of the absolute maximum temperature thresholds that are exceeded when temperatures reach 37.73°C for consecutive three hours in a day. The reproduction number peaks at 32.5°C when constant temperature is assumed and at 30.9°C when diurnal fluctuation is assumed.</p>
