  <title>Random variables associated with components of the transmission cycle (top) and their successive sums (bottom).</title>
  <p>On the top, the intrinsic incubation (IIP), human-to-mosquito transmission period (HMTP), extrinsic incubation period (EIP), and mosquito-to-human transmission period (MHTP) are shown from left to right, with the latter two parameterized for a temperature of 30Â°C. On the bottom, random variables for the elapsed time between inoculation of the primary infection and each event in the transmission cycle is shown in successive order from left to right.</p>
