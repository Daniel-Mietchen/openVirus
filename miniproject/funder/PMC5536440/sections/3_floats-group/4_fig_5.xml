  <title>DENV epidemic growth rate, 
   <italic>r</italic>, for high (red) and low (blue) mosquito densities based on our full model and other approximations.
  </title>
  <p>The top panels show comparisons of the full model estimates (solid lines) with those based on temperature independent, exponentially distributed (A) and fixed-length (B) generation intervals (mean = 16 days [
   <xref rid="pntd.0005797.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]) (dashed lines). The bottom panels show comparisons of estimates of the full model (solid lines) with those based on exponentially distributed (C) and fixed-length (D) generation intervals (dashed lines), with their mean values at each temperature set to the corresponding mean from the full model.
