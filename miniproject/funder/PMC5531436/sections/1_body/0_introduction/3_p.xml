<p>During 2014, the Dominican Republic was one of the countries with the most numerous suspected CHIKV cases in the Americas [

Although it remains unclear what accounts for the observed high number of cases, this country is highly urbanized and many people live in densely populated marginal barrios. These environmental conditions together with domestic storage of water and irregular trash collections foster conditions favorable for the proliferation of

Similar environmental conditions likely exist in other parts of the Americas that experienced a high number of CHIKV cases. Additionally, the Dominican Republic is a top destination for tourism, which may have facilitated introduction of CHIKV and subsequent local transmission. Variation in vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period is another possible explanation;
