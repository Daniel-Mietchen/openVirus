<p>Native to Africa, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) emerged to produce intermittent outbreaks from the 1950s in Southeast Asia (Asian CHIKV lineage) and regional outbreaks in India in the 1960s and 1970s [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Chikungunya also emerged in Kenya in 2004 (Eastern/Central/Southern African, ECSA, CHIKV lineage), followed by an outbreak of chikungunya fever on the island of La Réunion in 2005–2006 involving the Indian Ocean CHIKV (IOC) lineage, a descendent of the ECSA CHIKV lineage [
