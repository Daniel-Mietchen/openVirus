<p>In this paper, we examine CHIKV disseminated infection and transmission in Florida mosquitoes for two putative vector species, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. We tested whether local populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> show regional differences in susceptibility to infection and transmission to two emergent lineages of CHIKV, Indian Ocean (IOC) and Asian genotypes (British Virgin Islands, AC). As a baseline comparison, we compare susceptibility to infection and transmission 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors from Florida to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from the Dominican Republic, one of the countries associated with the most numerous cases of CHIKV during the American outbreak in 2014. Although 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is present in the Dominican Republic, it is often found at far lower abundances than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and so we focused on the latter species [
