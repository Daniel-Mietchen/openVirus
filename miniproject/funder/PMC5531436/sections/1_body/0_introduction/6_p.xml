<p>Little is known about the vector competence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes for the Asian lineage of CHIKV responsible for the outbreak in the Americas, including Florida. Chikungunya virus in the Americas belongs to the Asian lineage, suggesting that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> will transmit at a lower rate than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> due to an adaptive constraint [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, other studies have suggested that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were as competent as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> for transmission of an isolate of CHIKV from Saint Martin Island belonging to the Asian lineage [

With the potential for a major CHIKV epidemic in Florida, there is a need to appraise the relative risk and emergence of Chikungunya fever in Florida. An assessment using meteorological driven models to inform baseline risk for local Zika virus transmission in the U.S., and presumably other viruses including CHIKV and dengue viruses, showed that cities in southern Florida and south Texas were highly suitable for

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and imported viral cases [
