<p>Chikungunya virus can cause widespread epidemics with infection rates exceeding 25% in some locations (e.g., La Réunion, Americas) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is estimated that more than 4 million cases have occurred worldwide in the past 12 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Human CHIKV infection causes high fever, rash, headache, joint swelling, and joint pain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, chronic musculoskeletal diseases may last for months to years following infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The widespread, invasive mosquito 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was the vector of CHIKV on La Réunion during 2005–2006 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and likely the primary vector of an outbreak in 2007 in Gabon [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A single mutation in the E1 protein of CHIKV enhanced infection and transmission in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a species that was considered to be secondary in importance to the primary vector 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. There is now evidence showing that there have been multiple independent events of CHIKV exposure to 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations followed by development of this adaptive mutation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This observation suggests the potential for outbreaks involving 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> as the vector in regions where 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is rare or absent. The expansion of CHIKV in the Americas that began in 2013 increases the burden of disease in a region of the world recently invaded by Zika virus and where dengue is endemic. Local transmission in the U.S. is a major public health risk especially in Texas and Florida where both potential mosquito vector species reside, the environmental conditions promote vector abundance throughout much of the year, and there is a high potential for virus introduction [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The first documentation of locally-acquired cases of CHIKV in the continental U.S. states occurred in 2014 involving 11 cases in Florida [
