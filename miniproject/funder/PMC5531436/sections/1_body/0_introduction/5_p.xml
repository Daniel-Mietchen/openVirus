<p>An assessment of the vector competence of 35 populations of American 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> for two strains (i.e., individual isolates) in the ECSA lineage and one strain in the Asian lineage of CHIKV revealed that viral dissemination was high for all mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, transmission rates differed vastly among American populations (11â€“97%) suggesting that salivary gland infection/escape barriers affect vector competence among these two-vector species and their potential to transmit CHIKV. For the Indian Ocean and ancestral ECSA genotypes (both in the ECSA lineage) transmission efficiencies among F1 generation 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> from Vero Beach, FL were lower (&lt;30%) than most other American populations of these species. However, the vector competence of these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes from Vero Beach was not tested for the Asian lineage of CHIKV. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] provided preliminary information that Florida 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> may differ from other American populations of these species in their response to CHIKV attributable to differences in salivary gland infection/escape barriers.
