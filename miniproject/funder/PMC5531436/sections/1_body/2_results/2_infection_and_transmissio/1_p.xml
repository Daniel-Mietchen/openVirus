<p>Preliminary studies using 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from St. Lucie Co. and AC identified baseline infection and disseminated infection rates at constant 25°C and 30°C six days after ingesting CHIKV infected blood. Although not significant (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 2.55, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.11), we observed 3-fold differences in susceptibility to infection between 30°C (10.5%, 67 mosquitoes tested) and 25°C (3.6%, 83 mosquitoes tested). Viral dissemination (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.05, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.83, 8 mosquitoes) and transmission (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.44, df = 1, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.51, 8 mosquitoes) did not differ between the two temperatures. Viral dissemination rates of 100% and 40% were observed at 25°C and 30°C, respectively. Transmission of 33.3% and 0% was observed at 25°C and 30°C, respectively, using only the capillary tube method of collection of saliva.
