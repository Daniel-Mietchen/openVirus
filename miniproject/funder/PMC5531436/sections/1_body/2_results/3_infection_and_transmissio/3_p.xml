Disseminated infections increased from day 2 (55.3%) to day 5 (96.2%), then subsequently decreased again on day 12 (82.8%) following exposure.

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> from Alachua Co., FL had higher disseminated infection than other locations, followed by Indian River/St. Lucie Co. and Manatee Co. (
