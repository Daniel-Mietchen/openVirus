<p>There were significant temporal differences in the leg titer equivalents of individuals following exposure to both emergent CHIKV lineages (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005724.t005">Table 5</xref>). For IOC, viral titer equivalents were significantly higher on days 5 and 12 than day 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). For AC, viral titer equivalents were significantly higher on day 5 than days 2 and 12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). There were no significant treatment effects of species, location, or species by time interaction on leg titer equivalents for either AC or IOC (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005724.t005">Table 5</xref>). Our ability to detect temporal patterns in saliva viral titer equivalents was limited because we used two different analyses for day two versus days five and twelve. There were no significant differences in viral titer in saliva from the species, location, time, or species by time interaction for either AC or IOC (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005724.t005">Table 5</xref>). The one exception was that there was a location effect for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> so that individuals originating from Alachua Co. FL had significantly higher IOC viral load in the saliva than individuals from Indian River/St. Lucie Co. and Manatee Co. FL (
