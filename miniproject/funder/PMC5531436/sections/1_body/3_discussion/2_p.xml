<p>All populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes displayed susceptibility to infection and transmission for the two emergent lineages of CHIKV at high titers. Viral dissemination to the hemocoel for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes was rapid and co-occurred with infection of the saliva, with substantial transmission occurring by day 2 dpi (Tables

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005724.t004">4</xref>). This observation has important implications for CHIKV epidemiology because both 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> exhibit gonotrophic discordance whereby mosquitoes will blood feed more than once in a single gonotrophic cycle [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], allowing for the possibility of transmission during each feeding event. Florida vectors are highly competent, especially given the short extrinsic incubation period of CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] which strongly contributes to vectorial capacity as an exponential function [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Viral disseminated infection indicated rapid propagation in the midgut and spread to other mosquito tissues, with rates being higher for IOC than AC. Viral dissemination within 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> occurred for most individuals following five days of extrinsic incubation, suggesting a lack of substantial midgut escape barriers for IOC and AC [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For IOC, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> had higher disseminated infection than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in most instances, suggesting that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is more permissive to infection by this strain than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Similarly, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> had more efficient transmission of the IOC lineage sooner after ingesting CHIKV infected blood than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Specifically, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> had a 44% greater proportion of transmission than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. However, later in the infection process 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> had similar transmission. These observations are consistent with other studies showing more efficient viral dissemination for IOC into mosquito secondary organs and transmission in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We can infer from our observations that the duration of the extrinsic incubation period of IOC is shorter in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Differences in vector competence between 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> contribute as a linear function, and so relatively weakly, to vectorial capacity whereas changes in the extrinsic incubation period contribute as an exponential function and thus more strongly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A short incubation period in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> probably contributed to its role as the vector in the chikungunya outbreaks in the Indian Ocean in 2005–2007. Other contributing factors to this outbreak include an increased infectivity of
