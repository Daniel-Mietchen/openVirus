<p>Preliminary studies using 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes from St. Lucie Co., FL and AC identified baseline infection and disseminated infection rates at constant 25°C and 30°C. We observed that 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> had a low susceptibility to infection for AC, but a relatively permissive midgut escape barrier after ingesting a low dose of CHIKV infected blood. A midgut infection barrier refers to the inhibition of ingested arboviruses from entering or replicating in midgut cells. A midgut escape barrier refers to the inhibition of arboviruses from spreading beyond the basal lamina of the midgut cells to the hemocoel. The low infection rates were attributed to a relatively low dose of CHIKV in blood meals. Lack of significant differences among dissemination and transmission rates is most likely attributable to low sample sizes. Our main study demonstrated that the midgut infection barriers can be surpassed by high virus titers [
