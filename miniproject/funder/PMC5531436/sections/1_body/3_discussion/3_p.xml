<p>Tsetsarkin et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] tested the hypothesis, using viral infectious clones of CHIKV, that a mutation in the envelope protein gene (E1-A226V of IOC) influenced viral fitness for different vector species. Their study demonstrated that the E1-A226V mutation was directly responsible for increased infectivity and more efficient viral dissemination into mosquito secondary organs and transmission for
