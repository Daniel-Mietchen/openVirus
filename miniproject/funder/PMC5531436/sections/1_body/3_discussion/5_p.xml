<p>Large scale geographic variation in vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> have been observed among lineages of CHIKV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] as well as for other arboviruses (Zika, yellow fever, and dengue-2 viruses) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the current study, we have identified variation in vector competence on a smaller spatial scale than previously recognized. Regional differences in mosquito-virus interactions, especially as they might relate to the EIP, may have important implications for risk of disease transmission. However, the geographic variation wasn’t consistent between CHIKV lineages and mosquito species and the differences were often relatively small. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> from Manatee Co., Florida and Dominican Republic had lower or similar viral dissemination of IOC from one or more other locations in Florida (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Along the same lines, transmission was observed to be lower for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from Manatee Co. and from Indian River/St. Lucie Co. than Monroe Co (

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in Florida did not find strong genetic differentiation among Florida populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from East and West coasts, but there was some evidence of genetic isolation of Florida Keys 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from mainland [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] which may, in part, explain our observation. Similar studies characterizing genetic differentiation among Florida populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> have not yet been published. Studies of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from single nucleotide polymorphisms and sequenced nuclear genes have demonstrated differences in populations from the Caribbean compared to mainland U.S. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which is consistent with large scale difference in quantitative genetics of vector competence [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, although IOC disseminated infection was high and homogenous between collection sites, transmission rate was much lower and varied by origin, suggesting distinct barriers to transmission that may be operating at small geographic scales (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g005">5</xref>). Specifically, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> from Alachua Co. had lower IOC transmission than individuals originating from either Manatee Co. or Indian River/St. Lucie Co., FL, with the latter location resulting in the higher transmission potential. In contrast, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> from Alachua Co. had higher BVIC viral dissemination than individuals from Manatee or Indian River/St. Lucie Counties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g006">Fig 6</xref>). However, this effect did not correspond to similar changes in transmission. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> from the Dominican Republic and the laboratory strain had lower transmission potential than recent colonies from Florida (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest complex interactions between mosquito and CHIKV genotypes. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> originating from the Dominican Republic had viral dissemination and transmission potential rates for IOC and AC that were lower than Florida vectors (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g007">7</xref>). The fact that a large outbreak of CHIKV occurred in the Dominican Republic indicates that these lower rates are still sufficiently high to sustain transmission in nature and suggests that other factors largely contribute to transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], such as biting rates of humans by the vectors. To our knowledge there are no entomological surveys in Florida during the 2014 outbreak that would incriminate potential mosquito species as being infected with CHIKV. However, local infections in 2014 occurred in the ranges of both potential vector species in Florida.
