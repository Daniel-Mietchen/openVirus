<p>Our experiments demonstrated variation in dissemination and transmission among mosquito populations and virus strains, however, in some instances sample sizes were low limiting our ability to detect differences. Logistic constraints limited the number of time points we were able to sample, affecting precision in estimating minimum EIP and viral dynamics in the mosquitoes. With these constraints, however, we were still able to show geographic variation in vector competence. As similar variation may occur in other mosquito species, our results highlight the need for detailed investigations of vector competence across species and populations in different regions. Although geographic differences in the vector competence described in the current study may modulate local risks of infection and transmission, other components of vectorial capacity, such as vector survivorship and human biting rate, are likely to be more important determinants of the potentials for epidemic or endemic transmission [
