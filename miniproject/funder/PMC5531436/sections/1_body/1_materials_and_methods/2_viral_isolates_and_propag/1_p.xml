<p>A strain of CHIKV from the British Virgin Islands (BVI) (Asian lineage, GenBank accession: KJ451624), which is responsible for outbreaks that began in St. Martin in 2013, was obtained in December 2013 from an infected human. The Indian Ocean genotype (IOC) of CHIKV (LR2006-OPY1, GenBank accession: KT449801), responsible for the outbreak in the Indian Ocean region and parts of Europe [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], was isolated from a febrile patient in France who had been infected in La RÃ©union [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The virus isolates were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, TX. These CHIKV strains (passaged twice) were propagated in culture using African green monkey (Vero) cells, in which viral titer was determined by plaque assay [
