<p>Cohorts of mosquitoes were tested for transmission of CHIKV at 2, 5–6, and 12–13 days after feeding on a high dose of infected blood. Each tube containing a mosquito was presented with a honey-soaked filter paper (≈1 cm diameter) fastened to the inside of the lid. The honey was dyed with blue food coloring (McCormick) which provided a visual marker indicating that a mosquito fed on the honey and presumably deposited saliva during feeding. A similar system using FTA
 <sup>®</sup> cards (Flinders Technology Associates filter paper) instead of filter paper has been used successfully as a surveillance system to detect arboviruses that exploits the fact that female mosquitoes expectorate virus in their saliva during feeding on sugar sources [

An initial assessment using FTA cards to test for ability to transmit CHIKV suggested a toxic effect on mosquitoes (early death) and so we switched to using filter paper as the substrate to collect mosquito saliva. Here we use this methodology as a proxy for potential to transmit CHIKV. Mosquitoes were examined with a flashlight for blue coloring in their crop after 24 and 48-hours during the transmission assay. Mosquitoes and filter paper were collected upon first detection of blue in the crop and frozen at -80°C and later analyzed for expectorated virus using quantitative (q) RT-PCR [

Mosquitoes that did not feed on blue honey were not tested for CHIKV transmission. Cohorts of mosquitoes were tested for transmission of CHIKV at 2, 5–6, and 12–13 days after feeding on infected blood. Additionally, saliva was collected from these same mosquitoes in capillary tubes with immersion oil as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] after they had fed on blue honey for the second and third time points only. Additional studies (Alto et al., in preparation) indicate that the blue honey method is equivalent or slightly underestimates virus in saliva compared to capillary tube methods. All mosquitoes were immediately killed and stored at -80°C upon completion of each transmission assay. Mosquitoes were individually dissected and the bodies and legs were tested separately for the presence of CHIKV RNA by qRT-PCR using methods of [

Primers were designed to target a nonstructural polyprotein gene common to both lineages (accession ID of transcript, KU365292.1) with the following sequences: forward, 5'-GTACGGAAGGTAAACTGGTATGG-3': reverse, 5'-TCCACCTCCCACTCCTTAAT-3'. The probe sequence was: 5'-/56-FAM/TGCAGAACCCACCGAAAGGAAACT/3BHQ_1/-3' (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). Disseminated infection was calculated as the percent of infected legs from the total number engorged with blood. Transmission was calculated as the percent of saliva infected mosquitoes from the total number of mosquitoes with infected legs.
