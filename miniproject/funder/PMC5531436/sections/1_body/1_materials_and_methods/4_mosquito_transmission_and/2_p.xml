<p>The legs and filter paper were homogenized separately in 1.0 mL of 199 media. The saliva from mosquitoes collected in capillary tubes was combined with 300 μL of media. A 140 μL sample of mosquito legs, filter paper, and saliva homogenate was used for RNA isolation using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in 50 μL of buffer per the manufacturer’s protocol. CHIKV RNA was detected using the Superscript III One-Step qRT-PCR with Platinum Taq kit by Invitrogen (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously [

Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using primers and probes specific to the Asian and Indian Ocean lineages of CHIKV. The program for qRT-PCR was as follows; 50°C for 30 minutes, 94°C for 2 minutes, 39 cycles at 94°C for 10 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute, and lastly 50°C for 30 seconds. A standard curve method was used to express the titer of CHIKV of mosquito samples by comparing cDNA synthesis for a range of serial dilutions of CHIKV in parallel with plaque assays of the same dilutions of virus, expressed as plaque forming unit equivalents (pfue)/ml [
