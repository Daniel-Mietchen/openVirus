<p>Ten to thirteen-day old adult females were provided with CHIKV infected defibrinated bovine blood (Hemostat, Dixon, CA) using an artificial membrane feeding system (Hemotek, Lancashire, United Kingdom) as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Aliquots of blood were stored at -80°C for later determination of virus titer. Briefly, to prepare fresh virus for mosquito infection, monolayers of Vero cells in T-175 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks were inoculated with 500 μl of diluted stock CHIKV (multiplicity of infection, 0.1) and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere, after which 24 mL media (M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin and mycostatin) were added to each flask and incubated for an additional 47-hours. Mosquitoes were fed either a low dose (5.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> pfu/ml) or high dose of CHIKV infected blood (8 log
 <sub>10</sub> pfu/ml). After the feeding trials, fully engorged females were held in cylindrical cages and maintained at a 14:10 hour light:dark photoperiod and 30°C. To assess ability to transmit CHIKV mosquitoes were transferred to 37-mL plastic tubes (height x diameter: 8 by 3 cm) along with an oviposition substrate. Each tube held one mosquito and was fitted with a removable screen lid. Mosquitoes were deprived of sucrose for one day before the transmission trial started. Only 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from St. Lucie Co. were fed the low dose of the BVIC strain of CHIKV and held at 25°C or 30°C and tested for infection and salivary infection six days after ingesting CHIKV infected blood.
