<p>We chose collection sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005724.g001">Fig 1</xref>) based on distributions of these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species across the state of Florida and areas where local arbovirus transmission (chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses) has been detected in areas where these vector species are present. Larval 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> were collected in 2014 from cemeteries or tire/salvage yards across Florida where these species are present alone or coexist [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Collection sites for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> included Manatee (Bradenton), Monroe (Key West), and Indian River/St. Lucie (Vero Beach or White City) Counties. We initially made collections from separate sites in Indian River Co. and St. Lucie Co. but later decided to combine these to augment sample size given their proximity to one another (23 km between sites). Collection sites for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> included Alachua (Gainesville), Manatee (Bradenton), and Indian River/St. Lucie (Vero Beach or White City) Counties. So, we included collections from distinct regions of Florida (East, West, North, and South) for our assessment of regional differences in susceptibility to infection and transmission of two emergent lineages of chikungunya virus among 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. We also included a laboratory colony of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> originally collected in Orlando, FL (Orange Co.) and maintained in colony since 1952. Although no strong geographic genetic differentiation among Florida populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> has been reported, there is some evidence of genetic isolation of Florida Keys 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> from mainland Florida [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005724.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We were provided with eggs of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> collected in 2014 from La Romana, Dominican Republic by the University of Texas Medical Branch which were propagated at the Florida Medial Entomology Laboratory for the CHIKV infection study. The inclusion of the Dominican Republic strain of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> enabled us to compare Florida 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors to a separate vector population involved in outbreaks with the most numerous cases of CHIKV in the Americas in 2014 [
