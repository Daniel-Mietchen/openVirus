<p>Field-collected mosquitoes were reared to adulthood on a diet of equal parts of brewer’s yeast and liver powder larval food at 26–28°C. Pupae were collected daily and placed in vials with a cotton seal and upon emergence identified to species. Adults were provided with 10% sucrose solution and allowed to feed through hog casing membranes on commercially purchased defibrinated bovine blood (Hemostat Laboratories, Dixon, CA) once per week to propagate eggs. Larvae were reared at an approximate density of 150 larvae/L water in plastic photo trays (25cm width, 30cm length, 5cm height; Richard MFG Co. Fernandina Beach, FL, U.S.A) with 900 mL of water and 0.4 g larval food at hatching and supplemented again with the same amount 3–4 days later. Larvae developed to the pupal stage between 5–7 days after egg hatch. Adult males and females were held together for nine days in a cage (0.3
 <sup>3</sup> m) in a climate controlled room (26–28°C, photoperiod of 14:10 light:dark) and provided with 10% sucrose solution. Females were placed in cylindrical cages (height x diameter: 10 cm by 10 cm, 50 females/cage) with mesh screening one day before exposure to CHIKV infected blood and deprived of sucrose but not water.
