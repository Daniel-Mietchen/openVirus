<p>This study reports on retrospective testing of samples that were prospectively collected in 2 cohorts of HIV-uninfected pregnant women enrolled from March to August 2011 (n = 1056) and March to July 2012 (n = 1060), as well as 194 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled from March to June in 2011. The motherâ€“infant dyads were enrolled into double-blind randomized controlled trials (1:1 randomization to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV] or saline placebo) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IIV during pregnancy against influenza illness in the women and their infants as described previously [
