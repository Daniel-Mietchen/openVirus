<p>Due to the established seasonality of influenza virus in the study area, the IIV efficacy trial aimed to enroll pregnant women prior to the expected onset of the influenza season, based on past epidemiological data available from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This resulted in pregnant women mainly being enrolled during the anticipated RSV season, which generally precedes the onset of the influenza season in Johannesburg (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Consequently, the majority of births occurred after the peak of the RSV season and were concentrated during the influenza season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the purposes of the current analysis, the RSV season was defined as having started the first day of the first of 4 consecutive weeks of that year in which at least 10% of tested samples at NICD were positive for RSV, and having ended at the end of the last week when, after that, &lt;10% of the samples were positive for RSV for 2 consecutive weeks. These data were also used to calculate the person-time (per 1000 person-months) of RSV exposure.
