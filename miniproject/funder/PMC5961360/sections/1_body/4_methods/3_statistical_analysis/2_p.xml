<p>Categorical variables were described as proportions and compared by χ
 <sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test, and continuous variables were represented as means and compared by Student 
 <italic>t</italic> test. Incidence was calculated as density incidence using person-time as denominator; 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incidence estimates were calculated using a Poisson distribution. Follow-up was censored at last contact (if infant was &lt;175 days old), death (if occurred before infant was &lt;175 days old), when infant was 175 days old, or at the first RSV PCR–positive episode, whichever came first. 
 <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using Stata version 13.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
