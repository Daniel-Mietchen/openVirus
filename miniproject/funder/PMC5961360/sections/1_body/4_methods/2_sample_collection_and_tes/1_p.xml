<p>Details on the methods used for surveillance and sample collection have been published previously [

In brief, women from the time of enrollment, and infants from time of birth, were followed up weekly by either in-person visits or telephone calls to elicit the presence of respiratory symptoms. Those fulfilling predefined criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) were requested to attend the clinic for respiratory sampling (

Furthermore, all participants seeking medical care for any unsolicited respiratory illness, irrespective of duration of symptoms or presence of fever, were also sampled. Respiratory samples were also collected from participants hospitalized for any acute cardiopulmonary illness. Sampling of respiratory secretions included nasopharyngeal aspirates in infants obtained by douching the nasopharynx with 2 mL of 0.9% sterile saline that was then suctioned and collected in a sterile container with universal transport medium (UTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy), and oropharyngeal plus flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in the women that were placed in UTM. Samples were transported to the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit laboratory at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Academic Hospital, University of the Witwatersrand where testing was undertaken for influenza virus as described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The residual sample was stored and subsequently tested for RSV. Two-step real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the archived specimens using TaqMan technology and the primers and probes specific for RSV-A and RSV-B (LTC.Tech South Africa [Pty], Ltd) that have been previously published [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Amplification data was analyzed with Applied Biosystems 7500 software (Foster City, California) with manually defined thresholds. Negative samples were defined as those with cycle threshold (Ct) values &gt;37. If participants had recurrent illness visits, only visits occurring at least 15 days apart were included in the analysis.
