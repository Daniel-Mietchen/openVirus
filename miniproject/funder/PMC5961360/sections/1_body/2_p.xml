<p>The ethical acceptability of vaccination of pregnant women primarily aimed at protecting their infants can be mitigated should there be a direct benefit to the women themselves. Consequently, establishing the burden of RSV illness during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women, and investigating whether RSV infection in pregnant women affects pregnancy outcomes, could strengthen the case for vaccination of pregnant women. Recent studies reported an overall incidence of RSV in pregnant women of 3.9 per 1000 person-years in Nepal, and 0.03 per 1000 person-days in Mongolia, with only limited numbers of RSV-infected women having been identified (14/3693 [0.4%] in Nepal and 4/1260 [0.3%] in Mongolia) [
