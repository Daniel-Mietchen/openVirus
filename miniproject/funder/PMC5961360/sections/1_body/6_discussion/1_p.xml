<p>In our study, RSV infection was 2- to 4-fold more common during the latter half of pregnancy and up until 24 weeks postpartum than previously reported from a similar Nepalese birth cohort [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The incidence (per 1000 person-months) of RSV infection in our study among HIV-uninfected women fluctuated year to year, being greater for the 2012 cohort (4.3) than the 2011 cohort (1.9); including during pregnancy (5.3 vs 1.7). Furthermore, although not significant possibly due to the limited sample size, HIV-infected women had a higher incidence of RSV illness (4.3 vs 1.9), including during pregnancy (6.6 vs 1.7).
