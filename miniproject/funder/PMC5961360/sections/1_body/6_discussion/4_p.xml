 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the need to further investigate the severity of RSV infection among pregnant women. In our study, 2 (4.7%) of the RSV infections among HIV-uninfected women were associated with pneumonia, from which both women recovered uneventfully. Also, although there was a higher incidence of RSV illness among HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected women in our study, the recovery among the 5 HIV-infected women was uneventful.
