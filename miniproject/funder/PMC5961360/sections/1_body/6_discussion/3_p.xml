<p>Although the women with RSV infection in our study did not present with fever, the RSV illness was nevertheless sufficiently severe for them to seek medical attention. Furthermore, these RSV infections were commonly associated with other systemic symptoms including headache and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. The low prevalence of fever in RSV illness was documented since the mid-1970s by Hall et al, being present in only 5%â€“27% of household cases with RSV infection [

Further reasons for the difference in incidence observed between these studies could be due to geographic and temporal differences in the intensity and virulence of the circulating viruses between the countries. Even within our study, we observed significant year-to-year variability in incidence of RSV illness, which could have been due to more intense circulation of RSV during 2012 than 2011. Nevertheless, as our surveillance was focused on sampling for ILI episodes, although sampling of unsolicited illness visits was undertaken, these unsolicited medically attended visits of the mother and her infant was done at the discretion of the mother. Consequently, milder episodes of RSV illness for which the mother chose not to seek medical attention could have been missed and consequently underestimated the incidence of RSV in our study.
