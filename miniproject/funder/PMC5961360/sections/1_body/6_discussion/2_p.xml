<p>The most likely reason for the higher incidence of RSV infection observed in our study compared with the study from Nepal during RSV season (0.98 per 1000 person-months), possibly relates to differences in the threshold used for investigating for respiratory illness. Testing in Nepal was limited to women with respiratory illness who reported or measured fever (&gt;38Â°C) and at least 1 other ILI symptom of cough, myalgia, sore throat, or rhinorrhea [

In contrast, in addition to investigating such cases, we also investigated for other unsolicited medically attended respiratory illnesses, irrespective of whether they fulfilled the ILI criteria. The majority of RSV cases identified in our study did not fulfil the ILI criteria, and in fact none of the women volunteered a history of fever or were pyrexial at the time of investigation for that illness. Consequently, the Nepal study, as postulated by the authors, likely underestimated the incidence of RSV infection among the pregnant and postpartum women. In the other published study on RSV during pregnancy from Mongolia, similar to the Nepalese study, only women with fever and a diagnosis of ILI were tested for RSV. This study only documented 4 cases of RSV infection among 1260 (0.3%) pregnant women, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 per 1000 person-days during the sampling period. The detection of RSV in this study was likely compromised by the use of a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test, which has reduced sensitivity compared to PCR used in our study [
