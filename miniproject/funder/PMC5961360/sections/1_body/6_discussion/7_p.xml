<p>Furthermore, as was evident from our study and the study from Nepal, maternal postpartum RSV infection was commonly associated with concurrent RSV infection in their infants: 2 of 7 postpartum maternal episodes in Nepal and 14 of 27 (51.9%) in South Africa. Whereas it is uncertain whether the mothers infected their infants or vice versa or, alternatively, both might have been infected by another common source, prevention of such respiratory illness among the women through vaccination could provide further protection to their young infants against RSV infection by interrupting maternal–infant transmission. Furthermore, as asymptomatic RSV infections and milder illness that the mother chose not to seek medical care for would not have been investigated in our study, we likely underestimated the overall prevalence of RSV coinfections in mother–infant dyads.</p>
