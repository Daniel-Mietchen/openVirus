<p>Notably, among all the HIV-uninfected women, only 2 of 348 (0.6%) samples obtained during visits which fulfilled the ILI criteria tested positive for RSV, compared to 41 of 2802 (1.5%) medically attended non-ILI illness visits (

The common symptoms associated with RSV infection included cough (72.1%), headache (41.9%), rhinorrhea (39.5%), and sore throat (37.2%). There was no difference in the prevalence of these symptoms between illnesses associated with RSV infection compared with those associated with influenza infection, or illness in which neither of the 2 viruses was identified. The only symptom that differed between RSV and influenza-associated illness was a higher prevalence of myalgia in influenza infection episodes (19.3%) compared with RSV (4.7%) (

Two (4.7%) of the RSV infections among the women were associated with pneumonia, similar to the number among women with influenza infection (3/57 [5.5%]). None of the RSV illnesses among the women required hospitalization. The mean Ct value of the 2 HIV-uninfected women with RSV-associated pneumonia was 35 (33 and 37), and 32 in those who did not develop pneumonia (
