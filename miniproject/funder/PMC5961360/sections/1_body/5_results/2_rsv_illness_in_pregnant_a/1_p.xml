<p>The overall attack rate of RSV-associated illness did not differ between IIV and placebo recipients among the HIV-uninfected women in 2011 (1.5% [8/532] vs 0.4% [2/528], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .11) and 2012 (2.8% [15/530] vs 3.4% [18/526], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .58), and similarly so in the HIV-infected women (4.0% [4/100] vs 1.1% [1/94], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .37). Hence, the IIV and placebo groups were combined in further analyses.
