<p>There were 5 RSV illnesses among the 2011 cohort of HIV-infected women (2.6% of 194), including 3 RSV-A and 2 RSV-B subtypes. Four of these cases were identified during the defined RSV-epidemic period. In the 2011 HIV-uninfected cohort, 10 of the 1060 women had an RSV illness (0.9%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .07 compared with HIV-infected women), including 7 RSV-A and 3 RSV-B subtypes; 9 of these visits occurred during the RSV season. The incidence (per 1000 person-months) of RSV illness during the 2011 RSV season was 4.3 in HIV-infected and 1.9 in HIV-uninfected women and 6.6 and 1.7, respectively, during pregnancy (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 4.0 [95% CI, .9â€“17.8]). The incidence of RSV illness during the postpartum period was identical in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women (2.3 per 1000 person-months;
