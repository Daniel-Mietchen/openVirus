<p>There was no difference in the rates of RSV-associated illness in infants born to IIV and placebo recipients in either the HIV-unexposed cohorts in 2011 (5.9% [30/513] vs 4.9% [25/515], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .48) or 2012 (6.6% [34/513] vs 4.9% [25/508], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .24), nor the 2011 HIV-exposed cohort (9.0% [9/100] vs 8.0% [7/88], respectively; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .37). Hence, the IIV and placebo groups were combined in further analyses.
