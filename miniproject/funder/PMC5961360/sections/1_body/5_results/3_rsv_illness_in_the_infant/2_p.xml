<p>The peak number of illness visits among the infants occurred primarily after the RSV seasons and during the influenza seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Two HIV-unexposed and 2 HIV-exposed infants had 2 RSV-associated illness spaced 26, 29, 21, and 32 days apart, respectively. As these episodes involved the same RSV subtype in the infants and the PCR Ct was consistently higher for the second detection, we considered these to be single RSV episodes. Overall, RSV was identified from 16 (8.5%) HIV-exposed infants and 114 (5.4%) HIV-unexposed infants.
