<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of under-5 morbidity and mortality, causing an estimated 48000â€“74500 under-5 childhood deaths in 2015, 50% occurring during the first 6 months of life [

 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, passive immunization of premature infants with a monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) protects infants against RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) [
