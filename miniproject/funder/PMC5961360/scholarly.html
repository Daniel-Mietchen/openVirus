Results</div> <p>The incidence (per 1000 person-months) of RSV illness (n = 43 overall) among HIV-uninfected women was lower in 2011 (1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], .6–2.2) than in 2012 (4.0; 95% CI, 2.8–5.6). The incidence of RSV illness (n = 5) in HIV-infected women was 3.4 (95% CI, 1.4–8.1). Maternal RSV infection was associated with respiratory symptoms including cough (72.1%), rhinorrhea (39.5%), sore throat (37.2%), and headache (42%), but fever was absent. RSV infection during pregnancy was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Postpartum, RSV infection in mothers (n = 27) was associated with concurrent infection among 51.9% of their infants and, conversely, 29.8% of mothers investigated within 7 days of their infants having an RSV illness also tested positive for RSV.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

An inverse association has been reported between maternal RSV neutralizing antibodies and risk for RSV hospitalization among young infants [<a href="#CIT0002">2</a>, <a href="#CIT0003">3</a>]. Furthermore, passive immunization of premature infants with a monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) protects infants against RSV lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) [<a href="#CIT0004">4</a>]. This has served as a rationale for development of RSV vaccine candidates targeted at pregnant women to enhance transplacental antibody transfer to their infants [<a href="#CIT0005">5</a>], including one currently in phase 3 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02624947). Influenza vaccination during pregnancy has been shown to prevent influenza illness among pregnant women and protect their young infants [<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>, <a href="#CIT0007">7</a>]. Similarly, maternal pertussis vaccination prevents pertussis in the infants of vaccinated women [<a href="#CIT0008">8</a>].</p> <p>The ethical acceptability of vaccination of pregnant women primarily aimed at protecting their infants can be mitigated should there be a direct benefit to the women themselves. Consequently, establishing the burden of RSV illness during pregnancy and the postpartum period in women, and investigating whether RSV infection in pregnant women affects pregnancy outcomes, could strengthen the case for vaccination of pregnant women. Recent studies reported an overall incidence of RSV in pregnant women of 3.9 per 1000 person-years in Nepal, and 0.03 per 1000 person-days in Mongolia, with only limited numbers of RSV-infected women having been identified (14/3693 [0.4%] in Nepal and 4/1260 [0.3%] in Mongolia) [<a href="#CIT0009">9</a>, <a href="#CIT0010">10</a>]. Furthermore, there was a recent report on 3 pregnant women with RSV in the United States, 2 requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href="#CIT0011">11</a>]. The incidence of severe disease associated with RSV infection, however, remains undefined.</p> <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of confirmed RSV illness from midpregnancy to 24 weeks postpartum among cohorts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–uninfected and HIV-infected black-African women to determine their potential benefit from maternal RSV vaccination aimed primarily at protecting their probands.</p> <div class="methods" title="methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
METHODS</div> <p>This study reports on retrospective testing of samples that were prospectively collected in 2 cohorts of HIV-uninfected pregnant women enrolled from March to August 2011 (n = 1056) and March to July 2012 (n = 1060), as well as 194 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled from March to June in 2011. The mother–infant dyads were enrolled into double-blind randomized controlled trials (1:1 randomization to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine [IIV] or saline placebo) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of IIV during pregnancy against influenza illness in the women and their infants as described previously [<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>]. The women were enrolled from midpregnancy and followed up until 24 weeks postpartum. Furthermore, live births were followed up until 24 weeks of age.</p> <div class="samplecollectionandtesting" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Sample Collection and Testing</div> <p>Details on the methods used for surveillance and sample collection have been published previously [<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>]. In brief, women from the time of enrollment, and infants from time of birth, were followed up weekly by either in-person visits or telephone calls to elicit the presence of respiratory symptoms. Those fulfilling predefined criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI) were requested to attend the clinic for respiratory sampling (<a href="#sup1">Supplementary Materials</a>). Furthermore, all participants seeking medical care for any unsolicited respiratory illness, irrespective of duration of symptoms or presence of fever, were also sampled. Respiratory samples were also collected from participants hospitalized for any acute cardiopulmonary illness. Sampling of respiratory secretions included nasopharyngeal aspirates in infants obtained by douching the nasopharynx with 2 mL of 0.9% sterile saline that was then suctioned and collected in a sterile container with universal transport medium (UTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy), and oropharyngeal plus flocked nasopharyngeal swabs in the women that were placed in UTM. Samples were transported to the Respiratory and Meningeal Pathogens Research Unit laboratory at Chris Hani-Baragwanath Academic Hospital, University of the Witwatersrand where testing was undertaken for influenza virus as described previously [<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>]. The residual sample was stored and subsequently tested for RSV. Two-step real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on the archived specimens using TaqMan technology and the primers and probes specific for RSV-A and RSV-B (LTC.Tech South Africa [Pty], Ltd) that have been previously published [<a href="#CIT0012">12</a>]. Amplification data was analyzed with Applied Biosystems 7500 software (Foster City, California) with manually defined thresholds. Negative samples were defined as those with cycle threshold (Ct) values &amp;gt;37. If participants had recurrent illness visits, only visits occurring at least 15 days apart were included in the analysis.</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Statistical Analysis</div> <p>Due to the established seasonality of influenza virus in the study area, the IIV efficacy trial aimed to enroll pregnant women prior to the expected onset of the influenza season, based on past epidemiological data available from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) [<a href="#CIT0013">13</a>]. This resulted in pregnant women mainly being enrolled during the anticipated RSV season, which generally precedes the onset of the influenza season in Johannesburg (<a href="#F1">Figure 1A</a> and <a href="#F1">1B</a>). Consequently, the majority of births occurred after the peak of the RSV season and were concentrated during the influenza season (<a href="#F1">Figure 1C</a>). For the purposes of the current analysis, the RSV season was defined as having started the first day of the first of 4 consecutive weeks of that year in which at least 10% of tested samples at NICD were positive for RSV, and having ended at the end of the last week when, after that, &amp;lt;10% of the samples were positive for RSV for 2 consecutive weeks. These data were also used to calculate the person-time (per 1000 person-months) of RSV exposure.</p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1.</span></a></div>   <p>Number of participants in the study by week and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza seasonality.

Incidence was calculated as density incidence using person-time as denominator; 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incidence estimates were calculated using a Poisson distribution. Follow-up was censored at last contact (if infant was &amp;lt;175 days old), death (if occurred before infant was &amp;lt;175 days old), when infant was 175 days old, or at the first RSV PCR–positive episode, whichever came first. <i>P</i> values &amp;lt;.05 were considered significant.

There was no difference in the prevalence of these symptoms between illnesses associated with RSV infection compared with those associated with influenza infection, or illness in which neither of the 2 viruses was identified. The only symptom that differed between RSV and influenza-associated illness was a higher prevalence of myalgia in influenza infection episodes (19.3%) compared with RSV (4.7%) (<i>P</i> = .037; <a href="#T3">Table 3</a>). Two (4.7%) of the RSV infections among the women were associated with pneumonia, similar to the number among women with influenza infection (3/57 [5.5%]).

RSV Illness in the Infants</div> <p>There was no difference in the rates of RSV-associated illness in infants born to IIV and placebo recipients in either the HIV-unexposed cohorts in 2011 (5.9% [30/513] vs 4.9% [25/515], respectively; <i>P</i> = .48) or 2012 (6.6% [34/513] vs 4.9% [25/508], respectively; <i>P</i> = .24), nor the 2011 HIV-exposed cohort (9.0% [9/100] vs 8.0% [7/88], respectively; <i>P</i> = .37).

DISCUSSION</div> <p>In our study, RSV infection was 2- to 4-fold more common during the latter half of pregnancy and up until 24 weeks postpartum than previously reported from a similar Nepalese birth cohort [<a href="#CIT0009">9</a>]. The incidence (per 1000 person-months) of RSV infection in our study among HIV-uninfected women fluctuated year to year, being greater for the 2012 cohort (4.3) than the 2011 cohort (1.9); including during pregnancy (5.3 vs 1.7). Furthermore, although not significant possibly due to the limited sample size, HIV-infected women had a higher incidence of RSV illness (4.3 vs 1.9), including during pregnancy (6.6 vs 1.7).</p> <p>The most likely reason for the higher incidence of RSV infection observed in our study compared with the study from Nepal during RSV season (0.98 per 1000 person-months), possibly relates to differences in the threshold used for investigating for respiratory illness. Testing in Nepal was limited to women with respiratory illness who reported or measured fever (&amp;gt;38°C) and at least 1 other ILI symptom of cough, myalgia, sore throat, or rhinorrhea [<a href="#CIT0009">9</a>]. In contrast, in addition to investigating such cases, we also investigated for other unsolicited medically attended respiratory illnesses, irrespective of whether they fulfilled the ILI criteria. The majority of RSV cases identified in our study did not fulfil the ILI criteria, and in fact none of the women volunteered a history of fever or were pyrexial at the time of investigation for that illness. Consequently, the Nepal study, as postulated by the authors, likely underestimated the incidence of RSV infection among the pregnant and postpartum women. In the other published study on RSV during pregnancy from Mongolia, similar to the Nepalese study, only women with fever and a diagnosis of ILI were tested for RSV. This study only documented 4 cases of RSV infection among 1260 (0.3%) pregnant women, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 per 1000 person-days during the sampling period. The detection of RSV in this study was likely compromised by the use of a rapid point-of-care diagnostic test, which has reduced sensitivity compared to PCR used in our study [<a href="#CIT0010">10</a>].</p> <p>Although the women with RSV infection in our study did not present with fever, the RSV illness was nevertheless sufficiently severe for them to seek medical attention. Furthermore, these RSV infections were commonly associated with other systemic symptoms including headache and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. The low prevalence of fever in RSV illness was documented since the mid-1970s by Hall et al, being present in only 5%–27% of household cases with RSV infection [<a href="#CIT0014">14</a>]. Further reasons for the difference in incidence observed between these studies could be due to geographic and temporal differences in the intensity and virulence of the circulating viruses between the countries. Even within our study, we observed significant year-to-year variability in incidence of RSV illness, which could have been due to more intense circulation of RSV during 2012 than 2011. Nevertheless, as our surveillance was focused on sampling for ILI episodes, although sampling of unsolicited illness visits was undertaken, these unsolicited medically attended visits of the mother and her infant was done at the discretion of the mother. Consequently, milder episodes of RSV illness for which the mother chose not to seek medical attention could have been missed and consequently underestimated the incidence of RSV in our study.</p> <p>A case-series of RSV infection in 2 pregnant women from the United States reported on them requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href="#CIT0011">11</a>], and the need to further investigate the severity of RSV infection among pregnant women. In our study, 2 (4.7%) of the RSV infections among HIV-uninfected women were associated with pneumonia, from which both women recovered uneventfully. Also, although there was a higher incidence of RSV illness among HIV-infected than HIV-uninfected women in our study, the recovery among the 5 HIV-infected women was uneventful.</p> <p>Furthermore, RSV infection during pregnancy in our study was not associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including no difference in preterm birth, low birthweight, and stillbirths compared with either pregnant women who had influenza infection or those who did not develop either RSV or influenza infection during pregnancy.</p> <p>Recent studies in animal models indicated that RSV respiratory tract infection of pregnant rats was associated with virus transmission across the placenta to the fetus (30%), which was associated with aberrant parasympathetic innervation and airway hyperreactivity after postnatal RSV reinfection [<a href="#CIT0015">15</a>, <a href="#CIT0016">16</a>]. The clinical relevance of this murine model experiment warrants further investigation into the context of maternal RSV vaccine studies.</p> <p>Furthermore, as was evident from our study and the study from Nepal, maternal postpartum RSV infection was commonly associated with concurrent RSV infection in their infants: 2 of 7 postpartum maternal episodes in Nepal and 14 of 27 (51.9%) in South Africa. Whereas it is uncertain whether the mothers infected their infants or vice versa or, alternatively, both might have been infected by another common source, prevention of such respiratory illness among the women through vaccination could provide further protection to their young infants against RSV infection by interrupting maternal–infant transmission. Furthermore, as asymptomatic RSV infections and milder illness that the mother chose not to seek medical care for would not have been investigated in our study, we likely underestimated the overall prevalence of RSV coinfections in mother–infant dyads.</p> </div> <div class="supplementary-material" title="supplementary-material"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
