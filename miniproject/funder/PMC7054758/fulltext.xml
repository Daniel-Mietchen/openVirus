In this study, we found that EV71 infection promoted SOCS expression at both mRNA and protein levels in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, the infectivity of EV71 was decreased significantly in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells, suggesting that SOCS1 and especially SOCS3 are crucial for EV71 infection.

Introduction</title><p>Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a member of the Picornavirus family, is notable for its role in epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children, which is a global infectious disease that affects millions of people [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Currently, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying EV71 are unclear, and there are no effective treatments for diseases caused by EV71 [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Virus infection can induce a large number of antiviral factors and host immune responses [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The type I interferon (IFN) (including IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) system is a first line of the defense against viral infections [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Type I IFN can induce the production of various antiviral factors through the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When IFN binds to IFN receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on the cell surface, JAK, which is linked to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, is recruited and activated by phosphorylation. Meanwhile, IFNAR1 is also phosphorylated. STATs form heterodimers after binding to phosphorylated IFNAR1. The activated STATs can enter the nucleus to regulate the transcription of antiviral factors [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The suppressor of the cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein family is a classical negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling of the JAK/STAT pathway and consists of eight structurally similar proteins (SOCS1&#x02013;7 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are the most extensively characterized members [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several recent studies have revealed that some viruses could regulate expression of the host proteins by overstimulating SOCS1 and/or SOCS3, thereby inhibiting the immune signaling pathway and facilitating viral evasion of immune surveillance [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, HIV infection interferes with the expression SOCS1 and SOCS3, leading to immune activation. Sustained immune activation disrupts the lymphoid system and favors HIV replication [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, hepatitis B virus increases SOCS3 expression, thereby promoting the inflammation in the liver [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SOCS1 also aggravates enterovirus-induced cardiac injury [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Influenza A virus inhibits type I IFN signaling via NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B-dependent induction of SOCS3 expression [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the relationship of EV71 infection with JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling is less studied. Until now, whether EV71 evades the host immune system by regulating the expression of SOCS proteins remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of SOCS proteins on EV71 infection and the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T, CRL11268, ATCC) and human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells (CCL-136, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries) and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C in a humidified cell incubator with 5% of CO<sub>2</sub>. HEK293T or RD cells were infected with the EV71 virus (CC063) for the different time points.</p><p>RD cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates. At 40 to 60% confluence, cells were stimulated with 20&#x02009;ng/ml IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> for 0&#x02009;h, 3&#x02009;h, 6&#x02009;h, and 9&#x02009;h, respectively. On the other hand, RD cells were stimulated with 20&#x02009;ng/ml IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> for 6&#x02009;h, followed by EV71 infection for 24&#x02009;h. RD cells were also treated with/without the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B inhibitor (E)-3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile (BAY11-7082) for 1&#x02009;h, followed by EV71 infection, and cells were harvested at 0&#x02009;h, 3&#x02009;h, and 9&#x02009;h after EV71 infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Mouse Model of EV71 Infection</title><p>The Jilin University Office of Laboratory Animal Management approved our animal care and experimentation procedures, and we carried out the experiments in accordance with accepted guidelines. One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) ICR neonatal mice (<italic>n</italic> = 36) which were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center (College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China) were used to establish the animal model of viral infection. The neonatal mice were randomly divided into different experimental groups (<italic>n</italic> = 6 each) and inoculated intracerebrally with the EV71 virus CC063 strain (10<sup>3</sup> CCID50 ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or MEM medium (10&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l/mouse), according to previous description [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

The polyclonal antibody against EV71 was obtained from rabbits immunized with EV71 whole viruses in our laboratory. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (GE) and anti-mouse (Santa Cruz). The membranes were developed with an ECL substrate (Proteintech).

Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>3.1. EV71 Virus Infection Induces SOCS1 and SOCO3 Expression</title><p>To examine whether the expressions of SOCS proteins are affected by EV71 infection, RD cells were infected with the EV71 virus and the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were tested by RT-PCR. The results showed that SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA levels increased in the early stages of EV71 infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). In particular, the level of SOCS3 mRNA significantly increased at 12&#x02009;h, 24&#x02009;h, and 36&#x02009;h after infection compared to the negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). SOCS1 mRNA levels increased at 36&#x02009;h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In addition, the protein levels of SOCS3 and SOCS1 were analyzed by western blot. The results showed that the expression of SOCS3 significantly increased at 12&#x02009;h, 24&#x02009;h, and 36&#x02009;h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), and SOCS1 protein levels increased at 36&#x02009;h after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), which was consistent with SOCS mRNA results. In order to further determine whether EV71 infection regulates the expression of SOCS proteins, we infected one-day old mice with the EV71 virus and detected the expression of the SOCS protein in the hind-limb muscle of mice. The results showed that expressions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased significantly in the hind-limb muscle of the EV71-infected mice (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(e)</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins increased during the course of the EV71 infection both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. SOCS Proteins Promote EV71 Virus Infection</title><p>We then investigated the roles of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in EV71 infection. We knocked down SOCS1 and SOCS3 via shRNA in RD cells prior to viral infection. When SOCS3 and SOCS1 were knocked down in RD cells, RT-PCR and western blot results showed significant decreases in mRNA and protein levels of SOCS3 and SOCS1, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). Furthermore, the production of EV71 in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells was significantly lower than that in the control cells after EV71 infection, which revealed that the infectivity of EV71 was decreased significantly in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref>).</p><p>Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;-oligoadenylate synthetases 2 (OAS2) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] are IFN-induced antiviral genes. SOCS proteins regulate IFN by negative feedback, thereby inhibiting the expression of antiviral factors Mx1 and OAS2 [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In order to identify whether there is a similar mechanism involved in EV71 infection, we detected the expression levels of Mx1 and OAS2 in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown RD cells during EV71 infection. The results showed that the expressions of MX1 and OAS2 were both increased significantly comparing with normal cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(g)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(h)</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate SOCS1 and especially SOCS3 expression are required for EV71 replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Induction of SOCS Is in an IFN-Independent Manner in Early Stage of EV71 Infection</title><p>To detect the relationship between EV71 infection and SOCS expression, the EV71 viral titer was increased to MOI 1.5 in the infection of RD cells. SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA levels were increased in the early stage of viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>), accompanied with increased mRNA levels of IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>). We wonder whether SOCS3 induction might be due to the EV71 virus itself or the paracrine stimulation by IFN during the EV71 infection. Therefore, RD cells were stimulated with IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> for different time points, and the mRNA levels of SOCS1, SOCS3, and the IFN-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) were measured by RT-PCR. ISG56 is a typical IFN-inducible gene [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], serving as a control. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</xref> showed that ISG56 mRNA was significantly upregulated, whereas neither SOCS1 nor SOCS3 mRNA was significantly elevated in IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-stimulated RD cells.</p><p>To further confirm these results, we knocked down the IFNAR1 in HEK293T cells. RT-PCR showed that about 60% of IFNAR1 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(d)</xref>). The expressions of SOCS1/3 and IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> were increased in control cells infected with EV71 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(h)</xref>). In the IFNAR1 knockdown cells infected with EV71, the induction of type I IFN was inhibited significantly (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(g)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(h)</xref>), while the expressions of SOCS1/3 were still increased (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>). SOCS1/3 levels in the knockdown cells were almost unchanged compared to control cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>). These results indicate that induction of the SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expressions is independent on the virus-induced type I IFN expression. SOCS expression may be induced by other signaling pathways during EV71 infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4. EV71 Infection Activates SOCS Expression through NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B Pathway and Inhibits IFN-Induced STAT3 Phosphorylation</title><p>We have identified that the expression levels of type I IFN mRNA were induced in EV71 infection cells. However, the relationship between EV71 infection and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway remains unclear. To detect the effects of EV71 infection on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, we analyzed the expression of related factors by western blot. RD cells were stimulated with 20&#x02009;ng/ml IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> for 6&#x02009;h followed by EV71 infection for 24&#x02009;h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, without IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> stimulation and EV71 infection, the expression level of SOCS3 and the phosphorylation level of STAT3 were extremely low. With IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> stimulation and without EV71 infection, the expression level of SOCS3 and the phosphorylation level of STAT3 were significantly increased. However, in the IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-treated cells infected with EV71, the expression of SOCS3 was further upregulated significantly. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation level of STAT3 was significantly decreased in cells with IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> treatment and EV71 infection than in those with IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> treatment and without EV71 infection, although still significantly higher than those without IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> stimulation and EV71 infection. These data demonstrate that IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> could activate STAT3 phosphorylation, but EV71 infection could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation by inducing SOCS3 expression.</p><p>Furthermore, to explore how EV71 infection induces high expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, RD cells were treated with/without NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B inhibitor Bay11-7082 for 1&#x02009;h, followed by EV71 infection, and SOCS3 expression was detected by RT-PCR. It was observed that there was a significant reduction in the expression of SOCS3 mRNA in the early stage of viral infection treated with the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B inhibitor compared with the noninhibitor-treated EV71-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The above results indicate that EV71 infection could activate the SOCS1 and SOCS3 expressions through the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling pathway and counteract the host immune responses in particular by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which may be one of the strategies for the EV71 virus to evade host immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Type I IFN response is the most powerful innate immune defense of the body, which can limit the replication and spread of many viruses. Like other viruses, EV71 can not only induce type I IFN response, but also antagonizes its effects through various ways to achieve the purpose of immune escape. SOCS proteins provide selectively negative feedback to prevent overstimulation of the immune system. Because of the immunomodulatory effects of SOCS proteins, it is not surprising that the many viruses hijack SOCS proteins to escape the host immune responses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and hepatitis C virus. It was reported that SOCS3 was induced at the very early stage of HSV-1 infection in human amnion cells FL and was accompanied by JAK phosphorylation within 1&#x02009;h after infection [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Further study has shown that in HSV-1-infected FL cells, JAK3 signaling induced SOCS3 expression and then negatively regulated the antiviral IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>/<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> signal, thereby promoting viral replication [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, whether SOCS proteins are hijacked by the EV71 virus to escape host immunity remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that the EV71 virus infection induced SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA level expressions both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and SOCS proteins promoted EV71 virus replication. The SOCS3 is well known as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. JAK/STAT signaling pathway can activate type I IFN [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The expression of antiviral factors OAS2 and MX1 depends on type I IFN regulation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found that, in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown RD cells, the expressions of antiviral factors MX1 and OAS2 were significantly increased compared with those of normal cells. We speculate that EV71 might induce SOCS1 and SOCS3 expressions to regulate antiviral factors through the JAK/STAT pathway and then promote viral replication.</p><p>Various viruses suppress IFN-driven immunity by inducing SOCS1 and SOCS3, thereby evading immune responses [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SOCS proteins can be quickly induced by IFN signaling and inhibit the specific JAK/STAT signaling pathway [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate whether SOCS1/3 transcription might be induced due to the EV71 virus itself or paracrine action of IFN during EV71 virus infection. In our study, SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased in the early stage of viral infection in RD cells infected with an increased titer of EV71, accompanied by increased IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IFN<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>. These results were further identified by knockdown of IFNAR in HEK293T cells by shRNA approach, in which the induction of type I IFN was inhibited, but the induction of the SOCS1/3 expression was not impaired when cells were infected with EV71. Our results indicate that the SOCS expression might be induced by other signaling pathways in the early stage of EV71 virus viral infection.</p><p>The critical role of SOCS3 is manifested by its binding to both JAKs and cytokine receptors, which results in the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. STAT3 triggers a variety of gene expressions in response to cytokine (such as IL-6 and IL-10) and growth factor stimulation and plays a critical role in many cellular biological processes involved in anti-/proinflammatory responses, cell growth, and cell death [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, we demonstrated that early EV71 infection quickly activated SOCS protein expression and inhibited IFN-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. The EV71 virus may escape host immunity by inducing expressions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation. Meanwhile, we found that the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B inhibitor could inhibit the expression of the SOCS protein induced by EV71. Consistently, Collins et al. reported that murine hepatitis C virus could induce the expression of SOCS3 through the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway, ultimately leading to an increase of the viral titer [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Similar results have also been found in the Japanese encephalitis virus [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although EV71 infection initiates a very early type I IFN response, it also activates SOCS protein expression via the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling pathway to block this antiviral strategy.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our study found that EV71 virus infection induced SOCS mRNA level expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. SOCS1 and SOCS3 may promote virus infection by inhibiting IFN-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In the early stage, the induction of SOCS gene transcription was an IFN-independent manner and could be blocked by the NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B inhibitor. All these results may add a new aspect to our knowledge of the strategies used by the EV71 virus to fight against type I IFN responses.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 31900457), the Fund for Young Scholars of the First Hospital of Jilin University (grant number 00201080001), and the Projects of International Cooperation and Exchanges Research Jilin Provincial, China (grant number 20170414029GH).
