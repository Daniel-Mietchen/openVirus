<p>In summary, our study found that EV71 virus infection induced SOCS mRNA level expression 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. SOCS1 and SOCS3 may promote virus infection by inhibiting IFN-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In the early stage, the induction of SOCS gene transcription was an IFN-independent manner and could be blocked by the NF-
 <italic>Îº</italic>B inhibitor. All these results may add a new aspect to our knowledge of the strategies used by the EV71 virus to fight against type I IFN responses.
