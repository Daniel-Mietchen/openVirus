<p>Myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetases 2 (OAS2) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] are IFN-induced antiviral genes. SOCS proteins regulate IFN by negative feedback, thereby inhibiting the expression of antiviral factors Mx1 and OAS2 [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In order to identify whether there is a similar mechanism involved in EV71 infection, we detected the expression levels of Mx1 and OAS2 in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown RD cells during EV71 infection. The results showed that the expressions of MX1 and OAS2 were both increased significantly comparing with normal cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(g)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(h)</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate SOCS1 and especially SOCS3 expression are required for EV71 replication.
