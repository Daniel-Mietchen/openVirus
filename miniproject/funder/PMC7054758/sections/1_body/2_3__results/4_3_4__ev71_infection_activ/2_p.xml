<p>Furthermore, to explore how EV71 infection induces high expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3, RD cells were treated with/without NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B inhibitor Bay11-7082 for 1 h, followed by EV71 infection, and SOCS3 expression was detected by RT-PCR. It was observed that there was a significant reduction in the expression of SOCS3 mRNA in the early stage of viral infection treated with the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B inhibitor compared with the noninhibitor-treated EV71-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The above results indicate that EV71 infection could activate the SOCS1 and SOCS3 expressions through the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway and counteract the host immune responses in particular by targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which may be one of the strategies for the EV71 virus to evade host immunity (
