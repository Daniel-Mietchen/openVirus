<p>We have identified that the expression levels of type I IFN mRNA were induced in EV71 infection cells. However, the relationship between EV71 infection and the JAK/STAT signaling pathway remains unclear. To detect the effects of EV71 infection on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, we analyzed the expression of related factors by western blot. RD cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IFN
 <italic>β</italic> for 6 h followed by EV71 infection for 24 h. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>, without IFN
 <italic>β</italic> stimulation and EV71 infection, the expression level of SOCS3 and the phosphorylation level of STAT3 were extremely low. With IFN
 <italic>β</italic> stimulation and without EV71 infection, the expression level of SOCS3 and the phosphorylation level of STAT3 were significantly increased. However, in the IFN
 <italic>β</italic>-treated cells infected with EV71, the expression of SOCS3 was further upregulated significantly. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation level of STAT3 was significantly decreased in cells with IFN
 <italic>β</italic> treatment and EV71 infection than in those with IFN
 <italic>β</italic> treatment and without EV71 infection, although still significantly higher than those without IFN
 <italic>β</italic> stimulation and EV71 infection. These data demonstrate that IFN
 <italic>β</italic> could activate STAT3 phosphorylation, but EV71 infection could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation by inducing SOCS3 expression.
