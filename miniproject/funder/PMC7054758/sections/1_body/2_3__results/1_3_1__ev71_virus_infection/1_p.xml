<p>To examine whether the expressions of SOCS proteins are affected by EV71 infection, RD cells were infected with the EV71 virus and the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were tested by RT-PCR. The results showed that SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA levels increased in the early stages of EV71 infection (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</xref>). In particular, the level of SOCS3 mRNA significantly increased at 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h after infection compared to the negative control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). SOCS1 mRNA levels increased at 36 h after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). In addition, the protein levels of SOCS3 and SOCS1 were analyzed by western blot. The results showed that the expression of SOCS3 significantly increased at 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), and SOCS1 protein levels increased at 36 h after infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>), which was consistent with SOCS mRNA results. In order to further determine whether EV71 infection regulates the expression of SOCS proteins, we infected one-day old mice with the EV71 virus and detected the expression of the SOCS protein in the hind-limb muscle of mice. The results showed that expressions of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased significantly in the hind-limb muscle of the EV71-infected mice (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(d)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(e)</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins increased during the course of the EV71 infection both
