<p>Type I IFN response is the most powerful innate immune defense of the body, which can limit the replication and spread of many viruses. Like other viruses, EV71 can not only induce type I IFN response, but also antagonizes its effects through various ways to achieve the purpose of immune escape. SOCS proteins provide selectively negative feedback to prevent overstimulation of the immune system. Because of the immunomodulatory effects of SOCS proteins, it is not surprising that the many viruses hijack SOCS proteins to escape the host immune responses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and hepatitis C virus. It was reported that SOCS3 was induced at the very early stage of HSV-1 infection in human amnion cells FL and was accompanied by JAK phosphorylation within 1 h after infection [
