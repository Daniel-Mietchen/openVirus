<p>Various viruses suppress IFN-driven immunity by inducing SOCS1 and SOCS3, thereby evading immune responses [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. SOCS proteins can be quickly induced by IFN signaling and inhibit the specific JAK/STAT signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This prompted us to investigate whether SOCS1/3 transcription might be induced due to the EV71 virus itself or paracrine action of IFN during EV71 virus infection. In our study, SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased in the early stage of viral infection in RD cells infected with an increased titer of EV71, accompanied by increased IFN

 <italic>β</italic>. These results were further identified by knockdown of IFNAR in HEK293T cells by shRNA approach, in which the induction of type I IFN was inhibited, but the induction of the SOCS1/3 expression was not impaired when cells were infected with EV71. Our results indicate that the SOCS expression might be induced by other signaling pathways in the early stage of EV71 virus viral infection.
