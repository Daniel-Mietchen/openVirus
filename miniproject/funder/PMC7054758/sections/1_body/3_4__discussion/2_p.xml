<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the EV71 virus infection induced SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA level expressions both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and SOCS proteins promoted EV71 virus replication. The SOCS3 is well known as a feedback inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. JAK/STAT signaling pathway can activate type I IFN [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The expression of antiviral factors OAS2 and MX1 depends on type I IFN regulation [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found that, in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown RD cells, the expressions of antiviral factors MX1 and OAS2 were significantly increased compared with those of normal cells. We speculate that EV71 might induce SOCS1 and SOCS3 expressions to regulate antiviral factors through the JAK/STAT pathway and then promote viral replication.
