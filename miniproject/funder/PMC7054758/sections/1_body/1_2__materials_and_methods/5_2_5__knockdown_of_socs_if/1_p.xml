<p>Lentiviruses were produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with pLKO.1-shcontrol or pLKO.1-shSOCS1/3/IFNAR1 together with pRSV-Rev, pMDLg/pRRE, and pCMV-VSVG. The assembled virus-like particles in the culture supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 130,000 g for 2 h and then were used to infect fresh HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were selected with 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml puromycin (Sigma) 48 h after infection and then cultured for 1 week in the presence of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml puromycin. SOCS1/3 expression was monitored by RT-PCR and western blot. IFNAR1 expression was monitored by RT-PCR. The shSOCS1, shSOCS3, and shIFNAR1 sequences are as follows: shSOCS1: CCGGCTTCCGCACATTCCGTTCGCACTCGAGTGCGAACGGAATGTGCGGAAGTTTTTG, shSOCS3: CCGGCGGCTTCTACTGGAGCGCAGTCTCGAGACTGCGCTCCAGTAGAAGCCGTTTTTG, and shIFNAR1: CCGGAAGAACTACAGCAGGACTTTGCTCGAGCAAAGTCCTGCTGTAGTTCTTTTTTTG.
