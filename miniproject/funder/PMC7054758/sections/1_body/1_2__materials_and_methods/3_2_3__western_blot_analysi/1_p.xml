<p>Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 4 mM EDTA), and then proteins were extracted. Protein concentration was quantified using the BCA assay. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to NC membranes (GE Whatman). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and corresponding secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this study are listed as follows: 
 <italic>β</italic>-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Covance), anti-SOCS3 rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SOCS1 rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-STAT3 rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-p-STAT3 rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The polyclonal antibody against EV71 was obtained from rabbits immunized with EV71 whole viruses in our laboratory. The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (GE) and anti-mouse (Santa Cruz). The membranes were developed with an ECL substrate (Proteintech). Quantification of protein expression was performed by ImageJ2X software (NIH).
