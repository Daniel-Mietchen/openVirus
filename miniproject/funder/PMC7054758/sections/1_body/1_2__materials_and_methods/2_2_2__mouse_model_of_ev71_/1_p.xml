<p>The Jilin University Office of Laboratory Animal Management approved our animal care and experimentation procedures, and we carried out the experiments in accordance with accepted guidelines. One-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) ICR neonatal mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36) which were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center (College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China) were used to establish the animal model of viral infection. The neonatal mice were randomly divided into different experimental groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6 each) and inoculated intracerebrally with the EV71 virus CC063 strain (10
 <sup>3</sup> CCID50 ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) or MEM medium (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/mouse), according to previous description [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At 0, 2, and 4 days following inoculation, all the mice were sacrificed, and the hind-limb tissue samples of the mice were collected.
