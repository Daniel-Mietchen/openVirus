<p>RD cells were seeded on 24-well culture plates. At 40 to 60% confluence, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IFN

 <italic>κ</italic>B inhibitor (E)-3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile (BAY11-7082) for 1 h, followed by EV71 infection, and cells were harvested at 0 h, 3 h, and 9 h after EV71 infection.
