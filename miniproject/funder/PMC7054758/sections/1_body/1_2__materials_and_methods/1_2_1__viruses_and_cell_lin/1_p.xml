Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T, CRL11268, ATCC) and human rhabdomyosarcoma RD cells (CCL-136, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries) and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified cell incubator with 5% of CO
