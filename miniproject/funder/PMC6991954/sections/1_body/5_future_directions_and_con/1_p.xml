<p>Although mAbs have made a massive impact in controlling autoimmune disease, inflammation, and cancer, the relative impact in the world of infectious disease has largely been confined to viral diseases. The use of mAbs to protect against RSV infections and the profile of second-generation antibodies shows that it is possible to obtain mAbs that are sufficiently potent to provide long-term protection with a single intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. With the development of new technologies for cloning antibodies from B cells or plasma cells taken from patients infected with bacteria, viruses, fungi, or even protozoal pathogens, it is possible to quickly obtain fully human antibody collections with potential activity against pathogens in vitro and in vivo.</p>
