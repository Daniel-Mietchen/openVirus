<p>Target identification for schistosomiasis is not straightforward. Unlike malaria, the vaccine field offers no clues as to useful antibody targets. Two vaccine candidates are currently being tested in humans. The first is based on the fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) Sm-14 (Schistosoma mansoni-14), which is being tested in 2 small, open-label pilot studies in Senegal (NCT03041766 and NCT03799510). A larger 300-participant trial in Uganda, NCT03910972, is being planned for a vaccine based on Sm-TSP-2 (Schistosoma mansoni-tetraspanin-2) but is not expected to report before 2023.</p>
