<p>No target-product profile (TPP) for prophylaxis against schistosomiasis has been published, but it is possible to start to build one, with the recent characterization of praziquantel for such use in murine models and in pediatrics. Clinically, this treatment reduces infection by 70% to 80% using doses of 40 to 60 mg/kg [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, this murine dose produced a peak exposure of 6 ng/ml, some 10-fold higher than the exposure observed in children at the recommended regimen of 40 to 60 mg/kg [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. It seems pragmatic to project that an antibody that can reduce the worm burden by 80% in the mouse model, at a dose that is clinically achievable in humans, could be acceptable. The maximally practicable injection of an antibody in children is 2 to 5 mg/kg, and given the relatively consistent allometry between humans and mice for mAbs, this corresponds to a dose of 80 to 200 Î¼g in mice [
