<p>The role of protective antibodies in malaria was demonstrated over 40 years ago with the finding that the passive transfer of sera from mice with radiation-attenuated sporozoites delayed the development of infection in other mice [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These include a profile for seasonal malaria chemoprevention, a treatment successfully launched in sub-Saharan Africa in the last 5 years, consisting of a full treatment course of 3 days of amodiaquine and 1 dose of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. It is given monthly to children during the rainy season. Antibody therapeutics for malaria could (1) prevent the entry (initial infection) of the parasite, (2) block entry of the sporozoite into the liver cells, (3) block entry of the merozoites into the erythrocytes, or (4) block the uptake of the gametocytes into the mosquito (breaking the transmission cycle).
