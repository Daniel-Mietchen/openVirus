<p>A general observation with 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections is that the human host is unable to mount a sterilizing immune response. One theory is that the parasite can control the T-cell response and induce a state of fatigue or anergy similar to that seen in tumor-invading lymphocytes in immuno-oncology. Several studies in mice have demonstrated that blocking PD-L1 or CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) improves clearance in mice infected with 
 <italic>Plasmodium bergheii</italic> [
