 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic>, like 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, is an important opportunistic pathogen in HIV/AIDS and other immunosuppressed patient populations, with estimates of up to 500,000 cases per year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. However, unlike 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, which is acquired from the environment, 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> spp. are commensals, with different species occurring in the lungs of many mammals. The capacity for endogenous infection and for acquisition from asymptomatic carriers makes 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> an attractive target for immunoprophylaxis. To this end, a variety of programs are aimed at developing a 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> vaccine [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], and passive immunization studies have been initiated using mAbs raised to 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> epitopes. Intranasal administration of 4F11, an mAb that recognizes the 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> kexin-like protein KEX1, was able to prevent transmission of 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> pneumonia from infected to susceptible cohoused mice, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Emerging evidence of the importance of B cellâ€“mediated immunity to 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> infection strongly supports further research in this area [
