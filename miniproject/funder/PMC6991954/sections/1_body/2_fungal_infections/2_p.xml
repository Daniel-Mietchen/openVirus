<p>The discussion here will focus on mAbs developed for the following significant fungal pathogens: 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pneumocystis</italic> and 
 <italic>Paracoccidioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida</italic>. In addition to antibodies that directly target and inhibit the fungal pathogen, mAbs can be directed to checkpoints that control the host immune response. This approach may be particularly useful against fungal pathogens for which sustained infection is characterized by a shift from a protective Th1 or Th17 response to a noninflammatory Th2 response. The clinical use of anti-IL17 in rheumatoid arthritis clearly exacerbates fungal infection [
