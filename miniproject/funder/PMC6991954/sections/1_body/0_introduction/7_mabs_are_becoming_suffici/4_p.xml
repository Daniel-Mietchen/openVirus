<p>One final objection to the goal of administering monoclonals is that vaccination would instead provide lifelong coverage. However, for some diseases, the development of long-lasting potent vaccines still remains elusive. Many pathogens will not raise an adequate immune response, due to immunosuppression. Finally, antibodies give immediate protection, important during rapidly evolving epidemics or pandemics and for individuals being deployed into zones of high transmission. Antibodies would thus form part of the overall armamentarium, along with drugs, bed nets and insecticides, and vaccines.</p>
