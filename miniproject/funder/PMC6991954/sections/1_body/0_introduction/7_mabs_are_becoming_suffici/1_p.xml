<p>A major objection to the use of mAbs in infectious diseases as a therapeutic class is their high price, which is presumed to be a consequence of a high cost of goods. Manufacturing costs are a particularly important attribute for any medication that is developed for diseases of poverty in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, production efficiency of mAbs has increased dramatically over recent decades, and cell-culture expression levels around 4 g/l or even higher are common. A published analysis from a decade ago already noted that the costs of mAb production were dropping from US$300/g to US$20/g when being produced at the 10-tonne-per-year scale, potentially using large, 100,000 L reactors [
