<p>In infectious disease, the biggest success story has been the use of antibodies to provide prophylaxis against infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is responsible for over 30 million episodes of new lower respiratory tract infections, particularly targeting children 5 years and younger, resulting in an estimated 48,000 to 74,500 deaths globally (2015 estimates) [

Palivizumab, dosed at 15 mg/kg, is given as a monthly intramuscular injection throughout the RSV season, which is suitable for small babies but would not be appealing for adults. A follow-on antibody—MEDI8897, now in Phase II clinical studies [
