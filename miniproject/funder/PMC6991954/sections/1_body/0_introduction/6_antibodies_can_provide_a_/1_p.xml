<p>Most antibodies developed to date are used as therapeutics, targeting cellular mediators that are overexpressed in disease, such as cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis or cell-surface markers in oncology. For the anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies used in rheumatoid arthritis, although there is an initial loading dose to reduce an existing inflammatory signal, the long-term use is to provide prophylaxis against relapse. The first candidate to be approved was infliximab, initially approved for intravenous use at a dose of 3 mg/kg. More recent antibodies have been developed as subcutaneous injections, and adalimumab has taken over as the market leader, with an injection every 2 weeks. Clearly, compliance is linked to the relative ease of delivery of the subcutaneous approach, with a reasonable dose.</p>
