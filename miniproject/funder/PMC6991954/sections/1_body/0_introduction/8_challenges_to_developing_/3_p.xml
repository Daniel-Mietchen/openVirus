<p>Immunization against protist parasites and fungi is generally ineffective. One problem is that organisms such as 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (which causes sleeping sickness) and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (malarial parasites) encode dozens or even hundreds of different surface antigens that are sequentially exposed at their most abundant stage, outpacing the host's immune system.
