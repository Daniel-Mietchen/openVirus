<p>Recently, the case for discovering mAbs for neglected tropical and other infectious diseases was reviewed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This work took a broad, category-wide approach (viruses, bacteria, parasites) and also included venoms. Snake bites, and the challenge of envenoming, represent a serious health problem, resulting in 81,000 to 138,000 deaths yearly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007860.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and were recently included in the World Health Organization (WHO) list of neglected tropical diseases. The discovery of mAbs in this area logically follows the long-standing therapeutic successes with passive immunization [

In this Review, we selected diseases prioritized by the Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund, an international collaboration between the public and private sectors, supporting collaborations between Japanese and non-Japanese entities to advance global health research and development [
