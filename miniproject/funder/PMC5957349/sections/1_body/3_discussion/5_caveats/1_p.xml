<p>Additional caveats to note concern the type of data used in this study. Firstly, as the majority of our data are GP diagnosed cases of ILI, they may also include misclassified cases of other wintertime respiratory diseases, such as respiratory syncytial virus. However, sentinel ILI data are a robust indictor of influenza activity in Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and if misreporting is approximately uniform across space, it should not impact our general conclusions regarding spatial synchrony. Secondly, there were inconsistencies in our international data, as the Swedish time-series were confirmed influenza cases rather than ILI reports. As discussed in the previous sections, we believe our general conclusions are robust to this fact. However, we do note that eight counties in Sweden had to be discarded due to low sampling of confirmed cases. Although the remaining twelve are geographically, demographically, and climatically representative (see for example 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197519.g005">Fig 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s007">S2 Fig</xref>), incorporating the discarded counties would provide a more complete analysis of spatial synchrony. Increased laboratory sampling in Sweden following the 2009/10 pandemic should facilitate such work in the future.
