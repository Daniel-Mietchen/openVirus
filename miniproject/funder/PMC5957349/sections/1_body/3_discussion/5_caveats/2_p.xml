<p>Thirdly, our analyses do not differentiate influenza cases by strain or subtype and thus cannot account for patterns of spatial spread that may be caused by concurrent circulation of multiple strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For instance, well-mixed dynamics of aggregated influenza data could mask underlying structure in the local spread of distinct strains. The extent to which strain coexistence impacts overall spatial synchrony across small populations is an interesting area for future research. Finally, there may be regional and temporal differences in reporting rates that our analyses do not include, for example due to inaccessibility of local GP offices or increased reporting during the 2009/10 pandemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, our general conclusions should be robust to such fluctuations as: 1) the sentinel system is designed to maintain even population representation and reporting frequencies across space [
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; and 2) repeating analyses without the 2009/10 pandemic season did not significantly change our results (see for example
