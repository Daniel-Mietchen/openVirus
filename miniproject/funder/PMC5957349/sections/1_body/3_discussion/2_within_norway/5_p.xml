<p>More generally, the high levels of synchrony found in this relatively small population points to the open question of how much host mixing is needed to drive strong spatial synchrony in influenza transmission. Dynamics in small populations are often challenging to analyze due to demographic noise obscuring epidemic signals. However, the clear impact of distance on amplitude synchrony (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197519.g003">Fig 3</xref>) indicates there is a strong signal in these data despite this fact. Small populations can therefore provide useful insight into the local dynamics of influenza, and more quantitative work in this area is needed to elucidate how host mixing, climate, and demography impact the spread of seasonal epidemics.
