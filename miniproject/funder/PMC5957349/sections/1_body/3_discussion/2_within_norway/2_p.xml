<p>Also in agreement with previous literature, we find that distance has a stronger impact on synchrony in epidemic amplitudes than epidemic timing [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This is unlikely to be driven by demographic noise as spatial signals should be obscured by low case counts rather than amplified. Other unlikely factors are temperature and humidity conditions: these were highly correlated with geographic distance and would thus be expected to modulate epidemic amplitudes and timing in similar ways. More plausible factors, that could differentially mediate the severity of epidemics across space, include local differences in influenza strain dynamics, prior immunity, and healthcare seeking behavior. These were outside the scope of this study, but would be interesting covariates to include in future work.
