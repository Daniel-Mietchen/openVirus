<p>Alternative drivers of synchrony that we were unable to address include high levels of population movements and external importations of influenza. In particular, the well-mixed pattern of timing could be explained by multiple distinct introductions from other countries. Although we did not identify air travel as a significant predictor of spatial synchrony, our data did not include international flights and may thus miss external seeding events. Furthermore, other modes of ground transportation are likely to be important for more localized movement between municipalities. Therefore, additional mobility data, such as age-stratified commuting patterns, are needed to understand how smaller scale movements influence transmission in this region, particularly for key age groups [
