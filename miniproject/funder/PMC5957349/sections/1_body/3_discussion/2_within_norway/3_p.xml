<p>Specific humidity and temperature are parsimonious predictors of influenza virus transmission and survival and have been shown to modulate the timing and spatial spread of influenza epidemics in the US [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these variables were not significant in our analysis once we accounted for distance. Instead, the high correlations in humidity and temperature conditions across municipalities suggest country-wide similarities in climate that may promote synchrony across space. Although other climatic variables, such as sunlight levels, may also modulate influenza activity, these were not included in the present study as the underlying mechanisms are less well defined [
