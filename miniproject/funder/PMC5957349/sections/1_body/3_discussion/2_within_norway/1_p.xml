<p>Within Norway we found greater synchrony in epidemic timing than epidemic amplitudes. This echoes previous studies of influenza in the US and measles in the UK [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and is likely driven by increased sensitivity of epidemic amplitudes to demographic noise in small populations. However, our predictions of phase synchrony are very high relative to these previous studies. Further investigation with the US data suggests this may be partly due to a lack of sampling during the summer (weeks 21â€“39). Caution must therefore be exercised when interpreting such incomplete data.
