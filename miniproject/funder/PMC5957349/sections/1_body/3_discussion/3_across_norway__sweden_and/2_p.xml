<p>Incorporating data from Denmark and Sweden highlighted a striking systematic delay in the timing of epidemics in the latter country. Although the Swedish data represent confirmed influenza cases rather than ILI reports, previous work has shown these different sources consistently estimate the timing of influenza epidemics within a week of one another [

In addition, the robustness of phase trajectories to sample size, and the fact that downsampled Norwegian and Danish data produced equivalent results, suggest this lag represents a true phenomenon. Furthermore, these findings are consistent with previous reports of an eastward spread of influenza across Europe [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In particular, Alonso et al. (2015) found Swedish epidemics occurred, on average, two weeks after those in Denmark and Norway. This study compared laboratory confirmed cases of influenza across all three countries and thus does not suffer from inconsistent data sources.
