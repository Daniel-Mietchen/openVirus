<p>Aggregating data across national reporting systems is a vital step towards characterizing the international spread of influenza. However, care must be taken when reconciling data from different sources and spatiotemporal resolutions. Before extending our analysis beyond Norway, we therefore compared estimates of synchrony at different resolutions, and found an increase at the county-level that was greater for epidemic amplitudes than timing (

For example, when reconstructing phase-angles from the annual period of the ILI time-series, we remove noise at other frequencies. This may buffer the resulting phase trajectories against transient ILI fluctuations in small populations, and thus reduce their sensitivity to demographic noise. Overall, our findings suggest phase analysis may provide a more robust measure of spatial synchrony across different resolutions.
