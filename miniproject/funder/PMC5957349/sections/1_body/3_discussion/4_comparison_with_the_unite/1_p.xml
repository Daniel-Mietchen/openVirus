<p>We first took advantage of consistent temporal sampling in the US to investigate the impact of missing weeks on our Norwegian estimates of synchrony. We found that phase synchrony may be overestimated whereas amplitude synchrony may be underestimated, and propose that both cases can be explained by considering the respective timing of greatest spatial variation. For example, in the case of ILI trajectories, variation in amplitudes is greatest during the peak of the epidemics (i.e. during winter), whereas in summer amplitudes are more similar (i.e. all very small). Removing the summer weeks then removes the most correlated part of the time-series and thus causes synchrony to decrease. In contrast, variation in phase-angles should be greatest before epidemics begin to take off, when the underlying periodic signal is most obscured (i.e. near the transition between summer and winter). Removing this period would then increase correlation, and thus estimates of synchrony.</p>
