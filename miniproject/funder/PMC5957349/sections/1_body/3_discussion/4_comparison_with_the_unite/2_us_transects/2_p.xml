<p>Another caveat to our transect analysis is that the partitioning algorithm likely only captures a subset of all possible US transects. In addition, the coarse state-level resolution of the algorithm may have facilitated disproportionate representation of expansive and well-connected states in the central and southern regions. Therefore, although the transects we identified collectively spanned the entire country and included a range of population sizes and climatic conditions, we cannot guarantee that the resulting synchrony distribution is fully representative. Future work could explore this problem further by comparing both countries at finer spatial resolutions. This would allow more flexible partitioning of transect boundaries and greater sampling of irregular coastal and northern regions.</p>
