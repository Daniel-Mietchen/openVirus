<p>Partitioning the abridged US data into transects of similar size to Norway allowed us to compare synchrony between these countries whilst controlling for differences in sampling and geographic scale. We expected larger population sizes in the US transects to have a stronger synchronizing effect on influenza epidemics. Instead, we found that amplitude and phase synchrony were indiscriminately higher in Norway. One reason for this may be the lower mean and variance of Norwegian climatic conditions (

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whilst lower variation in these conditions may promote tighter spatial coupling that overcomes the expected lag between small populations. However, we note caution when interpreting these results as there may be other important differences between Norway and the US transects that we were unable to explore. For example, we did not assess differences in vaccine uptake, healthcare seeking behavior, population movements, age distributions, or school term times. In particular, the spatial spread of the 2009/10 US pandemic was mediated by variation in school opening times, whereas population movements can parsimoniously explain the corresponding patterns of seasonal outbreaks [
