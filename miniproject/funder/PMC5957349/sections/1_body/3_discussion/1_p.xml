<p>Guided by previous work, we expected to find a strong spatial signature in Norwegian influenza epidemics. In particular, we hypothesized that epidemics would originate in larger, well-connected cities and later diffuse into more isolated regions, and that climatic conditions would modulate the speed of this spread [

Instead, we found surprisingly little spatial variation in the synchrony of epidemics, with only population size moderately mediating this synchrony. Expanding the geographic scale of our analysis to include Sweden and Denmark did not substantially change these results. In addition, we hypothesized that spatial synchrony in Norway would be lower than US transects of comparable size, given the smaller population of the former country (approximately 4.9 million, compared to a mean transect population size of 44.9 million (range: 3.8 millionâ€“178.6 million)). Unexpectedly, however, we found the opposite. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the spatiotemporal spread of influenza in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Moreover, the unusually high degrees of synchrony, despite relatively small population sizes, highlight the importance of studying diverse environmental and demographic regions if influenza dynamics are to be better understood.
