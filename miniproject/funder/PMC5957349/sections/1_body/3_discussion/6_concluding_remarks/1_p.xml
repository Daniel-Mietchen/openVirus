<p>Using rich data from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark we characterized the spatial spread of influenza at different spatial resolutions and geographic scales. Although we found high degrees of epidemic synchrony, further comparison with the US suggested these estimates may be partly confounded by discontinuous temporal sampling. National surveillance systems are diverse with respect to sampling procedures, and our results highlight the challenges in analyzing influenza spread across regions where such differences are present. Nevertheless, important insights can be gained from careful studies that take sampling practices into account. In particular, future mechanistic models could be used to compare different sampling procedures and test their impact on the above analyses. Finally, incorporating data from the US enabled the comparison of influenza spread in two very different regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Contrary to expectations, US epidemics were less synchronized than those in Norway, demonstrating that further study of diverse environmental and demographic settings is needed to better understand the key mechanisms underlying influenza spread.</p>
