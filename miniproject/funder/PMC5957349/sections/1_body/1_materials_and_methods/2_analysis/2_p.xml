<p>To analyze synchrony in epidemic timing, wavelet phase-angles were also reconstructed from the 136 ILI time-series. Following standard procedures, each series was first padded with zeros to the nearest power of two, then log-transformed and standardized to reduce variability and noise obscuring the underlying periodic features [
