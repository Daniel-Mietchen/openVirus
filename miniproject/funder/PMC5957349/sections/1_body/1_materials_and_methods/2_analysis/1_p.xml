<p>To explore fine-scale spatiotemporal patterns of transmission within Norway, the ILI incidence data were aggregated at the municipality-level. Although weekly ILI records are often normalized by the weekly number of GP visits, we excluded this step as the latter data were unavailable for the first period of our study (1998–2003). Comparative analyses of the ILI and normalized ILI time-series from 2004–2014 produced qualitatively similar results and so we do not expect this omission to impact our conclusions. Of the 428 municipalities in Norway, 165 were originally represented in the data. To account for low sample sizes we removed 29 that failed a conservative Box-Pierce white noise test or had more than two seasons with less than ten total cases reported (
