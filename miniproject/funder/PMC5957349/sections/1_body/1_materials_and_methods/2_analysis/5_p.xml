<p>To explore patterns of transmission across national borders, the above analyses were repeated with additional data from Denmark and Sweden. Weekly time-series were aggregated by county from 2001â€“2014 in accordance with the common spatiotemporal resolution of the data. Of the resulting 45 time-series, eight failed our low sample size tests and were discarded from further analysis (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s010">S5 Fig</xref>). The discarded series were exclusively from Sweden, and likely reflect lower sampling of laboratory data (particularly before the 2009/10 pandemic), rather than reduced influenza activity [

Of the remaining 37 time-series, the Swedish lab confirmed data were still substantially lower in magnitude than the ILI data from Denmark and Norway, and thus unsuitable for comparison of epidemic amplitudes. However, phase-angle trajectories should be robust to differences in sample size as the series are standardized and de-trended during the reconstruction procedure. We therefore limited our cross-border analyses to synchrony in epidemic timing using the corresponding phase-angle trajectories (reconstructed as described above). To test the robustness of the phase-angle reconstructions, we repeated our analyses with downsampled data from Norway and Denmark that were equivalent in magnitude to Sweden (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s001">S1 Text</xref> for further details). We also compared the average epidemic center of mass as an alternative measure of synchrony in timing (
