<p>Finally, to test the relationship between epidemic synchrony and a wider range of predictor variables, we also performed Mantel and partial Mantel tests with Spearman correlations [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The former method tests for monotonic associations between a response and predictor variable that both vary across space, whereas the latter performs the same task whilst controlling for a third covariate. Our response variable was the pairwise correlation in ILI (or phase) trajectories between municipalities; and our predictor variables were the great-circle distance between those municipalities; the product of their population sizes; the absolute difference in their average altitude; the pairwise correlation in their temperature and specific humidity conditions; and the average number of airline passengers traveling between them. The choice of distance, population size, temperature, specific humidity, and airline travel (a proxy for population mobility) were motivated by previous influenza studies [
