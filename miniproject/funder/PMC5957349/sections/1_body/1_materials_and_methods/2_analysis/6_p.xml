<p>Finally, to compare our findings with those from a demographically and climatically diverse temperate region, the sncf analyses were repeated with the US ILI data and corresponding phase-angle trajectories. Two approaches were used to reconstruct the US phase-angles: 1) by using the original year-round ILI data; and 2) by first removing weeks 21–39 of each year to mimic the temporal distribution of sampling in Norway. Comparing these approaches enabled us to assess the impact of the unsampled weeks on our estimates of synchrony in Norway. To control for spatiotemporal resolution, the Norwegian data were aggregated by county from 2002–2009. To control for differences in the geographic scale of each country, we developed an algorithm to partition the contiguous US into an array of distinct transects of similar size and shape to Norway (see
