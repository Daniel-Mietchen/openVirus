<p>Synchrony in epidemic amplitudes (or timing) between each pair of municipalities was measured as the correlation between each respective pair of ILI (or phase) trajectories. The average phase difference between each pair of phase trajectories was employed as a supplemental measure of synchrony in timing [

Regional variation in synchrony was explored by mapping the correlation (or phase difference) between each municipality and a reference point, Oslo (the most densely populated municipality in Norway). To determine how synchrony varies as a function of the distance between municipalities, we estimated the spatial non-parametric correlation function (sncf) for the ILI and phase-angle time-series [
