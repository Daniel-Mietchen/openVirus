<p>The Danish data were obtained from the Danish sentinel surveillance system (Statens Serum Institut) and contain weekly ILI cases reported by approximately 140 GPs from 2001–2014. Similar to Norway, the data indicate the municipality and region (equivalent to Norwegian counties) in which each GP is located. The Swedish data were obtained from the Swedish virological surveillance system (Public Health Agency of Sweden) and consist of weekly positive confirmed cases of influenza from 2001–2015. These are reported by up to 27 laboratories across the country, and contain information on the county in which each laboratory is located. The majority of samples are processed in the county in which the corresponding case originated, and thus the data are assumed to be spatially representative. To coincide with peak influenza transmission, reporting in all three countries typically extends from week 40 of each year to week 20 of the following year. Notable exceptions were the pandemic seasons of 2009/10 and 2010/11 for which reporting continued year-round. The spatial boundaries of all municipalities and counties within each country are depicted in
