<p>Influenza data for Norway were obtained from the Norwegian sentinel surveillance system (Norwegian Institute of Public Health) and contain weekly reports of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases for 16 consecutive influenza seasons, from 1998â€“2014. Such sentinel data have been shown to provide reliable estimates of influenza activity across Norway and the wider European region [

Overall, the surveillance system represents approximately 16% of the Norwegian population and is assumed to be geographically representative [
