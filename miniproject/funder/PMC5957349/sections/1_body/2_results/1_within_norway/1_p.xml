<p>Mapping the pairwise correlations in ILI and phase-angle trajectories revealed that influenza epidemics are highly synchronized across Norwegian municipalities, particularly with respect to epidemic timing (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197519.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), the corresponding phase correlations and phase differences suggest epidemic timing is more evenly distributed (
