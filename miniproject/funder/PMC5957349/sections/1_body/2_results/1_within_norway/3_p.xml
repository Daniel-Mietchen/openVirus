<p>Using Mantel tests we found that distance, population size, temperature, and specific humidity conditions are all moderately associated with synchrony in epidemic amplitudes and timing (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.002, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197519.t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, average altitude was only weakly associated (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s002">S1 Table</xref>), and there was no association with the average number of airline passengers traveling between municipalities (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.42, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s002">S1 Table</xref>). After controlling for each significant predictor using partial Mantel tests, only population size remained moderately associated. In particular, specific humidity and temperature were not significant after controlling for distance, distance was not significant after controlling for temperature, and altitude was not significant after controlling for population size. This is likely due to correlations between specific humidity and distance (−0.98, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0002), distance and temperature (−0.96, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and altitude and population size (−0.28, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, we found that all municipalities are highly correlated with respect to their temperature and humidity time-series (across municipalities, temperature correlations ≥ 0.78, and humidity correlations ≥ 0.74). This suggests a substantial degree of spatial homogeneity in climatic conditions.
