<p>These findings were further confirmed by the sncf analysis. First, we estimated high levels of synchrony across the country, particularly in epidemic timing (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197519.g003">Fig 3</xref>, dashed blue lines). This indicates a stronger impact of distance and thus a greater degree of spatial structuring. Finally, the unusual increase in phase correlations beyond 1200 kilometers (km) suggests close synchronicity in timing between geographically distant areas, as noted above for Oslo and certain northern municipalities.
