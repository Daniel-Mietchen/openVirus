<p>Extending the geographical scale to Sweden and Denmark required aggregating data by county rather than municipality. To test the impact of this change in resolution on our synchrony estimates, we first compared municipality and county-level sncf curves within Norway. Although synchrony increased for both phase-angle and ILI trajectories at the county-level, the former were substantially less affected (

Subsequently incorporating Swedish and Danish phase-angles in the county sncf analysis revealed lower levels of synchrony, and a more pronounced relationship between synchrony and distance, than within Norway alone (
