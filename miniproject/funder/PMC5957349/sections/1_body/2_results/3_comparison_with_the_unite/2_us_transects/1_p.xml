<p>To compare synchrony in Norway to that in the US, we first controlled for differences in temporal sampling by using the abridged US data. To control for geographic scale, we then partitioned the US into 84 transects of similar size and shape to Norway (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s014">S9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s015">S10</xref> Figs). Compared to Norwegian counties, the majority of these transects had greater mean and variance in temperature, humidity, and population sizes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s016">S11 Fig</xref>). Estimates of synchrony for each transect, and for Norway, were obtained from the respective sncf (see for example 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s017">S12 Fig</xref>). For all transects, both amplitude and phase synchrony were lower than that of Norway (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0197519.s018">S13 Fig</xref>).
