<p>One notable difference between the US and Norwegian reporting of seasonal influenza is that the former remains consistent year-round, whereas the latter is suspended each year during weeks 21–39. We took advantage of the consistent temporal sampling in the US to investigate the impact of missing weeks on our Norwegian synchrony estimates. Specifically, for synchrony in epidemic amplitudes, we compared results using the original US ILI time-series to those obtained from an abridged dataset in which weeks 21–39 were removed. These abridged data were less synchronized than the original series, suggesting that missing weeks lead to an underestimation of amplitude synchrony (

For synchrony in epidemic timing, we compared results using phase angles reconstructed from the original time-series to those reconstructed from the abridged data. In contrast to the effect on epidemic amplitudes, the abridged phase-angles were more synchronized than the original trajectories, suggesting an overestimation of synchrony in epidemic timing (
