<p>In this paper we first explore patterns of influenza spread in Norway using spatially rich data from the national sentinel surveillance system. We then investigate the role of geographic, demographic, and climatic factors in mediating these patterns, and incorporate data from Sweden and Denmark to extrapolate our findings across a wider geographic scale. Finally, we use the US as a demographically and climatically diverse temperate region with which to assess the generalizability of our results. To address discrepancies in geographic scale between Norway and the US, we develop a novel approach of partitioning the latter into geographical transects of comparable size to Norway. Our results highlight the importance of comparing influenza spread across different geographic regions if the dynamics of this pervasive disease are to be fully understood.</p>
