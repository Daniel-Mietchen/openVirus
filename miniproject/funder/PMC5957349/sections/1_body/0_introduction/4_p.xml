<p>In addition to influenza spread within Norway, fluid population movements between neighboring countries underscore the importance of considering spread across a wider geographic scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For instance, high levels of commuting across the Swedish border may facilitate the importation of new seasonal strains and substantially alter local patterns of transmission in Norway. Across mainland Europe, previous studies have described eastward waves of influenza that bear hallmarks of a simple spatial diffusion process [

 <xref rid="pone.0197519.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, demographic and climatic covariates were not included in these analyses, and so the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, these studies were limited in their use of national-level data, which may dilute patterns of spread at finer spatial resolutions. Integrating subnational data from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark with new demographic and climatic information will thus enable further exploration of the factors mediating influenza spread across national borders.
