<p>Norway is situated in Northern Europe, a temperate region near the Arctic Circle, and provides a novel environment to explore spatial patterns of influenza spread. Firstly, Norway is the longest country in Europe in terms of latitudinal range, with an extremely heterogeneous population distribution. Over 80% of inhabitants live in urban areas around the south and central coasts, whereas the northern regions are more sparsely populated and geographically isolated. One may therefore expect a strong spatial signature in influenza epidemics, driven by preferential spread between large and well-connected southern cities such as Oslo and Bergen [
