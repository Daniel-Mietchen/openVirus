  <p>Top: blue states on the map were those included in the transect. Bottom: Spatial non-parametric correlation function comparing synchrony between the US transect (blue) and Norway (purple) for (A) ILI trajectories and (B) phase-angle trajectories. Solid lines represent the average synchrony across all regions, dashed lines depict the predicted relationship between synchrony and distance, and shaded regions are the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
