  <title>County-level data.</title>
  <p>Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish county time-series. Red trajectories indicate that the data were removed from further analysis due to failure of a Box-Pierce white noise test or the presence of at least two seasons with less than ten cases reported; series that were kept for further analysis are depicted with blue trajectories. The background color of each plot indicates the country in which each county is located.</p>
