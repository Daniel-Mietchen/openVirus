  <title>Geographic distribution of synchrony in epidemic timing between counties.</title>
  <p>Colors indicate the correlation in phase-angles (A) and the average phase difference (B) between each county and Oslo (marked by the black square); counties for which data were discarded are shown in white. A positive (negative) phase difference indicates epidemics tend to follow (precede) those in Oslo.</p>
