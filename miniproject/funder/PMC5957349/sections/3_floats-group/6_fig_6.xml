  <title>Impact of sampling on the relationship between synchrony and distance.</title>
  <p>Spatial non-parametric correlation function applied to US ILI (A) and phase-angle (B) trajectories. Colors indicate the temporal sampling distribution i.e. original year-round (purple) or abridged with weeks 21â€“39 removed (blue). Solid lines represent the average synchrony across all regions, dashed lines depict the predicted relationship between synchrony and distance, and shaded regions are the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
