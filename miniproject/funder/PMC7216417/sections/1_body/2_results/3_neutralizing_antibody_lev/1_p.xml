<p id="Par24">All 801 samples were first screened to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV. Of the 83 ZIKV IgM-positive samples, 8 demonstrated neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> = 1: 40 to 1: 640). Of the 8 samples, 3 (Z141a, Z153a, Z735a) exhibited ZIKV antibody titers that were &gt; 4-fold higher than the antibody titers for all 4 DENV serotypes (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> ZIKV = 1: 160 to 1: 640) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The remaining 5 samples (Z120a, Z138a, Z140a, Z420a, Z476a) were classified as probable ZIKV infections (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> ZIKV = 1: 40–1: 640).
