<p id="Par28">Levels of anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies in the 83 samples that exhibited anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies and five samples that demonstrated ZIKV neutralizing antibodies but negative for anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies (
 <italic>N</italic> = 88) were determined using anti-Zika Virus NS1 IgG ELISA (R&amp;D Systems). Anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG assays are useful for confirming ZIKV infection because they are highly specific and possess minimal cross-reactivity to other flaviviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Sixteen out of 83 ZIKV IgM positive samples (19.3%) demonstrated ZIKV NS1 specific IgG antibodies, with a mean of P/N ratio of 5.7 ± 10.3 (data not shown). Among 8 of 83 ZIKV IgM positive samples that demonstrated neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV, 6 samples (Z120a, Z140a, Z141a, Z153a, Z476a and Z735a) were also positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG by using ELISA. All of 3 samples (Z141a, Z153a and Z735a) that demonstrated a 4-fold or greater ratio of ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers to DENV antibody titers also demonstrated ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies (P/N ratio = 3.1–8.1). These results confirm that these 3 participants were exposed to ZIKV infection. Three of the 5 samples (Z120a, Z138a, Z140a, Z420a, Z476a) with ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were also confirmed positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 antibodies. The Anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG levels in the second samples collected in July 2018 were comparable to the levels in the first samples.
