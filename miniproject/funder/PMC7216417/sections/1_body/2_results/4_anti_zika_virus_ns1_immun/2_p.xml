<p id="Par29">Three of 5 samples (Z147, Z472, Z587, Z591 and Z606) that demonstrated ZIKV neutralizing antibodies (
 <italic>N</italic> = 718, ZIKV IgM negative samples) were also positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies. Two samples (Z472 and Z606) were positive for both ZIKV neutralizing antibodies and ZIKV NS1 IgG (P/N ratio = 10.6 and 46.1 respectively). In addition, one sample (Z147) was also positive for anti-NS1 antibodies with a P/N ratio of 4.5. Finally, a total of 19 samples demonstrated anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies, including 16 of 83 samples that exhibited anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies positive and three samples that showed ZIKV neutralizing antibodies but negative for anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, out of the 19 samples that were positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG antibodies, only 9 (Z120, Z140, Z141, Z153, Z476, Z735, Z147, Z472 and Z606) exhibited neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV with PRNT
