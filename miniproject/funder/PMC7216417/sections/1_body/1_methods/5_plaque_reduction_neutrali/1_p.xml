<p id="Par19">Serum samples were screened for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV using a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Serum samples were inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min before testing. In the first PRNT screening for ZIKV, the serum was diluted 10 times in the EMEM (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) containing 2% FBS, then the serum samples were serially diluted 2-fold (1:10–1:10240). The PRNT was performed in replicates of 2 for ZIKV (MR766 laboratory strain) and all 4 DENV serotypes (DENV-1 01–44 strain; DENV-2 TLC-30 strain; DENV-3 CH53469 strain; DENV-4 SLMC318 strain). At each dilution, 50 μL of serum sample was mixed with 50 μL virus containing 100–200 plaque forming units (2000–4000 PFU/mL). The immune virus-complex mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. A total of 50 μL of virus-immune complex mixture was then added onto BHK cell monolayers in 12 well plates (Corning Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 h. After incubation, overlay medium (2 mL of EMEM/ 1% methylcellulose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), in 2% FBS) was added into each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4–6 days until visible plaque formation. Cells were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer solution (Wako) for 1 h at RT and then stained with 1.25% crystal violet (Wako). The plaques were then counted by naked eye. The neutralization titers, PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> and PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>, were defined as the highest serum dilution which reduced the number of plaques by 50 and 90% respectively. The presence of neutralizing antibodies was defined as ZIKV PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titer ≥20. The criteria to confirm the case exposed to ZIKV that has neutralizing antibodies to ZIKV with PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titer ≥20, and 4 fold higher compare to DENV titers. The interpretation of probable ZIKV infection was according to WHO guidelines for laboratory testing for Zika virus infection in which samples that were positive for ZIKV IgM and negative for DENV IgM was interpreted as ZIKV probable case [
