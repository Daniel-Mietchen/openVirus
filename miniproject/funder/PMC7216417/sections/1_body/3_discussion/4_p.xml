<p id="Par34">Of the 718 samples that were negative for ZIKV IgM antibodies, 5 samples demonstrated high levels of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies with titers from 1: 320–1: 5120. Additionally, 3 samples were also positive for anti-ZIKV NS1 IgG, 2 of these 3 samples were confirmed by PRNTs with neutralizing antibody titers of 1:1280–1:5120. These results indicate local ZIKV transmission within the healthy community in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. Overall, 9/801 (1.1%) of the ZIKV confirmed case as positive for ZIKV had 5/200 (2.5%) cases collected in Cu Pong village, the same commune with the case of microcephaly cases that we reported in the previous study. In the vicinity at Chu Kbo and Pong Drang villages, only 2/119 (1.68%) and 2/202 (0.99%) positive cases were identified, respectively. This result indicates that the circulation of ZIKV in Central Vietnam is limited in the period of 2 years since the confirmation of nationwide ZIKV outbreak in Vietnam. In comparison with previous reports in Indochina, the ZIKV seroprevalence found in this study is at comparable levels with those of Cambodia [
