<p id="Par32">While the prevalence of anti-ZIKV IgM antibodies was highest in the 46–60 year age group, there were no significant discrepancy in anti-ZIKV IgM seropositivity rates across age groups, indicating that the risk of ZIKV infection is homologous across different age groups. In contrast, a high proportion of participants demonstrated DENV IgG antibodies, with seropositivity increasing with age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These results are consistent with those of other studies, indicating association with longer exposure due to persistent DENV endemicity. While there were high levels of DENV seropositivity (49/83; 59.0%), indicating DENV exposure in the community, the overall seropositive rates for ZIKV remains low (9/801; 1.1%). While low ZIKV seroprevalence, a proxy of protection, indicates vulnerability of the population of the region to the ZIKV epidemic, the results also suggest that DENV may offer limited cross-protection against ZIKV.
