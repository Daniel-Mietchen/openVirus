 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> shows the exploration of parameter values for cross-immunity (
 <italic>ψ</italic>) and infectivity enhancement (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>). Over a wide range of values for 
 <italic>ψ</italic> and 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>, the distribution of the KL information distance for each of the three characteristic features was plotted. On the upper and right side of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> is the area for which KL_DE is less than 3.0. On the corresponding area of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, the mean duration of the epidemics (DE) ranges from 5 to 20 weeks and matches the observed values. On the bottom left corner of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D and 2C</xref> where KL_IEP &lt; 3.0, the mean inter-epidemic period (IEP) ranges from 1.0 to 1.25 years. On the top left corner of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F and 2E</xref> on which KL_AR &lt; 3.0, the attack rate (AR) ranges from 10 to 20%. The overall measure of goodness of fit (KL3) is plotted on 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>. The best fit region is located within a narrow band: 0.5&lt;
 <italic>ψ</italic>&lt;0.75 and 2.4&lt;
 <italic>ϕ</italic> &lt;5.0 on which KL3 is less than 9.0. Within this narrow band, the duration of epidemics (DE) is estimated to range from 15 to 20 weeks; the inter-epidemic period (IEP) ranges from 1.0 to 1.3 years and the attack rate (AR) ranges from 15% to 25%. IEP estimates appear longer than the observed, however, the overall model outputs are a reasonable match to the empirical patterns. Model outputs are much less likely to match the empirical patterns for parameter values on which KL3 &gt; 9.0 (

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref> shows that when cross-immunity is very strong (i.e. &gt;80%), or infectivity enhancement (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) is not strong (i.e., &lt;1.7), the dominant strain cannot change (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]). While for a very weak cross-immunity, the dominant strain changes between epidemics but KL3 is unacceptably high, implying that the model outputs deviate substantially away from the typical observations of seasonal flu.
