<p>Three examples of model output time series are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>. When KL3 is small, the three characteristic features produced by the model match well those of empirical patterns. For the example shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> in which KL3 = 1.7, the output time series has a mean IEP of 51 weeks and a mean DE of 14 weeks, and a mean AR of 18%. Furthermore, the dominant strain changes irregularly between epidemics. A time series with KL3 &lt;9.0 can still resemble the empirical patterns. For the example in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> where KL3 = 4.7: the average IEP was 57 weeks and the average DE was 19 weeks which are both slightly longer than observed. When KL3 &gt;9.0 the model outputs deviate from the observed patterns. For the example in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, the epidemics have a mean IEP of 52 weeks but have a mean DE of 27 weeks, which is unlikely to be true. We therefore use a tentative criterion of KL3 &lt;9.0 to classify the overall goodness of fit: the output infection time series of KL3 &lt;9.0 corresponding to realistic behaviours with appropriate distributions of the three characteristic features.
