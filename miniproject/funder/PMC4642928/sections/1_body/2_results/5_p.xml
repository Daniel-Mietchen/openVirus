 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> explores how the external force of infection (EFOI) and co-transmission rate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>) affect the model outputs. When 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> is weak and EFOI is strong, only endemics with constant incidence are possible (see the small right triangle on the bottom right corner of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). This indicates that a strong constant EFOI will prevent variations in incidence. It is interesting to note how the effect of 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> depends on the value of EFOI. When EFOI is larger than 6.3×10
 <sup>−9</sup> per day, the three strains remain synchronous and there is no trough extinction. This is because, at these high levels of EFOI, there are more than three cases imported per week. When EFOI is smaller than 6.3×10
 <sup>−9</sup>, the infection cannot become extinct when 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> is low; however, as 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> exceeds ½
 <italic>β</italic>, the infection becomes increasingly likely to suffer extinction (

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). On this small range of EFOI, epidemic patterns remain roughly unchanged because the level of EFOI is negligible compared with the average force of infection generated by the indigenous population. Based on the value of KL3 and the probability of extinction (&lt;10%) (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6E</xref>), the best fitting values of 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> are 0.2
 <italic>β</italic>–0.5
 <italic>β</italic> (i.e., 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>

 <italic>ε</italic>) &lt;6.3×10
 <sup>−9</sup> per day under the situation of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. Within this region of model parameter values, model outputs have a mean DE of 10–16 weeks, a mean IEP of 1.0–1.3 years, and a mean AR of 10–25%. These are close to the empirical patterns of seasonal flu. Note that the range of EFOI estimated in this study includes the maximum likelihood estimate obtained by Truscott et al. [
