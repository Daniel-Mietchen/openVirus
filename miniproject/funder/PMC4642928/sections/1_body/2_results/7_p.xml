<p>Finally, we explore the situation that includes seasonal forcing in the transmission rate as described in Eq (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.e009" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>). The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>. The effect of 
 <italic>δ</italic> on KL3 depends on the values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. When 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is large, KL3 will increase monotonically with the relative amplitude 
 <italic>δ</italic>. However, when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is small, KL3 is not clearly associated with the relative amplitude 
 <italic>δ</italic>. As the KL3 values are larger when 
 <italic>δ</italic> &gt;0.3 than that when 
 <italic>δ</italic> &lt;0.3, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref> only displays the situation for 
 <italic>δ</italic> &lt; 0.3. With the inclusion of sufficient seasonal forcing in the transmission rate, the frequency of epidemics is determined by its yearly variation (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8D</xref>; cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). According to our tentative criterion of KL3&lt;9.0, the model outputs from a wide region of model parameters (e.g., 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt;1.7 and low values of 
 <italic>δ</italic>) resemble the typical patterns of seasonal flu. Two regions have KL3 &lt;3.0: one is the region of 
 <italic>δ</italic> ~0.0 and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt;2.2, with 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> ranging from 2.0 to 4.0; the other is the region of 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 7–15% and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 2.0–2.7 with 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> around 1.0 (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). They correspond to two different mechanisms for epidemic cycling that we call for convenience the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanism regions. All these results are obtained under the assumption of the co-transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> = 0.25
 <italic>β</italic>. For the situation of no co-transmission (i.e., 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> = 0), we obtained similar distributions of KL3 and the other characteristic features, except for the required values of 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> increasing to 3.0–5.0 within the intrinsic mechanism region (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). This increase in 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> is in agreement with the results illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> (c.f. Fig 4A of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Within these two regions, the model can well generate the observed infection time series (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8C–8E</xref>); and the dominant strain alternates among the three strains between epidemics (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8E</xref>). This suggests that though seasonal forcing can facilitate the generation of empirical patterns of seasonal flu, co-transmission and infectivity enhancement surely provide another mechanism that can generate the empirical patterns of seasonal influenza.
