 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref> illustrates the effect of strain interactions within concurrent infection on the model outputs. When both 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> are weak (i.e., the bottom left corner), cyclical epidemics cannot occur. As 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> increase to exceed certain threshold values, cyclical or chaotic epidemics will occur (cf., S1 Fig, and Fig 4 of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). When they become very large (i.e., the right top corner), IEP increases to three years or longer (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>) while the DE shortens to 6–9 weeks (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>) and AR exceeds 80% (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Under these circumstances, the infection incidence increases to very high levels within a reduced DE while they fall to very low levels during a long inter-epidemic period so that they can easily become extinct (cf. 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3H Fig</xref>). Between these two extreme regions in the 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>–
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> plane, model outputs resemble reasonably well the empirical patterns of seasonal flu. Within a narrow diagonal band of KL3 &lt;9.0, model outputs are a good resemblance to the observed patterns with a mean DE of 15–18 weeks, a mean IEP of 1.0–1.5 years and a mean AR of 10–20%. Within this band, there is a negative association between 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>, implying a compromise between the two aspects of strain interaction within concurrent infection. Further the dominant strain alternates among the three strains between epidemics when both 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> take values from the band (data not shown).
