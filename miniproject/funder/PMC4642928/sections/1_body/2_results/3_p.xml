<p>In order to identify the best fitting regions of model parameters, the 5-dimensional parameter space of: infectious period (
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>), basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), infectivity enhancement (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>), cross-immunity (
 <italic>ψ</italic>) and immunity period (D) was divided to explore. 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> shows the minima of KL3 and 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B, 4C and 4D</xref> show their corresponding best fitting values of the five parameters. A linear relationship emerges between the best fitting values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and those of 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>I</sub> (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), which indicates a constant transmission rate 
 <italic>β</italic> because of the formula 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 
 <italic>βd</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>. The results show that when 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is within the accepted range 1.5–3.0 [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], the infectious period is more likely to be shorter than 4 days. It is also found that there is a positive association between the best fitting values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and those of the immunity period (
 <italic>D</italic>) (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). A higher transmissibility (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) is compensated for by a longer immunity period which reduces the susceptible proportion of the population, leading to a constant mean attack rate. 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref> also shows that the immunity period (
 <italic>D</italic>) decreases with the infectious period, which is a consequence of both the constancy of the transmission rate (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) and the positive association between 
 <italic>D</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Infectivity enhancement is negatively associated with the infectious period but cross-immunity is positively associated with the infectious period; however, they both appear to be relatively not associated with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). It is worth noting that within the best fitting region (i.e. that of KL3 &lt;9.0 in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), infectivity enhancement 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> ranges from 2 to 7 (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>), the cross-immunity stays within a narrow range: 0.60–0.80 (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>) with its average duration (
 <italic>D</italic>) ranging from 3 to 9 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Within these regions, model outputs have a mean DE of 8–18 weeks, a mean IEP of 0.9–1.2 years, and a mean AR of 5–30%, which are fairly close to the empirical patterns of seasonal influenza. Furthermore, the dominant strain among the three strains alternate between epidemics within the best fitting model parameters (data not shown). Within the bottom right corner of 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref> where strains are of low 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> but long 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>, the fit of the model is poor: cross-immunity is very strong and the dominant strain does not change between epidemics (cf. 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Fixing at other alternative values of both co-transmission rate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>) and external force of infection (
 <italic>ε</italic>), similar explorations in the 5-dimension parameter space suggest the above observations still hold over a wide region of model parameters 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> and 
 <italic>ε</italic> (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).
