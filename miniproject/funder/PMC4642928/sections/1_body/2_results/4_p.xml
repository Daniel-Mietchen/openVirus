 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> illustrates the model fit (KL3) as a function of the basic reproductive number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) and the immunity period (
 <italic>D</italic>). The best fitting values suggest that a low transmissibility is compensated by a low immunity period (
 <italic>D</italic>: 2–4 years), while a high transmissibility is associated with a wide range of immunity period (3.0&lt;
 <italic>D</italic>&lt;10.0 years), as also shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. Both DE and IEP decrease with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, but increase with 
 <italic>D</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). AR is relatively insensitive to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> but decreases with 
 <italic>D</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> shows that the model behaves well (with the tentative criterion of KL3 &lt;9.0) in a broad triangular parameter area: 1.8&lt; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt;4.0 and 2&lt; 
 <italic>D</italic> &lt; 9 years. Within these parameter areas, DE ranges from 7–15 weeks, IEP from 0.8–1.3 years, and AR from 10–30%. And the dominant strain alternates between the three strains. That is, model epidemics on these parameter regions resemble the observed patterns.
