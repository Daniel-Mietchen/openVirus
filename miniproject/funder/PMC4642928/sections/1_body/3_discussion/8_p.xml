<p>For simplicity, we have ignored the heterogeneity among age groups. However, Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] identified age-structure as a necessary factor for recreating the patterns seen in time series of seasonal flu. Both Fig 5 of this study and Fig 3 of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] explore the model behaviour as a function of transmissibility and duration of immunity. But the best fits are quite different: in [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] the best fit region is located in a narrow diagonal band while in this study it is located in a broad triangle. The former shows a highly restrictive relationship between transmissibility and duration of immunity while the latter suggests a weak relationship. These discrepancies may result from different assumptions made about age-structure and seasonal forcing in these models. Age-structure allows for examinations of the impact of non-random mixing patterns and heterogeneity in the infectivity and the susceptibility of different age groups. Inclusion of such heterogeneity will surely improve our model. Further we assume the same epidemiological characteristics for each of the three strains in our model (i.e. that the three strains are phenotypically indistinguishable). This is surely a simplification of the truth as the epidemiological characters of influenza A and B are different. A deterministic model was used to describe influenza epidemics over a long term in spite of there being evidence for strong stochastic behaviour during the inter-epidemic periods. To reflect the antigenic drift within each strain (lineage), infection-induced immunity is assumed to wane, as a result of immune escapement and loss, and each strain was regarded as a constant biological identity. In this study, the same waning rate of immunity (equivalent to the rate of antigenic drift) is assumed for each strain. A recent comprehensive study [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] of strains co-circulating in the human population shows that the rates of antigenic drift are different among them with A/H3N2 the fastest and B strain the slowest. Heterogeneity in the intrinsic factors of strains and the stochastic nature of the transmission process will also make the model more realistic [
