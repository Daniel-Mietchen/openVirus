<p>It is interesting to compare our model with other extrinsic models for epidemic cycles in both incidence and strain. Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that in an age-structured population and when there are two strains that are affected by seasonal forcing, a weak cross-immunity (0.3–0.5) is necessary to recreate observed patterns in flu time-series data. Koelle et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] examined a two strain cholera model using an estimate of the time varying reproductive rate and found that the observed serotype cycles in cholera epidemics can be explained when the cross-immunity exceeds 95%. White et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] also examined a two strain SIRS model for transmission dynamics of groups A and B human respiratory syncytial virus in England &amp; Wales and Finland. They found that the change in the dominant group can be explained by a 65% reduction in the susceptibility to (and the infectiousness of) secondary homologous infections and a 16% reduction in the susceptibility to (and the infectiousness of) secondary heterologous infections. These models consider seasonal forcing and cross-immunity, but don’t include the strain interactions within concurrent infection. These models require a relatively high level of relative amplitude in seasonal forcing to explain the empirical patterns in seasonal flu (about 15–30%), in cholera (about 30%) and in respiratory syncytial virus infection in humans (about 35% for Finland and about 82% for England &amp; Wales). Nevertheless, the basic understanding of those studies is that recurrent epidemics are induced by seasonal forcing while alternation in the dominant strain between epidemics is due to the negative association created by cross-immunity. Our model, which includes strain interactions within concurrent infection but ignores seasonal forcing, can also explain the empirical patterns seen in seasonal flu when cross-immunity is 50–80%. When relaxing the assumption of a constant transmission rate, the relative amplitude in seasonal forcing required in our model (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) is 7–14%, which is lower than that required in [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
