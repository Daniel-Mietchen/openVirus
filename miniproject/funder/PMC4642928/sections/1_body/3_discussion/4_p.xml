<p>The crucial question arising from our modelling study is: what are the magnitudes of the co-transmission rate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>) and the infectivity enhancement (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) required to produce the observed patterns of seasonal influenza? Following Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the typical seasonal influenza epidemic was assumed to have an outbreak duration of 11 weeks and an annual attack rate of 15% and an epidemic period of one year. The Kullback-Leibler information distance between predicted and empirical epidemics was used to find model parameters that generated the typical patterns observed. The best fitting values for 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> may appear a bit high as shown here in the SIRS epidemic model of three strains. In the situation of 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> = 0, for example, the required value for 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> could be greater than 3.0. However, Zhang and Cao [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] show that the requirement reduces when the number of co-circulating strains increases. This implies that under the circumstance of a large number of co-circulating strains the empirical patterns of seasonal flu can be recreated even if infectivity enhancement is not strong (i.e., 
 <italic>ϕ ~</italic>1) (see Fig 4A of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). If defining different strains by different genotypes (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]), there are a large number of strains. Even if we define strains by their serological characteristics, the number of different influenza virus strains should be much larger than three [
