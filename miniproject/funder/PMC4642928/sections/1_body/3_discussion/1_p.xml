<p>The most obvious explanation for seasonal patterns of influenza is the variation in transmission rate caused by yearly environmental changes. In this study, we show an alternative mechanism for it. Our investigations show that the combination of both cross-immunity during sequential infection and infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection can generate the empirical patterns of both the periodic incidence and the alternation of the dominant strain in seasonal influenza. Within the accepted ranges of other transmission parameters, our model outputs closely resemble the empirical patterns of epidemic cycling when cross-immunity ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 and both co-transmission rate and infectivity enhancement are at intermediate levels.</p>
