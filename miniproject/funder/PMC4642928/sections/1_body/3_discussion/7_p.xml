<p>Recker et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] considered a four strain SIR model by decomposing the antibody dependent enhancement during sequential infection into two aspects: increased susceptibility to secondary infections and increased transmissibility from individuals suffering secondary infections. They showed that both the observed temporal patterns and the replacement in the dominant serotype of dengue can be reproduced without the need for extrinsic factors such as seasonal forcing or stochasticity. Hence it was suggested that it is the enhancement in both susceptibility and transmission during the sequential infection that induces irregular patterns of dengue. Nevertheless, this mechanism does not rule out cross-immunity which could be a contributing factor for the asynchronicity of strains [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Recker et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] did not include in their model the existence of concurrent infection and any strain interactions within it. However, both Recker et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and our study demonstrate that in the absence of seasonal forcing, at least two different types of strain interaction are required to generate epidemic cycling. Antigenically diverse pathogens are common and they are a big challenge for modern medicine. Co-circulations of different strains of other multi-strain pathogens have been observed (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]); concurrent infection and hence strain interactions within it are also possible (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]). The current lack of evidence for them may be due to our lack of intention or tool to search for them. This study shows that the key mechanism for the existence of epidemic cycling may lie in interactions between strains within concurrent infection and during sequential infection. Therefore, the intrinsic mechanism we show here for seasonal flu may also apply to other infectious diseases caused by antigenically diverse pathogens.
