<p>To test which mechanism is more likely, extrinsic or intrinsic, a seasonal variation in the transmission rate was introduced into the model (see Eq (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.e009" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>)). Model fitting exercises show two best fitting regions (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>, also 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>), which suggests two possible mechanisms for epidemic cycling. The intrinsic mechanism region is the long band having the relative amplitude 
 <italic>δ</italic> ≈0 but requiring infectivity enhancement; the extrinsic mechanism region is the round island which includes seasonal forcing but requires no infectivity enhancement. As far as the combined Kullback-Leibler information distance is concerned, it is not possible to distinguish which mechanism is better or more parsimonious.
