Although the cross-immunity during sequential infection is well known, proof for the existence of interactions between strains within concurrent infection is lacking. To our knowledge, there are some observations and theoretical reasoning for their existence [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and some indirect measurements of their possible values [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In this study we explore an alternative explanation for both periodicities in incidence and alternation of the dominant strain based on strain interactions. Non-linear models with enhanced transmissibility are well known for generating complex bifurcation structure and periodic behaviour [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In this study we concentrate on the cyclical behaviours by skipping the complex bifurcation details. We simply estimate the pattern of the time series by averaging over a long period (1000 epidemics after a burn-in period of 20000 years). We noticed that when both co-transmission rate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>) and infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) are low, only endemics with constant incidence will be generated (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). In the absence of co-transmission, generating the empirical patterns of seasonal flu requires a moderate value of infectivity enhancement 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> (about 3 in the situation illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). With the presence of co-transmission, the requirement for 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> is reduced further. That is, infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection could be compensated by co-transmission to produce the empirical patterns (also see Fig 4A of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).
