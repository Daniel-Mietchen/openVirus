<p>Cross-immunity during sequential infection has been widely recognised in multi-strain transmission models (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]) while the possible infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection has only recently been noticed [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These strain interactions might collectively provide an explanation for the periodicity in incidence and alternation of the dominant strain in seasonal influenza. Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] proposed a two strain SIRS epidemic model that allows for age and includes cross-immunity and seasonal forcing. They can almost generate the observed patterns of seasonal influenza: dominant strain alternation in successive years is due to a negative association between strains which is generated by cross-immunity; and incidence periodicity is due to seasonal forcing and variation between age groups of the contact rate, infectivity and susceptibility. However, the reports of seasonal influenza usually include three strains (i.e. type B, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and the alternation of dominant strains is not as regular as Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] predicted (i.e., [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]).
