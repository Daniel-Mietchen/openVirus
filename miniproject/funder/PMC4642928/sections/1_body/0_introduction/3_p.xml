<p>Nevertheless, infectivity enhancement was observed following a deliberate infection of another strain to previously infected animals (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). A vaccine effectiveness analysis indicates that vaccination can increase the susceptibility to other strains if the vaccine strain mismatches the circulated strains, which occurs in 26% of their study period of 33 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Tsuchihashi et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] showed that seasonal influenza vaccination might increase susceptibility to A(H1N1) pdm09. Skowronski et al (2013) [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] pointed out that H7N9 infection age profile in China 2013 that was skewed to the older side might hint the phenomenon of cross-reacting antibodies that facilitate infections. Furthermore, Dutry et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] demonstrated that prior addition of human serum to the inoculum trigged a 2â€“5 fold increase in infected cells. This is thought to occur when low-levels of different but similar antibodies are cross-reactive but not cross protective. When antibodies generated by past exposure to virus antigen form bridging complexes they facilitate uptake and replication of related but non-identical variants of themselves [
