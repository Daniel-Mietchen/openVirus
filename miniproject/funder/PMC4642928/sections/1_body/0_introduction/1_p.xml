<p>The incidence of many infectious diseases varies periodically: for example, seasonal influenza develops as an epidemic during winter in temperate regions but remains at very low levels during summer. Furthermore, in infectious diseases caused by multi-strain pathogens such as viral aseptic meningitis [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], cholera [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], dengue [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and rotavirus [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the dominant strain can also alternate between epidemics although the frequency of alternation is lower than the frequency of epidemics. For convenience, in this study we define ‘epidemic cycling’ as a combination of both periodicities in incidence and alternation of the dominant strain to reflect that successive epidemics is often accompanied by dominant strain alternation (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Despite the common nature of epidemic cycling, their underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Several external mechanisms have been suggested by others for periodicity in infection incidence: e.g., survival of disease pathogen outside host; host behaviour and seasonal changes in host susceptibility and immune defence [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These mechanisms can be expressed as seasonal dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] caused by the ‘seasonal forcing’ in the transmission rate [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, they have difficulty in explaining, for example, a fast and wide spread of influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many human infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that have multiple strains that differ antigenically. And coinfection with different strains is also a common occurrence. This suggests that interactions between strains might play some role in the formation of seasonality [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In fact, Grassly et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that it is the intrinsic factors (e.g., immunity), rather than external factors (e.g., changes in human sexual behaviours), that causes an 8–11 year cycle in syphilis incidence. Interactions among different types and subtypes of influenza virus surely play some role in determining the cyclical pattern of incidence and the replacement of the dominant strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, A/H1N1 pdm09 strain emerged in 2009 to cause the 2009 pandemic influenza and displaced the A/H1N1/77 strain which circulated before 2009; while A/H3N2 still circulated [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These phenomena could not be due to external factors such as environmental variations and host behaviour changes alone. Therefore traditional seasonal dynamics cannot explain what we call epidemic cycling. Others have suggested that strain interactions such as cross-protective immunity may be responsible for the replacement and cycle of strains (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). In this study, we consider seasonal influenza as an example and show how strain interactions alone can generate the observed patterns of total and strain-specific incidence of seasonal influenza epidemics.
