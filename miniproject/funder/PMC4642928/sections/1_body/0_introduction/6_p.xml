<p>In this study seasonal influenza epidemics are modelled via a three strain SIRS model. It is worth mentioning that small changes in the three routinely reported strains occur continuously due to frequent antigenic drift caused by mutation in the viral genome. Immunity built through primary infection will wane either because of immune loss within the human body or immune escapement due to changes in the strains. To approximate these complications, the model assumes a constant biological identity for each strain but allows for a waning immunity. Novel influenza virus strains can also be generated due to antigenic shift via reassortment, which could cause pandemic influenza. Because antigenic shift is much rarer than antigenic drift, it is ignored in this study. The emergence of pandemic influenza due to reassortment was discussed in a previous study [
