<p>Within this model two types of strain interaction are assumed: (a) the immunity due to a past infection of a different strain (referred to as “cross-immunity”); and (b) the greater infectivity of an individual who is simultaneously infected with more than one strain (referred to here as “enhanced infectivity within concurrent infection”) (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Strain interaction within concurrent infection can induce the periodic epidemics; however, strains become synchronized if cross-immunity is sufficiently strong (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Like Truscott et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], we assumed that seasonal influenza was typically characterised by an outbreak duration of 11 weeks and an annual attack rate of 15% and an epidemic period of one year. The possible range for model parameters was determined by using the Kullback-Leibler information distance, which is based on a comparison between the predicted epidemics and the observed epidemics of seasonal influenza. In addition the replacement of the dominant strain was used as another criterion for the goodness of fit. The model we propose here includes two different types of parameter. One type is used to describe the traditional transmission characteristics such as the transmission rate, the infectious period and the immunity period; the second type is used to represent strain interactions such as co-transmissibility, infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection and cross-immunity during sequential infection. The purpose of the model fitting exercise is to show whether the model proposed here can explain the typical patterns of seasonal influenza under the widely accepted values of transmission characteristics and reasonable ranges of strain interaction parameters.
