<p>Seasonal influenza causes approximately 250,000â€“500,000 deaths globally each year [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying the annual behaviour of influenza infection are crucial for forecasting and planning for seasonal influenza epidemics. Seasonal influenza epidemics are usually caused by influenza B virus and/or one of two influenza A subtypes: A/H3N2 and A/H1N1. Influenza viruses A and B are very similar in overall structure with eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments and only matrix genes differing somewhat between them. The targets of antibodies are two major surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which allows for the similarity of possible immunity between types and that between subtypes of type A [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For simplicity, type or subtype is in this article roughly referred to as "strain" in view of their similar dynamical behaviours although their biological details are different (c.f. [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Detailed studies illustrate that the dominant strain in seasonal influenza cycles irregularly among years [

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Strains interact by the means of changing human susceptibility and strain infectivity. For example, cross-immunity induced by previous infection protects against subsequent infection [
