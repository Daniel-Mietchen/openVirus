<p>Under the circumstance of no seasonal forcing (i.e., 
 <italic>δ</italic> = 0) and weak infectivity enhancement (e.g., 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> &lt;1.5 in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), only endemics with constant incidence where the number of new infections is balanced by the number of recoveries are possible. When the infectivity enhancement exceeds a certain threshold 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> (i.e., 1.7 by assuming the baseline values for other model parameters) the endemics bifurcate into cyclical (recurrent) epidemics. However, as 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> further increases, the cyclical epidemics burst into chaotic epidemics (
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). When the cross-immunity is very strong (i.e., 
 <italic>ψ</italic> &gt;80%) only cyclical epidemics are possible as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>. With an increased co-transmissibility (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>), the threshold infectivity enhancement 
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> reduces (cf. Fig 4A of [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). This implies that both infectivity enhancement and co-transmission complement each other to sustain cyclical epidemics. We notice that when the periodic epidemics are regular, the goodness of fit is not as good as for chaotic epidemics (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E Fig</xref>). Clearly the three characteristics of the seasonal flu patterns (i.e., DE, AR and IEP) vary between epidemics when they are chaotic or aperiodic (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B–S2D Fig</xref>) as observed in influenza surveillance [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the following we judge the model output by the combined KL information distance (KL3).
