<p>Strain interactions are characterised by three parameters: co-transmission rate (
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub>), coefficient of infectivity enhancement within concurrent infection (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>) and cross-immunity during sequential infection (
 <italic>ψ</italic>). It is worth mentioning that because the infectivity enhancement 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> only directly benefits the transmission of single strains the relative prevalence of concurrent infection (
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub>) is mainly determined by 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> rather than 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> as illustrated in

 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore the low number of reported concurrent infections (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0142170.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) should not simply be regarded as a fact for rejecting the infectivity enhancement of single strains which we assumed in this study.
