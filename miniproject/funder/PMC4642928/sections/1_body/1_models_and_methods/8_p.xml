<p>We define a strain as the dominant strain if the fraction of infections with that strain exceeds 50% during an epidemic. Under the situation of synchronous strains, the three strains have the same share of the total infection at any time. With asynchronised strains the fraction of infections of each strain varies between epidemics. This fraction does not necessarily exceed 50% and therefore there is not necessarily any dominant strain. It is obvious that within the three strain system, the requirement for the alternation of dominant strains is stronger than the emergence of asynchronous strains, which is clearly illustrated in
