A) Duration of epidemics (DE) in weeks; B) Goodness of fit as measured by the KL information distance of duration of epidemics (KL_DE); C) Inter-epidemic period in years; D) Goodness of fit as measured by the KL information distance of inter-epidemic period (KL_IEP); E) Attack rate; F) Goodness of fit as measured by the KL information distance of attack rate (KL_AR); G) the overall goodness of fit to the three characteristics (KL3); H) alternation of the dominant strain (the yellow area represents the model parameter region where only endemics with constant incidence are available).
