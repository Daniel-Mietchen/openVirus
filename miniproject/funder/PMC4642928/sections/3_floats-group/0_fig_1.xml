  <title>Flow chart of the three-strain SIRS epidemic model.</title>
  <p>Solid arrows indicate transitions. Expressions next to arrows show the 
   <italic>per capita</italic> flow rate between compartments. Births and deaths, and transitions from the recovered to the susceptible are not shown. Variables and parameters are explained in Tables 
   <xref rid="pone.0142170.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
   <xref rid="pone.0142170.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Triple infection is ignored by assuming that, once infected with two strains (either concurrent or sequential), no one can be infected by the third strain.
