  <p>The blue lines show the total case incidence, the red lines the annual attack rate and the bottom bar plot shows the fractions of the three strains (represented by three different colours). The dashed blue straight line represents the threshold level of 42 cases per 100000 person-days for defining an epidemic. Other parameters are as baseline values in
