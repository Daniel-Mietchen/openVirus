<p>However, the limited reliability of the data (for example, some infections require nucleic acid testing a minimum of two times (on two days), which results in biased data) may affect the analysis result. As a result of the limitation of the methods, we only discussed a few characteristics or patterns. Other characteristics that can be analyzed in depth include a short-term trend or turning points (which cannot be identified using the nonparametric tests used in this study), as well as the future risk in different areas. Additionally, descriptive and nonparametric methods can only detect spatio-temporal patterns. More reliable and quantitative methods need further exploration. For example, spatial regression models, such as geographically weighted regression [
