<p>For spatial patterns, spatial clusters with high incidence rates were detected during the whole study period. These areas are concentrated around Wuhan and also belong to the Wuhan Metropolitan Area or Greater Wuhan. As the political, economic, financial, cultural, educational, and transportation center of Greater Wuhan, a large population flow resulted in the high risk in Greater Wuhan. Spatial outliers were also discovered in two areas, i.e., Jingzhou and Tuanfeng, with a high–low outlier, and a low–high outlier, respectively. Because of spatio-temporal variation of daily new confirmed cases, spatial outliers did not appear during the whole period. Therefore, timely control of regional population flows would be beneficial to prevent a regional outbreak of disease.</p>
