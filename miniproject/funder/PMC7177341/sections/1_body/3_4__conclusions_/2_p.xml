<p>Regarding temporal patterns, most areas during the study period did not show significant characteristics of trend or abrupt change. Nevertheless, 11 areas with different types of patterns were detected, and these areas with increasing trend characteristics, included ITAC and ITNO patterns, are characterized by spatial aggregation. Notably, we found that the main reason for the abrupt change was the improvement of the nucleic acid examination capabilities when the number of suspected cases exceeded the detection capacity. Therefore, enhancing the capability to diagnose infections helps control the epidemic; otherwise, isolating the suspected patients is also an effective control measure.</p>
