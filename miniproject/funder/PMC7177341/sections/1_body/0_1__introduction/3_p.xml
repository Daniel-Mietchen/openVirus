<p>As a result, this research aims to detect spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic by using spatio-temporal analysis methods, namely, nonparametric statistical tests implemented by Python and spatial autocorrelation indexes implemented in ArcGIS 10.2. Additionally, considering that apart from Wuhan, where the epidemic first arose, other areas inside the Hubei were also severely affected, we focus on spatio-temporal patterns at the county level in Hubei province. The structure of the article is organized as follows: 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-ijerph-17-02563">Section 2</xref> describes the study area, datasets, and methods; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-17-02563">Section 3</xref> presents and discusses the results of the identified spatio-temporal patterns and the possible reasons; then, 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijerph-17-02563">Section 4</xref> provides a summary of our work and details future work.
