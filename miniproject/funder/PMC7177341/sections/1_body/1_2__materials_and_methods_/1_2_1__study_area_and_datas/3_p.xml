<p>We only considered the dataset from January 26 to February 11 for the current study. This is because from February 12, the criteria for confirmed cases, in Hubei, was changed by adding clinically diagnosed cases that show signs of pneumonia in the lungs of patients based on a computerized tomographic scan. The 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases on February 12 were added to the total number of daily new confirmed cases, which was far higher than those on February 11 (1638). The change in criteria would result in variations in spatio-temporal patterns for most areas. </p>
