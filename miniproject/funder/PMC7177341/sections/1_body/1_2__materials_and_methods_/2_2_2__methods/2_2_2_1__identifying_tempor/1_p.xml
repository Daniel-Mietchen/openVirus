<p>As mentioned earlier, the temporal patterns of daily new confirmed cases were determined by two characteristics: temporal trend and abrupt change. A temporal trend is a continued increase or decrease in the time series of the number of daily new confirmed cases that can describe the epidemical risk for a given period. Generally, the trend changes smoothly or regularly and can be seen from the commonly used epidemic models [

However, owing to the interference of specific events (such as large-scale vaccination and isolating suspected cases), an abrupt change in the time series of daily new confirmed cases may occur. Therefore, based on the level of significance of these trends (i.e., increasing or decreasing trends) and significant abrupt change, six types of temporal patterns can be defined (see 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-02563-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The ITAC pattern has an Increasing Trend and an Abrupt Change, while the ITNO pattern has an Increasing Trend only, and the DTAC pattern has a Decreasing Trend and an Abrupt Change. Moreover, the DTNO pattern has a Decreasing Trend only, while the NOAC pattern has Abrupt Change only, and the NONO pattern has none of these two characteristics.
