 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-02563-f002">Figure 2</xref>, this research aims to discover the spatio-temporal patterns of the 2019-nCoV epidemic from two aspects, i.e., temporal and spatial patterns. The temporal pattern, i.e., of daily new confirmed cases per county, is defined based on the characteristics of the temporal trend and abrupt change. In contrast, spatial patterns, i.e., of the incidence rate per county per day, include spatial outliers and clusters. Two types of spatio-temporal analysis methods, namely, nonparametric statistical methods and geographical analysis methods, were used to achieve the above aim. Specifically, Mann–Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to test the temporal trend and abrupt changes in a time series of daily new confirmed cases, respectively. The local Moran’s I index was applied to identify spatial outliers and clusters. A brief introduction to the above methods is given in the following subsection.
