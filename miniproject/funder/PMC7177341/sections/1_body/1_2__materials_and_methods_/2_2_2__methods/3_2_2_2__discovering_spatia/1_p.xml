<p>Moran’s I index is a measure of spatial autocorrelation or dependency that can be used to explore the spatial structure of infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-02563" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-02563" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-02563" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Autocorrelation always shows significant local variations because of spatial heterogeneity in spatial or epidemical data. Consequently, local Moran’s I index was used to explore the local spatial autocorrelation or dependency of the spatial data [
