<p>These four types of spatial patterns can reveal the spatial structure of the incidence rate of the epidemic in the study area. Specifically, an HH (LL) cluster indicates several adjacent areas with a relatively high (low) value of incidence rate of the epidemic, which can reveal a high (low) risk of epidemic in these areas. An HL (LH) outlier means a high (low) value surrounded primarily by low (high) values of incidence rate, which may be caused by a unique mechanism [
