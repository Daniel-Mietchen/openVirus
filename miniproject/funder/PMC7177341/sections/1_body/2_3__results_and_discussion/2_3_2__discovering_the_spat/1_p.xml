<p>The incidence rate of all areas at the county level was calculated based on the population data and the total number of infections. To obtain the evolution process, local Moranâ€™s I indices for each day during the period (January 26 to February 11) were calculated using ArcGIS 10.2. The spatial weight, in Equation (8), was computed based on the edge contiguity of these areas, i.e., 
 <italic>w
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> is equal to 1 if there is a shared edge between two areas 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>, and otherwise, 
 <italic>w
  <sub>ij</sub>
 </italic> is equal to 0. Further, on the basis of the statistical value at the confidence level of 0.05, spatial patterns of the incidence rate were identified (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-02563-f005">Figure 5</xref>, it can be found that this study discovered only three from the dataset, namely, HH clusters, HL outliers, and LH outliers. The proportion of HH clusters among all identified patterns was the highest, i.e., mainly around Wuhan, followed by HL clusters.
