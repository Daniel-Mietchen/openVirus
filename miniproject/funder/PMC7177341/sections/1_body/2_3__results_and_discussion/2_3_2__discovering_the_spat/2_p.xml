<p>Notably, on January 26, the areas, including Wuhan and Huanggang, where the incidence rates were 0.071‰ and 0.361‰, respectively, were first detected as HH clusters. Although the total number of infections in Wuhan was more significant than in Huanggang, the population of Huanggang is much smaller than that of Wuhan. Thus, this resulted in a higher incidence rate. Subsequently, with the increase of confirmed cases in each area, the incidence rate also increased. The areas near Wuhan and Huanggang, such as Xiaogan (January 27), Ezhou (January 27), Huangshi (January 28), Hanchuan (February 5), Hongan (February 8), and Tuanfeng (February 11), were recognized successively as an element of the HH cluster. As mentioned above, all these areas near Wuhan received most of the population departing from Wuhan, which led to high incidence rates.</p>
