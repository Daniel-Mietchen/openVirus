<p>All the LH outliers appeared in Tuanfeng on January 26, and from January 29 to February 3. Tuanfeng, with a low number of infections (i.e., less than 5), shows an outlier characteristic because it was near the HH cluster before February 3. However, from February 3 to February 11, the total number of infections increased from 50 to 117; the high incidence rate resulted in the HH cluster due to proximity. Similarly, Jinzhou was identified as a unique area with the HL outlier from January 31 to February 7. During this period, the number of confirmed cases increased from 149 to 312, which is significantly higher than the surrounding area, thus leading to an HL outlier.</p>
