<p>For these areas with DTAC or DTNO, decreasing trends imply that the epidemic was almost under control. All the remaining areas had NONO, which indicates that the daily new confirmed cases in most of these areas generally fluctuated in a particular range and thus did not have significant abrupt change points. Moreover, it can be deduced that a short-time trend, in this study, cannot be identified because the Mâ€“K test can only investigate a monotonous global trend over the entire study period. Thus, this was the limitation of the study. For instance, although the daily new confirmed cases of Yunmeng exhibit an increasing trend (see
