<p>The change in the curve in the areas with the ITAC or ITNO pattern is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-02563-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The abrupt change date of daily new confirmed cases in Wuhan was February 3. Before this day, the number of daily new confirmed cases was approximately 400 to 1,000, and after this day, the numbers fluctuate around 1750. One possible reason is that the number of infected cases was still increasing. However, a more important reason is that on February 2, as a result of the insufficient diagnostic resources, there were lots of suspected cases that had not yet been confirmed. The local government emphasized that they must enhance the ability to examine the infection by several measures, such as providing full payment to third-party examiners, simplification of the examination process, and strengthening the quality of sample allocation and inspection. The abrupt change in Ezhou, on February 7, can be attributed to similar factors to those mentioned above, namely, the improvement of the ability of the medical service. Ezhou was one of the most severely affected areas, and the lack of medical workers greatly affected diagnosis and treatment. On account of this, on February 4, a proposal published by the local disease command invited the retired, resigned, and independent medical workers to return to work. Meanwhile, a medical team from Peking University International Hospital arrived in Ezhou to participate in disease control on February 7.
