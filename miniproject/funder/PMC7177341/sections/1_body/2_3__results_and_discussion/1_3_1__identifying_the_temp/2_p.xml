<p>Almost all the areas (except Zaoyang) that showed increasing trends (including ITAC and ITNO patterns) are distributed near Wuhan. After confirming that the 2019-nCoV epidemic could spread among people, Wuhan was sealed in an emergency to control the transmission of infections from January 23, 2020. Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, is situated in east-central Hubei and constitutes over a fifth of the provinceâ€™s population. It is recognized as the political, economic, financial, cultural, educational, and transportation center of central China.

Because of the incubation period of 0 to 14 days and the mean period of 6.4 days [

Most of the surrounding areas had to face the difficulty of an increasing trend of daily new confirmed cases. Compared to areas showing increasing trends, the areas with decreasing trends (i.e., DTAC and DTNO) were randomly distributed.
