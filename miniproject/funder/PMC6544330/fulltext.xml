All the currently known HV genotypes can cause HFRS, including Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava/Belgrade virus (DOBV/BGDV)[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In China, most cases are caused by two HV genotypes, HTNV and SEOV, which are mainly carried by the rodents <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, respectively.</p><p>According to previous studies, over 90% of all cases of HFRS in the world have occurred in China in recent decades[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the harm caused by HFRS in humans has declined in recent years due to the development of preventive measures and medical capabilities, HFRS is still a serious public health threat in China today. Shandong Province, which has the second largest population among all the provinces in China, has been suffering from a large HFRS burden for several decades. In the past decade, Shandong Province remained in the top five of all provinces in China regarding the number of HFRS cases[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Changes in the epidemic foci (areas in which some wild animals have a long-term preservation of infectious pathogen) of infectious diseases are caused by many factors, including natural, human and viral host factors[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent years, Shandong Province developed an <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic>-dominated mixed viral genotypes epidemic focus. However, the characteristics of the HFRS epidemic foci in Shandong Province have been constantly changing, and the health threat to humans has been constantly changing as well. Adjustments to policies and practices should be performed in a timely manner. However, although many studies have analyzed the HFRS epidemic situation in Shandong Province[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we do not have a comprehensive and clear understanding of the current epidemic foci of HFRS. For this reason, we conducted a systematic analysis of surveillance information on HFRS in Shandong Province from 2012 to 2015 to assess the severity of the situation and determine the new epidemic foci in Shandong Province.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board, Science and Technology Supervisory Committee at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.

Based on historical HFRS surveillance data from Shandong Province, 14 representative counties with serious epidemics were selected as the surveillance sites in this study. The 14 surveillance sites including 4 fixed surveillance sites mandated by Shandong Provincial CDC and 10 flexible surveillance sites set up in this study.

In Shandong Province, HFRS case peaked in the mid-1980s, then declined gradually and then became stable[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Based on the 2012&#x02013;2015 HFRS data from Shandong Province, the characteristics of the disease, virus host and laboratory testing were analyzed in this study, and the nature and characteristics of current epidemic foci were identified.</p><p>Overall, the annual HFRS incidence rate exhibited small fluctuations during the study period, peaking in 2013, then decreasing year by year, and reaching its lowest point in 2015. There were still annual incidence peaks, which comprised a small peak in late spring to early summer and a big peak in autumn to winter. The small peak is associated with indoor-related infections linked to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> breeding activity, while the big peak is mainly due to the increased contact between people and wild rats when they work in fields, and the migration of wild rats from fields to residential areas for foraging in the later period[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that 88% of all deaths occurred in September to January. Previous studies have suggested that the clinical symptoms of HFRS caused by HTNV are often more serious than those caused by SEOV[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Additionally, human immunity decreases in autumn and winter when it is cold. Therefore, the deaths may be the result of a combination of HTNV and seasonal factors. Additionally, male farmers represented the biggest HV-susceptible population because of their increased contact with rodents due to working in the fields and poor residential sanitation conditions[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Therefore, HFRS prevention and control in Shandong Province should continue to be focused on controlling the rodents&#x02019; population and strengthening the immunization and education interventions for farmers in key epidemic foci. To reduce the mortality rate, we should also pay more attention to the treatment of cases occurring in autumn and winter.</p><p>We found that although the HV carriage rate among rodents was lower in southeastern Shandong Province than in central Shandong Province, the epidemic situation and clinical symptoms of cases were worse. This suggests that more attention should be paid and more interventions should be undertaken in the southeastern region. Additionally, the proportion of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> carrying HV is very low in this study and other researches. Therefore, determining whether <italic>Mus musculus</italic> can carry HV normally and pass on the infection to humans should be a key task of future research.[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>HTNV and SEOV were still the main HV genotypes in Shandong Province. Although we inferred the patient's situation according to the HV genotype from rodents, studies have shown that HV isolated from patient's serum in Shandong Province was associated with local dominated rodent species. For example, the serum test results of Zhaoyuan patients showed that the area belongs to <italic>Apodemus</italic>-type epidemic focus, while Jining, Zibo, Weifang belong to <italic>Rattus</italic>-type epidemic foci. These conclusions are consistent with this study[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. But two points are worth noting. First, we obtained HTNV from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> captured in the wild, indicating that HTNV from <italic>A</italic>. <italic>agrarius</italic> spilled over to <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic>. Previous studies also showed that some HV obtained from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> seemed to be HTNV[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, each HV genotype is associated primarily with a specific rodent host species that it coevolved with[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The phenomenon of viruses spilling over to non-traditional specific rodent hosts can allow them to find more suitable surroundings for a higher survival rate and more efficient infection and replication[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Huangdao is one of the most serious HFRS epidemic foci, which is located in southeastern Shandong. This phenomenon may promote the epidemic situation in this region. It is perhaps one of the reasons for migration of geographic boundaries of HFRS endemic areas. Second, we found two novel strains obtained from <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City and they were closely related to strains from northeastern China, which reportedly belong to the VLAV genotype. This phenomenon of potential VLAV strains in Shandong Province has not previously been reported. Therefore, determining whether the viruses were transmitted from northeastern China, or simply involve indigenous genetic mutations, requires further research.</p><p>In the 1970s, HFRS was in completely <italic>Apodemus</italic>-type natural focal state in Shandong. Then the <italic>Apodemus</italic>-type focus in the southeastern part of Linyi and the <italic>Rattus</italic>-type focus in the southern part of Jining began to expand and merge with each other, and formed two foci in the 1980s, one mixed focus dominated by <italic>Apodemus</italic>-type in the hilly area of the southern and middle part of Shandong, another one dominated by the <italic>Rattus</italic>-type in the Yellow River valley of the northwestern part of Shandong. In the 1990s, Shandong Province formed a mixed focus dominated by <italic>Rattus</italic>-type, and entered a stable stage[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The results of Liu and Fang showed that the epidemic focus of HFRS in Shandong Province before this study was mainly concentrated in the northern part of Linyi in southeastern Shandong Province with a dominance of spring peak of incidence[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The whole landscape of Shandong Province became a uniform mixed HTN-type and SEO-type endemic focus with dominant rodents <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. However, the current epidemic foci of HFRS in Shandong Province shows changes both in its distribution and the composition of the HV host. In terms of the temporal distribution, the influence of Region a, which involved an <italic>A</italic>. <italic>agrarius</italic>-dominated mixed-type epidemic focus, on HFRS epidemic situation in Shandong Province mainly occurred in the autumn and winter. The coverage of Region a was more extensive than the coverage of Regions b and c, and the epidemic situation was also more serious. We inferred from previous studies that Region a is derived from the epidemic foci previously centered on Linyi City. Conversely, Regions b and c were more similar, involving <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus-</italic>dominated mixed-type epidemic foci. In Regions b and c, the temporal distribution of HFRS cases was more uniform and the epidemic situation was more moderate than in Region a. It was inferred that Region b is derived from the epidemic foci previously centered on Jining City, while Region c is the residue of the epidemic foci centered on Jining City[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Although the HV carriage rates among rodents in Regions b and c were higher than that associated with Region a, the severity of the epidemic situation was less severe, suggesting that the HV-susceptible population appears to be more susceptible to the HV strains in Region a (which mainly belong to the HTNV genotype). Interestingly, the distance between Regions b and a is much smaller than that between Regions b and c. Despite this, the epidemic characteristics of Region b are quite different from those of Region a, and more similar to those of Region c. Although previous studies have shown that HTNV (which was the main genotype in Region a, where the epidemic situation was more serious) is more harmful to humans than SEOV (which was the main genotype in Regions b and c), local geographic conditions, climate, HFRS prevention and control measures and safety awareness among susceptible populations are also important factors[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that a further study should be performed to explore the factors underlying our result.</p><p>Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the HV genome can be divided into S, M and L segments. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the three segments would give us a clearer understanding of the genetic diversity and evolutionary trajectory of HV. The data on S and M segments in this study were insufficient, so the phylogenetic analysis of HV may be biased. Second, there are many factors that can influence the distribution and severity of infectious disease, such as natural environmental factors, urbanization processes and local prevention efforts[<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, this research lacked information on these factors, so the HFRS spatio-temporal distribution analysis is inadequate.</p><p>In conclusion, the southeastern and central Shandong Province are current key HFRS epidemic foci dominated by <italic>A</italic>. <italic>agrarius</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. <italic>norvegicus</italic>, respectively. Although the overall epidemic intensity was lower than the previous intensity in Shandong Province, it was still relatively high compared to the rest of the country. The spatio-temporal distribution of HFRS within Shandong Province indicated different epidemic situations in different regions. Local departments still need to strengthen their prevention and control measures to reduce the hazards of HFRS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007148.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007148.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007148.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>The partial L segment sequence of the strains without the accession number in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007148.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007148.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The accession number of strains used in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007148.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007148.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>The relationship between different partitions in Shandong Province in this study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007148.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0007148.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal> (<year>2014</year>) <article-title>Epidemic characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China, 2006&#x02013;2012</article-title>. <source>BMC Infect Dis</source>
