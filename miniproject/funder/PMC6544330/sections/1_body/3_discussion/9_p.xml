<p>Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the HV genome can be divided into S, M and L segments. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the three segments would give us a clearer understanding of the genetic diversity and evolutionary trajectory of HV. The data on S and M segments in this study were insufficient, so the phylogenetic analysis of HV may be biased. Second, there are many factors that can influence the distribution and severity of infectious disease, such as natural environmental factors, urbanization processes and local prevention efforts[
