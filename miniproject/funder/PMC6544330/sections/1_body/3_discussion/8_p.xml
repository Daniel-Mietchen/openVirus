<p>Although the HV carriage rates among rodents in Regions b and c were higher than that associated with Region a, the severity of the epidemic situation was less severe, suggesting that the HV-susceptible population appears to be more susceptible to the HV strains in Region a (which mainly belong to the HTNV genotype). Interestingly, the distance between Regions b and a is much smaller than that between Regions b and c. Despite this, the epidemic characteristics of Region b are quite different from those of Region a, and more similar to those of Region c. Although previous studies have shown that HTNV (which was the main genotype in Region a, where the epidemic situation was more serious) is more harmful to humans than SEOV (which was the main genotype in Regions b and c), local geographic conditions, climate, HFRS prevention and control measures and safety awareness among susceptible populations are also important factors[
