<p>In conclusion, the southeastern and central Shandong Province are current key HFRS epidemic foci dominated by 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> and 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>, respectively. Although the overall epidemic intensity was lower than the previous intensity in Shandong Province, it was still relatively high compared to the rest of the country. The spatio-temporal distribution of HFRS within Shandong Province indicated different epidemic situations in different regions. Local departments still need to strengthen their prevention and control measures to reduce the hazards of HFRS.
