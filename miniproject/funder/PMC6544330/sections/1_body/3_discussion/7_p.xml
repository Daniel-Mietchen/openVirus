<p>The results of Liu and Fang showed that the epidemic focus of HFRS in Shandong Province before this study was mainly concentrated in the northern part of Linyi in southeastern Shandong Province with a dominance of spring peak of incidence[

 <italic>agrarius</italic>-dominated mixed-type epidemic focus, on HFRS epidemic situation in Shandong Province mainly occurred in the autumn and winter. The coverage of Region a was more extensive than the coverage of Regions b and c, and the epidemic situation was also more serious. We inferred from previous studies that Region a is derived from the epidemic foci previously centered on Linyi City. Conversely, Regions b and c were more similar, involving

 <italic>norvegicus-</italic>dominated mixed-type epidemic foci. In Regions b and c, the temporal distribution of HFRS cases was more uniform and the epidemic situation was more moderate than in Region a. It was inferred that Region b is derived from the epidemic foci previously centered on Jining City, while Region c is the residue of the epidemic foci centered on Jining City[
