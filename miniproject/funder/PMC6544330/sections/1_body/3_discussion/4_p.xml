<p>We found that although the HV carriage rate among rodents was lower in southeastern Shandong Province than in central Shandong Province, the epidemic situation and clinical symptoms of cases were worse. This suggests that more attention should be paid and more interventions should be undertaken in the southeastern region. Additionally, the proportion of 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> carrying HV is very low in this study and other researches. Therefore, determining whether 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> can carry HV normally and pass on the infection to humans should be a key task of future research.[
