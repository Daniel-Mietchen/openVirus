<p>It is worth noting that 88% of all deaths occurred in September to January. Previous studies have suggested that the clinical symptoms of HFRS caused by HTNV are often more serious than those caused by SEOV[

Therefore, the deaths may be the result of a combination of HTNV and seasonal factors. Additionally, male farmers represented the biggest HV-susceptible population because of their increased contact with rodents due to working in the fields and poor residential sanitation conditions[

Therefore, HFRS prevention and control in Shandong Province should continue to be focused on controlling the rodentsâ€™ population and strengthening the immunization and education interventions for farmers in key epidemic foci. To reduce the mortality rate, we should also pay more attention to the treatment of cases occurring in autumn and winter.
