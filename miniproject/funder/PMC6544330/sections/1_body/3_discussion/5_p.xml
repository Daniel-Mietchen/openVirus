<p>HTNV and SEOV were still the main HV genotypes in Shandong Province. Although we inferred the patient's situation according to the HV genotype from rodents, studies have shown that HV isolated from patient's serum in Shandong Province was associated with local dominated rodent species. For example, the serum test results of Zhaoyuan patients showed that the area belongs to 
 <italic>Apodemus</italic>-type epidemic focus, while Jining, Zibo, Weifang belong to 
 <italic>Rattus</italic>-type epidemic foci. These conclusions are consistent with this study[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. But two points are worth noting. First, we obtained HTNV from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> captured in the wild, indicating that HTNV from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> spilled over to 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>. Previous studies also showed that some HV obtained from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> seemed to be HTNV[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, each HV genotype is associated primarily with a specific rodent host species that it coevolved with[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The phenomenon of viruses spilling over to non-traditional specific rodent hosts can allow them to find more suitable surroundings for a higher survival rate and more efficient infection and replication[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Huangdao is one of the most serious HFRS epidemic foci, which is located in southeastern Shandong. This phenomenon may promote the epidemic situation in this region. It is perhaps one of the reasons for migration of geographic boundaries of HFRS endemic areas. Second, we found two novel strains obtained from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City and they were closely related to strains from northeastern China, which reportedly belong to the VLAV genotype. This phenomenon of potential VLAV strains in Shandong Province has not previously been reported. Therefore, determining whether the viruses were transmitted from northeastern China, or simply involve indigenous genetic mutations, requires further research.
