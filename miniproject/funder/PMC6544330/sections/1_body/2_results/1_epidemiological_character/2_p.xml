<p>Regarding the demographic characteristics, 4465 males accounted for 72% of all cases. We found that 81% of all cases occurred in individuals aged 30–70 years, with the 41–50-year-old age group having the highest proportion of all the 10-year age groups. The three occupations with the highest incidence rates were farm workers (85%), urban workers (5%) and students (3%). The results clearly showed that middle-aged male farm workers are the main population to experience HFRS in Shandong Province. (
