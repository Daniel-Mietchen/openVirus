<p>From 2012 to 2015, 6,206 HFRS cases and 59 related deaths were reported in Shandong Province, and the annual incidence rate, mortality rate and case fatality rate ranged from 1.15 to 1.87 per 100,000, 0.01 to 0.02 per 100,000, and 0.80% to 1.07%, respectively (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). During the study period, the annual HFRS incidence rate in Shandong Province peaked in 2013, then decreased year by year, and reached its lowest point in 2015. In addition, there were two incidence peaks each year, the small peak was from April to June and the larger one was from October to January. However, mortality rates and case fatality rates declined year by year. The deaths mainly occurred from September to January (

As for spatial distribution, significant dynamic variation was found in that the high-risk areas were concentrated in a single large region in central and southeastern Shandong Province in 2012, which gradually separated into two regions, and then eventually formed two relatively independent high-risk regions in 2015 (
