<p>To construct a phylogenetic tree, partial L segment sequences from 47 HV strains were used: 29 strains from our samples and 18 strains from GenBank (which had been isolated in mainland China, the Korean Peninsula and Europe). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007148.g005">Fig 5</xref>, the branches of the phylogenetic tree revealed that the HTNV strains obtained in this study consisted of two clades from a bigger branch. They shared a common ancestor with strains isolated in Hubei and Xi'an. The SEOV strains obtained in this study constituted one branch, except for one strain that was obtained in Jiaxiang County (in the southwest of Shandong Province). Almost all the SEOV strains were closely related to viruses isolated in Fujian, Beijing and Zhejiang. However, the SEOV strain obtained in Jiaxiang County was dissimilar to all other strains and formed a separate branch. In addition, the genetic diversity associated with the SEOV branches indicated that they were more homogeneous than the HTNV branches, which had a higher degree of genetic diversity.
