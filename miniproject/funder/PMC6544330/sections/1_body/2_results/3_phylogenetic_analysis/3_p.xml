<p>We obtained two viruses with novel genotypes from 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City that were different from the other strains. After the alignment analysis in GenBank, it was found that they were closely related to the strain previously isolated in Russia (Jewish Autonomous Oblast), which has not been classified and named. Then together with strains isolated in Fusong County and Shenyang City (northeastern China), forming a single branch in the phylogenetic tree. Previous studies on the complete S segments of strains isolated in Fusong County and Shenyang City have shown that they are closely related to a virus isolated in Vladivostok in the Russian Far East, forming a single branch. The researchers believed that they belong to the same HV genotype, the Vladivostok virus (VLAV), which host are

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, our two novel viruses appear to be similar to the VLAV genotype [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We also obtained HTNV (1584101 HD 2015) from the wild-collected 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic> in Huangdao. This result suggested that HTNV in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> has spilled over to 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>, which was previously not common in Shandong Province.
