<p>To more intuitively identify the current HFRS epidemic foci in Shandong Province, the distribution of HV genotypes in each surveillance site was mapped. Additionally, the time distribution of HFRS throughout Shandong Province has a seasonal periodicity obviously. Peaks generally occur in spring or autumn and winter. Based on the two annual incidence peaks, we divided the 2012–2015 cases into three groups according to the month of their occurrence (Feb to May, June to Sept, and Oct to Jan) and mapped them with the 2012–2015 annual incidence rates on a single map. Finally, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007148.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we summarized the 2012–2015 HFRS case spatial epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and rodent surveillance results in Shandong Province, indicating the epidemic foci during the study period.
