<p>We constructed a geographic map of the different HV-infected rodent species. This indicated that the HV-infected dominant rodents in central Shandong Province were 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>norvegicus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, while 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>agrarius</italic> was the dominant HV-infected rodent in southeastern Shandong Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007148.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Additionally, the HV carriage rates of rodents in each surveillance site were calculated and plotted on another map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007148.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This showed that the surveillance sites with high HV carriage rates were mainly concentrated in central Shandong Province (Guangrao county had the highest HV carriage rate, at 16.67%), while the surveillance sites in southeastern Shandong Province had lower HV carriage rates (Pingdu city had the highest HV carriage rate, at 6.67%). Obviously, there were distinct differences in the spatial distributions of different HV-infected rodent species and HV carriage rates in Shandong Province.
