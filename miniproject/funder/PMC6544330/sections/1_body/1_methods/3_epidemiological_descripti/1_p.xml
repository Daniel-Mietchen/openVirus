<p>The 2012â€“2015 records of HFRS cases covering the whole of Shandong Province were used to calculate the monthly incidence rate (per 100,000 population). The proportions of cases in different demographic groups, based on gender, age and occupation were calculated. To observe the temporal distribution of cases more intuitively, we divided all cases into three groups (Feb to May, June to Sept and Oct to Jan) based on the two annual HFRS incidence peaks.</p>
