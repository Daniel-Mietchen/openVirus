<p>The night trapping method was used to capture rodents with peanuts as bait. The wild and residential areas were both taken into account when placing the rat clips and spring and autumn were selected as the sampling time for each surveillance site. The sampling process of each surveillance site was carried out by professionals use same method to ensure the representativeness of results. According to the information on the captured rodents, the proportion of each rodent species out of all the rodents captured was calculated. Lung samples of the captured rodents were screened using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA, which was extracted from 20–50 mg of lung tissue using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), was reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) and the primer P14: 5’-TAGTAGTAGACTCC-3’[
