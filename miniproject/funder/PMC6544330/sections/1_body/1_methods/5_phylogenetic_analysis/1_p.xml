<p>It was found that the strains of same surveillance sites stacked in same small branch based on the results of preliminary phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, we screened the strains with low homology in the same county every year. Eventually, the partial L segments of 29 strains from the 14 surveillance sites were selected (

Additionally, we searched GenBank and downloaded data on 18 relevant HV strains isolated in other regions of China, the Korean Peninsula and Europe. A phylogenetic tree was then constructed, using the Maximum likelihood (ML) method and bootstrap testing (1000 replicates), in MAGE 7.0 software (Pennsylvania State University, PA, USA)[
