<p>Changes in the epidemic foci (areas in which some wild animals have a long-term preservation of infectious pathogen) of infectious diseases are caused by many factors, including natural, human and viral host factors[

 <italic>norvegicus</italic>-dominated mixed viral genotypes epidemic focus. However, the characteristics of the HFRS epidemic foci in Shandong Province have been constantly changing, and the health threat to humans has been constantly changing as well. Adjustments to policies and practices should be performed in a timely manner. However, although many studies have analyzed the HFRS epidemic situation in Shandong Province[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007148.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we do not have a comprehensive and clear understanding of the current epidemic foci of HFRS. For this reason, we conducted a systematic analysis of surveillance information on HFRS in Shandong Province from 2012 to 2015 to assess the severity of the situation and determine the new epidemic foci in Shandong Province.
