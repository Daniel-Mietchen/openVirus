  <title>Phylogenetic tree of hantaviruses based on partial L segment sequences.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed by partial L segment of 47 hantavirus (HV) sequences, including 29 sequences obtained in this study represented by black marker, of which the black triangle represents HTNV isolated from 
   <italic>R</italic>. 
   <italic>norvegicus</italic>, and 18 sequences downloaded from GenBank. The Maximum likelihood (ML) method and bootstrap testing (1000 replicates) were employed. Only values greater than 70% are shown at the branch nodes. The scale bars indicate 0.1 substitutions per site.
