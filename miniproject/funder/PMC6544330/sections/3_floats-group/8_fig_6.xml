  <title>Status of epidemic foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Shandong Province from 2012 to 2015.</title>
  <p>(A) The Hantavirus (HV) genotypes obtained from each surveillance site were represented by different color. (B) The mean incidence rate of HFRS between 2012 and 2015 was calculated and overlapped with the temporal distribution of cases. The temporal distribution of cases was divided into three groups according to the month of their occurrence (Feb to May, June to Sept and Oct to Jan). (C) To get a clearer understanding of HFRS epidemic situation, the incidence rate of HFRS during the study was calculated by Kriging interpolation. Based on the results of spatial epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and rodent surveillance, the epidemic foci of HFRS in Shandong Province during the study period were summarized as the Regions a, b and c. The black dotted line represents the boundary between Regions a and b. The map was visualized with ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA).</p>
