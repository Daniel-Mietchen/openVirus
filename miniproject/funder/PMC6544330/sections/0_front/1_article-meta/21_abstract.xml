  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), an infectious disease caused by hantaviruses, is endemic in China and remains a serious public health problem. Historically, Shandong Province has had the largest HFRS burden in China. However, we do not have a comprehensive and clear understanding of the current epidemic foci of HFRS in Shandong Province.</p>

  <title>Methodology/principal findings</title>
  <p>The incidence and mortality rates were calculated, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed after laboratory testing of the virus in rodents. Spatial epidemiology analysis was applied to investigate the epidemic foci, including their sources. A total of 6,206 HFRS cases and 59 related deaths were reported in Shandong Province. The virus carriage rates of the rodents 
   <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, 
   <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and 
   <italic>Mus musculus</italic> were 10.24%, 6.31% and 0.27%, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that two novel viruses obtained from 
   <italic>R</italic>. 
   <italic>norvegicus</italic> in Anqiu City and Qingzhou City were dissimilar to the other strains, but closely related to strains previously isolated in northeastern China. Three epidemic foci were defined, two of which were derived from the Jining and Linyi epidemic foci, respectively, while the other was the residue of the Jining epidemic focus.

  <title>Conclusions/significance</title>
  <p>The southeastern and central Shandong Province are current key HFRS epidemic foci dominated by 
   <italic>A</italic>. 
   <italic>agrarius</italic> and 
   <italic>R</italic>. 
   <italic>norvegicus</italic>, respectively. Our study could help local departments to strengthen prevention and control measures in key areas to reduce the hazards of HFRS.
