<p>Put together, the estimated spatio-temporal variations in MBV suitability found in this study suggest that in order to decrease mosquito populations before the onset of ZIKV epidemics or prevent potential ZIKV introduction events from the southern region, control initiatives should take place just before, and at the beginning of, the wet season. Special attention could also potentially be stratified across districts or states in the middle of the country, including the major urban centres, and in particular in the south, as these regions are likely to have higher transmission potential.</p>
