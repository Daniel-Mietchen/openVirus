<p>Exposure to ZIKV infection during gestation is a major risk factor for development of a variety of neonate neurological complications including microcephaly (MC)

Based on the estimated time window of peak MBV suitability in Myanmar between June and October, we therefore predict that, in the event of a ZIKV outbreak, an epidemic of MC in the country would occur between November and March. This time window is therefore critical for active MC surveillance to be established in Myanmar. To date, there has been no report of significant increases in MC cases in Myanmar. Caution should be taken in assuming this as evidence for no ZIKV circulation, since in previous epidemics there has also been a lack of reported ZIKV-associated MC cases ‚Å†
