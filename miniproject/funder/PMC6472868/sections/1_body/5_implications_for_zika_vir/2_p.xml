<p>The higher suitability for MBVs in southern Myanmar suggests the south to be a viable route for importation of ZIKV from Thailand. It is known that southern international borders are home to sizeable mobile populations with limited access to healthcare 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Introduction of ZIKV through such borders would therefore carry a significant public health burden but would also likely be difficult to detect with a passive surveillance system. Additionally, suitability and DENV counts suggest a path of high transmission potential in the middle of the country, in districts including the 3 major urban centres of Myanmar (Yangon, Naypyitaw and Mandalay). Due to the domestic nature of the mosquito species involved, urban centres are a hallmark for ZIKV transmission and establishment, with attack rates above 60% reported elsewhere

For the city of Yangon, for example, a similar attack rate would result in +3 million cases, and would incur significant health and economic consequences. Public health prevention or mitigation of a starting epidemic therefore calls for active surveillance initiatives that move beyond formal international points of entry (i.e. airports and maritime ports) and urban centres. Detecting early epidemic transmission chains in time for mosquito-control interventions before the wet season may effectively hamper the full potential of ZIKV and prevent high attack rates.
