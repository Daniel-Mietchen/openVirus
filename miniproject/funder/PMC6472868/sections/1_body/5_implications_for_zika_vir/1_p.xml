<p>Our understanding of Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemiology in Myanmar and other countries of South East Asia (SEA) is incomplete, although there is evidence of continued transmission in the region from serosurveys and occasional viral isolation in residents and travellers to the region

 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Such evidence also supports the notion that ZIKV transmission in SEA preceded that of the Americas (2014-2015, 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) even with an apparently low number of cases and no major epidemics reported. To date, only one imported ZIKV case has been notified by the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and the virus’ spatio-temporal potential for transmission in the country is largely unknown. Given that mainland countries of SEA share many of the climatic and eco-demographic factors that dictate positive suitability for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, it is reasonable to assume that regions within Myanmar have the potential for epidemic or endemic transmission of ZIKV. Exploiting the fact that transmission seasons of various 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-born viruses (e.g. DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV) tend to be synced in time in other regions of the world 
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>⁠, we here discuss and speculate on the ZIKV public health implications of the index P’s spatio-temporal patterns found both at the national and subnational levels in Myanmar.
