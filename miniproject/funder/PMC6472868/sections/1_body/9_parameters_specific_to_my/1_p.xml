<p>As detailed in the main text, unknown parameters α, ρ and η were obtained for each weather station using a parameter sweep with heuristics of adult mosquito life-span of ~9 days and extrinsic incubation period of ~ 5 days (over the period 2015-2016). See Methods for details. The obtained values for α, ρ and η per weather station were (in order): Pathein 1.414, 0.78, 2.241; Hpa An 1.414, 0.78, 2.241; Sittwe 1.552, 0.45, 2.517; Dawei 1.414, 0.56, 2.517; Yangon 1.552, 0.78, 2.241; Am 1.414, 0.78, 2.379; Bago 1.414, 0.67, 2.379; Nay Pyi Taw 1.552, 0.45, 2.517; Loikaw 1.966, 0.45, 2.379; Aw 1.552, 0.78, 2.241; Katha 1.689, 0.56, 2.379; Hkamti 1.828, 1.00, 1.828; Taunggyi 1.828, 0.78, 1.828; Mandalay 1.552, 0.23, 2.655.</p>
