<p>The administrative distribution of Myanmar into districts was suitable for our analysis, since it was possible to classify them by predominant weather conditions, using the Köppen-Geiger classification 
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>⁠: equatorial monsoonal (Am), equatorial winter dry (Aw), warm temperate-winter dry-hot summer (Cwa), warm temperate-winter dry-warm summer (Cwb) and arid steppe-hot arid (BSh). We obtained climate data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage 
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, which had incomplete observations that we then complemented with information from the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, Yangon, for the period 2015-2016. Time and resource constrains for this process of data collection allowed for retrieving data from 14 weather stations, which were representative of the following districts: Pathein station, for the districts of Pathein, Pyapon, Maubin, Myaungmya and Labutta; Hpa An station, for Hpa An, Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Mawlamyine and Thaton; Sittwe station, for Sittwe, Marauk-U and Maungdaw; Dawei station, for Dawei, Myeik, and Kawthoung; Yangon Airport station, for North, South, East and West Yangon; Bago station for Bago, Hpapun and Hinthada; Nay Pyi Taw Airport station for North and South Nay Pyi Taw, Yamethin and Magway; Loikaw station for Loikaw, Bawlake and Langkho; Katha station for Katha, Bhamo and Mohnyin; Hkamti station for Hkamti district only; Taunggyi station for Taunggyi and Loilen; Mandalay Airport station for Mandalay, Kyaukse, Miyngyan, Nyaung-U and Meiktila; an average of the weather conditions in the Am region, for the districts of Kyaukpyu and Thandwe); and an average of the weather conditions in the Aw region, for the districts of Minbu, Pakokku, Gangaw, Pyinoolwin, Sagaing, Shwebo, Monywa, Kale, Yinmabin and Kyaukme.
