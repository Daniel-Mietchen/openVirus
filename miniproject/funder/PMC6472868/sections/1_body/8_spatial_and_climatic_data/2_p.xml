<p>To include a district in the present analysis, we used the criteria that its main population settlements were below 1500 meters above sea level, since the entomological modelling system we employed does not account for the effect of elevation on vector ecology and higher altitudes are less favourable to mosquito survival, plus either of the following: having access to climate variables from its weather station; or that its central point was within 100 Km of a station from which climate information was available; or being situated within a weather region were climate could be extrapolated from other districtsâ€™ stations. The latter was done since an analysis of variance showed no difference in mean temperature across weather stations in the Am (F=0.391, p-value=0.53; Dawei, Hpa An, Yangon, Pathein and Sittwe, and Bago stations) and Aw regions (F=2.793, p-value=0.09; Taungoo, Loikaw and Nay Pyi Taw stations). Extrapolation was not done for districts within the Cwa region, as there was a statistically significant difference in weather observations from individual stations (F=12.03, p-value&gt;0.05; Hkamti, Katha nad Taunggyi stations). Lastly, Mandalay was a single station within the BSh region and Hakha station from the Cwb region was removed from analysis, due to elevation criteria.</p>
