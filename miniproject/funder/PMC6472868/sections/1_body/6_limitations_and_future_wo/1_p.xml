<p>There are certain limitations to our approach. We note that the unavailability of high resolution climatic data meant that (1) it was impossible to estimate suitability along the border with China and Laos, two countries in which DENV transmission is reported to be endemic; and (2) that weather stations had to be used for vast geographical ranges, limiting our capacity to explore potentially relevant spatial heterogeneities within the larger districts. The climatic data used was also limited to 2 years, and although we show that the index P in that period explains much of DENVâ€™s epidemiology in 1996-2001, it is uncertain to what degree our estimations could have been better with matching time periods. It should also be noted that we take care in not interpreting P&gt;1 as a critical threshold for transmission potential. The real epidemic thresholds (R0&gt;1, Re&gt;1) are dependent on the total number of female mosquitoes per human (M=NV/NH) which is largely unknown in time and space. In this context, our sensitivity analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref> helps to elucidate this and can be of use for other regions for which climatic variables are available. Another climatic data source that could be investigated in future is satellite remote sensing, although we did not use this for the present study. We also discuss the implications for ZIKV transmission in Myanmar, although our results are based on DENV epidemiological data. Given that no seroprevalence or epidemiological data exists for ZIKV in Myanmar, our discussion points are intended to inform the community to the best of our knowledge, but should be taken as speculative until new data is made available and compared to our current projections. Our approach also does not include demographic factors, why may affect both the human susceptibility and the vector carrying capacity. Although our index P can explain much of the spatio-temporal patterns of Myanmar, it is possible that these factors explain some of the missed spatial patterns (e.g. local vector capacity could be higher in regions with more cases than predicted by P).
