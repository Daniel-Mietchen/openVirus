<p>The individual-mosquito transmission potential P(u,t) is a positive number, with P&gt;1 indicating the capacity of a single adult female mosquito to contribute to epidemic expansion, and P&gt;1 indicating otherwise. However, this threshold around 1 does not necessarily equate to the classic epidemic threshold of R0&gt;1 (or Re&gt;1), since P(u,t) critically ignores the total number of female mosquitoes per human (M). In other words, an epidemic threshold may be reached, for instance, with P&gt;1 if M&gt;&gt;1. Here, we argue and demonstrate that P(u,t) holds critical information on transmission seasonality (timing) and amplitude (relative epidemic potential between seasons and regions), both driven by the inherent climatic variables affecting viral and entomological factors. We denote P(u,t) as the mosquito-viral suitability index P, using a complementary terminology to existing vector suitability indices which more generally consider entomological factors and / or vector-population sizes
