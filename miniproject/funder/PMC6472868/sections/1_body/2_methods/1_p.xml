<p>Our approach develops from a climate-driven, mosquito-borne mathematical model of viral transmission that has been successfully applied to three MBV epidemics: for the 2012 dengue serotype 1 outbreak in the island of Madeira (Portugal) 
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>⁠, the 2014 dengue serotype 4 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the 2015-2017 ZIKV outbreak in Feira de Santana (Brazil) 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>⁠. In these case studies, given the availability of reported epidemic curves at appropriate spatio-temporal scales, deterministic simulations were used with a Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting approach to derive key local eco-epidemiological parameters, allowing of the estimation of the basic reproductive number (R0) and effective reproductive number (Re).
