<p>In the context of Myanmar and the lack of reported case counts at the subnational level, we addressed the potential for MBVs transmission by focusing on the model’s equation for R0

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>⁠. R0 is the sum of the transmission potential of each adult female mosquito per human, across the total number of female mosquitoes per human (M), in a totally susceptible human population. Hence, R0 can be expressed as the product of M with each individual mosquito transmission potential P(u,t):
