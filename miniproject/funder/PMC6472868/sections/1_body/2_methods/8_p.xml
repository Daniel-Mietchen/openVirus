<p>Here, a is the baseline biting rate, and the terms marked with * are the actual functions defined in the empirical studies, which can be found in Materials and Methods of Lourenco et al. 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The multiplicative coefficients η and α are used in the temperature dependent components of the adult mosquito mortality and incubation period, respectively. Their inclusion does not alter the relative effect of temperature variation on the entomological parameters per se, but allows for the parameter’s baselines to be different from the ideal laboratory conditions of the original research (e.g. 
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In practice, the effect of temperature on these parameters can be considered to be the same as observed under laboratory conditions if η~1 and α~1, or weaker if &gt;1 or higher if &gt;1. The exponential parameter ρ allows instead to modulate the strength by which adult mosquito mortality and biting rate react to deviations from local mean humidity. In practice, the effect of humidity can be switched off when ρ tends to 0 and made stronger when ρ &gt;1. For a discussion on possible biological factors that may justify these factors divergence from 1 please refer to the original description of the method
