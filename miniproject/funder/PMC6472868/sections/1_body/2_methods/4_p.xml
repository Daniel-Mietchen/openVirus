<p>The R0 expression is dependent on time-varying humidity (u) and temperature (t); M is the number of adult female mosquitoes per human (V/N, with N the human population size and V the adult female mosquito population size); av(u) is the mosquito biting rate, dependent on humidity; Φv-h(t) is the probability of transmission of the virus by infected-mosquito to human, per bite, dependent on temperature; Φh-v is the probability of transmission from infected-human to mosquito, per bite; 1/γv(t) is the extrinsic incubation period, dependent on temperature; 1/γh is the intrinsic incubation period; 1/μv(u,t) is the mosquito life-span, dependent on humidity and temperature; 1/σh is the human infectious period; and 1/μh is the human life-span. Each of the climate dependent functions was previously determined by laboratory estimates of entomological data (equations 20-37,
