<p>Fitting exercises to MBV epidemic curves that would allow for quantitative estimations of scaling factors α, ρ and η were not possible for Myanmar due to the lack of reported cases at appropriate spatio-temporal scales. To overcome this limitation, we ran a parameter sweep on the three factors in the range 0-10, and drew the combination of three values that would derive a yearly mean life-span of adult mosquitoes of ~9 days and an extrinsic incubation period of ~5 days. These heuristics are based on prior knowledge for ZIKV and DENV transmission estimations with the same model in three different regions

Please refer to the Data section for a description on the epidemiological and climate time series used in this study and the section Parameters specific to Myanmar section for all subnational values found and used for the scaling factors α, ρ and η. Constant parameter values used were: human lifespan of 64 years
