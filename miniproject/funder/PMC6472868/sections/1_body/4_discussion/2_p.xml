<p>At both the national and subnational levels, the wet season (Jun - Oct) was estimated to have the highest potential for MBVs transmission, in accordance with reported epidemiological time series. Since this was observed across Myanmar, it suggests that the epidemic potential of each district peaks during this period independently of their spatial location. In contrast, the hot and dry season (Mar - May) presented the lowest potential, also consistently across Myanmar, in accordance with what are known to be less favourable climate conditions for the vector. We therefore argue that in Myanmar, adequate surveillance and health care delivery resources should be fully operational by the end of the hot and dry season (May), in anticipation for the increase in MBVs case counts that is likely to occur in the following months. A similar argument can be used for vector control strategies in Myanmar, which should have maximal impact before the onset of the wet season, when mosquitoes encounter less favourable climate conditions and have smaller population sizes.</p>
