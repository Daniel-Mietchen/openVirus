<p>We also identified important spatial variations in MBV suitability across Myanmar. For instance, the highest potential was found primarily in the southern rural districts bordering with Thailand, and to a lesser degree across the middle of the country where the 3 major urban centres are located. Importantly, this estimated potential was highly correlated with DENV cases counts at the state level, although the lack of epidemiological data at such spatial resolution precluded us from verifying if our estimations at the district level fitted local counts. It may be tempting to speculate that the higher number of DENV counts in the south is a consequence of inflow of cases from Thailand (a highly endemic country). Critically, however, the estimated suitability in the south of Myanmar, in particular during the wet season, suggests for the first time that the observed higher incidence is driven by a local, higher intrinsic potential for MBVs transmission. Although management of case importation should be part of any national plan, it is clear that reducing suitability in the southern region of the country will be critical to control MBVs, for which vector control strategies should be effectve.</p>
