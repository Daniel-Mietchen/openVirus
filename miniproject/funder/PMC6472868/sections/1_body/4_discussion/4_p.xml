<p>Epidemiological models are useful tools to gauge the burden of a disease of interest, assess transmission potential, mosquito suitability, prompt surveillance efforts, inform better public health policies and highlight areas for pressing research. Such approaches are even more critical in epidemiological settings characterized by the absence of sustained surveillance or for pathogens which tend to have mild or asymptomatic pathology. The method here introduced requires solely climatic data and basic ento-epidemiological assumptions for which literature support is available. We foresee the usefulness and applicability of the index P for other regions of the world for which surveillance data is still missing, either due to lack of resources or absence of a pathogen of interest. In contrast, for regions rich in historical spatio-temporal and ento-epidemiological data, the index P may be a starting point for the development of an early warning system which would be based on real-time input of climatic variables.</p>
