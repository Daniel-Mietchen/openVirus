<p>As in other places of the world presenting endemicity for MBVs, Myanmar is likely to present significant heterogeneities between districts (and states) in terms of suitability (transmission potential). Apart from studies reporting differences in the total number of MBV case counts across the country, an assessment of suitability in space has not been previously done for Myanmar. Since our results suggested that the index P contains information on the timing and amplitude of observed DENV counts and mosquito population size (
