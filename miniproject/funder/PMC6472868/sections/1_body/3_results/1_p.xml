<p>We first tested the index P in the context of publicly available DENV case count data at the national-level for the period between 1996 and 2001

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figures 1 A1-2</xref>). While the epidemiological and climatic data available for the analysis were from different time periods, we found that the estimated P for both 2015 and 2016 presented seasonal fluctuations in sync with mean DENV counts from multiple years (1996-2001). The dynamics of P at the country level further presented key signatures in accordance to Myanmarâ€™s climatic seasons. Namely, (i) a sharp increase in transmission potential during May and June, coincident with the onset of the rainy season (Jun - Oct), and (ii) a trough in potential in the middle of the hot and dry season (Mar - May). A linear correlation between mean DENV counts (1996-2001) and mean index P (2015-2016) showed that ~76% of the variation in case count dynamics could be explained by the index with statistical significance (p-value=2.4x10-4,
