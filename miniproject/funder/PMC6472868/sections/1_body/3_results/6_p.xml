<p>We next attempted to correlate the spatial distribution of suitability with local mosquito abundance measures and MBV case counts. However, we found no data with spatial resolution for abundance, and found only DENV counts at the level of Myanmar’s states for the year 2015 as reported by the Ministry of Health and Sports

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2B</xref>) and compared its spatial distribution with DENV counts per state for 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2C</xref>). States presenting higher average suitability were located across the centre of the country, but particularly in the south, sharing a border with Thailand. The distribution of DENV counts presented a generally similar spatial signature co-localised in the centre and south of the country (
