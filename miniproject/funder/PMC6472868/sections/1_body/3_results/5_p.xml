<p>We looked at the spatial variation of the index P (2015-2016), focusing on its average within the cool dry (Nov - Feb), hot dry (Mar - May) and wet seasons (Jun - Oct) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2A</xref>), and found significant differences between seasons. Namely, the cool dry season presented a generally lower index P across space, at a time when climatic conditions are expected to be less favorable for the mosquito and therefore for suitability. In contrast, the wet season presented the highest index P across space. Importantly, the latter occurs in the same time period (Jun - Oct) in which DENV counts and mosquito abundance measures also peak. Significant variation within each season was also observed, with the cool and dry season presenting more homogeneous suitability across space (standard deviation, SD=3.86) and the wet season presenting the most heterogeneous suitability (SD=4.17).
