<p>Again, since we propose the index P as a measure of suitability independent of the number of (female) mosquitoes per human (M), a typical threshold of P=1 may not be adequate to speculate on local epidemic potential, given that an R0&gt;1 can be achieved with P&gt;1 and M&gt;1 (although the results from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that both the timing and amplitude of P are highly informative). We hypothesized that the time spent above a certain value (threshold) of suitability could be a better proxy for local, yearly epidemic potential. A sensitivity analysis was performed for 2015, the only year for which we had both climate input (index P) and DENV counts, with the intent of searching for the threshold of P that best explained the observed spatial distribution of DENV counts per state. We set 100 thresholds from 0.5 to 2.5 and measured the amount of time (T) the index P remained above each threshold in each state in 2015. Measures of T per state were used to calculate Pearson’s correlation with DENV counts per state (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that small thresholds (P&gt;1) had non-significant and low correlations between yearly cases and mean yearly suitability, while intermediate-to-high thresholds (P&gt;1.35) had significant and high correlations. The minimum correlation was found just above P=1 (dashed vertical lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>), when states are seen to spend equal amount of time T above that threshold in a year (seen by measures of T per state coloured according to DENV counts as in map’s legend, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results show the amount of time a region spends with suitability above a typical threshold of 1 is the least optimal to predict yearly epidemic potential and that in Myanmar’s epidemiological context higher thresholds are more informative.
