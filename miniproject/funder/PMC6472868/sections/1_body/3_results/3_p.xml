<p>Because we propose the index P as a measure of suitability independent of the total number of (female) mosquitoes, it is critical to have empirical support on whether its oscillatory behaviour (timing and amplitude) correlates with local measures of mosquito population size. Studies including mosquito surveys in Myanmar are scarce in the literature, mostly targeting vectors related to malaria transmission and focusing on their spatial distribution and species diversity (e.g.

 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. As far as we know, this is the only study with larval indices measured monthly over the period of at least one year. We compared the published data with our estimations of index P for Yangon in 2015 and 2016 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1 A1-2</xref>), the seasonal fluctuations of index P and larval indices were synchronous in time. A linear correlation between Yangonâ€™s larval indices (2011) and index P (2015) showed that ~76% of the variation in mosquito abundance measure, a proxy for adult mosquito population size, could be explained by the index P with statistical significance (p-value=2.2x10-4,
