<p>Recently, we have developed and applied a climate-driven mathematical framework to study epidemics of MBVs such as DENV

 <sup>,</sup>
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and ZIKV 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>⁠. The success of this framework stems from its data-driven approach, including temporal climatic series used to parameterise both vector and viral variables under mathematical relationships derived from experimental studies. The reliance on local climatic variables as its main input makes the framework general enough to be applied to different geo-locations. Here we translate our experience with this framework to introduce an MBV suitability index, which we apply to the context of Myanmar. With it, we estimate spatio-temporal patterns of suitability across the country, validating it against existing but incomplete data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of Myanmar’s MBV transmission potential in both time and space. We discuss the public health and control implications of our findings both generally for MBVs and in particular for ZIKV.
