<p>The evolutionary and host-pathogen history of MBVs is vastly diverse, but the population biology of these viruses shares one unifying characteristic: their epidemiological dynamics and epidemic behaviour is inherently linked to the underlying population dynamics of their vector-species. Mosquito-population dynamics are known to be dictated by a wide range of factors, such as climate, altitude, population density of humans or other animals, air or waste pollution levels, and natural or artificial water reservoirs

While most of these factors can dictate absolute population sizes (carrying capacity), seasonal oscillations are largely driven by natural climate variations.‚Å† South East Asia (SEA) is the most densely populated region of the world and has experienced rapid urbanization in the past century. Such demographic factors and tropical climate are believed be the main drivers of the success of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the region, the main genus for the transmission of MBVs such as DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV. Historically, surveillance of MBVs has been highly heterogeneous in the region. For instance, a few countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore often serve as global references for DENV epidemiology, reporting spatio-temporal epidemiological and genetic data spanning several decades

For instance, published DENV case counts over time are reported at national level with total counts per year at the state level, but spatio-temporal data at the district or lower levels is not freely available. In the context of countries with incomplete data coverage for a robust understanding of the local epidemiological determinants and epidemic potential of MBVs, mathematical frameworks, and in particular dynamic models, are essential to close the gaps in knowledge.
