 <label>MBV suitability index P and spatial distribution of epidemiological data in Myanmar.</label>
 <caption>
  <p>Panel A shows maps of Myanmar coloured according to mean index P per district in different seasons of the year (as labelled in each map). Panel B presents the yearly mean index P per state in 2015 with borders of neighboring countries (named) shown in light blue. Panel C presents the number of DENV cases per state in 2015. Panel D presents a sensitivity exercise showing the critical index P (~1.5) for which the spatial distributions of dengue cases and mean index P are most correlated in 2015. Colored lines show the amount of time (T) each state spends with index P above a certain threshold (colors related to 2015 DENV case counts, as in map C). Points present Pearson’s correlation coefficient between T and dengue case counts with significant correlations in blue. Dashed vertical lines signal the T values for which the minimum (no) correlation is found. In all panels: all model parameters as described in Methods section, except for α, ρ and η as described in section Parameters specific to Myanmar.</p>
