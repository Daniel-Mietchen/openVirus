high disease burden and significant economic costs. While in some SEA
countries the epidemiology of MBVs is spatio-temporally well characterised
and understood, in others such as Myanmar our understanding is largely
incomplete.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Here, we use a simple mathematical approach to estimate a climate-driven
suitability index aiming to better characterise the intrinsic,
spatio-temporal potential of MBVs in Myanmar.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Results show that the timing and amplitude of the natural oscillations of our
suitability index are highly informative for the temporal patterns of DENV
case counts at the country level, and a mosquito-abundance measure at a city
level. When projected at fine spatial scales, the suitability index suggests
that the time period of highest MBV transmission potential is between June
and October independently of geographical location. Higher potential is
nonetheless found along the middle axis of the country and in particular in
the southern corridor of international borders with Thailand.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion:</title><p>This research complements and expands our current understanding of MBV
transmission potential in Myanmar, by identifying key spatial
heterogeneities and temporal windows of importance for surveillance and
control. We discuss our findings in the context of Zika virus given its
recent worldwide emergence, public health impact, and current lack of
information on its epidemiology and transmission potential in Myanmar. The
proposed suitability index here demonstrated is applicable to other regions
of the world for which surveillance data is missing, either due to lack of
resources or absence of an MBV of interest.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Notice of Correction</title><p><bold>10 October 2018:</bold> PLOS Currents - Correction: Measuring Mosquito-borne

(DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika (ZIKV), yellow fever (YFV), Rift Valley fever
(RVFV), West-Nile (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses. Due to ongoing
globalization and climatic trends that favour the establishment of vectors and
movement of infectious hosts, these pathogens are becoming increasingly detrimental
for human public health <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>The evolutionary and host-pathogen history of MBVs is vastly diverse, but the
population biology of these viruses shares one unifying characteristic: their
epidemiological dynamics and epidemic behaviour is inherently linked to the
underlying population dynamics of their vector-species. Mosquito-population dynamics
are known to be dictated by a wide range of factors, such as climate, altitude,
population density of humans or other animals, air or waste pollution levels, and
natural or artificial water reservoirs <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. While most of these factors can dictate absolute population sizes
(carrying capacity), seasonal oscillations are largely driven by natural climate
variations.&#x02060; South East Asia (SEA) is the most densely populated region of the world
and has experienced rapid urbanization in the past century. Such demographic factors
and tropical climate are believed be the main drivers of the success of
<italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in the region, the main genus for the
transmission of MBVs such as DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV. Historically, surveillance of
MBVs has been highly heterogeneous in the region. For instance, a few countries such
as Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore often serve as global references for DENV
epidemiology, reporting spatio-temporal epidemiological and genetic data spanning
several decades <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Other countries, such as Myanmar, report
epidemiological data at lower spatio-temporal resolutions <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. For instance,
published DENV case counts over time are reported at national level with total
counts per year at the state level, but spatio-temporal data at the district or
lower levels is not freely available. In the context of countries with incomplete
data coverage for a robust understanding of the local epidemiological determinants
and epidemic potential of MBVs, mathematical frameworks, and in particular dynamic
models, are essential to close the gaps in knowledge.</p><p>Recently, we have developed and applied a climate-driven mathematical framework to
study epidemics of MBVs such as DENV <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and ZIKV <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02060;. The success of this framework stems from
its data-driven approach, including temporal climatic series used to parameterise
both vector and viral variables under mathematical relationships derived from
experimental studies. The reliance on local climatic variables as its main input
makes the framework general enough to be applied to different geo-locations. Here we
translate our experience with this framework to introduce an MBV suitability index,
which we apply to the context of Myanmar. With it, we estimate spatio-temporal
patterns of suitability across the country, validating it against existing but
incomplete data. Our results contribute to a better understanding of Myanmar&#x02019;s MBV
transmission potential in both time and space. We discuss the public health and
control implications of our findings both generally for MBVs and in particular for
ZIKV.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Our approach develops from a climate-driven, mosquito-borne mathematical model of
viral transmission that has been successfully applied to three MBV epidemics: for
the 2012 dengue serotype 1 outbreak in the island of Madeira (Portugal) <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02060;, the 2014 dengue serotype 4 outbreak in
Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the
2015-2017 ZIKV outbreak in Feira de Santana (Brazil) <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02060;. In these case studies, given the availability of
reported epidemic curves at appropriate spatio-temporal scales, deterministic
simulations were used with a Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting approach to derive key
local eco-epidemiological parameters, allowing of the estimation of the basic
reproductive number (R0) and effective reproductive number (Re).</p><p>In the context of Myanmar and the lack of reported case counts at the subnational
level, we addressed the potential for MBVs transmission by focusing on the model&#x02019;s
equation for R0 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, a similar starting
point of a recent and successful strategy implemented in the context of YFV in the
African continent <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02060;. R0 is the sum of the
transmission potential of each adult female mosquito per human, across the total
number of female mosquitoes per human (M), in a totally susceptible human
population. Hence, R0 can be expressed as the product of M with each individual
mosquito transmission potential P(u,t):</p><p>
<inline-graphic xlink:href="Methods1.jpg"/>
</p><p>The R0 expression is dependent on time-varying humidity (u) and temperature (t); M is
the number of adult female mosquitoes per human (V/N, with N the human population
size and V the adult female mosquito population size); av(u) is the mosquito biting
rate, dependent on humidity; &#x003a6;v-h(t) is the probability of transmission of the virus
by infected-mosquito to human, per bite, dependent on temperature; &#x003a6;h-v is the
probability of transmission from infected-human to mosquito, per bite; 1/&#x003b3;v(t) is
the extrinsic incubation period, dependent on temperature; 1/&#x003b3;h is the intrinsic
incubation period; 1/&#x003bc;v(u,t) is the mosquito life-span, dependent on humidity and
temperature; 1/&#x003c3;h is the human infectious period; and 1/&#x003bc;h is the human life-span.
Each of the climate dependent functions was previously determined by laboratory
estimates of entomological data (equations 20-37, <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The individual-mosquito transmission potential P(u,t) is a positive number, with
P&#x0003e;1 indicating the capacity of a single adult female mosquito to contribute to
epidemic expansion, and P&#x0003e;1 indicating otherwise. However, this threshold around
1 does not necessarily equate to the classic epidemic threshold of R0&#x0003e;1 (or
Re&#x0003e;1), since P(u,t) critically ignores the total number of female mosquitoes per
human (M). In other words, an epidemic threshold may be reached, for instance, with
P&#x0003e;1 if M&#x0003e;&#x0003e;1. Here, we argue and demonstrate that P(u,t) holds critical
information on transmission seasonality (timing) and amplitude (relative epidemic
potential between seasons and regions), both driven by the inherent climatic
variables affecting viral and entomological factors. We denote P(u,t) as the
mosquito-viral suitability index P, using a complementary terminology to existing
vector suitability indices which more generally consider entomological factors and /
or vector-population sizes <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. As seen
above, P(u,t) is a complex expression containing human, entomological and viral
factors, and can thus be parametrized for any species of virus, host or vector, and
estimated for any region for which humidity and temperature are available.</p><p>While some parameters used to calculate P can be quantified through known constant
values, others follow mathematical expressions that depend on three scaling factors,
&#x003b1;, &#x003c1; and &#x003b7;, that are used to modulate the baseline relationships between climatic
variables and entomological parameters:</p><p>
<inline-graphic xlink:href="Methods2.jpg"/>
</p><p>Here, a is the baseline biting rate, and the terms marked with * are the actual
functions defined in the empirical studies, which can be found in Materials and
Methods of Lourenco et al. <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. The
multiplicative coefficients &#x003b7; and &#x003b1; are used in the temperature dependent components
of the adult mosquito mortality and incubation period, respectively. Their inclusion
does not alter the relative effect of temperature variation on the entomological
parameters per se, but allows for the parameter&#x02019;s baselines to be different from the
ideal laboratory conditions of the original research (e.g. <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In practice, the effect of temperature on these
parameters can be considered to be the same as observed under laboratory conditions
if &#x003b7;~1 and &#x003b1;~1, or weaker if &#x0003e;1 or higher if &#x0003e;1. The exponential parameter &#x003c1;
allows instead to modulate the strength by which adult mosquito mortality and biting
rate react to deviations from local mean humidity. In practice, the effect of
humidity can be switched off when &#x003c1; tends to 0 and made stronger when &#x003c1; &#x0003e;1. For a
discussion on possible biological factors that may justify these factors divergence
from 1 please refer to the original description of the method <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and in a separate study by Brady and colleagues <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>Fitting exercises to MBV epidemic curves that would allow for quantitative
estimations of scaling factors &#x003b1;, &#x003c1; and &#x003b7; were not possible for Myanmar due to the
lack of reported cases at appropriate spatio-temporal scales. To overcome this
limitation, we ran a parameter sweep on the three factors in the range 0-10, and
drew the combination of three values that would derive a yearly mean life-span of
adult mosquitoes of ~9 days and an extrinsic incubation period of ~5 days. These
heuristics are based on prior knowledge for ZIKV and DENV transmission estimations
with the same model in three different regions <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, which are

used in this study and the section Parameters specific to Myanmar section for all
subnational values found and used for the scaling factors &#x003b1;, &#x003c1; and &#x003b7;. Constant
parameter values used were: human lifespan of 64 years <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, human infectious period of 5.8 days, biting rate of 0.25
per day, human incubation period of 5.9 days and the infected-human to mosquito
probability of transmission per bite of 0.5 (as previously modelled <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We first tested the index P in the context of publicly available DENV case count data
at the national-level for the period between 1996 and 2001 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. For this, we estimated P for each district using
available local climatic data (2015-2016), further aggregating and averaging P
across all districts of the country and per month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figures 1 A1-2</xref>). While the epidemiological and climatic
data available for the analysis were from different time periods, we found that the
estimated P for both 2015 and 2016 presented seasonal fluctuations in sync with mean
DENV counts from multiple years (1996-2001). The dynamics of P at the country level
further presented key signatures in accordance to Myanmar&#x02019;s climatic seasons.
Namely, (i) a sharp increase in transmission potential during May and June,
coincident with the onset of the rainy season (Jun - Oct), and (ii) a trough in
potential in the middle of the hot and dry season (Mar - May). A linear correlation
between mean DENV counts (1996-2001) and mean index P (2015-2016) showed that ~76%
of the variation in case count dynamics could be explained by the index with
statistical significance (p-value=2.4x10-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1 B3</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Because we propose the index P as a measure of suitability independent of the total
number of (female) mosquitoes, it is critical to have empirical support on whether
its oscillatory behaviour (timing and amplitude) correlates with local measures of
mosquito population size. Studies including mosquito surveys in Myanmar are scarce
in the literature, mostly targeting vectors related to malaria transmission and
focusing on their spatial distribution and species diversity (e.g. <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).
Here, we use data collected in a study of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> abundance
in Yangon for the year of 2011 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. As far
as we know, this is the only study with larval indices measured monthly over the
period of at least one year. We compared the published data with our estimations of
index P for Yangon in 2015 and 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figures 1
B1-2</xref>). As previously shown for DENV counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1 A1-2</xref>), the seasonal fluctuations of index P and
larval indices were synchronous in time. A linear correlation between Yangon&#x02019;s
larval indices (2011) and index P (2015) showed that ~76% of the variation in
mosquito abundance measure, a proxy for adult mosquito population size, could be
explained by the index P with statistical significance (p-value=2.2x10-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1 C3</xref>).</p><p>As in other places of the world presenting endemicity for MBVs, Myanmar is likely to
present significant heterogeneities between districts (and states) in terms of
suitability (transmission potential). Apart from studies reporting differences in
the total number of MBV case counts across the country, an assessment of suitability
in space has not been previously done for Myanmar. Since our results suggested that
the index P contains information on the timing and amplitude of observed DENV counts
and mosquito population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>),
we explored the spatial variation of index P across the country.</p><p>We looked at the spatial variation of the index P (2015-2016), focusing on its
average within the cool dry (Nov - Feb), hot dry (Mar - May) and wet seasons (Jun -
Oct) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2A</xref>), and found significant
differences between seasons. Namely, the cool dry season presented a generally lower
index P across space, at a time when climatic conditions are expected to be less
favorable for the mosquito and therefore for suitability. In contrast, the wet
season presented the highest index P across space. Importantly, the latter occurs in
the same time period (Jun - Oct) in which DENV counts and mosquito abundance
measures also peak. Significant variation within each season was also observed, with
the cool and dry season presenting more homogeneous suitability across space
(standard deviation, SD=3.86) and the wet season presenting the most heterogeneous
suitability (SD=4.17).</p><p>We next attempted to correlate the spatial distribution of suitability with local
mosquito abundance measures and MBV case counts. However, we found no data with
spatial resolution for abundance, and found only DENV counts at the level of
Myanmar&#x02019;s states for the year 2015 as reported by the Ministry of Health and Sports
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Similarly to the approach applied
for districts, we calculated the yearly average index P per state using climate data
for both 2015 and 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2B</xref>) and
compared its spatial distribution with DENV counts per state for 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2C</xref>). States presenting higher average
suitability were located across the centre of the country, but particularly in the
south, sharing a border with Thailand. The distribution of DENV counts presented a
generally similar spatial signature co-localised in the centre and south of the
country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2C</xref>). The Pearson&#x02019;s
correlation between mean yearly suitability and yearly DENV counts of the
state-based two maps was 0.56 (p-value=0.033).</p><p>

</p><p>Again, since we propose the index P as a measure of suitability independent of the
number of (female) mosquitoes per human (M), a typical threshold of P=1 may not be
adequate to speculate on local epidemic potential, given that an R0&#x0003e;1 can be
achieved with P&#x0003e;1 and M&#x0003e;1 (although the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> suggest that both the timing and amplitude of P
are highly informative). We hypothesized that the time spent above a certain value
(threshold) of suitability could be a better proxy for local, yearly epidemic
potential. A sensitivity analysis was performed for 2015, the only year for which we
had both climate input (index P) and DENV counts, with the intent of searching for
the threshold of P that best explained the observed spatial distribution of DENV
counts per state. We set 100 thresholds from 0.5 to 2.5 and measured the amount of
time (T) the index P remained above each threshold in each state in 2015. Measures
of T per state were used to calculate Pearson&#x02019;s correlation with DENV counts per
state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that small
thresholds (P&#x0003e;1) had non-significant and low correlations between yearly cases
and mean yearly suitability, while intermediate-to-high thresholds (P&#x0003e;1.35) had
significant and high correlations. The minimum correlation was found just above P=1
(dashed vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>), when
states are seen to spend equal amount of time T above that threshold in a year (seen
by measures of T per state coloured according to DENV counts as in map&#x02019;s legend,
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results show the
amount of time a region spends with suitability above a typical threshold of 1 is
the least optimal to predict yearly epidemic potential and that in Myanmar&#x02019;s
epidemiological context higher thresholds are more informative.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we were able to demonstrate that our measure for mosquito-borne viral
suitability is informative in the context of Myanmar, despite the lack of
ento-epidemiological datasets with high spatio-temporal resolution. By estimating
suitability through climate variables and known ento-epidemiological parameters, we
were able to project mosquito-born virus (MBV) suitability at the district level, a
resolution for which epidemiological data and mosquito abundance measures are not
generally available. Here, we discuss the national and subnational public health and
control implications for MBVs in the context of our projections.</p><p>At both the national and subnational levels, the wet season (Jun - Oct) was estimated
to have the highest potential for MBVs transmission, in accordance with reported
epidemiological time series. Since this was observed across Myanmar, it suggests
that the epidemic potential of each district peaks during this period independently
of their spatial location. In contrast, the hot and dry season (Mar - May) presented
the lowest potential, also consistently across Myanmar, in accordance with what are
known to be less favourable climate conditions for the vector. We therefore argue
that in Myanmar, adequate surveillance and health care delivery resources should be
fully operational by the end of the hot and dry season (May), in anticipation for
the increase in MBVs case counts that is likely to occur in the following months. A
similar argument can be used for vector control strategies in Myanmar, which should
have maximal impact before the onset of the wet season, when mosquitoes encounter
less favourable climate conditions and have smaller population sizes.</p><p>We also identified important spatial variations in MBV suitability across Myanmar.
For instance, the highest potential was found primarily in the southern rural
districts bordering with Thailand, and to a lesser degree across the middle of the
country where the 3 major urban centres are located. Importantly, this estimated
potential was highly correlated with DENV cases counts at the state level, although
the lack of epidemiological data at such spatial resolution precluded us from
verifying if our estimations at the district level fitted local counts. It may be
tempting to speculate that the higher number of DENV counts in the south is a
consequence of inflow of cases from Thailand (a highly endemic country). Critically,
however, the estimated suitability in the south of Myanmar, in particular during the
wet season, suggests for the first time that the observed higher incidence is driven
by a local, higher intrinsic potential for MBVs transmission. Although management of
case importation should be part of any national plan, it is clear that reducing
suitability in the southern region of the country will be critical to control MBVs,
for which vector control strategies should be effectve.</p><p>Epidemiological models are useful tools to gauge the burden of a disease of interest,
assess transmission potential, mosquito suitability, prompt surveillance efforts,
inform better public health policies and highlight areas for pressing research. Such
approaches are even more critical in epidemiological settings characterized by the
absence of sustained surveillance or for pathogens which tend to have mild or
asymptomatic pathology. The method here introduced requires solely climatic data and
basic ento-epidemiological assumptions for which literature support is available. We
foresee the usefulness and applicability of the index P for other regions of the
world for which surveillance data is still missing, either due to lack of resources
or absence of a pathogen of interest. In contrast, for regions rich in historical
spatio-temporal and ento-epidemiological data, the index P may be a starting point
for the development of an early warning system which would be based on real-time
input of climatic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for Zika virus in Myanmar</title><p>Our understanding of Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemiology in Myanmar and other countries of
South East Asia (SEA) is incomplete, although there is evidence of continued
transmission in the region from serosurveys and occasional viral isolation in
residents and travellers to the region <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Such evidence
also supports the notion that ZIKV transmission in SEA preceded that of the Americas
(2014-2015, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) even with an apparently low
number of cases and no major epidemics reported. To date, only one imported ZIKV
case has been notified by the Myanmar Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and the virus&#x02019; spatio-temporal potential
for transmission in the country is largely unknown. Given that mainland countries of
SEA share many of the climatic and eco-demographic factors that dictate positive
suitability for <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, it is reasonable to assume that
regions within Myanmar have the potential for epidemic or endemic transmission of
ZIKV. Exploiting the fact that transmission seasons of various
<italic>Aedes</italic>-born viruses (e.g. DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV) tend to be synced
in time in other regions of the world <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02060;,
we here discuss and speculate on the ZIKV public health implications of the index
P&#x02019;s spatio-temporal patterns found both at the national and subnational levels in
Myanmar.</p><p>The higher suitability for MBVs in southern Myanmar suggests the south to be a viable
route for importation of ZIKV from Thailand. It is known that southern international
borders are home to sizeable mobile populations with limited access to healthcare
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. Introduction of ZIKV through such
borders would therefore carry a significant public health burden but would also
likely be difficult to detect with a passive surveillance system. Additionally,
suitability and DENV counts suggest a path of high transmission potential in the
middle of the country, in districts including the 3 major urban centres of Myanmar
(Yangon, Naypyitaw and Mandalay). Due to the domestic nature of the mosquito species
involved, urban centres are a hallmark for ZIKV transmission and establishment, with
attack rates above 60% reported elsewhere <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> . For the city
of Yangon, for example, a similar attack rate would result in +3 million cases, and
would incur significant health and economic consequences. Public health prevention
or mitigation of a starting epidemic therefore calls for active surveillance
initiatives that move beyond formal international points of entry (i.e. airports and
maritime ports) and urban centres. Detecting early epidemic transmission chains in
time for mosquito-control interventions before the wet season may effectively hamper
the full potential of ZIKV and prevent high attack rates.</p><p>Exposure to ZIKV infection during gestation is a major risk factor for development of
a variety of neonate neurological complications including microcephaly (MC) <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>.
Recent studies have further suggested that the risk of MC is highest for exposure
around week 17 of gestation, resulting in a lag of approximately 5 months between
ZIKV and MC epidemic peaks <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Based on the
estimated time window of peak MBV suitability in Myanmar between June and October,
we therefore predict that, in the event of a ZIKV outbreak, an epidemic of MC in the
country would occur between November and March. This time window is therefore
critical for active MC surveillance to be established in Myanmar. To date, there has
been no report of significant increases in MC cases in Myanmar. Caution should be
taken in assuming this as evidence for no ZIKV circulation, since in previous
epidemics there has also been a lack of reported ZIKV-associated MC cases &#x02060;<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and it is possible that only one of two
existing lineages of the virus is responsible or such clinical manifestations <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> .</p><p>Put together, the estimated spatio-temporal variations in MBV suitability found in
this study suggest that in order to decrease mosquito populations before the onset
of ZIKV epidemics or prevent potential ZIKV introduction events from the southern
region, control initiatives should take place just before, and at the beginning of,
the wet season. Special attention could also potentially be stratified across
districts or states in the middle of the country, including the major urban centres,
and in particular in the south, as these regions are likely to have higher
transmission potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and future work</title><p>There are certain limitations to our approach. We note that the unavailability of
high resolution climatic data meant that (1) it was impossible to estimate
suitability along the border with China and Laos, two countries in which DENV
transmission is reported to be endemic; and (2) that weather stations had to be used
for vast geographical ranges, limiting our capacity to explore potentially relevant
spatial heterogeneities within the larger districts. The climatic data used was also
limited to 2 years, and although we show that the index P in that period explains
much of DENV&#x02019;s epidemiology in 1996-2001, it is uncertain to what degree our
estimations could have been better with matching time periods. It should also be
noted that we take care in not interpreting P&#x0003e;1 as a critical threshold for
transmission potential. The real epidemic thresholds (R0&#x0003e;1, Re&#x0003e;1) are
dependent on the total number of female mosquitoes per human (M=NV/NH) which is
largely unknown in time and space. In this context, our sensitivity analysis in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2D</xref> helps to elucidate this and
can be of use for other regions for which climatic variables are available. Another
climatic data source that could be investigated in future is satellite remote
sensing, although we did not use this for the present study. We also discuss the
implications for ZIKV transmission in Myanmar, although our results are based on
DENV epidemiological data. Given that no seroprevalence or epidemiological data
exists for ZIKV in Myanmar, our discussion points are intended to inform the
community to the best of our knowledge, but should be taken as speculative until new
data is made available and compared to our current projections. Our approach also
does not include demographic factors, why may affect both the human susceptibility
and the vector carrying capacity. Although our index P can explain much of the
spatio-temporal patterns of Myanmar, it is possible that these factors explain some
of the missed spatial patterns (e.g. local vector capacity could be higher in
regions with more cases than predicted by P).</p></sec><sec><title>Ento-epidemiological count data</title><p>DENV case counts for Myanmar between 1996 and 2001 (as published by <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02060;) were published already aggregated at the

analysis, since it was possible to classify them by predominant weather conditions,
using the K&#x000f6;ppen-Geiger classification <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02060;:
equatorial monsoonal (Am), equatorial winter dry (Aw), warm temperate-winter dry-hot

Atmospheric Administration webpage <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
which had incomplete observations that we then complemented with information from
the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, Yangon, for the period 2015-2016. Time
and resource constrains for this process of data collection allowed for retrieving
data from 14 weather stations, which were representative of the following districts:
Pathein station, for the districts of Pathein, Pyapon, Maubin, Myaungmya and
Labutta; Hpa An station, for Hpa An, Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Mawlamyine and Thaton;
Sittwe station, for Sittwe, Marauk-U and Maungdaw; Dawei station, for Dawei, Myeik,

district only; Taunggyi station for Taunggyi and Loilen; Mandalay Airport station
for Mandalay, Kyaukse, Miyngyan, Nyaung-U and Meiktila; an average of the weather
conditions in the Am region, for the districts of Kyaukpyu and Thandwe); and an
average of the weather conditions in the Aw region, for the districts of Minbu,
Pakokku, Gangaw, Pyinoolwin, Sagaing, Shwebo, Monywa, Kale, Yinmabin and
Kyaukme.</p><p>To include a district in the present analysis, we used the criteria that its main
population settlements were below 1500 meters above sea level, since the
entomological modelling system we employed does not account for the effect of
elevation on vector ecology and higher altitudes are less favourable to mosquito
survival, plus either of the following: having access to climate variables from its
weather station; or that its central point was within 100 Km of a station from which
climate information was available; or being situated within a weather region were
climate could be extrapolated from other districts&#x02019; stations. The latter was done
since an analysis of variance showed no difference in mean temperature across
weather stations in the Am (F=0.391, p-value=0.53; Dawei, Hpa An, Yangon, Pathein
and Sittwe, and Bago stations) and Aw regions (F=2.793, p-value=0.09; Taungoo,
Loikaw and Nay Pyi Taw stations). Extrapolation was not done for districts within
the Cwa region, as there was a statistically significant difference in weather
observations from individual stations (F=12.03, p-value&#x0003e;0.05; Hkamti, Katha nad
Taunggyi stations). Lastly, Mandalay was a single station within the BSh region and
Hakha station from the Cwb region was removed from analysis, due to elevation
criteria.</p><p>The three weather seasons defined in this study for the context of Myanmar were: cool
