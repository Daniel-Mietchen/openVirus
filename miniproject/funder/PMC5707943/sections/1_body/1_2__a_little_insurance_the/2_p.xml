<p>First, virtually by definition, an epidemic of contagious disease is the antithesis of independent harmful events. Instead, when an epidemic breaks out, harm to one person is surely correlated with harm to many other people. This means that “epidemic insurance” for a single type of viral threat cannot take advantage of the law of large numbers which allows a fixed payment to come as close as we like to offsetting the harm from some adverse event.</p>
