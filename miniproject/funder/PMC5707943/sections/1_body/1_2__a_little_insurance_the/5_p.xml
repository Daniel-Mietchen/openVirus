<p>Depending on difference in timing between when the vaccine is administered and when an epidemic breaks out, it may or may not be possible to know if the vaccine provided any benefit. If the vaccine is administered well in advance of identifying an epidemic and immunity then prevents any epidemic from occurring, we will never know if the vaccine provided protection or not. If it is kept in reserve and only administered once some cases suggesting the potential of an epidemic have occurred, at least we will know if it mattered.</p>
