<p>In the face of threats from communicable infectious diseases such as Ebola or the Zika virus, public health policymakers and philanthropists have turned their attention to ways to deal with such risks. One obvious thought is that, if a preventive vaccine could be developed and administered to populations at risk, the harm—both to health and wealth—from epidemics could be greatly reduced. A popular metaphor is that the development of such a vaccine, were it to be successful, would constitute “insurance” against the harms from any future outbreaks [

In this paper, I want to look at vaccine development and diffusion from an insurance perspective, and see what that perspective has to say about the efficiency and feasibility of vaccine development programs. My focus will be on the risk and insurance for firms, philanthropies, or governments concerned with having vaccines available if a pandemic strikes; I will not explore in detail insurance aspects of patient access and financing, nor will I deal with other dimensions of responses to pandemics such as the isolation or stockpiling of vaccines. I will also not deal with efforts to make “surge funding” available at the outbreak of an epidemic, the target of the World Bank’s “Pandemic Emergency Facility” (PEF), a joint effort with Germany and Japan and the world’s largest reinsurance funds [
