<p>Insurance is an arrangement in which a population at risk of some future loss makes a fixed certain payment—the premium—in return for financial protection against losses should they occur. If no loss occurs, the risk-averse person who “lost” the premium is still better off than experiencing the loss while paying no premium. That fixed premium payment can be used in two ways: (1) to compensate losers financially after a loss, holding the loss prospect constant and/or (2) funding ways to prevent or mitigate the loss, so that large financial losses are less common. I assume that the insurance metaphor for vaccines represents the second type (sometimes called “self-protection”). Yet, does the metaphor work—and are there other insurance alternatives to deal with this problem? In this paper, I will argue that not only does this metaphor limp much more than usual, but there are insurance alternatives that can replace or supplement investment in developing vaccines for uncertain future epidemics that should be considered.</p>
