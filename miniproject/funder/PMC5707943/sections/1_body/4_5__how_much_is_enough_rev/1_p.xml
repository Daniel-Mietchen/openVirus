<p>As already noted, a firm that needs (at minimum) to cover its costs from outside revenues will be challenged if it is possible that a vaccine that is expensive to develop and test is not needed. Either the cost of developing vaccines that turn out to be unneeded needs to be funded, or the revenues from those vaccines for which there is need because an epidemic breaks out will have to be high enough to cover past investment in vaccines for other diseases that did not occur and so failed to generate enough revenue to cover their R&amp;D costs. There are two reasons why the development of a vaccine might not cover its cost. Most obviously, the disease for which it is to be used may fail to appear in a reasonable period of time. Less obviously, the disease may appear but if there is timely and well planned use of the vaccine in the initially small population affected, the epidemic may be stopped in its tracks—which is good news except that it means that not much vaccine will be sold. To cover these losses, “profiteering” in terms of high pricing for a vaccine that is used after a pandemic is in progress is to be expected and accepted as a way of providing sufficient funding for R&amp;D investment of uncertain payoff and incentives to undertake that R&amp;D.</p>
