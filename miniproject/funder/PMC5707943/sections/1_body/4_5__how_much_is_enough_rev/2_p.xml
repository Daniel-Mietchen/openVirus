<p>This point—coping with potential losses from developing vaccines that turn out to be unneeded in large quantities—is the missing link in the vaccines-as-insurance metaphor. It is not enough to have vaccines when they are needed; instead, pricing or revenues for the global process of developing an inventory of approved vaccine concepts and materials must also be supported in some fashion. Accomplishing this task is something that actual insurance can help with. An organization that is large enough to invest in a portfolio of vaccines may itself be able to cover the wasted costs of vaccines that are not needed by making profits on those that are—but it would have to be permitted to do so.</p>
