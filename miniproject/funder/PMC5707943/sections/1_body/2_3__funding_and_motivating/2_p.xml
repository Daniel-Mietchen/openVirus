<p>Some nonprofit entrepreneurs have taken steps to develop organizations to perform the research and testing functions. For example, a former GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) scientist, who worked on developing an Ebola vaccine that eventually was not needed, has made efforts to create an entity to work on vaccines in a former GSK facility but has yet to secure adequate funding (beyond an apparently favorable rental arrangement with GSK). The plan is to invent vaccines and carry their development through Phase I and Phase II trials, with the expectation that the outbreak of an epidemic will provide the opportunity, the motivation, and influence at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to move the relevant vaccine through Phase III trials.</p>
