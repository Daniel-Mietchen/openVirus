<p>A challenge potentially easier to deal with is that of finding capacity to manufacture vaccines against an epidemic. If an entity is willing to bear the costs of regulation-required clinical trials and storage, there could be a stockpile of vaccines in case of emergency. Rules might be modified to permit the use of vaccine that has passed Phase II trials and to monitor for the less frequent harms that might occur when it is used on a population basis. Or, there could be mothballed capacity set aside for this purpose. Another possibility is to stockpile other medicines whose production facilities can be diverted to vaccine production in the event that a disease reaches epidemic level. In each case, the relevant variables are the cost of each strategy and their ability to deliver protection on a timely basis.</p>
