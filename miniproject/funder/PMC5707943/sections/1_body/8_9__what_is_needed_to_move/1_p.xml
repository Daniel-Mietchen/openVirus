<p>The most obvious necessity for making progress in reducing the risk of harm from epidemics is a recognition that something needs to be done, even when the world is not at present in the throes of some serious challenge. The cycle of a “fire drill” when a new infectious agent is identified—whether it ultimately leads to a harmful epidemic like Ebola or turns out to be false alarm like bird flu—followed by no activity as the threat recedes in time, until the next threat develops, may be human nature, but it should be avoided by planning ahead. That planning should move on two fronts: (1) the development of materials and methods to reduce the chances of harm or mitigate actual losses and (2) the simultaneous development of and coordination with financial insurance to create tools for mitigation and offset the losses of harms that can never be completely prevented.</p>
