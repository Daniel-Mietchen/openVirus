<p>Dr. Rino Rappuoli of GSK has proposed a program in which vaccine development against 30 diseases would be funded by all governments. This is a large enough portfolio that the risk of high losses from a vaccine that turns out to be unneeded can be mitigated. The remaining challenge here is likely to be willingness to pay, which in turn will depend on presenting evidence of net benefit from a program at this scale. There is also the issue of centralized planning by governments (which ones?) versus use of a market-based system where government fosters the development of insurances for firms and affected populations by setting or permitting adequate rewards to risk taking as opposed to government estimating and taking the risk itself.</p>
