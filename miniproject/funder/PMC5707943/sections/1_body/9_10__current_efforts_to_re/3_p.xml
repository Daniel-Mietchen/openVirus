<p>What exactly an entity like CEPI should do in terms of financing and insurance or risk reduction is purposely vague in the expert reports and statements. Technologically, the goal seems to be to develop a platform adaptable to the DNA and RNA of whatever specific virus emerges so that there can be a quick response, along with stockpiling hundreds of thousands of doses by Gavi, the international organization for vaccine policy. The intent seems to favor nonprofit organizations, but without recognition that uncertainty makes it very hard to hit the goal of breakeven precisely, and with almost no consideration of the prices or revenues that the entity doing the development might receive. There is some discussion of the partial insurance approach of gainsharing, but little elseâ€”hopes for ideal technology development and better planning of responses from a public health perspective put financing, incentives, and financial sustainability issues to the side.</p>
