<p>Timely availability of effective and approved vaccines to vaccinate at risk populations is clearly one of the responses that should be sought if possible. Here we have insurance that pays for vaccines that do turn out to be needed (as opposed to paying for ones that do not). How would the availability of this type of insurance fit into the vaccine development process? The key issue is the price to be paid. How large does it have to be to motivate supplying organizations to develop the vaccines that can be used in pre-planned responses? The answer to this puts us back on familiar ground—the payment must be enough to cover not only the R&amp;D costs of the vaccine that will be used, but also to cover as well the cost of providing the “option” of having a vaccine available that is never used. Determining that price will be a challenge, for some of the reasons already noted.</p>
