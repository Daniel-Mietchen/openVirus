<p>Current policy developments have not, to our knowledge, directly involved vaccine makers. Instead, they have taken the more direct route of developing mechanisms to make cash available to countries hit by an epidemic. Furthest along is a project in Africa, under the heading of “African Risk Capacity (ARC)” [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-14-01304" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ARC is part of a larger and longer running effort to make insurance for protection against climate disasters (drought, windstorms) available to farmers and other businesses in Africa. The intent is to develop a vehicle, funded by contributions from African governments and philanthropic organizations, that would make available, as a sovereign insurance product, the payment of timely early funds, so governments hit by an epidemic can fund an immediate response (rather than wait for the slower process of the application for assistance and mobilization of resources). This product is planned to be rolled out sometime in 2018. The development of methods to detect early signs of disease and specify trigger indicators that can start the flow of funds, which in turn can fund pre-planned response activities, is daunting but underway nonetheless.
