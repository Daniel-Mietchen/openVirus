<p>The idea that prices would be set so high that no one would be able to afford a vaccine that is being developed is nonsensical, since the firm can only make profits by setting the price low enough that some buyers are willing to pay it. However, it is true that, with government guarantee of monopoly, the price will be set higher than the cost of manufacturing the vaccine, and potentially higher than the R&amp;D costs. A nonprofit firm would not pose this threat, but neither would a for profit firm if a tight contract to develop an effective vaccine and make it available at a prespecified price could be written. Ultimately, the form of ownership depends on which type of firm can be more closely monitored. The provision of vaccines that could not be sold at a profit depends on donorsâ€™ willingness to make up any shortfall between revenues or prices and costs.</p>
