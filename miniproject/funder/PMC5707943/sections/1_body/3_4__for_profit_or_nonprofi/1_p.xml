<p>If a vaccine was developed by a profit maximizing firm that was able to secure both patent protection and FDA-granted exclusivity, the concern is that the price or revenue the firm would seek would make the vaccine unaffordable for those who need it if an epidemic strikes. Indeed, the possibility of “price gouging” in the face of a sudden surge in demand motivates much of the consideration of alternative development arrangements. The fear is that, if left to the private market, either no vaccine will be developed when an epidemic strikes because firms correctly calculate that patients do not have enough income to allow them to pay prices that will cover development costs or, if a vaccine is developed, the surge in demand will lead to prices and revenues that overcompensate investors by overcharging buyers.</p>
