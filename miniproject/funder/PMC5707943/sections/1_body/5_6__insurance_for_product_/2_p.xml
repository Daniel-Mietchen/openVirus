<p>Using insurance to hedge the risk that a product under development will have zero demand because its target never causes an epidemic may be an efficient and acceptable way to motivate upfront investment by non-philanthropic or philanthropic capital, since it avoids the possibility of wasting investment on a product that is never needed. A guarantee that risky investments will not lead to losses may attenuate incentives for the investing entity to be cautious in taking risk—so called “moral hazard”—so either partial risk sharing or serious supervision of investment choices may need to be built into the contract.</p>
