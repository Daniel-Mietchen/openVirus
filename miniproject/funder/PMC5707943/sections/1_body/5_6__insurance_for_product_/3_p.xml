<p>There is an alternative device that may help as wellâ€”mutual insurance. Suppose there are many firms developing different vaccines, whose funders have different views on the likelihood of an outbreak of any epidemic. If they nevertheless agree on a set of epidemics that are regarded as equally likely, they can set up a mutual insurance arrangement, with an initial pledge of funding close to the highest estimate of epidemic likelihood. Then, if fewer epidemics materialize so less insurance benefits need to be paid out of the pool than the worst-case expectation, the pool can pay out any surplus as a dividend.</p>
