<p>What is the trigger? Any insurance needs to specify the event or circumstances that trigger the payment of benefits, and ideally that event should be outside the control of those insured. Drought insurance, for example, uses data on rainfall (or the absence thereof) to trigger payments. What are the analogues for insurance against unneeded vaccines or insurance against actual pandemics? In both cases, there is objective information—the length of time a developed vaccine has remained “on the shelf”, or the frequency of cases of the disease. Yet, in both cases the insured entity might be able to manipulate the trigger—by choosing to develop vaccines against diseases that are unlikely to occur, or by allowing some cases of a contagious disease to go without treatment until the trigger number is reached. This distortion of incentives by insurance is a kind of moral hazard, and needs to be detected and prevented to the extent that is possible.</p>
