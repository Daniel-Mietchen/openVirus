<p>What if an epidemic turns into a pandemic? This question concerns the availability of capital to an insurer covering risks that are correlated. It is most severe for insurance against the cost of an epidemic that emerges, and occurs if the volume of losses to be covered is so great that the insurer does not have enough in reserves to pay for them. First line insurers like ARC will buy reinsurance to protect against this event, usually by specifying a maximum total amount they will pay out of their own resources before a reinsurer becomes liable. If epidemics, such as drought, only affect a limited geographic area at the time, there can be risk pooling across countries or areas within a continent or around the world. It will make sense for a reinsurer to write limited business in many different geographic locations to try to cope. Also, the worldwide pool of total capital is large enough that by pooling with other risks reinsurers it may be able to obtain substantial diversification. Fatally catastrophic bonds, where interest and principal are foregone if a pandemic strikes, is another way to tap the worldwide capital pool. Very high losses for product insurance are unlikely to occur unless contagious disease totally disappears. That is, it is unlikely that no vaccines will be needed for a substantial period of time.</p>
