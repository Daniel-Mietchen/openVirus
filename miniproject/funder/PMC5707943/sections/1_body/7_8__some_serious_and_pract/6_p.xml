<p>How closely should insurers monitor the insuredsâ€™ loss mitigation efforts? The ARC imagines that potential insured countries will work with it to establish efficient quick response procedures and other ways to reduce expected losses, by steps that either lower the probability that a disease strikes or the damage that it does. An insurer can give conditions that the offering of insurance will depend on the extent of pre-planned responsiveness. Alternatively, insurance may be offered but its premium surcharged if prevention efforts are judged to be below par.</p>
