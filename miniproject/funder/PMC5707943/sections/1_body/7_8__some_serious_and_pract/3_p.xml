<p>Where is the data for epidemic insurance? There is extensive data on the frequency of deaths at various ages stretching back decades. If insurers are willing to assume that the future will be similar to the past, such data can make it easy to estimate the premium or contribution that will cover the expected payoff. However, the availability of data to predict the frequency and severity of epidemics is both more limited and more specific (to the kinds of epidemics that occurred) than rainfall data. Insurers therefore will be somewhat apprehensive in offering coverage since they do not have the data that allows them to price it in a way that can be justified as (at least) likely to cover claims costs. This is not necessarily a fatal flawâ€”some insurers, such as Lloyds, are willing to offer cover for unique events, and mutual insurance is a way of dealing with uncertainty about loss probabilities if it is accompanied by certainty about which risks are the same.</p>
