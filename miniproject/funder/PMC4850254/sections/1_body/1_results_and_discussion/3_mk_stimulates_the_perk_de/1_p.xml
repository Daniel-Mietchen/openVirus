<p>As neither 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription of viral RNPs nor accumulation of viral RNAs in infected cells was altered by MK addition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), we assumed that the target of MK anti-influenza virus activity is cellular. To identify such a potential cellular target, we carried out deep-sequencing analysis of the cellular RNAs present in mock- or virus-infected human cells treated with MK or left untreated. Duplicate cultures of A549 cells were infected at 3 PFU/cell or mock infected and treated with 20 µM MK, a dose that neither affected cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) nor reduced cellular protein synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>), or left untreated. Deep-sequencing analysis was started by comparing the expression of cellular RNAs in virus-infected cells treated with MK or left untreated. When a false-discovery rate (FDR) of &lt;10
 <sup>−3</sup> was used as a statistical significance cutoff, a number of cellular genes were overexpressed in virus-infected cells upon MK treatment with changes ranging from 1.87- to 6.2-fold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, left side, red dots, and B). The potential interactions between the cellular genes identified in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref> were tested by using the STRING database, and several of them (ATF4, TRIB3, DDIT4, and ASNS) appeared to be connected in an interaction network, based on experimental, text mining, and database searching evidence (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref> in the supplemental material, where they are circled in red), and they all represent genes downstream of the PERK-mediated arm of the unfolded protein stress response (UPR) (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). To verify that the ATF6 and IRE1 arms of the UPR were also induced by MK treatment, the RNA accumulation of a number of their downstream genes was checked and none was upregulated in virus-infected cells upon MK treatment (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material; FLU-MK versus FLU). Thus, it could be concluded that MK specifically stimulates the PERK arm of the UPR during virus infection.
