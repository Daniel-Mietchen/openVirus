<p>When the gene set described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B</xref> was considered in the two alternative comparisons included in the experimental setting, it became clear that they were all overexpressed upon MK treatment of mock-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, middle, red dots, and B) and they were all downregulated in virus-infected versus mock-infected cells, albeit to a lesser extent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, right side, green dots, and B). For a direct comparison, these data are jointly represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C</xref> and all together indicate that MK treatment is able to restore the expression of this set of genes to the normal levels observed in untreated cells. To test whether MK treatment counteracts the downregulation of any gene as a consequence of virus infection, we selected those showing a fold change (FC) of less than −3 and an FDR of &lt;10
 <sup>−3</sup>. The alterations of the 15 genes identified upon MK treatment were analyzed, and the results indicate that MK treatment does not unspecifically counteract cellular genes downregulated by virus infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref> in the supplemental material).
