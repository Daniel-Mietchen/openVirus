<p>Influenza virus infection leads to the activation of a number of cell signaling pathways, including those dependent on NF-κB, Raf/MEK/ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> to 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Thus, the expression of some viral proteins leads to the phosphorylation of IκB and the subsequent activation of NF-κB (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), which participates in the cellular innate and inflammatory responses. However, inhibition of this pathway has been shown to interfere with virus replication (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), probably because of a defect in caspase-3 activity and the subsequent retention of progeny RNPs in the nucleus (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Similarly, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway appears to be important for late events in the virus replication cycle, since its inhibition also leads to the accumulation of progeny RNPs in the nucleus. In this case, an ERK-dependent phosphorylation event in the viral NP or cellular factors seems to fire RNP export as a result of the late accumulation of viral hemagglutinin at the cell surface (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). On the other hand, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by virus infection is bimodal. While an early burst of PI3K activation is induced by virus binding and is important for virus entry (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>), late stimulation was also observed, which is relevant to avoid the premature appearance of apoptosis and is induced by the viral NS1 protein (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Thus, the virus makes use of cellular pathways that normally participate in the cellular innate and inflammatory responses to stimulate specific events in its replication cycle.
