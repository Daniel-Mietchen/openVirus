<p>The mechanism by which MK elicits activation of the PERK-mediated UPR but not the ATF6- and IRE1-dependent arms is not clear at this time. Treatment with MK does not downregulate the GADD34/PPP1R15α regulatory cofactor, but it is able to counteract virus-induced GADD34/PPP1R15α overexpression (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>). Anyway, the use of MK in influenza virus-infected cells has uncovered the PERK-mediated UPR as a potential target for anti-influenza virus treatment, which would complement the various virus targets presently under development. In addition, being a cellular target, it may eventually be useful for inhibiting other fast-replicating RNA viruses.
