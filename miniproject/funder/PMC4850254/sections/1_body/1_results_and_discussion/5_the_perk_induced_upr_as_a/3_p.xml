<p>Interestingly, these findings were derived from data obtained after the treatment of infected cells with MK, a known drug that has long been used for the treatment of asthma in humans (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). When used at higher doses in influenza virus-infected human cells, MK preferentially reduced viral protein synthesis and accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) without altering virus transcription or splicing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material). These findings are consistent with the stimulation of PERK phosphorylation observed upon MK treatment of mock-infected cells and the reversal of the virus-induced downregulation of PERK phosphorylation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">C</xref>). Consistently, transcription of GADD34/PPP1R15α was not enhanced in virus-infected cells by treatment with MK (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref> in the supplemental material).
