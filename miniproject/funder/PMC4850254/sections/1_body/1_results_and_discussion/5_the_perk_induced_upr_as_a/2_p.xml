<p>Contrary to these findings, here we show that influenza virus infection leads to attenuation of the PERK-mediated UPR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">C</xref>) but does not induce general downregulation of the ATF6 or IRE1 arm of this stress response (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref> in the supplemental material). This is in contrast to previous studies showing the stimulation of ATF6- and IRE1-dependent UPR in virus-infected cells (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). However, those investigators analyzed UPR activation at very late times after infection (12 to 48 h), long after the virus infection cycle is finished (around 8 h). Here, we show clear downregulation of PERK phosphorylation as early as 6 h after virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">C</xref>). This observation is in line with the activation in influenza virus-infected cells of p58
 <sup>IPK</sup>, a cellular inhibitor of PKR that also inhibits PERK autophosphorylation (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>), although our data indicate a small transcriptional downregulation upon influenza virus infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). In addition, upregulation of the transcription of GADD34/PPP1R15α, a coactivator of PERK/eIF2α phosphatase, was observed in virus-infected cells (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>), which could also account for the reduced levels of PERK phosphorylation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">C</xref>).
