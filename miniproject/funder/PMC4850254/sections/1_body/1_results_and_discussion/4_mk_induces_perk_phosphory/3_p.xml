<p>It is no surprise that, acting as an inducer of PERK phosphorylation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>), MK showed up as an inhibitor in the screening based on virus RNP-based GFP expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>), led to preferential reduction of viral protein synthesis, and inhibited virus multiplication in cultured cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Consistent with these findings, treatment of influenza virus-infected cells with GSK-2656157, a specific inhibitor of PERK phosphorylation, led to a dose-dependent increase in viral protein synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">D</xref>). Although the rather low CC
 <sub>50</sub>-to-IC
 <sub>50</sub> ratio observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) precluded any use of MK as an influenza virus inhibitor, the results presented support the use of PERK phosphorylation as a target to limit virus multiplication. Being a cellular target, it would have a low probability of eliciting the appearance of resistant virus strains and could be considered complementary to those virus targets already shown to be effective or in the process of development. Conversely, alterations of the PERK-dependent UPR might lead to potential deregulation of other stress response pathways that may have side effects on the host cell. However, since influenza virus infection produces an acute disease that would require only short-term treatment, the consequences of these potential side effects might be less relevant. Although inhibition of other cell signaling pathways has been extensively considered for anti-influenza virus treatment (reviewed in reference 31), the PERK-driven UPR has not been described yet as a potential influenza virus target. However, inhibitors of eIF2α dephosphorylation have been shown to downregulate virus multiplication. Thus, the small molecule salubrinal has been reported to inhibit several PERK/eIF2αphosphatases (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) and be effective against HSV1 (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) and dengue virus infections (65; reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). Moreover, the inhibitor guanabenz (Wytensin), a drug used for a long time to treat hypertension, was shown to inhibit the GADD34/PPP1R15α-dependent PERK/eIF2α phosphatase specifically (67). Consistent with such action, we show here that treatment of influenza virus-infected cells with guanabenz results in partial inhibition of viral protein synthesis under conditions that do not affect general cellular protein synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">F</xref>).
