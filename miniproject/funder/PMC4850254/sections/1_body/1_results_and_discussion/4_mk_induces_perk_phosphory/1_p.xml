<p>The first step in the induction of the PERK-dependent UPR is the dimerization and autophosphorylation of PERK (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>), and the transcriptomic analysis shown above suggests that MK treatment stimulates PERK phosphorylation. To directly evaluate this possibility, we measured the amounts of P-PERK and total PERK in mock-infected and influenza virus-infected A549 cell cultures treated with various MK concentrations. As a control for PERK phosphorylation, the cultures were treated with thapsigargin, a well-known UPR stimulator (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and a clear increase in the levels of P-PERK was observed in both mock- and virus-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, C+). Treatment of normal cells with MK progressively induced PERK phosphorylation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, MOCK), while virus infection reduced the P-PERK levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, compare FLU with MOCK, untreated). Treatment of virus-infected cells with MK led to the restoration of P-PERK levels to those found in normal cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref>, compare lanes MOCK 0 and FLU 40). In agreement with the results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>, the NP accumulation was strongly reduced upon treatment with MK at 40 µM and, interestingly, it was also reduced upon treatment with thapsigargin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>, NP, C+). The quantitation of several experiments similar to that presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6B</xref> is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref> and indicates an opposite and statistically significant variation of PERK phosphorylation by virus infection and by MK treatment.
