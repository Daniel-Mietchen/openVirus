<p>Virus infection is among the various stimuli that induce the UPR, probably because of the rapid demand of protein synthesis and folding capacity made by the virus. Some viruses, like hepatitis C virus and many other positive-polarity RNA viruses, have evolved not only to resist the UPR but also to take advantage of it (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), much in the same way that influenza viruses have usurped other signaling pathways to optimize the replication cycle (see below). However, firing of the PERK-mediated UPR leads to protein synthesis attenuation by phosphorylation of the eIF2α translation factor and hence constitutes a strong limitation of the rapid demand exerted by acute influenza virus infection. To test whether other fast-replication viruses are inhibited by MK, we carried out experiments similar to that presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref> with the New Caledonia (H1N1) strain of influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Results showed that the protein synthesis of both viruses was strongly reduced under conditions that did not alter cellular protein synthesis (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5">Fig. S5</xref> in the supplemental material). This observation is in agreement with protein translation being the crucial step in MK-induced virus inhibition, as VSV is a cytoplasmic negative-stranded RNA virus with no nuclear phase.
