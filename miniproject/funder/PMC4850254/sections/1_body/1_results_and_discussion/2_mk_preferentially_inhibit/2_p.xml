<p>Next, we determined the effect of MK on the protein synthesis activity in mock- or virus-infected cells. Cultures of A549 cells were infected at 3 PFU/cell or mock infected and treated with various amounts of MK. At 6 hpi, the cells were labeled with [
 <sup>35</sup>S]methionine-cysteine for 1 h and total cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The results of a representative experiment are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref> and indicate partial inhibition of viral protein synthesis at 20 µM MK and almost complete inhibition at 40 µM. In contrast, cellular protein synthesis was almost unaltered at 20 µM MK and only marginally affected at 40 µM MK. These data result in a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of about 62 µM and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of around 24 µM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>), in good agreement with previous results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), and suggest that viral protein synthesis is the target of MK action during infection, although nucleocytoplasmic mRNA transport could not be excluded at this point (but see below).
