<p>To determine whether the reduction of virus protein accumulation observed under treatment with MK was due to an inhibition of virus transcription/replication or viral protein synthesis, we first measured the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity of recombinant RNPs treated with MK or left untreated. Recombinant mini-RNPs containing a 248-nucleotide (nt)-long template (clone 23 RNPs) were generated by transfection of viral polymerase, NP, and genomic plasmids into human HEK293T cells as previously described (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). As a negative control, parallel transfections were carried out in which the plasmid encoding the PB1 subunit of the polymerase was omitted. The RNA synthesis capacity of total cell extracts was determined in the presence of 20 µM MK or the corresponding amount of vehicle (DMSO) by quantification of the transcript generated, after separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis. An example of the results is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, and the quantitative data of several replicate experiments are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>. These results indicate that MK does not alter viral RNA synthesis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. To analyze viral RNA synthesis during infection, we carried out deep sequencing of virus-specific RNAs present in mock- or virus-infected human cells treated with MK or left untreated. We chose 6 hpi as the time point because viral transcription and replication are well under way in cells infected at a high multiplicity (3 PFU/cell) and a 20 µM concentration of MK because it is not toxic to the cells and leads to partial viral protein synthesis inhibition (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Duplicate biological replicates were subjected to Illumina sequencing after removal of rRNA. Analysis of the virus RNA sequences obtained verified that treatment with MK does not alter the accumulation of positive-polarity or negative-polarity viral RNAs during infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">D</xref>) and also indicated that the virus splicing process is unaltered by MK, since the M1/M2 and NS1/NEP mRNA ratios are indistinguishable under both experimental conditions (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref> in the supplemental material). To further verify whether viral transcription is altered by MK treatment, the accumulation of primary transcripts was determined by RT-qPCR of total cell RNA isolated from cells infected in the presence of cycloheximide, treated with MK or left untreated. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref> and confirm that MK does not affect influenza virus transcription.
