<p>To evaluate the toxicity and effectiveness of MK, cultures of A549 human cells were treated with a range of compound concentrations and cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay 48 h later. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and indicated a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 52 ± 2 µM. Parallel cultures were treated under the same conditions and infected with the VIC influenza virus strain at 0.001 PFU/cell. At 48 h postinfection (hpi), virus titers in the supernatants were determined by plaque assay in MDCK cells. The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref> and indicated a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of around 26 µM. It is important to mention that virus production in the presence of 40 µM MK was below the limit of detection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), in spite of only a marginal reduction in cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). To verify these results, cultures of A549 human cells were infected with the VIC influenza virus strain at 3 PFU/cell and treated with various MK concentrations and total cell extracts were prepared at 6 hpi. Under these conditions, no apparent cytotoxic effect on mock-infected cells was observed at any of the MK concentration used (data not shown) but the accumulation of viral NP showed a progressive decline, as determined by Western blotting, with an estimated IC
 <sub>50</sub> of around 25 µM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results indicate that MK is able to reduce influenza virus yields and reduces viral gene expression at nontoxic concentrations, in good agreement with the design of the screening procedure used, but indicates a selectivity index of around 2. Such a low selectivity index precludes the use of MK as a potential influenza virus inhibitor but still allows further studies to identify the target affected.
