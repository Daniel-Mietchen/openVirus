<p>To set up a screening platform, we adapted our previous know-how with viral replicon systems expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase to use a more versatile GFP marker. Recombinant RNPs containing the GFP-encoding gene in negative polarity were generated by transfection of viral RNA polymerase, NP, and genomic plasmids into human HEK293T cells as previously described (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). As a negative control, RNPs were prepared from which the plasmid encoding the PB1 subunit of the polymerase was omitted. In addition, we downscaled it to a 96-well plate format to carry out medium-throughput screening. After optimizing the transfection parameters and replication time, we could observe reproducible GFP expression in most of the cells in each culture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>, DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide]) and a very low background fluorescence level in the negative-control cultures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>, CTRL). To determine the quality of the screening system, multiple transfected cultures were analyzed for fluorescence signal, standard deviation, reproducibility factor, coefficient of variation, and signal-to-noise and signal-to-background ratios (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1">Fig. S1</xref> in the supplemental material, and the Z factor obtained indicates that the screening system developed is a fully suited assay. As a positive control for the inhibition of reporter expression, we used favipiravir (T-705), a well-known inhibitor of virus RNA replication (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> (T-705) and quantitated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, statistically significant inhibition was observed upon the addition of favipiravir 2 h after transfection (
