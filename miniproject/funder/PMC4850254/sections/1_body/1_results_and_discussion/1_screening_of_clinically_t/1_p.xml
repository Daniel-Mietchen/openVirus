<p>With the aim to identify new cellular targets for influenza virus inhibition, we reasoned that screening with a recombinant replicon system would address an early step in the virus replication cycle, namely, virus transcription/replication and/or gene expression, and hence provide a stage of virus infection more useful for inhibition. In addition, we reasoned that by using a restricted library of compounds that have been approved as drugs for human use would most probably ensure that a cellular target would be addressed.</p>
