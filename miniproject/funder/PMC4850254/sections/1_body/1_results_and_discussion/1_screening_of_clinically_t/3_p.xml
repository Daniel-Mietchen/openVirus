<p>We then used NIH libraries of approved drugs, including a total of 727 compounds, to perform screening in the system, always including negative (DMSO) and positive (T-705) controls in the same plate. We chose a dose of 50 µM for the first screening, as pilot tests indicated that less than 10% of the compounds led to toxicity or inhibition. A sample of the results obtained is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>. Most of the compounds were not active, but some of them abolished GFP expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, stars). Another group of compounds (
 <italic>n</italic> = 196) reduced GFP to levels similar to those obtained with T-705 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, arrowheads) and were selected for further analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). To verify their activity and rule out unspecific or toxic compounds, the screening was repeated with both the indicated GFP-based replicon system and a control system in which GFP expression was driven by a polymerase II promoter (i.e., was independent of any virus element). The compounds that showed potential toxicity (i.e., induced aberrant cell morphology or reduced the cellular mass of the cultures) were further tested at lower concentrations (3, 6, 12, and 25 µM). In this way, 22 compounds were selected that showed activity in the GFP-based replicon system but did not inhibit cellular GFP expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). Finally, these 22 compounds were tested for inhibition of virus replication in low-multiplicity infections with the VIC (H3N2) and WSN (H1N1) strains of influenza virus in two human cell lines, A549 and Huh7, of epithelial and hepatic origins, respectively. Two compounds were found to reproducibly reduce virus yields: ribavirin, a known wide-range virus inhibitor (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), and MK sodium (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2A</xref> in the supplemental material). To verify that MK was indeed able to reduce virus titers, the compound was purchased from a different provider, the identities of both the NIH Collection and the alternative compound were verified by mass spectrometry (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">Fig. S2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2">C</xref>) and the inhibition of virus multiplication was again verified by low-multiplicity infections as described above.
