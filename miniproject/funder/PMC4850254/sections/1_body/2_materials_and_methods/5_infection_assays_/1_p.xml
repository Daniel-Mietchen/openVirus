<p>Cells were infected with viruses at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) specified for each experiment. After 1 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with growth medium (DMEM–5% FBS) including the corresponding amount of MK, thapsigargin, GSK-2656157, guanabenz, or DMSO. Supernatants were harvested and used for virus titration by plaque assay in MDCK cells, or cell extracts were prepared for protein analysis.</p>
