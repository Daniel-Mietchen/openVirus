<p>Recombinant RNPs containing the clone 23 genomic RNAs were generated and amplified in 8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells by transfection of a mixture of plasmids expressing the polymerase subunits (pCMVPB1, 3 µg; pCMVPB2His, 3 µg; pCMVPA, 600 ng) and NP (pCMVNP, 12 µg) and a genomic plasmid (pHHclone23, 12 µg) by the calcium phosphate technique (
