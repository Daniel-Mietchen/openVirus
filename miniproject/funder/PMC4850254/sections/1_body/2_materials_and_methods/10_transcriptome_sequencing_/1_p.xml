<p>The quality of Illumina reads (50 nt) was checked with FastQC (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>). No additional read filtering was needed. TopHat2 (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>) was used to align all reads against a human (GRCh38) or influenza virus (A/Victoria/3/75 [H3N2]) genome. The htseq-count function of the HTSeq package (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>) was used to assign read counts with all of the human genes (GRCh38 Ensemble release 76). The DESeq2 package (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>) of the bioconductor project (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) was used to determine the statistical significance of the differential expression of genes, and the results are presented as adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> values (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>) based on two biological replicates per sample. Detection of outliers based on Cook’s distance was disabled (cooksCutoff = FALSE). FIESTA viewer (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) was used for real-time graphic evaluation of the application of different combinations of fold changes and FDR thresholds for filtering of gene expression results.
