<p>The HEK 293T cell line (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) was obtained from J. C. de la Torre, the A549 human cell line (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>) was obtained from J. A. Melero, and the Huh7 cell line (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>) was obtained from P. Gastaminza. The MDCK cell line was purchased from the ATCC. Cell culture was carried out as previously described (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Influenza virus strains A/Wisconsin/33 (H1N1) (WSN) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) and a recombinant virus containing the M, HA, and NA segments of WSN in the background of A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) (VIC) (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>) were used in these experiments. Titrations were done in MDCK cells as previously described (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). VSV was provided by R. Alfonso and titrated in BHK21 cells. Plasmids pCMVPB1, pCMVPB2, pCMVPA, and pCMVNP, expressing the influenza virus polymerase subunits and the NP, have been previously described (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Plasmid pHHclone23, a genomic plasmid expressing a deleted NS RNA segment (clone 23) (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) in negative polarity, was provided by R. Coloma. Antiserum specific for NP was generated by immunization of rabbits with recombinant NP (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). A polyclonal antibody specific for P-PERK (SC-32577) was purchased from Santa Cruz, and a monoclonal antibody specific for actin (ab8226) was purchased from Abcam. The secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were purchased from Sigma.
