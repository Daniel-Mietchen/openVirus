<p>To construct plasmid pHHGFP, a PCR fragment containing the gene for enhanced GFP flanked by the conserved sequences of the NS segment was amplified by using as primers 5′ TCAATCA
 <italic>CGTCTC</italic>TTATT
 <underline>AGTAGAAACAAGGGTGTTTT</underline> 3′ and 5′ CAGTATCA
 <italic>CGTCTC</italic>TGGG
 <underline>AGCAAAAGCAGGGTGACAAAG</underline> 3′, which contain the NS-specific sequences (underlined) and BsmBI restriction sites (italics). The PCR fragment was digested with BsmBI and ligated with BsmBI-digested plasmid pHH21 (
