<p>Quantification of primary transcription was carried out by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) as described previously (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). A 5.5-µl mixture containing 200 ng of total RNA and 10 pmol of a tagged primer specific for NP mRNA (5′ CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAATTGTCGTAC 3′) were heated for 10 min at 65°C, chilled immediately on ice for 5 min, and then heated again at 60°C. After 5 min, 14.5 µl of a preheated reaction mixture containing 4 µl of First-Strand Buffer (Invitrogen), 1 µl of 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 1 µl of a mixture of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (each at 10 mM), 1 µl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (50 U/µl; Invitrogen), 1 µl of RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor (40 U/μl; Promega), and 6.5 µl of saturated trehalose was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h. Real-time qPCR was performed with Power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). Four microliters of a 10-fold dilution of the cDNA was added to a qPCR mixture containing 10 µl of SYBR green qPCR SuperMix, 1.5 µl of forward primer (10 µM), 1.5 µl of reverse primer (10 µM), and 3 µl of double-distilled water. The sequences of the primers specific for the NP mRNA are 5′ CCAGATCGTTCGAGTCGT 3′ and 5′ GTCGTGCCCTCTTTTGACAT 3′. The PCR was carried out in a PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with 1 cycle of 50°C for 2 min, followed by 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 min and 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. The cycle threshold was determined with the SDS analytical software (Applied Biosystems).
