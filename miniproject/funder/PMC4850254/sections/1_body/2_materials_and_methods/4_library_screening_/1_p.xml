<p>Cultures of HEK293T cells in 96-well plates were transfected with a mixture of plasmids expressing the polymerase subunits (pCMVPB1, 3 ng; pCMVPB2His, 1.5 ng; pCMVPA, 2.5 ng) and NP (pCMVNP, 120 ng) and a genomic plasmid expressing a viral RNA-like GFP-encoding gene (pHHEGFP, 120 ng) by the calcium phosphate technique (

At 2 hpi, compound stock solutions were diluted to 50 µM in 100 µl of growth medium (DMEM–5% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) and this mixture was added to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 days, after which images of each well were collected on a Leica DMI 6000B with an ORCA-R2 digital camera (Hamamatsu). Images were acquired with a 10× (0.30 numerical aperture) objective and a resolution of 1,344 by 1,024 pixels. Quantification of the fluorescent signal was performed with the ImageJ software. Compound toxicity was determined by evaluating the metabolic activity of the cell biomass by the MTT cell viability assay (
