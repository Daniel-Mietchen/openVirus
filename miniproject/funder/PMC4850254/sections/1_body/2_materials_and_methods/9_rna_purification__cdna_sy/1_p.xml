<p>For RNA extraction, cell pellets containing 2.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNA was purified as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase (1 U/mg) for 1 h at 37°C, extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, and precipitated with ethanol. The purified RNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water, and the absorbance at 260 nm was measured (NanoDrop ND-1000). For deep sequencing, rRNA was removed with the Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit (catalog no. RZH1046; Illumina). Each RNA preparation was monitored with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). cDNA was synthesized with reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II, catalog no. 18064-014; Invitrogen) and random primers. The second strand of the cDNA incorporated dUTP instead of dTTP. Double-stranded DNA was subjected to A tailing and ligation of the bar-coded TruSeq adapters. Purification steps were done with AMPure XP beads. Library amplification was performed by PCR with the primer cocktail supplied in the kit. Final libraries were analyzed with Agilent DNA 1000 chips to estimate the quantity and check size distribution and were then quantified by qPCR with the KAPA Library Quantification kit (catalog no. KK4835; KAPA Biosystems) prior to amplification with Illumina cBot. Sequencing was done with Illumina HiSeq by using single reads of 50 nt.
