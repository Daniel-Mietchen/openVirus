<p>Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon filters. Western blotting was carried out essentially as previously described (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). The membranes were saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. For Western blotting of phosphorylated proteins, the membranes were saturated with 5% milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The filters were washed with PBS containing 0.25% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.25% Tween 20 for phosphorylated proteins) and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After further washing as described above, the filters were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The procedures for protein labeling 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> have been previously described (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). Cultures were washed, incubated for 1 h in a DMEM medium lacking methionine-cysteine, and labeled with [
 <sup>35</sup>S]methionine-cysteine to a final concentration of 50 µCi/ml. After incubation for 1 h, total extracts were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer and processed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For quantification of cell protein synthesis, the complete lanes were used, while quantification of viral protein synthesis was carried out with the specific protein bands indicated in the figures.
