<p>Early efforts in this direction came from the observation that some signaling pathways are altered during influenza virus infection (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and modulation of influenza virus multiplication was attempted with drugs designed to alter cell signaling (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These approaches reflect the general requirement of cellular pathways and biosynthetic machineries for virus multiplication that has been the subject of much attention in recent years. Thus, the identification of cellular factors important for influenza virus replication has been addressed by a number of different approaches, like targeted (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) or general (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) two-hybrid screens, as well as targeted proteomic analyses of virus-containing intracellular complexes (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) or purified virions (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In addition, genome-wide downregulation of cellular gene expression has identified a plethora of genes that can alter influenza virus multiplication (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>; reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). This information has been complemented with general analyses of the alterations in cellular gene expression induced by influenza virus infection, at either the RNA (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) or the protein (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) level. Knowledge derived from these virus-host interaction studies has fostered the search for inhibitors targeted to cellular factors that may serve as influenza antivirals (reviewed in references 50 to 53).
