<p>At present, two types of anti-influenza virus drugs are available, the adamantanes, which block the M2 ion channel, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, which interfere with virion release (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), as well as the polymerase inhibitor favipiravir (T-705) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), which has been recently approved in Japan. In addition, a number of other compounds have been described that are specific for targets related to virus transcription/replication and may become useful in the clinic in the future (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and others have been reported to inhibit virus-induced membrane fusion (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, a common problem for the virus target-directed antivirals is the generation of resistant virus strains. Most circulating influenza viruses are resistant to adamantanes, and virus strains resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors have been described upon clinical use (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) or independently of drug use (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Likewise, some of the potential new inhibitors have been shown to readily select for resistant mutants (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Hence, a large effort has been made to identify cellular targets that could be useful in indirectly reducing influenza virus multiplication and/or pathogenesis.
