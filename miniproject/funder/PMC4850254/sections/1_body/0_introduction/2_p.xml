<p>The genome of influenza A viruses is a set of eight single-stranded, negative-polarity RNAs that are assembled in ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) and incorporated into enveloped particles (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Upon entry into the infected cell, viral RNPs are imported into the nucleus, where viral transcription and replication take place. The first step in virus gene expression is transcription from the parental RNPs, and translation of these early viral mRNAs is essential for viral RNP replication (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). At least the virus nucleoprotein (NP) and polymerase (PB1, PB2, and PA proteins) are necessary to produce progeny RNPs (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). This process involves first the generation of complementary RNPs that serve as efficient templates for the production of large amounts of progeny RNPs (reviewed in references 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> to 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Progeny RNPs are then exported back to the cytoplasm and bud from the cell membrane (reviewed in reference 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
