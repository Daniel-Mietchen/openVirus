<p>Here we have taken an alternative approach to identify potential cellular targets for anti-influenza virus intervention. By screening collections of drugs approved for human use in a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based virus transcription-replication system, we identified Montelukast (MK) as an inhibitor of virus gene expression and validated these results in virus-infected cells. The selectivity index of MK was rather low, and hence, it is not a potential antiviral 
 <italic>per se</italic>, but we used it as a probe to identify the cellular target affected. By deep sequencing of RNA isolated from mock- and virus-infected human cells, treated with MK or left untreated, we showed that it counteracts the influenza virus-induced block in the PERK-mediated unfolded protein stress response. In agreement with these alterations in cellular gene expression, PERK phosphorylation was inhibited in infected cells but stimulated in MK-treated cells, and accordingly, inhibition of PERK phosphorylation led to increased viral gene expression. These results suggest the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response as a potential cellular target to modulate influenza virus infection.
