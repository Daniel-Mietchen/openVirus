  <p>Efficacy and toxicity of MK during influenza virus infection. (A) Cultures of human A549 cells were treated with the concentrations of MK indicated, and the mitochondrial activity of the cells was measured at 48 hpi with the MTT assay. (B) Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with the VIC virus strain at an MOI of 0.001 PFU/cell and treated with the concentrations of MK indicated. Virus titration was performed with samples obtained at 48 hpi. (C) Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with VIC at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell and treated with the concentrations of MK indicated. At 6 hpi, the accumulation of NP and β-actin was determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies. The quantification of the NP signal is represented at the bottom. The data in panels A and B are presented as averages and standard deviations of three independent biological replicates.</p>
