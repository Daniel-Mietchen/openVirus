  <p>Lack of alteration of genes downregulated by virus infection upon MK treatment. Shown are the genes downregulated by influenza virus infection (FLU versus MOCK; cutoff values, FC of less than −3 and FDR of &lt;10
   <sup>−3</sup>) and the lack of their modification by treatment with MK (FLU-MK versus FLU, MOCK-MK versus MOCK). The identification (ID) code in the Ensembl database is specified, as well as the FC and the FDR.
