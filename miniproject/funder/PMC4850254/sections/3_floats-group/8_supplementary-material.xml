  <p>Splicing of influenza virus mRNA is not altered by MK treatment. Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with influenza virus at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell and then treated with 20 µM MK or the corresponding amount of DMSO. Total cell RNA was isolated at 6 hpi, and rRNA was removed. Viral RNA of each segment was determined by deep sequencing and classified according to the virus segment and polarity. The splicing efficiencies of segments 7 (M2/total M) and 8 (NEP/total NS) are presented as reads in splice junctions versus the total reads in each segment mRNA. Download </p>
