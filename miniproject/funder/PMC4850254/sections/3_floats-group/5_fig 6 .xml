  <p>MK treatment reverses influenza virus-induced PERK dephosphorylation. (A) Scheme of pathways activated by accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The pathways activated by ATF6, PERK, and IRE1 are indicated. Most relevant for this study, the PERK-dependent pathway is highlighted, including the eiF2α-dependent translation block and the downstream genes identified here as upregulated by MK treatment in virus-infected cells. (B) Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with VIC virus at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell (FLU) or mock-infected (MOCK) and treated with 20 or 40 µM MK or 1 mM of thapsigargin (C+). At 6 hpi, the accumulation of P-PERK, total PERK, NP, and β-actin was determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies. (C) The quantification of the P-PERK signal is presented as the average and standard deviation of five determinations. Significance of differences between treated cells and untreated mock-infected cells (black stars), between treated and untreated virus-infected cells (red stars), and between infected cells and mock-infected cells without treatment (blue stars) was determined by the Student
