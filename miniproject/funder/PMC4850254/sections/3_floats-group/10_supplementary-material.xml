  <p>MK inhibits viral protein synthesis. Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with the New Caledonia (H1N1) or VIC (H3N2) strain of influenza virus or with VSV at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell and then treated with 40 µM MK or the corresponding amount of DMSO. At 6 hpi, the cultures were pulse-labeled with [
   <sup>35</sup>S]methionine-cysteine and total protein extracts were prepared. (A) The samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The mobility of some of the virus-specific proteins (stars for influenza virus and arrows for VSV) is indicated to the right. (B) Quantification of the signals of DMSO-treated (blue) and MK-treated (red) samples. Download
