  <p>Functional protein association network of the genes differentially expressed in influenza virus-infected cells upon treatment with MK. Shown is the protein-protein interaction network as visualized by the STRING database. The nodes represent proteins, red circles contain most of the proteins differentially expressed in influenza virus-infected cells upon treatment with MK, and the lines represent the predicted functional associations. The associations were inferred from several types of evidence from the STRING database: the presence of experimental evidence (pink line), text mining evidence from abstracts of the scientific literature (yellow line), information from databases (light blue), sequence homology (light gray), co-occurrence evidence (dark blue), and coexpression evidence (dark gray).
