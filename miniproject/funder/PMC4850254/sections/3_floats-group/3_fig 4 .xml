  <p>MK treatment preferentially inhibits influenza virus-specific protein synthesis. Cultures of human A549 cells were infected with influenza virus strain VIC (FLU) at an MOI of 1 to 3 PFU/cell and treated with the concentrations of MK (A and B), GSK-2656157 (GSK) (C, D), or guanabenz (GNZ) (E and F) indicated. At 6 hpi, the cultures were pulse-labeled with [
   <sup>35</sup>S]methionine-cysteine and total protein extracts were prepared. The samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. (A, C, E) Autoradiographs of polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels from representative experiments are presented. The mobility of some of the virus-specific proteins is indicated to the right. (B, D, F) Quantification of the signals of cellular proteins (red) and viral proteins (gray) at the MK, GSK, or GNZ concentrations indicated. The average and standard deviation of three independent experiments are presented. Significance of treated-infected versus nontreated-infected cells (black stars) or mock-infected versus infected cells (gray stars) was determined by the Student
