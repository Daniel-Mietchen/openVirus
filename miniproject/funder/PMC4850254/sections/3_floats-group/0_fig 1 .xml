  <p>Recombinant GFP-based screening for influenza virus inhibitors. Cultures of human HEK293T cells in 96-well plates were used to reconstitute a GFP minireplicon system and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or favipiravir (T-705). As a control, similar experiments were performed without the PB1 subunit of the viral polymerase (CTRL). (A) Fluorescence images. (B) GFP fluorescence values of DMSO-treated wells (blue), T-705-treated wells (gray), and individual wells treated with specific compounds from the NIH library (green). The blue and gray horizontal bars indicate the averages of DMSO- or T-705-treated wells, and the corresponding shadowed zones indicate the standard deviations. Specific compounds that are potentially toxic (stars) or inhibitors of GFP expression (triangles) were identified. AU, arbitrary units. (C) Overview of the screening process. Out of 727 specific compounds from the NIH libraries, 495 did not alter the GFP signal, 36 compounds increased the GFP signal, and 196 decreased the GFP signal. These 196 compounds were used for counterscreening for toxicity and specificity. Cultures of human HEK293T cells in 96-well plates were transfected with plasmid pCAGGsGFP or used to reconstitute RNP-GFP and treated individually with the 196 candidate compounds. Fourteen compounds showed no toxicity, and 16 were partly toxic and were tested at lower concentrations. Finally, 22 compounds decreased the GFP signal in the context of the replicon system (RNP-GFP) but not in the context of an RNA polymerase II-dependent system (pCAGGsGFP). These 22 compounds were used for inhibition of infection of A549 and Huh7 cells with the VIC and WSN strains. Only ribavirin, a known inhibitor of influenza virus infection, and MK reduced virus yields under all of the conditions analyzed.</p>
