  <p>Characterization of the MK preparation used for screening. (A) Chemical structure of MK obtained from the PubChem database (CID 23663996) corresponding to the formula C
   <sub>35</sub>H
   <sub>35</sub>ClNNaO
   <sub>3</sub>S and a molecular mass of 608.16 g/mol. The mass spectra of samples of the compound MK obtained from the NIH library (B) and AKOS GmbH (C), as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--time of flight tandem mass spectrometry, are shown. Peaks correspond to ionized fragments of the compound generated by laser irradiation and separated by mass/charge ratios with a mass spectrometer. Download
