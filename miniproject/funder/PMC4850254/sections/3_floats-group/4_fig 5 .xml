  <p>The PERK-dependent unfolded protein response pathway is differentially altered by influenza virus infection or MK treatment. Cultures of A549 cells were infected with influenza virus at an MOI of 3 (FLU) or mock infected (MOCK) and treated with 20 µM MK or not treated. At 6 hpi, total nonribosomal RNA was subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. The results were standardized by the total number of reads per sample. The use of total histone mRNA reads for standardization led to similar results. (A) FIESTA diagrams (
   <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) indicating the number of differentially expressed human genes across the comparison of MK-treated versus DMSO-treated infected cells (left side), MK-treated versus untreated mock-infected cells (middle), and infected versus mock-infected cells (right side). On the left side, the genes with an FDR of &lt;10
   <sup>−3</sup> and an FC of &gt;1.7 are shown with red dots. The yellow dot corresponds to a pseudogene with an FDR of &gt;5.10
   <sup>−3</sup>. The position of this set of genes in the other comparisons is marked in red (middle) or green (right side). (B) Table with the products of the genes marked with red dots on the left side of panel A. The FC and FDR are presented for each of the comparisons shown in panel A. (C) The accumulation of RNA for the genes listed in panel B, obtained from DMSO-treated (blue), MK-treated (red), mock-infected (−), or influenza virus-infected (+) cells by deep sequencing, is shown (number of reads standardized as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>). The data are presented as the average and range of two independent biological replicates.
