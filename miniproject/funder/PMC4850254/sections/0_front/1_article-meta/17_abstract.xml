 <title>IMPORTANCE</title>
 <p>Influenza A viruses are responsible for annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with important consequences for human health and the economy. The unfolded protein response is a defense mechanism fired by cells when the demand of protein synthesis and folding is excessive, for instance, during an acute virus infection. In this report, we show that influenza virus downregulates the unfolded protein response mediated by the PERK sensor, while Montelukast, a drug used to treat asthma in humans, specifically stimulated this response and downregulated viral protein synthesis and multiplication. Accordingly, we show that PERK phosphorylation was reduced in virus-infected cells and increased in cells treated with Montelukast. Hence, our studies suggest that modulation of the PERK-mediated unfolded protein response is a target for influenza virus inhibition.</p>
