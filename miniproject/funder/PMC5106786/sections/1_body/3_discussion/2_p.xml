<p>Other studies have examined RSV epidemics and individual-level factors that are related with higher RSV risk; risk factors associated with RSV have included sharing bedrooms and having more than 4 children in a house [

These measures of crowding could have a similar influence on RSV incidence as population density and population density of children &lt;5 years old. The basic reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>, a measure of transmissibility) of RSV has also been shown to be significantly associated with population density [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which could help explain the finding of seasonal RSV epidemics happening earlier in urban areas. Population density and percent of the population that was black are correlates of urbanicity and socioeconomic status of the population in Connecticut. These are likely also correlates of other characteristics of the population that affect the intensity of transmission. For instance, more frequent contacts in dense urban areas or larger household sizes could lead to increased transmission and more rapid epidemic growth.
