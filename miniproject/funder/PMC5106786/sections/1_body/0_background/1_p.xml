<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of hospitalizations in children worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most children will have an RSV infection before 2 years of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; however, certain high-risk groups are at an increased risk of severe RSV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Prophylaxis (Palivizumab) can be given to high-risk groups including infants less than 12 months old at the beginning of RSV season who were born premature (earlier than 29 weeks gestation), infants with some congenital pulmonary and heart diseases, and immunocompromised infants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Palivizumab has been available since 1998, and has been shown to be moderately effective in lowering the risk of RSV hospitalization [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Each dose of Palivizumab protects for approximately 5 weeks; up to five doses are given to provide protection for high-risk infants, and the timing of these doses needs to coincide with the RSV season. Starting prophylaxis too soon is an inefficient use of resources, as the cost of Palivizumab is high and the risk of infection is low before the seasonal RSV epidemic begins; starting prophylaxis too late can put susceptible infants at risk for a severe RSV infection as they would not be protected when local RSV transmission begins. To optimize the use of resources and maximize the protection afforded to high-risk infants, it is critical to understand variations in RSV epidemic timing between locations so that prophylaxis can be appropriately timed [
