<p>Across all ZIP codes, the average seasonal RSV peak occurred 29.68 weeks after July 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The seasonal peaks among ZIP codes ranged from 27.07 weeks after July 1 to 31.71 weeks after July 1. Large differences in RSV incidence between ZIP codes were also present, as measured by an incidence rate ratio comparing incidence in each ZIP code to the average incidence for the state of Connecticut. The incidence rate ratio varied from 0.18 to 5.18, reflecting rates that were approximately 5-fold above or below average (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). Seasonal peak timing and incidence rate ratio were significantly and negatively correlated with one another (earlier peak timing in ZIP codes with higher incidence; r = -0.35, 95 % C.I. -0.46, -0.24).
