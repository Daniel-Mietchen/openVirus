<p>Finally, a multivariable model was used to evaluate these relationships. Population density &lt;5 years old and proportion black were independently associated with peak timing. A 1-log increase in population density &lt;5 years old was associated with a peak timing of 0.11 weeks earlier (95 % C.I. -0.18, -0.04 weeks); a 1-log increase in proportion black was associated with the seasonal RSV epidemic peaking 0.13 weeks earlier (95 % C.I. -0.20, -0.06).</p>
