<p>Seasonal RSV epidemics that peaked earlier were associated with higher population density &lt;5 years old (r = -0.45, 95 % C.I. -0.54, -0.34) and higher proportion of the population that is black (r = -0.46, 95 % C.I. -0.55, -0.36). A similar relationship was seen with incidence rate ratios. ZIP codes with higher RSV incidence were associated with higher population density &lt;5 years old (r = 0.46, 95 % C.I. 0.46, 0.55) and proportionally larger black populations (r = 0.58, 95 % C.I. 0.49, 0.65).</p>
