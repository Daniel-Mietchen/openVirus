<p>Among children &lt;2 years old hospitalized for RSV, annual RSV incidence in children &lt;6 months old (176.26 cases per 10,000, 95 % C.I. 161.14, 191.39) was more than three times the annual incidence among children 6-12 months old and more than nine times the annual incidence among children 1-2 years old (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The annual incidence of RSV was highest in ZIP codes where the population density was in the highest quintile (103.27 cases per 10,000, 95 % C.I. 95.71, 110.83). The annual incidence in ZIP codes where at least 20 % of the population was black was more than twice that of ZIP codes where &lt;5 % of the population was black (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Annual RSV incidence in New Haven County (116.30 cases per 10,000, 95 % C.I. 105.84, 126.76) was almost double the incidence in any other county (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
