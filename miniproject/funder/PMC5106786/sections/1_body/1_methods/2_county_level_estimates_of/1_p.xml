<p>A harmonic regression analysis was first conducted to evaluate how timing of RSV epidemics differed between the eight counties in Connecticut [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. With harmonic regression, sine and cosine waves with a specified periodicity (e.g. 52 weeks) are fit to the data. The regression coefficients can then be transformed to obtain estimates of the average amplitude and the average temporal shift (phase) in the curves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Using the county-level data, we fit Poisson regression models with sine and cosine terms that had a period of 52 weeks; the data did not show evidence of overdispersion (deviance/degrees of freedom was near 1), so Poisson regression, rather than negative binomial regression, was appropriate. The average peak timing of the annual epidemics and 95 % confidence interval were estimated for each county [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Annual incidence was calculated using the mean annual number of RSV hospitalizations and a proportion of the county population &lt;5 years old to estimate the county population &lt;2 years old [(Mean annual cases / (0.4*population &lt;5))*10,000].
