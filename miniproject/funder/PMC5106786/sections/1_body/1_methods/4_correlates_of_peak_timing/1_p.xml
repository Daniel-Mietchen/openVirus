<p>We explored associations between ZIP-code-level variations in peak-timing or incidence rate ratios and demographic characteristics. To do this, we used a second stage model, where the estimates of peak timing and incidence from the ZIP code-level hierarchical model were used as the outcome variable. The demographic characteristics that were evaluated were population density of children &lt;5 years old and proportion of the population that is black. We calculated the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) to evaluate univariate associations and used linear regression to fit a multivariable model.
