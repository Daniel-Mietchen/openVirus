<p>The NGS yielded 4,627,078 reads with a median of 186,381 [IQR 157,296â€“204,495] reads per sample. For each patient, five consensus ultra-deep sequences with a prevalence cutoff of 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% and 15% were obtained by geno2pheno, and NS5A haplotype sequences were constructed by Quasirecomb. NGS confirmed infection with GT1b in all individuals. No cases of other genotype/subtype coinfections were present, with no additional minority non-GT1b variants, at all NGS cutoffs used. </p>
