<p>Among the 28 patients analysed by Sanger sequencing, NS5B, NS3 and NS5A sequences were obtained for 23, 22 and 21 patients, respectively. The NS5A ultra-deep-sequencing was then performed in 15 patients with a positive amplification product, nine with acute infection and six with chronic infection, all putatively involved in TCs harboring HCV NS5A resistance.</p>
