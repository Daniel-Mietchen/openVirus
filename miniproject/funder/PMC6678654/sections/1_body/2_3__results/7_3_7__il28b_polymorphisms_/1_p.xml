<p>To better characterize a potential virus-host interaction, we also investigated the relationship between human polymorphisms IL-28B rs12979860 and the presence of Y93H, the nucleotide sequence variability (NSV) and the Shannon entropy. Among the 15 patients analysed, the IL-28B information was available for 14 patients (13 of whom were involved in the clusters, see 
 <xref rid="cells-08-00666-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Overall, CC polymorphism was present in seven patients and CT polymorphism in the remaining seven patients. No specific relationship between IL-28 (CC and CT) and Y93H, NSV and Shannon Entropy were identified with any statistically significant difference (
