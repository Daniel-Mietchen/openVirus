<p>Furthermore, in order to better characterize the variants transmission, we analysed common patterns of variants shared between patients within the same cluster. For each cluster, common patterns of variants were identified (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-08-00666">Table S1</xref>). The number of mutations and common patterns differed according to the different cutoff of detection of minority variants used and whether the cluster was composed only of patients with acute HCV infection, acute and chronic HCV infection, or only chronic HCV infection. A higher number of mutations was observed in chronic HCV infected patients at 1% cutoff (a median of 20.5 mutations vs a median of 13 mutations in acute patients). A higher number of common patterns was observed in clusters made up of patients with only acute or acute and chronic HCV infection at a 15% cutoff (&gt;81.82% vs. 56.21 in the cluster of only chronic HCV infected patients). Interestingly, cluster 4, containing one acute patient and the only chronic patient who had previously failed a DAA regimen, was the cluster with the highest percentage of sequence similarity within the common patterns (81.82% at 1% cutoff and 100% at 15% cutoff) whereas cluster 3, composed of only chronic patients, was the cluster with lowest percentage of sequence similarity (39.11% at 1% cutoff and 56.21% at 15%) (
