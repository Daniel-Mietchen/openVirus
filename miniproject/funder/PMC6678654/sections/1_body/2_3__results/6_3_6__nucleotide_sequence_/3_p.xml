<p>Interestingly, different Shannon Entropy median values were also observed between HCV sequences of acute onco-hematologic-patients vs HCV sequences of acute β-thalassemia-patients (Sn median 0.55 [IQR 0.54–0.60] vs median 0.34 [IQR 0.27–0.36]

This observation was also confirmed as a significant trend by analysing the intra-host NSV between the two groups of HCV acute patients with the two different diseases (see
