<p>The Shannon entropy showed a similar trend, with generally higher values in patients with chronic HCV infection vs patients with acute HCV infection, however, significantly higher values were observed only when comparing β-thalassemia patients with chronic infection versus β-thalassemia patients with acute HCV infection (Sn median HCV chronic 0.66 [IQR 0.60–0.81] vs Sn median HCV acute 0.34 [IQR 0.27–0.36] 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between Sn values from HCV acute onco-hematologic-patients vs HCV chronic β-thalassemia-patients (Sn median 0.55 [IQR 0.54–0.60] and Sn median 0.66 [IQR 0.60–0.81], respectively).
