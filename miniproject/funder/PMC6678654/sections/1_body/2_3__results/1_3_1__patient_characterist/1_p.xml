<p>This study included 28 HCV infected patients followed in two Italian hospitals (15 males, 53.5%) with a median age of 43 years [IQR 34–52]. For diagnostic purposes, a genotypic test based on the Sanger sequencing of NS3, NS5A and NS5B was performed. All patients were infected with GT1b. Median log serum HCV-RNA was 4.9 [IQR 3.3–6.0] IU/mL, while median [IQR] ALT and AST values (available only for the patients with acute infection) were 485 [IQR 255–718] IU/L and 271 [IQR 85–547] IU/L, respectively. The rate of IL-28B rs12979860 genotype was CC (50.0%), CT (39.2%) and TT (7.1%). The clinical and virological characteristics of the 28 patients included in the study are shown in
