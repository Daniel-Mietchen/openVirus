<p>Sanger sequencing showed no RASs in any NS3 and NS5B genes analyzed, with the exception of S122T, a polymorphism associated with resistance to NS3-inhibitors, which was found in four onco-hematologic patients, forming cluster 5. Instead, in the NS5A gene, the R30Q, L31M and/or Y93H were detected by both sequencing analyses in seven patients (
