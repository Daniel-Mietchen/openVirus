<p>Using NGS, no additional minority NS5A-resistant variants were identified at any of the cutoffs used. The NS5A-RAS Y93H was observed in seven out of 15 patients analyzed. Particularly, three out of nine patients (33.3%) with acute infection and four out of six patients (66.6%) with chronic infection presented RAS. This mutation was observed in all five transmission clusters, even if it was not shared by all the patients involved in the same cluster. In transmission cluster 2, the Î²-thalassemia patient with chronic HCV infection showed the Y93H at 32.9% of intra-patient prevalence, but this mutation was not present in the other two HCV acute patients, involved in the same cluster (NGS cutoff up to 1%).</p>
