<p>To characterize the transmission clusters, a Bayesian analysis was performed in 15 patients by using both Sanger and NGS NS5A sequences. Specifically, for NGS NS5A sequences, haplotypes and five different consensus sequences (obtained at cutoff of 15%, 10%, 5%, 2% and 1%) were used for each patient. Among the 15 patients analyzed, five transmission clusters involving 14 patients were identified: four onco-hematologic patients with HCV acute infection, four β-thalassemia patients with acute infection and six β-thalassemia patients with chronic infection. In onco-hematologic patients, only one transmission cluster was observed involving four HCV acute patients (Pt11-Pt12-Pt13-Pt15) while one patient (Pt14) was not involved in the cluster. The other transmission clusters involved patients with β-thalassemia. One cluster involved three HCV chronic patients (Pt6-Pt7-Pt9) and three transmission clusters included both acute and chronic HCV infected patients (Pt1-Pt2; Pt3-Pt4-Pt5; Pt8-Pt10). Bayesian phylogenetic trees for the two groups of patients are shown in
