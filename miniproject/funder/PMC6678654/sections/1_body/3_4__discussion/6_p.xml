<p>This observation can be explained by the compromised immune system of patients with onco-hematologic disease, who did not in fact develop anti HCV antibodies after the infection (also at the last follow-up visits). These patients therefore fought the spread of the virus less efficiently, thus allowing it to change more easily with high replication turn-over, similar to that which would occur in a patient with a chronic infection. For instance, the HCV-RNA levels corresponding to the samples of HCV sequencing of the acute patients with onco-hematologic disease were higher than the levels observed in the acute HCV infected patients with β-thalassemia. On the other hand, the patients with β-thalassemia during the acute infection were under strong immune pressure, effectively limiting the viral replication over such a short period, and as a consequence also limiting variability and heterogeneity. </p>
