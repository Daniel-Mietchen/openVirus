<p>In conclusion, even though this study is limited to a small number of individuals, we highlighted the presence of nosocomial transmission clusters in patients with a diagnosis of acute HCV infection. Transmission of treatment resistant HCV variants in some cases occurred, and the transmission/maintenance of Y93H RAS in acute infected individuals was independent of the IL-28 polymorphism. We also observed a differential degree of HCV sequence variability and heterogeneity, which was higher in patients with chronic HCV infection, followed by immunocompromised patients during acute infection, and lower in immunocompetent patients during the acute HCV infection. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms driving the intra host interactions and the transmission/maintenance of resistance. </p>
