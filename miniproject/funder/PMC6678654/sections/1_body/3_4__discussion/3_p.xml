<p>To uncover the potential mechanisms of the intra-host variability observed within the nosocomial transmission clusters identified, we investigated the relationship between Y93H and the IL-28 polymorphisms in the rs12979860 gene. A previous study analysing the prevalence of resistant variants in a large European population of HCV infected individuals, in correlation to SNPs in IFNL4, in fact showed that the NS5A resistant variant Y93H was detected frequently in HCV GT 1b (14%) and it was significantly associated with the beneficial rs12979860 IL-28B polymorphism CC [

In our study, however, probably due to the limited numbers of cases analysed, even though all the individuals were infected with HCV GT 1b, we did not find any specific and statistically significant association between Y93H and the IL-28B polymorphism CC.
