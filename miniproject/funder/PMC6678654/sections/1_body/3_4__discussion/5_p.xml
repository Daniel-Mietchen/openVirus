<p>Analyzing both groups (acute vs chronic infection), with respect also to the underlying disease (β-thalassemia vs onco-hematologic disease), the HCV sequence heterogeneity, measured as Shannon Entropy, was significantly higher in chronic HCV patients in comparison to patients with acute infection, but only in the presence of β-thalassemia (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Significantly higher Shannon entropy was also observed analysing the sequences of HCV acute patients with onco-hematologic disease respect to HCV acute patients with β-thalassemia. Instead, similar levels of sequence heterogeneity were observed between HCV acute patients with onco-hematologic disease and chronic HCV patients with β-thalassemia.
