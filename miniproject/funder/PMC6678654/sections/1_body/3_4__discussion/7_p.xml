<p>It is worth mentioning that the only β-thalassemia patient with HCV chronic infection that previously failed a DAA-treatment (Pt8) had a low value of Shannon Entropy, at similar levels to that observed in the other acute patients with β-thalassemia (Sn in Pt8 0.38 versus Sn median in HCV acute β-thalassemia patients 0.34 [IQR 0.27–0.36]) (
 <xref rid="cells-08-00666-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and this could be the consequence of the strong pharmacological pressure that allowed the selection and transmission of the resistant variants to the patient with acute HCV infection belonging to the same transmission cluster (TC4). Cluster TC4 was in fact the cluster with the highest percentage of common patterns at all of the cutoffs analysed (from 81.8% at 1% to 100% at 15%).
