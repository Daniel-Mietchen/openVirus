<p>To better characterize the virus host interactions, we also analysed the HCV variability and Shannon entropy in individuals with acute HCV infection in comparison to individuals with chronic infection. As expected, the NSV was significantly higher in patients with chronic HCV infection versus patients with acute infection, at all cutoffs tested (
