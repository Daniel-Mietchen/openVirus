<p>Specific NS5A RASs (R30Q, L31M and/or Y93H) were previously observed using Sanger sequencing in all five transmission clusters. Through NGS, the patterns of resistance were confirmed, and no additional minority NS5A-resistant variants were identified at any of the cutoffs used (up to 1%). In all clusters at least one patient showed the Y93H, even if it was not shared within all patients involved in the same transmission cluster. This RAS was present overall in 37.5% of patients with acute HCV infection and in 66.7% of patients with chronic HCV infection. This prevalence is quite high, in all probability due mainly to these existing nosocomial transmission events. In fact, this level of prevalence is higher than the natural prevalence recently reported in a large Italian cohort of DAA na√Øve patients infected with HCV GT1b, which was around 10% [

In one cluster (TC2) the patient with chronic HCV infection showed the Y93H at 32.9% of intra-patient prevalence, and this mutation was not present in the other two patients with acute HCV infection, who were in the same transmission cluster. In this case, it can be presumed that the wild-type variant from the individual with the chronic infection (around 70% of intra-patient prevalence) was the major variant transmitted in the two individuals who acquired the acute HCV infection. In contrast, the patients with acute HCV infection found in transmission clusters TC1 and TC4 showed the same RAVs, with the same high intra-patient prevalence rate, as observed in the patients with chronic HCV infection belonging to the same clusters (&gt;97.0%). In both cases, there is virological evidence of resistance transmission. For instance, in TC4, the patient with a chronic infection (Pt8) had previously failed a DAA treatment containing a NS5A inhibitor (grazoprevir/elbasvir) and developed at failure a resistant HCV with three NS5A RASs (R30Q, L31M and Y93H), which was fully transmitted to the patient who acquired the acute HCV infection (Pt10). Even if this case is, to our knowledge, the first case of nosocomial transmission of an HCV resistant variant, it is important to mention that a case of the transmission of an HCV NS3 resistant variant from a telaprevir treated patient to his sexual HIV positive partner has already been observed.
