<p>At present, HCV is classified into eight major genotypes and at least 100 subtypes [

 <xref rid="B13-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The worldwide distribution and prevalence of each HCV genotype (GT) vary depending on geographical region. A recent global survey found that GT 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b predominate in Europe, North America, and Australia) and GT 3 (primarily found in South Asia, particularly the Indian sub-continent) are the most prevalent, accounting for 46% and 30% of all infections, respectively. The GT 2 (prevalent in Western Africa), GT 4 (prevalent in the Middle East and North and Central Africa), GT 5 (prevalent in South Africa) and GT 6 (prevalent in Southeast Asia) accounted for 9%, 8%, 1% and 6%, respectively. The GT 7 (in Central Africa) and GT 8 (from the Punjab, in India) were found in a few individuals [
