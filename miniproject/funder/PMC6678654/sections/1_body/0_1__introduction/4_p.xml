<p>At intra-host level, HCV is genetically diverse and exists as a quasispecies defined by several closely related yet genetically distinct populations [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The extremely high intrinsic genetic variability of HCV is a consequence of its high mutational rate and replication turnover, along with a lack of proof-reading activity of viral polymerase. As a result of this phenomenon, a natural emergence of resistance associated variants (RAVs) against direct acting antivirals (DAA) can arise and may compromise treatment [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is a particular characteristic of HCV [
 <xref rid="B23-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], although less shared by other viruses responsible for chronic infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HIV-1, which are more associated with resistance transmission rather than natural resistance [
