<p>By performing phylogenetic analysis on NS3, NS5A and NS5B genes using Sanger sequencing, we recently identified separate episodes of HCV transmission in two healthcare settings: one in patients with acute HCV diagnosis affected by onco-hematologic disease [
 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the second in patients with acute HCV diagnosis with Î²-thalassemia [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this present study, through NS5A NGS analysis we aimed to investigate the intra-host viral quasispecies composition and resistance transmission in 15 patients, all putatively involved in transmission clusters.
