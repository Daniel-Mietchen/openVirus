<p>Since the whole genome analysis is expensive and highly complex, the sequencing of specific HCV genomic regions, like Core and/or NS5B, represented, and still represents a more convenient method to study HCV genetic diversity [

Furthermore, various studies have showed that performing the sequencing of NS3 and NS5A non-structural genes involved in DAA drug resistance also produces highly reliable genotype information and can therefore provide both resistance and evolutionary information for molecular epidemiology [
