 <xref rid="B2-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The incubation period for hepatitis C is from two weeks to six months. Since acute HCV infection is usually asymptomatic, very few people are diagnosed during the acute phase. Furthermore, the majority of individuals develop chronic HCV infection having been previously undiagnosed, as the infection may remain asymptomatic for decades until symptoms slowly reveal serious liver damage [
