<p>Nucleotide-sequence-variability (NSV) was estimated through an ambiguous nucleotide-positions percentage in NS5A ultra-deep consensus sequences using an in-house perl script. Genetic complexity was also evaluated as amino acid variability and this parameter was used to define NS5A heterogeneity. More specifically, the Shannon entropy weighted for intra-patient prevalence of viral haplotypes (Sn) was estimated for each NS5A amino acid position for each patient. The formula is reported in the Text S2.</p>
