<p>For each patient, the HCV genotype and sub-genotype were determined. The NS3 + NS5A + NS5B sequences from Sanger sequencing were aligned and compared with reference sequences for all of the HCV genotypes and sub-genotypes (geno2pheno). The sequences were then manually edited using the Bioedit program, and gaps were removed from the final alignment. Genotype assignments were achieved by constructing phylogenetic trees, first using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [

The ML tree was inferred using the General Time-Reversible nucleotide substitution model (GTR) with gamma-distribution among site rate heterogeneity, a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+I+Î“
