<p>Transmission clusters were first deduced using a Maximum-Likelihood tree as described above by using NS5A sequences from Sanger sequencing and NGS. The robustness of the transmission clusters was further tested using a Bayesian analysis. The Bayesian phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with MrBayes [
 <xref rid="B48-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], using a GTR + I + Γ
 <sub>5</sub>. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) search was run for 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations with the trees sampled every 100th generation (with a burn-in of 50%) [
 <xref rid="B49-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Statistical support was obtained by calculating the posterior probability of each monophyletic clade, and a posterior consensus tree was generated after 50% burn-in. Clades were considered epidemiological clusters only if a posterior probability ≥90 was inferred.
