<p>Serum samples from 28 HCV infected patients followed in two Italian hospitals were analyzed using the Sanger genotypic-resistance-test for NS3, NS5A and NS5B genes. All the patients were naïve to DAAs, with the exception of 1 patient with chronic infection who failed a DAA based regimen. Twenty-two patients were affected by β-thalassemia Major and 6 patients had an onco-hematologic disease [

 <xref rid="B36-cells-08-00666" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Eleven β-thalassemia patients received a diagnosis of acute HCV infection during an outbreak between April and November 2016. Five of these received a diagnosis of de-novo acute infection documented by an increase in ALT values greater than 10 upper normal values, positive serum HCV-RNA and seroconversion from anti-HCV negative to anti-HCV positive, while 6 patients received a diagnosis of HCV reinfection since they had past evidence of HCV infection with spontaneous clearance or sustained virological response to Interferon-based therapy. Eleven β-thalassemia patients had a known chronic HCV infection documented by a persistence of serum HCV-RNA positivity. The six patients with hematological malignances received a diagnosis of de-novo acute HCV infection between January and February 2016. None of these patients had developed anti-HCV antibodies (also at the last follow-up visit), confirming their profound immunodepression state as a result of the disease and the chemotherapy received [
