<p>In brief, to prepare indexed libraries from each sample for sequencing, the HCV-RNA genomic was subjected on a NS5A-RT-PCR with SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and when necessary on a Nested-PCR with AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). For each sample, 1 ng of amplicon was involved in a tagmentation reaction using a Nextera XT DNA Library Kit (Illumina Inc) and a unique combination of an i5 and an i7 index primer was then added to each tagmented DNA sample. The libraries were diluted at 4 nM as a final concentration before being pooled. Finally, 15 pM of the denatured pool was paired end sequenced using the MiSeq Nano reagent kit v2 (2 Ã— 250) (Illumina Inc).</p>
