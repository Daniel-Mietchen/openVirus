  <p>NS5A nucleotide sequence variability (%), Acute vs Chronic. Difference between acute and chronic infected patients in Nucleotide-sequence-variability at different NGS cutoff of detection of minority variants. The 
   <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U Test. (
   <bold>A</bold>) nucleotide sequence variability at 1%; (
   <bold>B</bold>) nucleotide sequence variability at 2%; (
   <bold>C</bold>) nucleotide sequence variability at 5%; (
   <bold>D</bold>) nucleotide sequence variability at 10%; Panel E: nucleotide sequence variability at 15%.
