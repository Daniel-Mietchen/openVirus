  <p>
   <bold>(A-C)</bold> IL-1β protein expression in cells from lungs of coinfected mice was determined by flow cytometry. 
   <bold>(D-F)</bold> Samples collected from WT BMDMS 24 hours post-infection were examined by ELISA for IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. Data are pooled from 2–5 independent experiments with n = 2–3 wells per experiment. One-way ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used for statistical comparison (Mean +/- SEM). ns: not significant, p values: &lt;0.01 (**), &lt;0.001 (***).
