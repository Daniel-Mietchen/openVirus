  <title>Pathogen titers and lung pathology in coinfected mice.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A-B)</bold> Viral and bacterial titers in whole lung homogenates of coinfected mice on day 9 (day 2 after coinfection). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Total Lung pathology scores from coinfected mice on day 9 (day 2 after coinfection). 
   <bold>(D-F)</bold> Lung pathology scores from coinfected mice on day 12 (day 5 after coinfection). 
   <bold>(G)</bold> Lung histology images on day 12 (day 5 after coinfection). Original magnification is 400x (B, indicates Bronchi; Arrow, indicates region of lymphocyte infiltration). 
   <bold>(H-K)</bold> Bacterial titers in whole lung, Liver, brain and spleen homogenates of coinfected mice on day 12 (day 5 after coinfection). Data are representative of one-two independent experiments, n = 5–9 mice per group per experiment. One-way ANOVA using Tukey’s post hoc analysis was used for statistical comparison (Mean +/- SEM). ns: not significant, p values: &lt;0.05 (*), &lt;0.01 (**), &lt;0.001 (***).
