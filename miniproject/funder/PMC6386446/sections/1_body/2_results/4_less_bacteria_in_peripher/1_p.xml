 </sup> mice toward lower bacterial burden in the lungs, but this did not reach statistical significance compared to WT mice (p = 0.0957) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212236.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Examination of lung pathology on day 9 showed that

 <sup>
  <italic>-/-</italic>
 </sup> mice had slightly reduced overall lung pathology that approached significance (p = 0.0696) compared to WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212236.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). This was mainly due to reduced cellular infiltrates into the lung (data not shown). Because differences in weight between WT,

 </sup> mice did not occur until day 10 or later, we examined lung pathology and pathogen loads in mice on day 12 (5 d post-coinfection). There was improved overall lung pathology in

 <sup>
  <italic>-/-</italic>
 </sup> mice on day 12, particularly with respect to airway inflammation and lymphocyte numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212236.g004">Fig 4Dâ€“4G</xref>), but this was independent of lung bacterial numbers, as all genotypes of mice had similar lung bacterial loads on day 12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212236.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). Bacterial numbers in the liver were also similar between all genotypes of mice (
