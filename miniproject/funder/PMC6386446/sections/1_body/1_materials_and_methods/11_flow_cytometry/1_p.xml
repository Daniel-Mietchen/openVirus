<p>Lungs from coinfected mice were collected on day 9 (2 d post-coinfection) and passed through a 70μM cell strainer. Cells were isolated by centrifugation through a 35% percoll solution and then stained with a 1:200 dilution of each antibody to determine which cell types express pro-IL-1β in the lung during coinfection. An initial surface stain was performed using anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-Gr1, anti-CD3ε, and anti-CD19 (TONBO biosciences, clones M1/70, N418, RB6-8C5, 145-2C11, 1D3). Then, cells were fixed with IC Fixation Buffer and permeabilized in 1x Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience, 00-8222-49, 00-8333-56) followed by staining with anti-IL-1β pro-form (eBioscience, clone NJTEN3). Cells were distinguished based on the following gating strategies: CD3ε—CD19
 <sup>-</sup> CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> CD11c
 <sup>-</sup> Gr1
 <sup>-</sup> (macrophages), CD3ε—CD19
 <sup>-</sup> CD11b
 <sup>+</sup> CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> Gr1
 <sup>-</sup> (Dendritic cells), CD3ε
 <sup>-</sup>CD19
 <sup>-</sup>CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>CD11c
 <sup>-</sup>Gr1
 <sup>+</sup> (neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes), CD3ε
 <sup>+</sup>CD19
 <sup>-</sup> (T cells), CD3ε 
 <sup>-</sup>CD19
 <sup>+</sup> (B cells), and lineage negative cells were considered mainly epithelial cells.
