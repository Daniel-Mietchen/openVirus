<p>Some studies have examined IL1 receptor signaling during bacterial coinfection with IAV. Bansal et al. recently reported that

 </sup> mice had similar survival to WT mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0212236.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). However, these results suggest the inflammasome and IL-1β are not responsible for alveolar macrophage survival or mouse survival, or that IL-1β and IL-1α play redundant roles. Alternatively, Bansal et al. hypothesized an inflammasome independent mechanism for producing IL-1β [
 <xref rid="pone.0212236.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A second group, Robinson et al., reported that 
 <italic>Il1r1</italic>
