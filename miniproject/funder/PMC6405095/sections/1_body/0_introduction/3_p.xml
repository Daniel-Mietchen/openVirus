<p>The factors causing epidemic growth to peak have been debated. Delayed detection of EVD outbreaks and resulting widespread distributions of EVD have significantly contributed to epidemic growth.[
 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In addition to traditional burial practices, Ebola treatment units with low quality care and/or high mortality rates have discouraged Ebola suspects from presenting to care and contribute to community-based transmission.[
