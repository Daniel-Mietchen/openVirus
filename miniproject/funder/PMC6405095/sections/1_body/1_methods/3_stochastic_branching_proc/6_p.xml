<p>This model generated randomly varying simulated outbreaks with a range of case counts per day. After the Ministry of Health and WHO conducted epidemiological investigations about the beginning of the EVD outbreak in Ã‰quateur Province, they concluded that the outbreak began on April 4, 2018, with a single case.[
 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The simulation process occurs as follows: proposed epidemic trajectories are generated in an initial step based on the above branching process, and these are then subsequently filtered by discarding all but those whose cumulative case counts match the known counts of the April-July 2018 EVD outbreak on known dates. The filtration accepts epidemics within a range of 3 cases more or less than each recorded value. This one-step particle filtering technique produced an ensemble of model outbreaks, filtered on agreement with the recorded trajectory of the outbreak to date. This filtered ensemble is then used to generate projections of the eventual outcome of the outbreak.[
