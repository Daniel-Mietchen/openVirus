<p>To estimate the reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic> as a function of the number of days from the beginning of the outbreak, we included reported cases by date from thirteen prior outbreaks and excluded the first historical outbreak reported in those countries (e.g., 1976 outbreak in Yambuko, DRC) (

 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] As there is a difference in the Ebola response system as well as community sensitization to EVD following a country’s first outbreak, we employed this inclusion criterion to reflect the Ebola response system in DRC during what is now its ninth outbreak. The Wallinga-Teunis technique was used to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic> for each case and therefore for each reporting date in the outbreak.[
