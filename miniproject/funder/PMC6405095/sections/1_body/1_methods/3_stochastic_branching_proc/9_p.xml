<p>For simulation based on probable and confirmed cases, from 122,683,392 simulated outbreaks, 21,036 were retained after filtering on approximate agreement with DRC case counts. For simulation based on probable, confirmed, and suspected cases, from 122,683,392 simulated outbreaks, 32,431 were retained after filtering. The simulated outbreaks that were retained after filtering were continued until they generated no further cases. This ensemble was used to derive a distribution of outbreak sizes and durations. Mean and median values and 95% prediction intervals were calculated using the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of simulated outbreak size and duration. These analyses were conducted using R 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).</p>
