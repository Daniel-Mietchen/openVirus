 </disp-formula> where 
 <italic>R</italic> is reproduction number as a function of day, 
 <italic>k</italic> is a dispersion parameter, and Nb() denotes the negative binomial distribution. All transmission events were assumed to be independent. The serial interval between date of detection of each primary case and that of each of its secondary cases is assumed gamma distributed with mean 14.5 days and standard deviation 5 days, rounded to the nearest whole number of days, as above. The pair of parameters 
 <italic>R</italic>

  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> and τ estimated for the different past outbreaks used, and dispersion parameter 
 <italic>k</italic>, were used in all possible combinations (with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> and τ taken as a unit) to simulate outbreaks.
