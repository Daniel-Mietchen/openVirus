<p>Then, past estimates of the proportion of unreported cases were used to estimate the proportion of exposed individuals not covered by the vaccination process. Based on a Sierra Leonean study from the 2013â€“2016 outbreak,[
 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] we estimated that the percentage of reported cases in DRC would rise over time from a low of 68% to a high of 96%. Given these low and high estimates of reported cases and the estimate of vaccine effectiveness (64.6%), a low estimate of vaccination program coverage was 44% (68% multiplied by 64.6%) and a high estimate of vaccination program coverage was 62% (96% multiplied by 64.6%). The course of the outbreak with and without the vaccination program was modeled based on approximate dates available from situation reports.[
