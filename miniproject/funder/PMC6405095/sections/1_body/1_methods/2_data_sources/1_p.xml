<p>Data on suspected, probable, and confirmed case counts were available from WHO situation reports in May 2018 and used as the basis for analysis. The published situation reports reflected data available up until May 11, 13, 16, 23, and 27, respectively. During the outbreak, the Ebola response team tested suspected cases for EVD and depending on positive or negative results, cases were classified as confirmed or not a case. The final outbreak case count was 54 probable and confirmed cases (no suspected cases).[
 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Due to this reporting process, probable and confirmed cases were used to parameterize the stochastic branching process model, regression models, and Gottâ€™s law. We added suspected cases to create an additional projection, using stochastic branching process model.
