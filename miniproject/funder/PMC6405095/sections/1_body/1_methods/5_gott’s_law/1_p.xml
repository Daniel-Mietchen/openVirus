<p>Gott’s Law was used to estimate the outbreak size using data through May 27 and May 11. We included a projection using data through May 11 because we hypothesized that this method performs better when the first situation report is posted than at later in the outbreak period.[
 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Then we included a projection with the regression models using data through May 11 for comparison. With Gott’s Law, we assume we have no special knowledge of our position on the epidemic curve. If we assume a non-informative uniform prior for the portion of the epidemic that still remains, the resulting probability distribution for the remaining number of cases
