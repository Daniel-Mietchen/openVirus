<p>There are limitations to our projections. Projection distributions were right-skewed, with long tails (and we therefore reported the median instead of the mean). While there have been 22 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten cases, we were unable to include all prior outbreaks in our estimates due to data availability.[

 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] Note that the simple regression projection is based entirely on past outbreaks of EVD (measured and reported in different ways), and cannot account for the improved control measures and vaccination in the way that a mechanistic model does. We included, however, as much real-time information into our estimates as possible, but situations such as the introduction of EVD into a large urban population and implementation of RDTs and vaccines are new to DRC. We did not include vaccination of healthcare workers in the stochastic model. Our estimates of vaccination effectiveness and reported cases were obtained from West Africa because these estimates were not available for the EVD outbreak in Ã‰quateur. These modeling assumptions may not have been consistent with estimates in DRC and should be carefully considered prior to use in other EVD outbreaks.
