<p>When we were conducting our projections in late May, this outbreak still had the potential to become the largest outbreak in DRC since 2007. Vaccine use, regardless of coverage levels, was projected to prevent more than half of the total outbreak size. Vaccines, however, were only part of concurrent prevention, control, and care strategies.[

 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] We also found that the stochastic model with vaccine use projected that rare, large outbreaks (tail of the distribution of the model without vaccinations) were prevented, suggesting that repeat epidemics such as the 2013–2016 West African outbreak may have been highly unlikely once vaccines were rolled out.
