<p>Multiple models were used to estimate total outbreak size. This study exemplified how mathematical models, including simple regressions, can be useful for advising real-time decision making because they provided rapid projections and similar estimates of

 <xref rid="pone.0213190.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] Our projections that included suspected cases did not suggest that vaccines had as much of an impact as our model using only probable and confirmed cases. The trends associated with suspected cases were subject to several factors, including operational choices of response teams and maturity of the outbreak. Nevertheless, suspected case counts may at times provide a better glimpse into the near future of an outbreak than the confirmed and probable case counts. In our case, use of the time series of confirmed, probable, and suspect cases yielded a forecast closer to the final outbreak size. However, as model projections can be highly sensitive to inclusion of suspected cases and use of exact case counts, particularly the last few counts in the available data, conclusions must be taken with caution.
