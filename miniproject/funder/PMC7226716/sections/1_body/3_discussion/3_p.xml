<p id="Par32">During the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks, there were 14,999 and 19,723 cases of indigenous dengue fever, respectively. Case reports from early 2016 showed signs of a continuation of the 2015 epidemic, with 340 indigenous cases reported before April. However, there were only two cases of native dengue fever throughout the remainder of 2016. In 2017 and 2018, Kaohsiung City achieved the two lowest numbers of indigenous cases on record (3 and 11 cases, respectively) [

This significant reduction in the number of dengue cases was in part due to a complete reorganization of the dengue quarantine and epidemic preventive network in Kaohsiung in April 2016, though other factors (such as the emergence of short-lived cross-protection between heterologous Dengue serotypes following disease outbreaks) may have also contributed to the extent of this reduction.
