<p id="Par31">The spread and control of infectious diseases are key aspects in promptly preventing the occurrence of disease. Kaohsiung City experienced a severe epidemic outbreak of dengue fever from 2014 to 2015, in part due to a lack of real-time reporting of cases, which allowed the virus to spread in the community. Following this, the Kaohsiung City Government refocused its disease prevention efforts on border quarantine to prevent importation of disease, which should consequently reduce the number of indigenous cases resulting from secondary infections. The Kaohsiung City Government devised the following action plans to improve the anti-epidemic capacity of Kaohsiung City to prevent dengue fever. These efforts included the establishment of a quarantine referral station, a quarantine period for foreign workers and fishermen, return of new residents and foreign students to their home country for health care measures, and increased incentives for the local or returning citizens related to the prevention of epidemics.</p>
