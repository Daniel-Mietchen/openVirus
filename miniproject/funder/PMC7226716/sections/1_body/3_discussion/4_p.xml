<p id="Par33">A new project focusing on imported cases was initiated in July 2016 to cover both border quarantine and epidemic prevention work. In October 2016, the only “Quarantine referral station” in Taiwan was established at the Kaohsiung International Airport to identify infected travelers. Thus, the airport and seaport of Kaohsiung City constitute the front line of the border quarantine network in South Taiwan for the prevention of dengue fever epidemics.</p>
