<p id="Par34">Kaohsiung City possesses large native populations of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, resulting in a high risk of secondary dengue infection after importation of an initial case from abroad. Although the ongoing collection and testing of thousands of human and mosquito specimens suggest that the DENV has not yet localized in Kaohsiung, it is vital that control programs targeting mosquitoes continue to reduce the likelihood of future localization and minimize the risk of secondary outbreaks following the initial wave of infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Efforts for the control of dengue, whether focused on vector control or prevention of disease importation, are costly both in terms of resources and workload. Constant innovation is required to maintain the low number of dengue cases reported in Kaohsiung City, while reducing unnecessary expenditure. This includes improved, efficient targeting of high-risk individuals to reduce the likelihood of transmission throughout local communities. For example, foreign workers and fishermen from countries in which dengue is endemic could be screened for dengue (NS1) within the first 3â€‰days of entering Taiwan [

This approach will assist in isolating the DENV carrier from the vector mosquitoes in the community, effectively blocking DENV from spreading into the community from foreign sources. Furthermore, the use of mathematical modelling, both to predict patterns of future disease outbreaks and to test the origin of disease cases, has becoming increasingly widespread in recent years [
