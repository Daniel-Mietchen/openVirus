<p id="Par21">The airport fever screening program was introduced in 2003 to detect travelers infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, dengue, or other diseases. In this study, we analyzed data collected between January 2013 and September 2018 from the International Kaohsiung Airport. All airline passengers (outbound and inbound) were requested to have their body temperature measured using NCITs. Two thermal NCITs were set up at each entry gate, with each NCIT having an infrared-thermal camera. Travelers with a detected temperature &gt; 37.5 °C were rechecked by quarantine officers with a symptoms survey and assessed using an ear thermometer. Travelers with a temperature &gt; 38 °C, who had arrived from a dengue-affected area, were triaged for additional diagnostics. Specimens were obtained for testing with the Dengue NS1 Rapid Test (SD BIOLINE Inc., Korea; sensitivity and specificity estimated at 92 and 98%, respectively) at an airport inspection station. Duplicate specimens were sent to the central laboratory of the Taiwan CDC for simultaneous confirmation through molecular and/or serological diagnosis.</p>
