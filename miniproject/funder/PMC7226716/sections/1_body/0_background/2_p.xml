 <italic>dengue virus</italic> (DENV) itself is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. DENV contains 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and a single open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein that can be cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane/membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [
