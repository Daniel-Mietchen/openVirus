<p id="Par17">However, the relationship between the numbers of indigenous and imported cases remains unclear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This relationship is complicated in part by cases of asymptomatic disease and prolonged periods of disease latency, which can result in secondary/tertiary waves of infection many weeks after the first wave [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In theory, the latency period in mosquitoes is between 8 and 12 days, while the maximal latency in humans is between 3 and 8 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As such, the second wave of infections typically occurs 2–3 weeks later, and the third wave can occur 4–6 weeks after the initial bout of infections. Detailed case reports collected over prolonged periods are required to dissect the complex interactions between indigenous and imported cases of dengue fever.
