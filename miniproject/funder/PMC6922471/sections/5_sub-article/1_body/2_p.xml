<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Dengue virus reduces AGPAT1 expression to alter phospholipids and enhance infection in Aedes aegypti" (PPATHOGENS-D-19-00992R1) for review by PLOS Pathogens. The editors have reviewed your revision and would like you  to experimentally address some of the points made by Reviewer #1. In particular, is the issue of whether phopsphatidic acid (or its downstream products) is inhibitory to DENV replication in vitro (Aag cells) both in wild type infection and the silencing experiments. We view this as important for two reasons. (i) It further controls the silencing experiment for off-target effects and directly implicates the lipid pathway. (ii) It asks the important question as to what happens when DENV can't downregulate phosphatidic acid. Silencing AGPAT1 likely produces a minor 2-fold phenotype on DENV replication because DENV infection is already decreasing its expression level.  This experiment can be done via simple media addition of PA over a range of concentrations or over-expression of AGPAT1 if necessary. qRT-PCR and titering would give some insight into life cycle stage (controlling for cell viability). This should be a relatively simple experiment. An additional in vivo experiment is unnecessary, as it is difficult to adequately control.</p>
