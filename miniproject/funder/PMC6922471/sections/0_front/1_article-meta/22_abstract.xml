 <p>Dengue is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, and has now encroached onto temperate regions because of the geographic expansion of its vector, 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. In the absence of effective vaccine and curative drug, the sole intervention relies on containment strategies using insecticide. However, occurrence of insecticide resistance diminishes vector control efficacy. Here, we explore the nascent field of mosquito metabolomics as part of our discovery effort for new transmission-blocking targets. Dengue virus (DENV) relies on host metabolome, specifically the lipid membrane to complete its life-cycle. However, little is known about how DENV subverts the mosquito physiology. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we described metabolic changes incurred by DENV throughout the mosquito cycle, from cellular replication onset to systemic infection. Membrane phospholipids were highly reconfigured and were associated with reduced expression of 
  <italic>AGPAT1</italic>, an enzyme involved in their biogenesis. AGPAT1 depletion partially recapitulated DENV-induced metabolic reconfiguration and enhanced infection by maintaining high phospholipid concentrations. These phospholipids were then consumed/redirected later in the mosquito DENV cycle. Our work comprehensively describes metabolic changes associated with DENV infection. In addition, we reveal how DENV subdues the lipidome for its benefit by demonstrating the role of phospholipids in mosquito infection.
