<p>Reviewer #2: This study aims to understand how dengue virus (DENV) modulates mosquito metabolome to enhance virus production. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, the authors identified changes in aminophospholipid (aminoPL) concentrations during the course of DENV infection in vitro and in vivo. They showed that the expression of 1-Acylglycerol-3-Phosphate O-Acyltransferase 1 (AGPAT1), a rate-limiting enzyme of phospholipid biogenesis, is decreased during DENV infection, whereas AGPAT1 knockdown leads to a modest increase in DENV production late in infection. This is a significant, but highly descriptive study. There is little mechanism as to how DENV utilizes a select group of phospholipids (PL) to enhance virus production. The study does not address how DENV infection causes AGPTA1 inhibition or the relationship between AGPAT1 inhibition and an increase in aminoPL concentration. It is unclear how in aminoPLs contribute to DENV infectivity in mosquitoes. Finally, if AGPTA1 plays a crucial role in DENV infectivity, its silencing should lead to a marked increase in DENV load. However, this is not the case in the current study.</p>
