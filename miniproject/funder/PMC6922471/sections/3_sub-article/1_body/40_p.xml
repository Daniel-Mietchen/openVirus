<p>Reviewer #1: Throughout the manuscript, the authors conclude that inhibition of AGPAT1 promotes infection by increasing aminophospholipids. While their data show a correlation between aminophospholipids levels, and dengue infection, a causal link between aminophospholipid levels and infection is never established. Are downstream aminophospholipid producing enzymes important for dengue infection? Does supplementation with specific aminophospholipids impact infection, e.g. in vitro?</p>
