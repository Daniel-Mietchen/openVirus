<p>Fig. 4 addresses the impact of AGPAT1 silencing on DENV replication and aminoPL consumption in mosquitoes. Please, show the heat map for control siRNA-treated mosquitoes in Fig. 4B. In Fig. 4CD, contrary to the authors assertion, AGPAT1 knockdown in mosquitoes shows no significant impact on DENV infectivity at day 2 or 7 postinfection. The DENV infection rate at day 7 (Fig. 4C) is clearly not impacted by AGPAT1 knockdown. There might be a slight increase in DENV genome replication at day 7, but is there a significant change in DENV load in these mosquitoes?</p>
