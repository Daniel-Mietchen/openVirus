<p>Fig. 3 addresses the impact of AGPAT silencing on aminoPL levels and DENV replication in mosquito cells. First, it will be helpful to show the control PL samples for the heat maps in Fig. 3C and 3E. It is hard to compare the PL heat maps, from mock and DENV-infected cells, when they show different PL species. In Fig. 3D, it is also hard to interpret the DENV infection data based on the heat maps in Fig. 3C and 3E.There is only a modest increase in DENV production after AGPAT1 knockdown.</p>
