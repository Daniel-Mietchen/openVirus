<p>The authors claim, e.g. in the title, that dengue inhibits AGPAT1, this suggests inhibition of the protein. What the authors actually show is that AGPAT1 expression levels are down-regulated. What mediates this down regulation? Is live virus necessary for AGPAT1 down-regulation? Does UV-inactivated virus down-regulate AGPAT1 expression?</p>
