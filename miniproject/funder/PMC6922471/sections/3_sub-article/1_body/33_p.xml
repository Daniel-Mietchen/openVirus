<p>Reviewer #1: The authors perform metabolomic analysis on dengue infected cells and mosquitoes, which broadly agrees with previously published metabolomic studies on dengue infection of mosquitoes. They find that dengue infection induces substantial changes to various aminophospholipid species. Further, they find the dengue infection substantially reduces the expression of AGPAT, a key enzyme in phospholipid synthesis. siRNA-mediated targeting of AGPAT moderately increases viral replication in cell culture and in mosquitoes. Further, they find that siRNA-mediated depletion of AGPAT phenocopies aspects of the metabolic changes induced by dengue infection. The identification of AGPAT1 as a restriction factor whose downregulation could be contributing to dengue-induced metabolic remodeling has implications for the fieldâ€™s understanding of dengue-induced metabolic remodeling, but as indicated below the authors over-interpret a number of correlations implying causality, which, when coupled to a lack of mechanistic details of how dengue targets AGPAT1 or how AGPAT1 contributes to dengue infection limit the impact of the current work.</p>
