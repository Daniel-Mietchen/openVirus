<p>Reviewer #3: In the manuscript entitled “Dengue virus inhibits AGPAT1 to alter phospholipids and enhance infection in Aedes aegypti,” Vial et al study the metabolome of Aedes Aegypti mosquitos over time after dengue infection. While other metabolomics studies of the mosquito midgut following Dengue infection have been published (Chotiwan, PLoS Pathogens 2018), this one is more comprehensive including Aedes Aegypti cells, midguts, and whole mosquitos. Furthermore, this study goes beyond the previous one by examining the role of a host lipid synthesis enzyme in this process. The strengths of this manuscript include the provision of a comprehensive database reflecting metabolic changes during dengue infection of mosquitos and the uncovering of a novel pathogenesis mechanism for Dengue in which a mosquito gene that inhibits viral replication is downregulated by the virus during infection. Weaknesses include the presentation of the findings and statistical analysis of the data.</p>
