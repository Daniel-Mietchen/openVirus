   <italic>aegypti</italic> female mosquitoes were inoculated with DENV serotype 2 and collected at 1, 2 and 7 days post inoculation for transcriptomic analysis using microarray. Data from 3 separate infections. AGAPAT 1â€“5 were found significantly regulated by DENV infection. Data retrieved from (Colpitts et al., 2011, PMID: 21909258).
