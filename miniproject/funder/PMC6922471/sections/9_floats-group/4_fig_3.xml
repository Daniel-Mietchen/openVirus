  <title>AGPAT1 but not AGPAT2 depletion increases DENV multiplication and aminoPL in cells.</title>
  <p>Aag2 cells were transfected with either dsRNA against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> or 
   <italic>2</italic> (dsAGPAT1 or 2) or with dsRNA control (dsControl). At 24 h post transfection, cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 1 or mock infected. Supernatant was collected at 48 hpi. Expressions of (A) 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> and (B) 
   <italic>AGPAT2</italic> in mock-infected cells at 72 h post transfection. 
   <italic>Actin</italic> expression was used for normalization. Bars show mean ± s.e.m. (C) Number of phospholipid-related metabolites significantly regulated. (D) Impact of AGPAT1 or 2 depletion on the lipidome of mock-infected cells at 72 h post transfection. *, p-value &lt;0.05 and |log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change| &gt; 1. (E) Impact of AGPAT1 or 2 depletion on DENV production at 48 hpi as determined by plaque forming unit (pfu) assay. Bars show mean ± s.e.m. and each point represents independent wells. (F) Impact of AGPAT1 or 2 depletion on the lipidome of infected cells at 48 hpi. *, p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change| &gt; 1. (A, B, D and F) result from three biological replicates. (A, B) ***; p-value &lt; 0.001; ****, p-value &lt; 0.0001, as indicated by unpaired t-test. (E) **, p-value &lt; 0.01, as indicated by Dunnett’s test. PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine.
