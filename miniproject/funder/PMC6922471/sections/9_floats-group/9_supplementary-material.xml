  <title>Ion intensity of regulated metabolites in cells, midguts and mosquitoes infected with DENV and mock.</title>
  <p>Normalized ion intensity was calculated after total ion chromatography normalization and auto scaling from three biological replicates. Conditions with significantly regulated metabolites (p-value &lt;0.05 and |log2 fold change| &gt;1) were indicated with an asterisk. Only metabolites from the general metabolism (i.e., lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid and peptide, nucleotide and nucleoside, sialic acid) are shown. â€ , indicates metabolite annotated by spectral similarity. Carbo., carbohydrate; SA, sialic acid; PL, phospholipid; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; LysoPS, lysophosphatidylserine; LysoPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LysoPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LysoPG, lysophosphatidylglycerol; LysoPI, lysophosphatidylinositol; SM, Sphingomyelin; DAG, Diacylglycerol; MAG, Monoacylglycerol; FAHFA, Fatty Acid ester of Hydroxyl Fatty Acid; NAE, N-acylethanolamine; HEA, Heneicosanoic acid; pep., peptides.</p>
