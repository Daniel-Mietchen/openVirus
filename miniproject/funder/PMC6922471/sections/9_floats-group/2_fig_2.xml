  <p>(A) An overview of phospholipid biogenesis. Sequential additions of two acyl-coA to one G3P produce a LysoPA and a PA. Several AGPATs mediate the second addition. PA forms either DAG or CDP-DAG, each generating a different set of phospholipids. DAG produces aminophospholipids by addition of a Cho or Eth group. Aminophospholipids are also produced by acylation of lysoPL and base group modifications. CDP-DAG produces PI and PG, the latter being transformed in CL by combination with a second PG. Phospholipases cleave off an acyl chain from PL to produce lysoPL. G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; LysoPA, lysophosphatidate; PA, phosphatidate; AGPAT, acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases; DAG, diacylglycerol; CDP-DAG, cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; Cho, choline; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; Eth, ethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; LPS, lysophosphatidylserine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; LPI, lysophosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; LPG, lysophosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin; LCL, lysocardiolipin.

   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> and 
   <italic>AGPAT2</italic> expressions in DENV-infected cells at 24 and 48 hpi with an MOI of 5. Expressions of 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> and 
   <italic>AGPAT2</italic> (D) in midguts at 1, 7 dpi and (E) in whole mosquitoes at 1, 7 and 14 dpi with DENV at 10
