  <title>Spectral similarity network from mosquito MS features.</title>
  <p>Example of a molecular spectral network for Ae. aegypti mosquito at 14 days post-infection using MS features detected with the non-polar LC condition and MS negative mode. Line length represents the MS/MS score similarity. Ontology for unknown features was determined based on the proximity with database-identified features.</p>
