  <title>AGPAT1 depletion increases DENV multiplication and consumption of aminoPLs in mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>Mosquitoes were injected with either dsRNA against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> (dsAGPAT1) or dsRNA control (dsControl). Two days later, mosquitoes were orally fed with non-infectious blood or infectious blood containing DENV at 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml. (A) Validation of 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> silencing in non-infected mosquitoes at two days post dsRNA injection. 
   <italic>Actin</italic> expression was used for normalization. Bars show mean ± s.e.m. from 3 pools of 5 mosquitoes each. ****, p-value &lt; 0.0001 as indicated by unpaired t-test. (B) Impact of AGPAT1 depletion on the lipidome of mosquitoes at 2 and 7 days post non-infectious blood feeding (dpb). Impact of AGPAT1 depletion on (C) DENV gRNA copies and (D) viral load measured as pfu/ml at 7 days post oral infection (dpi). Bars indicate mean (C) or geometric means ± 95% CI (D) with each dot representing one mosquito. ***, p-value &lt; 0.001 ****, p-value &lt; 0.0001 as indicated by unpaired t-test (C) or Mann-Whitney test (D). (E) Impact of AGPAT1 depletion on the lipidome of infected mosquitoes at 7 dpi. (F) Impact of infection on the lipidome of AGPAT1-depleted mosquitoes at 7 dpi. (B, E, F) Only regulated metabolites are shown (p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change| &gt; 1). PL, phospholipid; FA; fatty acyl; AC, acylcarnitine; DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LPS, lysophosphatidylserine; LPG, lysophosphatidylglycerol; LPI, lysophosphatidylinositol; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; GPEtn, glycerophosphoethanolamine.
