  <title>Quantification of DENV infection in Aag2 cells, 
   <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquito and midgut.
  </title>
  <p>(A) DENV gRNA copies in Aag2 cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48h post-infection with DENV at MOI = 5. Points from 4 repeat and standard errors show geometric mean ± 95% CI. (B) Plaque titer (plaque forming unit—pfu) in supernatant from Aag2 cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48h post-infection. Aag2 cells were infected with DENV at MOI = 5 and virus titer was calculated using plaque assay. Each point represents one well. (C) DENV gRNA copies per infected mosquitoes and dissected midguts at 1, 7 and 14 days post-oral infection with 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml. Each point represents one mosquito or midgut. Bars show geometric mean ± 95% CI. (D) Infection rate in whole mosquito and midgut at 1, 7 and 14 days post-oral infection. Bars represent percentages ± s.e.
