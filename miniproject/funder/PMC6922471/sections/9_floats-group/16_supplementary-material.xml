  <title>Impact of AGPAT1-depletion in mosquitoes on DENV infection rate and gRNA copies.</title>
  <p>Mosquitoes were injected with either dsRNA against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> (dsAGPAT1) or dsRNA control (dsControl). Two days post injection, mosquitoes were orally fed with either non-infectious blood or DENV infectious blood. Impact of AGPAT1 depletion on (A) infection rate and (B) DENV gRNA copies at 2 days post oral infection (dpi) with 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml. (C-E) Impact of AGPAT1 depletion on infection rate (C) and DENV gRNA copies at 2 (D) and 7 (E) dpi with 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu/ml. Bars indicate percentage ± s.e. (A, C) or geometric means ± 95% C.I. (B, D, E) with each dot representing one mosquito. *, p-value &lt; 0.05 as indicated by Mann-Whitney test.
