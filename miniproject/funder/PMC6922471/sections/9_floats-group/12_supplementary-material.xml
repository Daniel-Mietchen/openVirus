  <title>Metabolomic impact of AGPAT1 and AGPAT2 depletion and infection in cells as measured by ion intensity.</title>
  <p>Aag2 cells were transfected with dsRNA against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> (dsAGPAT1) or 
   <italic>AGPAT2</italic> (dsAGPAT2) or a dsRNA control (dsControl). 24h later, cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 1. (A) Ion intensity of regulated metabolites in mock cells at 72h post transfection. (B) Ion intensity of regulated metabolites in infected cells at 24 hpi. Normalized ion intensity was calculated after total ion chromatography normalization and auto scaling from three replicates. Conditions with significantly regulated metabolites (p-value &lt;0.05 and |log2 fold change| &gt;1) were indicated with an asterisk. PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine.
