  <title>Metabolites detected from cell, midgut and whole mosquito with differential regulation upon DENV infection.</title>
  <p>The three tabs contain compound detected on cell, midgut and mosquito with the following information: ionization mode (positive and negative), phase detection (polar and non-polar), the mass average m/z between replicate, the retention time average Rt in minutes between replicates, the MS/MS spectrum fragmentation and intensity, adducts [M+H]+ and [M-H]-, metabolites of importance in
