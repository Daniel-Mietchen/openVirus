  <title>Metabolomic impact of AGPAT1 and AGPAT2 depletion in uninfected mosquitoes as measured by ion intensity.</title>
  <p>Two days post dsRNA injection against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> (dsAGPAT1) or control (dsControl), mosquitoes were orally infected with DENV at 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml. Metabolomic analyses were performed at 2 and 7 dpi. Normalized ion intensity was calculated after total ion chromatography normalization and auto scaling from three replicates. Conditions with significantly regulated metabolites (p-value &lt;0.05 and |log2 fold change| &gt;1) were indicated with an asterisk.
