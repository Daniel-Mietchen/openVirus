  <title>Aminophospholipid composition is altered throughout DENV infection in mosquitoes.</title>
  <p>(A) Schematic of the multidimensional strategy deployed to profile the mosquito metabolome after DENV infection. Aag2 mosquito cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of 5 and collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi). Mosquitoes were orally infected with 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml of DENV. Midguts and whole mosquitoes were collected at 1, 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi). Metabolic extracts were analyzed by LC-HRMS as in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. (B) Venn diagrams show regulated metabolites at the different time points and bars indicate class distribution within tissue levels. Triangles indicate direction of regulation and are color-coded with regards to the time point. Uninfected condition was used as control. (C) Fold changes of annotated and significantly regulated metabolites (|log
   <sub>2</sub> fold change| &gt; 1 and p-value &lt; 0.05) by DENV in cells, midguts and mosquitoes as compared to mock infection. Only metabolites from the general metabolism (i.e., lipid, carbohydrate, amino acid and peptide, nucleotide and nucleoside, sialic acid) are shown. *, indicates metabolite annotations determined by spectral similarity. Carbo., carbohydrate; SA, sialic acid; PL, phospholipid; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; LysoPS, lysophosphatidylserine; LysoPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; LysoPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine; LysoPG, lysophosphatidylglycerol; LysoPI, lysophosphatidylinositol; SM, Sphingomyelin; DAG, Diacylglycerol; MAG, Monoacylglycerol; FAHFA, Fatty Acid ester of Hydroxyl Fatty Acid; NAE, N-acylethanolamine; HEA, Heneicosanoic acid; pep., peptides.
