  <title>Ethanolamine supplementation partially rescued infection increase upon AGPAT1 depletion.</title>
  <p>24h before infection, Aag2 cells were transfected with dsRNA against AGPAT1 (dsAGPAT1) or with dsRNA control (dsControl) and reared in standard growth media or the same media supplemented with 2mM ethanolamine. Cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 1 and gRNA copy was quantified 48h later. Bars show geometric means Â± 95% C.I. Each point represents an independent well. *, p-value &lt; 0.05; **, p-value &lt; 0.01 as determined by unpaired t-test.</p>
