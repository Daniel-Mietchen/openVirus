   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> and 
   <italic>2</italic> expression in cells after the other AGPAT depletion.
  </title>
  <p>Aag2 cells were transfected with dsRNA against 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> or 
   <italic>2</italic> (dsAGPAT1 or 2). Control cells were transfected with dsRNA control (dsControl). Cells were collected 72h post dsRNA. (A) 
   <italic>AGPAT1</italic> expression in AGPAT2-depleted cells. (B) 
   <italic>AGPAT2</italic> expression in AGPAT1-depleted cells. Bars show mean Â± s.e.m from 3 biological replicates. ns, non-significant, as indicated by unpaired t-test.
