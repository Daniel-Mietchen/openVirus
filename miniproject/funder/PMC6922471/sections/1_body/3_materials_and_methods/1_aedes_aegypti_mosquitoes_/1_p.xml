<p>The 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> colony was established in 2010 from Singapore and was reared at 28°C and 60% relative humidity with 12h:12h light:dark cycle. Eggs hatched in milliQ water were fed with a mix of fish food (TetraMin fish flakes), yeast and liver powder (MP Biomedicals). Adults were held in rearing cages (Bioquip) supplemented with water and 10% sucrose solution. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% filtered fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco). For media supplementation, 2 mM of ethanolamine (Sigma) was added to Aag2 growth medium. Cells were maintained in vented culture flasks in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 28°C. BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) (ATCC CCL-10) cells were grown in the same media and maintained at 37°C with 5% CO
