<p>Templates for dsRNA against AAEL011898 and AAEL001000 were PCR amplified with primers flanked with a T7 promoter (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s014">S3 Table</xref>) from mosquito cDNA. dsRNA was synthetized with megaScript T7 transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), extracted in DEPC-treated water and annealed by slowly cooling down from 95°C. Control dsRNA targeting LacZ was produced [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Two- to five-day-old cold-anesthetized female mosquitoes were intrathoracically injected with 69 nl of 3 mg/ml of dsRNA by using Nanoject II injector (Drummond Scientific). Mosquitoes were then maintained at 28°C with water and 10% sucrose solution before oral infection as detailed above. Cells were seeded at 2 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> per 24-well plate and transfected after 24h with 1 μg of dsRNA by using TransIT-mRNA Transfection kit (Mirusbio). Infection with DENV was done one day post transfection.
