<p>Peak detection and alignment were performed using MS-DIAL (ver. 3.12) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Peak annotation was done using MS-finder (ver. 3.04) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] with HMDB, ChEBI, LipidMAPS and LipidBlast databases, allowing a level 2.2 of metabolite identification [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Data were normalized by total ion chromatogram (TIC) and features lower than 2-fold average blank were removed. Each LC-HRMS condition was analyzed separately before concatenation. Data were normalized by auto-scaling before selecting regulated metabolites with more than 2-fold intensity change and a p-value &lt; 0.05 with FDR adjustment as indicate by unpaired t-test using MetaboAnalyst (ver. 4.0) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. To account for physiological variations between the different time-tissue combinations, the t-tests were done by comparing the same tissue in infected and uninfected conditions within each time. Uninfected condition was used as control. PCA for quality control was performed with MetaboAnalyst (ver. 4.0). MS/MS similarity metabolic networks with cut-off &gt; 60% were generated with MS-Finder for each LC-HRMS mode-tissue combination.
