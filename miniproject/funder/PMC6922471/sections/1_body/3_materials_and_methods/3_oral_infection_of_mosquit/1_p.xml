<p>Two- to four-day-old adult female mosquitoes were starved for 24h before oral feeding on a blood meal containing 40% volume of washed erythrocytes from SPF pig’s blood (PWG Genetics, Singapore), 5% of 100 mM ATP (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5% of human serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50% of DENV-2 in RPMI media (Gibco). The virus titer in the blood meal was 2 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml and validated by plaque assay. Blood was maintained at 37°C using hemotek membrane feeder system (Discovery Workshops) with sausage casing for 1.5 h. A control group was allowed to feed on the same mix of SPF pig blood meal without virus. Engorged mosquitoes were visually selected and maintained at 28°C with water and 10% sucrose solution.
