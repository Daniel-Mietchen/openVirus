<p>Total RNA from five mosquitoes was extracted using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA kit I, treated with RapidOut DNA Removal kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and reverse transcribed with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Gene expression was quantified using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and primers detailed in
