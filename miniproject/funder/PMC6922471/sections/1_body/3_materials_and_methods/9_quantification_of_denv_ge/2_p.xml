<p>An absolute standard curve was generated by amplifying fragments containing the qPCR target using a forward primer tagged with T7 promoter; forward: 5’-CAGGATAAGAGGTTCGTCTG-3’ and reverse: 5’-TTGACTCTTGTTTATCCGCT-3’, resulting in a 453bp fragment. The fragment was reverse transcribed using MegaScript T7 transcription kit (Ambion) and purified using E.Z.N. A. Total RNA kit I. The total amount of RNA was quantified using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to estimate copy number. Ten times serial dilutions were made and used to generate absolute standard equation for gRNA. In each subsequent RT-qPCR plate, five standards were added to adjust for threshold variation between plates. The infection rate was calculated by dividing the number of samples with detectable gRNA over total number of samples.</p>
