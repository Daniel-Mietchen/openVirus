<p>Single mosquitoes or tissues were homogenized in 350μl of TRK lysis buffer (Omega Bio-tek) using a bead Mill homogenizer (FastPrep-24, MP Biomedicals). Total RNA was extracted using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA kit I (Omega Bio-tek) and eluted in 30μl of DEPC-treated water. Genomic RNA (gRNA) was quantified with one-step RT-qPCR using iTaq Universal probe kit (Bio-Rad) and primers and probes targeting the DENV Envelope [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The 12.5 μl reaction mix contained 1 μM of forward and reverse primers, 0.125 μM of probe and 4 μl of RNA extract. Quantification was conducted on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). Thermal profile was 50˚C for 10 min, 95˚C for 1 min and 40 cycles of 95˚C for 10 sec and 60˚C for 15 sec.
