<p>Dry extracts were normalized at 2 mg/mL in methanol:water 80:20 solution and metabolites were detected using two methods. Compounds from medium range polarity to lipophilic substances were detected using a UPLC-UV-QTOF-MS
 <sup>E</sup> instrument (Xevo G2 QTof, Waters) mounted on an electrospray ionization (ESI) source, with a UPLC BEH C18 Acquity column (100 × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 μm, Waters) equipped with a guard column. Mobile phase A was of 0.1% formic acid in water, B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was 400 μl/min and the gradient ran with 98% A for 0.5 min to 20% B over 3.5 min, 98% B for 8 min, held at 98% B for 3 min, and returned in 0.5 min to initial conditions (98% A), finally held for 3.5 min to assure equilibration before the subsequent analysis. Detection was performed at 254 nm by TOF-MS in both electrospray (ESI) negative mode with voltage at 2.5 kV and positive mode with voltage at 3.0 kV. The m/z range was 100–1200 Da with a scan time of 0.1 s. All detected ions were fragmented using MS
 <sup>E</sup> scan with an energy collision ramp from 20 to 50 eV. All analyses were acquired using leucine enkephalin as the lock mass at a concentration of 400 pg/μl and flow rate 7 μl/min. The injection volume was 2 μl and samples were kept at 10°C during the whole analysis.
