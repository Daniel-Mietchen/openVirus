<p>Polar metabolites were profiled using a UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument (Ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) set at 15,000 resolution, with a Zic-pHilic column (150 × 2.1 mm i.d., 5 μm, SeQuant, Merck). Mobile phase A was 20 mM ammonium acetate buffered at pH 9 and B was acetonitrile. The flow rate was 250 μl/min and the gradient ran from 90% B for 0.5 min to 40% B over 18 min, held at 40% B for a further 3 min, and then returned in 0.5 min to initial conditions (90% B) finally held for 5 min before subsequent analysis. The 
 <italic>m/z</italic> range was 100–1500 and ISpray voltage at 4.2 kV (positive mode) and 3.0 kV (negative mode). Each full MS scan was followed by data dependent MS/MS on the two most intense ions using stepped CID fragmentation mode at 35% normalized collision energy, isolation width of 2 u and activation Q set at 0.250.
