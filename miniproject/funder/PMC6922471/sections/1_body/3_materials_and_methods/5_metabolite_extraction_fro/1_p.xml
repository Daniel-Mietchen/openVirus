<p>At 1, 7 and 14 days post-oral feeding, 10 mosquitoes in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol and water ratio of 80:20 (LCMS grade, Thermo Fisher) were homogenized with bead Mill homogenizer (FastPrep-24, MP Biomedicals) and sonicated for 15 min in an ultrasonic bath (J.R. Selecta) at 4°C. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C to collect 400 μl supernatant. Pellets were further extracted twice by addition of 500 μl of methanol:water (80:20), followed by centrifugation. Supernatants were combined and vacuum-dried (Speed-Vac, Thermo-Scientific) before storage at -20°C. At 1 and 7 days post-oral feeding, 10 midguts were homogenized in 200 μl of the methanol:water (80:20) solution and 120 μl of supernatant was collected three times with the same protocol. At 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, cells were washed with room temperature 0.9% NaCl and collected in 2 ml of ice-cold methanol:water (80:20) by scraping. Cells were homogenized by ultrasound and extracted thrice as detailed above by adding 500 μl of ice-cold methanol:water (80:20). Three biological replicates were conducted per condition.</p>
