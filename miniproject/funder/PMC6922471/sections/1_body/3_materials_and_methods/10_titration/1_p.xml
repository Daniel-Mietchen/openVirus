<p>Titration was conducted by plaque assay with BHK-21 cells as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Briefly, 80â€“90% confluent cells were inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of samples for 1h. Cells were then incubated with 1% carboxyl-methyl cellulose (CMC) (Merck) for 5 days, fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Merck) -PBS and stained with 1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) solution to count plaque forming units (pfu).
