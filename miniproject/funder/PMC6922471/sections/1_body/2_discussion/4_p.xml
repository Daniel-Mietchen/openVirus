<p>DENV intricately interacts with aminoPL-containing membranes and a change as we report can alter several stages of its life-cycle, such as entry, replication, translation, assembly and egress [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. DENV interacts with the plasma membrane for entry and fusion, and with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane for translation, replication and assembly [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These membranes are mostly composed of PE and PC, and PS in lower proportions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Their fluidity and topology are determined by the aminoPL structure and concentration. The cylindrical shape of PCs stabilizes lipid bilayers, whereas the conical shape of PEs induces curvature. Several flavivirus-aminoPL interactions have been described in human cells. PLs present in the DENV envelope are recognized by cellular ligands and mediate entry [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Replication of flaviviruses induce the invagination of the endoplasmic reticulum by altering PE [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and lysoPC compositions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Alternatively, 
 <italic>AGPAT</italic> expressions could alter anti-viral immune response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In mammalian cells, 
 <italic>AGPAT</italic> overexpressions amplify cellular signaling of cytokine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] that can reduce DENV infection in mosquito cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Although the precise function of AGPAT1-regulated aminoPLs is unknown and may be multifactorial, previous studies and ours indicate that membrane aminoPL reconfiguration influences DENV multiplication.
