<p>By combining observational and manipulative approaches 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we deciphered how DENV hijacks the mosquitoesâ€™ metabolome. We deployed metabolomic profiling throughout the mosquito DENV cycle, and revealed an overall increase in aminoPLs, followed by a reduction at the end of the cycle. We next showed that aminoPL reconfiguration is partially mediated by infection-induced 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> down-regulation, which increases aminoPL concentrations. Because AGPAT1 depletion promotes virus multiplication, our study discovers a mechanism whereby DENV reconfigures the metabolome to its benefit. Furthermore, we show that in an environment richer in aminoPLs (AGPAT1 depletion), infection reduces aminoPL concentrations at a higher and earlier rate than in a wild-type organism, while increasing virus production. This suggests that DENV consumes/redirects aminoPLs, although this is based on correlations between indirect lipidome alteration and virus multiplication. Altogether, we propose a model whereby DENV regulates aminoPL enzymes to increase aminoPL concentrations early during the cycle and consumes/redirects them for its multiplication.
