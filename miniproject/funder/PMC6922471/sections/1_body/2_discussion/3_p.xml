<p>The expression of 
 <italic>AGPATs</italic> is regulated either directly through their transcription factors or indirectly by altering the endoplasmic reticulum topology. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) coordinate fatty acid, sterol and phospholipid metabolisms by transcriptionally regulating enzymes, such as acyl transferases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. DENV protein interaction with SREBP, as described with other transcription factors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], could alter 
 <italic>AGPAT</italic> expressions. In support of this, chemical inhibition of SREBP blocks DENV replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Alternatively, AGPAT activity is influenced by substrate accessibility, which depends on membrane topology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Several DENV proteins are embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and modify its topology [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. This can alter endoplasmic reticulum-located AGPAT activity, PL profile and activate acyl-transferase expressions to restore homeostasis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
