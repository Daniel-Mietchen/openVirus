<p>To test whether infection-induced phospholipidome reconfiguration is associated with AGAPT regulation, we quantified 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> and 
 <italic>2</italic> expressions. Interestingly, we observed that 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> was downregulated at 24 and 48 hpi in cells, at 1 and 7 dpi in midguts and at 1, 7 and 14 dpi in mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). In contrast, 
 <italic>AGPAT2</italic> was not significantly regulated in cells, midguts and mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). This partially corroborates a transcriptomic study [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] that shows 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> downregulation and 
 <italic>AGPAT2</italic> upregulation at 1, 2 and 7 days post DENV-inoculation in mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). To test whether virus replication was required for 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> down-regulation, we incubated cells with UV-inactivated virus (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). 
 <italic>AGAPT1</italic> expression did not vary between mock and UV-inactivated DENV at 24 and 48 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), indicating that active infection is required.
