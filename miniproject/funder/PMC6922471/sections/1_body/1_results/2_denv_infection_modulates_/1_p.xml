<p>To determine how PLs are reorganized upon DENV infection, we first characterized the rate-limiting AGPAT enzymes in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). In humans, there are five AGPAT isoforms with different activities depending on four motif sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Motifs I and IV bind to acyl-CoA and catalyze lysoPA to PA acylation, while motifs II and III bind to lysoPA. Human AGPAT (hAGPAT) 1 and 2 are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and have the highest acyltransferase activity and lysoPA affinity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. hAGPAT3-5 have lower transferase activity and target different substrates that lysoPA such as lysoPL, participating in PL remodeling [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> also has five AGPAT isoforms: AGPAT1 (AAEL011898), AGPAT2 (AAEL001000), AGPAT3 (AAEL011902), AGPAT4 (AAEL014026) and AGPAT5 (AAEL011901). Based on amino acid similarity, AGPAT1, 2, 3 and 5 cluster with hAGPAT1 and 2, whereas AGPAT4 clusters with hAGPAT3-5 (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] establishes AGPAT1, 2, 3 as homologues of hAGPAT1 and 2 (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that they all share the acyltransferase activity and lysoPA affinity.
