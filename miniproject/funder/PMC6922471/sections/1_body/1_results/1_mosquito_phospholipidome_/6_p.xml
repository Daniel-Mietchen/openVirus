<p>Different types of PL precursors were regulated. PA, the direct precursor of all PLs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], was upregulated at 1 dpi in midgut, similar to aminoPLs. Two diacylglycerols (DAG), intermediates for PE and PC productions, were up and downregulated in mosquitoes at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively. Fatty acyls can be incorporated into a glycerol head to produce PL and were regulated. Fatty acyls with an ethanolamine group can be related to PE either via degradation or as a precursor. Similar to aminoPLs, two acyl-ethanolamine increased at 1 dpi and decreased at 14 dpi in mosquitoes. In accordance with previous studies [
