<p>Our comprehensive metabolomic profiling revealed that DENV infection profoundly reconfigures the phospholidome. The aminoPLs including PE, PC and PS increased at the beginning of DENV cycle and decreased later on. A large phospholipidome reconfiguration was previously observed in DENV-infected midguts at 3, 7 and 11 dpi [

They reported a decrease in lysoPL abundance, which we observed at 14 dpi in mosquitoes. The authors also noted an increase in sphingolipids, which we saw in mosquitoes but only for one species. Those variations between the studies can stem from methodological differences in extraction and analyses, or from biological differences in mosquito colony and virus strain. Taken together, our results and those of others indicate that DENV infection reconfigures lipid membrane composition.
