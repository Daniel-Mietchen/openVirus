<p>Several classes of PLs were regulated in all three tissues (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although infection altered different species of aminoPLs in the different tissue-time combinations, we observed a general increase at the beginning of DENV cycle, followed by a reduction at the end. In cells, the majority of regulated aminoPLs (3 out of 5) were upregulated at 48 hpi. In midguts and mosquitoes a total of 9 aminoPLs were increased at 1 dpi, whereas 15 and 14 were reduced at 7 and 14 dpi, respectively.
