<p>To describe the metabolic changes in

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, we designed an untargeted multidimensional approach that covered the different stages of DENV cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Extracts from Aag2 cells at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi) represented changes caused by entry, initiation of replication, replication and virion production (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Extracts from midguts at 1 and 7 days post oral infection (dpi) represented infection onset and replication peak, respectively (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Extracts from whole mosquitoes at 1, 7 and 14 dpi represented the different dissemination stages in the mosquito body (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The extracts were analyzed using a Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomic workflow that detects polar and nonpolar metabolites (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We detected 667, 486 and 1121 compounds in the cells, midgut and whole mosquitoes, respectively (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Comparison of MS spectra with available non-mosquito databases enabled the annotation of 77% of the peaks. To annotate the remaining mosquito-specific metabolites, we deployed MS spectral similarity network (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s012">S1 Table</xref>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Based on the spectral similarity with database-identified features, we identified the class of 20 MS features without homologues in the databases, increasing the identification coverage to 77, 70 and 82% in the cells, midguts and whole mosquitoes, respectively (
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among all annotated metabolites, we detected 29% of PLs, 21% of non-PL lipids, 8% of amino acids and peptides, 5% of organic acids, 4% of carbohydrates and 33% of other minor classes (fewer than 3 occurrences). The distribution of metabolite classes indicates that the metabolomic workflow had a broad coverage, although slightly biased towards lipids.
