<p>When profiling metabolic changes throughout mosquito DENV cycle, we observed that aminoPLs were reduced at the end of DENV cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To test whether this reduction occurred when aminoPL concentrations were increased by AGPAT1 depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g004">Fig 4E</xref>), we examined how DENV modifies the lipidome in AGPAT1-depleted mosquitoes. Control mosquitoes were depleted of AGPAT1 and fed a non-infectious blood meal. At 7 dpi, aminoPLs were drastically decreased by DENV despite AGPAT1-depletion enhancement (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s021">S10 Table</xref>). Specifically, three PEs and five PCs were reduced more than 100 folds. These results suggest that, by reproducing infection-induced aminoPL reconfiguration, AGPAT1 depletion amplifies the DENV reconfiguration, thereby promoting infection. Altogether, our results indicate that DENV inhibits
