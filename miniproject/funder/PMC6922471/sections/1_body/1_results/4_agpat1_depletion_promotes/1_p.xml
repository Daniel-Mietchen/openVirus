<p>To further characterize how AGPAT1-mediated PL alteration increases DENV infection, we depleted AGPAT1 in mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). We first described how AGAPT1 regulates PLs in mosquitoes that fed on a non-infectious blood meal (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s019">S8 Table</xref>). As in cells, AGPAT1 mostly regulated aminoPLs and their derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s019">S8 Table</xref>). At 2 days post oral feeding, one DAG and one PA, two key precursors of PLs, and one PS were increased. At 7 days post oral feeding, eight lysoPLs (one lysoPI, two lysoPGs, one lysoPS, two lysoPEs and two lysoPCs) were downregulated, similarly to those in DENV-infected wild-type mosquitoes at 14 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Strikingly, some metabolites were similarly regulated by either AGPAT1-depletion or DENV infection. PS (34:2) was upregulated by either AGPAT1-depletion at 2 days post oral feeding or DENV infection at 1 dpi. LysoPI (20:4), lysoPE (18:1), lysoPC (16:1) and lysoPC (20:4) were reduced by either AGPAT1-depletion at 7 days post oral feeding or DENV infection at 14 dpi. At 7 days post oral feeding in AGPAT1-depleted mosquitoes, one fatty acyl, two acylcarnitines, oleoylcarnitine (18:1) and acetyl-L-carnitine, were decreased. Of note, one of the regulated acylcarnitines (i.e., oleoylcarnitine) was inversely regulated by DENV infection at 14 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These results show that AGPAT1 depletion partially reproduces the aminoPL reconfiguration caused by DENV infection.
