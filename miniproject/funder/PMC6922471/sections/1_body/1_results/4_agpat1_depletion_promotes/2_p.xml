<p>Next, we found that AGPAT1-depletion increased DENV gRNA (p-value = 0.0004) and titer (p-value &lt; 0.0001) at 7 dpi in whole mosquito (

This may indicate that DENV infection is necessary to amplify AGPAT1-mediated alteration in establishing a pro-viral environment. To characterize the AGPAT1-induced proviral environment, we compared the lipidome of infected mosquitoes that were AGPAT1 depleted or not. AGPAT1-depletion increased aminoPL concentrations at 7 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s020">S9 Table</xref>). Specifically, one PC, four PEs and one glycerophosphoethanolamine were upregulated. By artificially modulating the metabolome, we revealed that AGPAT1 depletion favors DENV by increasing aminoPL concentrations.
