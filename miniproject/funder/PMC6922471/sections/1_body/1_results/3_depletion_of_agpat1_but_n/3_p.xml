<p>To test whether AGPAT1 effect on DENV was related to aminoPLs, we modified the AGPAT1-induced reconfiguration of aminoPLs by media supplementation. In PL biogenesis, PA produces DAG, which is transformed into PE by addition of ethanolamine (

Controls were non-depleted cells without supplementation (standard media that does not contain ethanolamine), non-depleted cells with ethanolamine supplementation and AGPAT1-depleted cells without supplementation. While ethanolamine supplementation did not alter gRNA in non-depleted cells, the increase observed upon AGPAT1-depletion was reverted to non-depleted non-supplemented control when ethanolamine was supplemented (
