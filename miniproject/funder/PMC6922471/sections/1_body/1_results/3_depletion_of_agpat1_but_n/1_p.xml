<p>Based on the association between the infection-induced phospholipidome reconfiguration and 
 <italic>AGPAT1</italic> down-regulation, we hypothesized that AGPAT1 mediates the phospholipidome reconfiguration that promotes DENV infection. First, we described how both AGPAT1 and 2, the latter used as control, regulate PL biogenesis in non-infected mosquito cells. LC-HRMS polar mode detection was used to target phospholipid metabolites (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), indicating the enzyme-specificity of the aminoPL alterations. These results confirm the roles of AGPAT1 and 2 in PL biogenesis, and reveal differences between the two enzymes.
