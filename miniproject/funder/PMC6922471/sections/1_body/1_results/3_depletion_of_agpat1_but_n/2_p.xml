<p>To test whether AGPAT-mediated reconfiguration of aminoPLs promotes DENV infection, we quantified infection in cells depleted of either AGPAT1 or 2. While DENV titer was not altered by AGPAT2 depletion, it increased 2.09 Â± 0.36 fold (p-value = 0.0012) following AGPAT1 depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008199.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Next, we described how DENV infection altered the lipidome in cells depleted of either AGPAT1 or 2. Infection in AGPAT1-depleted cells, but not in AGPAT2-depleted cells, mostly increased aminoPLs as compared to infected wild-type cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008199.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). These results indicate that: (i) depletion of AGPAT1 prior infection amplifies the aminoPL increase observed in early mosquito DENV infection (
