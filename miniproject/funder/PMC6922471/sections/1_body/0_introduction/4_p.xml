<p>Following an infectious blood meal, DENV infects the mosquito midgut, multiplies, and propagates to the whole mosquito body, including salivary glands, from where it is expectorated during subsequent blood feeding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Throughout various infected tissues, the virus modifies its metabolic environment. In this study, we aim to understand how DENV modifies mosquitoesâ€™ metabolome. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we explored the metabolic changes throughout the DENV cycle, in

 <italic>aegypti</italic> Aag2 cell line, midguts and whole mosquitoes at different times post infection. Infection-induced metabolic alteration mostly affected PLs and was associated with

 <italic>in vivo</italic> in PL-altered environments indicated that increased PL redirection/consumption favored virus multiplication. Our study reveals how DENV reconfigures the metabolome and identifies PLs as important components in the virus life-cycle.
