<p>PL 
 <italic>de novo</italic> biogenesis is initiated by two types of acyl-transferases that sequentially add two acyls to one glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The second addition is catalyzed by 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferases (AGPAT) that transform lysophospatidate (lysoPA) in phosphatidate (PA) [
