<p>Increased global distribution of dengue virus (DENV) is driven by the expansion of its mosquito vectors, mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An estimated 400 million infections occur yearly in over 100 countries [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and cause a range of symptoms from flu-like illness to potentially lethal complication called severe dengue. Without approved antiviral drug, treatment is limited to supportive care. Although dengue vaccine is now licensed in several countries, it has variable efficacy against all dengue serotypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and is only suitable for dengue-seropositive patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To curb dengue epidemics, containment strategy mainly relies on vector control that includes the use of insecticides [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, insecticide resistance is rapidly developing, compromising the efficacy of the only available intervention [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Characterization of viral metabolic requirements in mosquitoes will identify targets for novel chemical-based control strategies [
