<p>As obligate and intracellular parasites, viruses rely on the host to fulfill their metabolite requirements. Glycolysis, amino acid and lipid pathways provide the energy and structural compounds necessary for multiplication. In human cells, DENV alters energy [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As an envelope virus, DENV is particularly dependent on host-derived lipid membranes, with which it interacts for entry, replication, translation, assembly and egress [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], particularly altering the membrane lipids such as phospholipids (PL) and sphingolipids. Chemical inhibition of lipid synthesis confirmed the DENV requirements for lipids in human and mosquito cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008199.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] have been elucidated in the mammalian host. However, how DENV reconfigures lipids in mosquitoes remains unknown.
