<p>Consensus sequences were aligned by MUSCLE [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by using RAxML v8.1.6, with the GTR model of nucleotide substitution and Î³-distributed rates among sites. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by maximum-likelihood using YFV genome sequences [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A NJ tree based on YFV genome sequences was also constructed to show the results were robust (
