<p>RNA secondary structures were predicted by using RNAfold program of ViennaRNA Package 2 with default settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nucleotide sequences started at the beginning of 3' UTRs of Angola 2016 strain. The length of window for secondary structure prediction was equal to 70 nucleotides. We also extended the additional 200 nucleotides at the end of the sequence, with a step length equal to 50.
