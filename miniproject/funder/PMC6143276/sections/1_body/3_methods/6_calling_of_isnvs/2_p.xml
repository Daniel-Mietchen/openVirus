<p>The iSNV calling was according to the site depth and strand bias with following: 1) remove the ambiguous iSNV and keep the following iSNVs: (1.1) minor allele frequency of ≥5%, a conservative cutoff based on an error rate estimation described before [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]; (1.2) depth of the minor allele of ≥15; and (1.3) strand bias of the minor allele less than tenfold. 2) In our analysis, these two types of nucleotides in each site have contained the nucleotide in the reference genome. Mutated allele frequencies were calculated by the rate of the reads numbers for mutated alleles to the references and total reads. Minor allele and Major allele frequencies were calculated by the majority nucleotides and minor nucleotides in each site respectively. 3) The effect of iSNV to the gene was calculated by the mutation whether caused the amino acid changes.
