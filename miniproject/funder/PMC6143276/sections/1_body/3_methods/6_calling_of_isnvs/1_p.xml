<p>To minimize the potential sequencing errors generated by system, we performed the following two steps before we called iSNV, including 1) mapping the clean reads to the reference genome, 2) qualification of the samples. For mapping the clean reads to genome, we use the traditional protocol used widely. First, we mapped the clean reads with pair-ended aligned to the assembled genome from YF-BJ1/7D by using Bowtie2 v2.2.5 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with default parameters. SAMtools v1.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used to generate ‘mpileup’ files with no limit for the maximum site depth. To find the potential mutation in each site, we do not use the following pipeline in SAMtools. Instead, we developed homemade PERL scripts (available at

The depth of bases in each sites were used to measure the mutation rate of iSNV. Then, we selected the samples with more than 3,000 sites with a sequencing depth ≥300× as candidate samples for iSNV calling. Using this protocol, we called iSNV in 15 samples in this study (

 </xref>), and obtained the frequencies of each allele in each genome site. Interestingly, we only found the heterogeneous nucleotides with two types in each sites. Thus, we defined the nucleotide with higher frequencies as the major allele, and fewer one as the minor allele in the following iSNV calling.
