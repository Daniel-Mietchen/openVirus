<p>The iSNVs that co-occurred in same viral haplotype(s) within quasispecies was defined as phased iSNVs. 1)We screened the iSNV sites along genome with a window of 250 bp, and then identified all the windows which probably containing a phasing iSNVs. 2) All the sequencing reads aligned to YFV genome region harboring these iSNVs were extracted. 3) The stretches of nearest iSNV were determined by the mutations in the reads aligned to the genome region with the same phasing (supporting reads &gt; = 2). 4) The fractions of reads supporting phased and non-phased neighbor iSNVs were respectively calculated.</p>
