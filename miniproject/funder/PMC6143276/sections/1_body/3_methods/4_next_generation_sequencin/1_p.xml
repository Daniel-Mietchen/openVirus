<p>RNA from both serum and urine samples were deployed to two approaches of deep sequencing. Approach I: Total RNA sequencing. RNA was purified by Trizol (Thermo Scientific) for each sample, and then total RNA libraries were constructed with 500bps insertion size using the NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, MA, USA), and then sequenced by Illumina Hi-seq platform, and generated 2 × 125 bp paired-end reads. Approach II: RNA amplicon sequencing. Two sets of YFV-specific primer pairs were designed (Set A: 5 pairs, amplicon length = 2,248 ± 168 nt; Set B: 12 pairs, amplicon length = 1,018 ± 48 nt;

 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The probably low quality regions in sequencing, including 1) Q&lt;30, and 2) the first 10 bps after primers were removed from the high quality sequences, according to a previous study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To minimize sequencing error that affects the accuracy of iSNV calling, we only kept the read-pair that has &gt;100 high quality bases in both ends as clean reads. All reads were deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the accession no. SRP096859.
