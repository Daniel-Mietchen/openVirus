<p>In January 2016, the Ministry of Health of Angola notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of a yellow fever disease outbreak: as of October 28
 <sup>th</sup>, 4,347 suspected cases, including 377 deaths, were reported from all 18 provinces of Angola. Outbreaks were also reported simultaneously from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda [
