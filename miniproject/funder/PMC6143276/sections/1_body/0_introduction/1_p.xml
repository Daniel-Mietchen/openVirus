<p>Yellow fever is a notorious mosquito-borne viral disease emerged during the 15th-19th centuries in the Americas, Africa and Europe, causing severe hemorrhagic fever and liver injury with high mortality rates. Although control of mosquitoes and the use of the live-attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV)-17D vaccine strain have effectively prevented and controlled the epidemics, YFV is estimated to cause approximately 30,000 deaths out of 200,000 infections annually worldwide, mostly in Africa (

 <sup>th</sup> April, 2018). The etiological agent of the disease, YFV, is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a ~11 kb genome in length. The virus is frequently transmitted between nonhuman primates and mosquitoes in African and American jungles, known as the sylvatic cycle [

Occasionally, YFV can escape from the sylvatic cycle to infect humans, with subsequent transmission between mosquitoes and humans, forming the urban cycle. Historically, YFV was believed to have originated from Central or East Africa, and transmitted to America during the slave trade [
