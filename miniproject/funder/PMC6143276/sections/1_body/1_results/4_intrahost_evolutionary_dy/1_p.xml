<p>Subsequently, we placed all of the polymorphic sites (SNPs and iSNVs) along viral genome (

 </italic>). SNPs and iSNVs described the viral difference in two levels of between and within the host, respectively. Within 65 days (from the onset of the first patient to the sample of the last patient in this study) we observed a total of 234 SNPs in 148 sites in 18 samples, including 102 synonymous and 117 nonsynonymous SNPs. A total of 138 SNPs that appear only once are scattered along the viral genome. In particular, the SNPs of 5 sites (T900A, A2352C, C3918A, G6463A, and A7320G) could be used to characterize the 2016 YFVs. All five SNPs were detected in seven patients, four SNPs (without A7320G) were detected in one patient (YF-BJ5), and only one patient (YF-BJ3) does not possess any of the above SNPs (

 </italic>). Of note, YF-BJ1 is likely a co-infection with more than one YFV variant, as the virus genome on day 7 does not contain any of the five SNPs, whereas all five SNPs became dominant on day 8 (
