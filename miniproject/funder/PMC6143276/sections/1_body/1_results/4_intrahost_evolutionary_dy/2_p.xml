<p>We then compared the accumulation of polymorphic sites within patients over time (

 </italic>). Each sample was set to days after onset of the symptoms of the patients it belongs to. Linear regressions revealed that iSNVs and SNPs accumulated from the day of onset of symptoms at a rate of 0.72 and 0.32 variations/day, respectively. The accumulation rate of iSNV may reflect the intrahost evolution. Intriguingly, the YFV evolutionary rate within humans is roughly 2.48 x10
 <sup>-2</sup> variations/site/year (0.72 variations/day = 0.72 x 365 / 10591 variations/site/year = 2.48 x10
 <sup>-2</sup> variations/site/year) in our study. Of those synonymous variations, the intrahost evolutionary rate estimated by iSNV was 0.7 x10
 <sup>-2</sup> variations/site/year; whereas the rate of nonsynonymous variations was 1.2 x10
 <sup>-2</sup> variations/site/year. Compared to the rates estimated by SNP within these samples, the intrahost evolutionary rate of non-synonymous sites (by iSNV) is higher, while the rate of synonymous sites is slightly higher than the SNP rate.
