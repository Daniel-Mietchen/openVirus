<p>We performed phylogenetic analysis of the coding region of YFVs (

 </italic>). Of note, the vaccine strain YF-17D and its derivatives are located far from the Angola strains on the phylogenetic tree. A closer inspection of the Angola strains shows that the viruses in the 2016 outbreak are likely from a single origin and genome sequences from both severely ill patients are closely clustered (
