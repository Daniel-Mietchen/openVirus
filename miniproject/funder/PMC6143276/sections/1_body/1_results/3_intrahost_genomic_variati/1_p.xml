<p>For the deep-sequenced samples, we identified the iSNVs by using methods in a previous study for Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The mean sequencing depth of genomic regions is between 16,558x and 37,822x (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006738.g003">Fig 3A</xref>
 </italic>), and a total of 101 iSNV sites were discovered, including 69 in the coding region and 32 in non-coding regions. In each iSNV sites, we only found two types of nucleotides. Taken that sequencing errors are generated randomly and may result in multi-nucleotide heterogeneity in a single site, it is unlikely those iSNVs were the results of sequencing bias. Fewer iSNVs appeared in the 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> codon positions than the 3
 <sup>rd</sup> codon position (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006738.g003">Fig 3C</xref>
 </italic>), implying that the coding region is generally under purifying selection. We plotted the distributions of all mutated allele frequencies of the iSNVs (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006738.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>
 </italic>). The mean mutated allele frequency of non-coding iSNVs was at 0.18, while that of synonymous and non-synonymous iSNVs was 0.12 and 0.09, respectively (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006738.g003">Fig 3D</xref>
 </italic>). Among them, non-synonymous iSNV is significantly lower than that in non-coding regions (P = 0.02). The distribution of non-coding iSNVs is close to the expected neutrality, whereas curves of synonymous and nonsynonymous iSNVs have higher portions of iSNVs in the area of low mutated allele frequencies (

 </italic>). This further supports the notion that the coding region was under purifying selection. Additionally, we discovered two variant types at the 3’ untranslated region (UTR), one with 5 concurrent iSNVs (G10360A, U10365G, C10367U, G10373A, and U10398C) and the other having an additional iSNV (A10425G) (

 </italic>). Phasing analysis reveals that these iSNVs tend to be concurrent in the same reads (
