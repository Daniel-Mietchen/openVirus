<p>We collected samples from twelve out of thirteen YFV patients in China, sequenced the viral genomes, and performed analyses on phylogenetics, sequence comparison, and intra-host dynamics. Of the 12 patients, two had severe disease, in which one survived (YF-BJ3) and one died (YF-BJ1), and the remaining patients displayed mild symptoms (

 </italic>). We tested blood samples of these 12 patients from the first day of admittance to the hospital by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and four patients (YF-BJ1, YF-BJ2, YF-BJ3, and YF-BJ5) were positive. YFV RNA fragments could be detected in serum until 9, 12, 10 and 6 days, respectively, after the onset of symptoms (
