<p>Compard to Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), YFV shares similar host vectors (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the long-term substitution rates of DENV (0.77–0.99 x10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year) and ZIKA (0.98–1.06 x10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year) are higher than that of YFV [

Since the transmission of YFV variants needs mosquitoes as vector, the window (viremia duration) that mosquitoes could use is essential, as only the variations within this period could be brought into the transmission cycle. A wider window size would possibly allow more non-synonymous variations into the transmission cycle (Cristina Domingo, EID, 2018). Given that YFV, DENV and ZIKV have ~3, 3–7, and 4–7 days of viremia, respectively, after symptom onset (

 </italic>), it hinted that the shorter viremia duration in YFV infections might result in the lower evolutionary rate than that of DENV or ZIKV. Most Flaviviruses are vector-borne viruses and the evolutionary rates in mammals and arthropods are different. The intrahost analysis of virus could show the short-term evolution dynamics, especially from serial samples, and this would be a helpful complement to the long-term evolution of Flaviviruses.
