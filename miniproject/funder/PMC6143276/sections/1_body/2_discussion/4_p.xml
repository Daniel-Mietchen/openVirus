<p>In addition, deep sequencing and viral genomics have provided new insights into viral evolutionary dynamics, especially in a continuous mode. Our findings strongly suggest that the urine samples should be considered for the clinical diagnosis, genomic surveillance, and large-scale screening of YFV infections. Further investigations are also encouraged to characterize the factors that maintain viremia in vector-borne diseases.</p>
