<p>The evolution of YFV is a basic question to unfold to predict the risk of the pathogens. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the 2016 outbreak is likely the spillover of YFV viruses in Angola. The high identity between the 2016 strain and the vaccine strain YF-17D would explain the effectiveness of the current vaccines [

There is not any evidence that the Angola outbreak was due to immune escape and it is accepted among public health professionals that low vaccine coverage in the area prior to the outbreak was the driving factor and the resulting aggressive mass vaccination campaign was vital for containing and eliminating the outbreak. However, it should be noted that the Angola lineage is clearly diversified from the 17D-lineage (

 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but the limited clinical and epidemiological data cannot tell the immune escape. Future immune escape from current YFV vaccines cannot be fully ruled out, although YFVs evolve very slowly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A novel vaccine based on a Central/East African YFV isolate would be necessary as a complement vaccine to prepare against future outbreaks. Owing to the slow evolutionary rate and the past experience of using YF-17D, the novel vaccine is likely to work for another decades.
