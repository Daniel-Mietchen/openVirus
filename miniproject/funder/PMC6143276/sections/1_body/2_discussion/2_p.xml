<p>Virus evolution experienced mutation, selection within and between hosts, genetic drift, and transmission, and finally formed the genetic variants (lineages) over long-term evolutionary timescales [

In this intra-host phylogenomic analysis, we depicted the evolutionary process of YFV from intra-host to epidemic substitutions, which were reflected by iSNV to SNP, respectively. Other than using the metric for long-term evolutionary rate, we applied the substitution/site/day to measure the intrahost evolutionary rate, which appeared more appropriate in outbreak or epidemic scenarios. Short-term rates may provide better insight into the intrahost YFV evolutionary trends (e.g., iSNV dynamics over time) relative to clinical symptomology, severity, and/or co-morbidities. However, further in vitro or in vivo studies would be needed. The estimated evolutionary rates clearly showed that the intrahost evolutionary rate is ~2.25 times higher than that of the epidemic evolutionary rate, and both are much higher (59 times and 26 times) than the substitution rate of YFV along longer evolutionary timescale [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006738.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The higher rate estimated by iSNV reflected purifying selection occurred, when intrahost variations were spreading out. The rates estimated by synonymous iSNV and SNP, respectively, were similar, implying that the synonymous variations were under similar evolutionary constraints during transmission. Meanwhile, only a few of the nonsynonymous variations were spread out in different individuals, and only G6463A (Val to Ile in NS4A) were detected in multiple samples.
