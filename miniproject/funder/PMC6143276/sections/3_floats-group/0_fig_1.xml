  <title>Cases of twelve documented returning YFV patients in China by date in the outbreak of Angola from March to May 2016.</title>
  <p>Timeline of events for each patient from symptom onset to the leaving from hospital are shown with different molecular detection methods and results. Dots denote that we did not get any positive molecular detection result in the time point, grey (before admitted to hospital) and blue (after admitted to hospital). The larger size dots means that we performed Real-time PCR detections in that point. The red triangles denote the sample have been detected by PCR and Real-time PCR with positive results. Blue boxes denote the samples that were subjected to NGS analysis at the time points.</p>
