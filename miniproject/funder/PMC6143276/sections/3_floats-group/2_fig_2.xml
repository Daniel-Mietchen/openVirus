  <title>Phylogenetics and amino acids comparison of YFV viruses.</title>
  <p>(A) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of YFV genome sequences (the first 130 bps in 5’-UTR and the last 370 bps in 3’-UTR sequences are excluded). Bootstrap support values are shown along the branches. Wesselsbron virus, Sepik virus and Entebbe bat virus were used as outgroup. (B) Maximum-likelihood phylogenic tree of YFV genomes of Angola 2016 strains. Viruses from patients with severe disease are highlighted in magenta. Angola 1971(GenBank accession AY968064) was used as outgroup. Bootstrap support values (≥70) are shown. (C) Comparison of amino acids of YFV consensus sequence of each lineage in (A). Identical amino acid to vaccine strain (17D) lineage is denoted as a dot. The amino acid sites that were different in Angola 2016 and 1971, are highlight with red rectangles. Novel amino acid substitutions of Angola 2016 are denoted by arrowheads.</p>
