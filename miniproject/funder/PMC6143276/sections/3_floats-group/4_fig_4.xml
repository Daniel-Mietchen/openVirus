  <title>Genomic variations of Angola 2016 YFV and evolutionary model.</title>
  <p>(A) SNPs (in magenta) and iSNVs (in cyan) detected in Angola 2016 strains along the YFV genome. Non-synonymous variations are denoted by ovals, synonymous variations by diamonds, and variations in UTR by rectangles. Non-synonymous site at 6463 is denoted by arrowhead. YFV genome of patient YF-BJ1 at 7 days after the onset (YF-BJ1/7D) was used as the reference sequence (B) Linear regression of number of variations at all variations, synonymous and non-synonymous sites accumulated by days after onset. The smooth shadows denote the LOESS fit with 95% confidence interval.</p>
