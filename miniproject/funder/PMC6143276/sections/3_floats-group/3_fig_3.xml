  <title>The iSNVs of Angola 2016 YFVs from clinical samples.</title>
  <p>(A) Sequencing depth across the sequenced genomes. The x-axis represents the YFV genome, with the ORF boundaries indicated by vertical dashed lines. The sequencing depth smoothed by locally weighted smooth regression (LOESS) is shown by the black curve, with 95% confidence interval as shown by shadow. (B) Numbers of iSNVs at non-coding (NC) regions and codon positions of the ORF. (C) Numbers of nonsynonymous (N) and synonymous (S) iSNVs of the ORF. (D) Box plots of the mutated allele frequencies (MuAFs) for non-coding, synonymous and nonsynonymous iSNVs. The MuAF values of three kinds of iSNVs are compared to each other with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Dashed lines denote the boundaries of MuAFs in iSNV identification. Boxes denote the interquartile range (IQR) between the first and third quartiles. Lines inside the boxes indicate the median, and the lines outside boxes represent values within 1.5 times the IRQ. Outliers are denoted as dots. (E) Comparison of MuAF spectra of non-coding, synonymous and nonsynonymous iSNVs. MuAFs (dots) are shown with LOESS lines (95% confidence interval in shadow). Expectation under neutral selection is shown by a black line. (F) Prediction of RNA secondary structures of 3â€™ UTR (with 68 bp downstream of the stop codon). The earliest type of Angola 2016 (wildtype) and two nucleotides variant types are illustrated. Six variation sites are highlighted in magenta. The stop codon is in the gray box.</p>
