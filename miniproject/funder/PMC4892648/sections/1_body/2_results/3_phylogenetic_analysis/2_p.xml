<p>Phylogenetic analysis of DENV-2 strains isolated during the outbreak showed that these two newly isolated strains (GZ05 and GZ25) were assigned to the same clade (GD2014 D2-B) belonging to genotype cosmopolitan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156548.g003">Fig 3</xref>), which was closely related to the strain (GZ26199) isolated from Guangdong in 2013, and shared the same origins of Indonesia from 2008 to 2010. Other Guangdong strains isolated in 2001, 2007 and 2010, were also clustered into this clade. In addition, some strains isolated from other laboratory during this outbreak were assigned to the clade GD2014 D2-A and GD2014 D2-C. Zhongshan strains (GD ZS 2014) situated in these two clades were highly similar to isolates obtained in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and Cambodia) from 2005 to 2012, along with the stains from Guangdong province (GZ26120 and FS D13205) in 2013. Together, these results suggested that multiple sources of DENV-1 and DENV-2 strains were responsible for this severe outbreak, and most stains have circulated in Guangdong for a long time.
