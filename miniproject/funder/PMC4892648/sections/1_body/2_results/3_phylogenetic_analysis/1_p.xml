<p>The phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the complete E gene. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156548.g002">Fig 2</xref>, the data suggested that DENV-1 strains isolated during the outbreak belonged to genotype I and V, respectively. These isolates formed three clades (GD2014 D1-A, B and C). GD2014 D1-A (GZ35 strain) was closely related to the isolate (GD D13202) obtained from the same province, Guangdong in 2013, and highly similar to isolates obtained in Japan (2014), Bali (2010) and Singapore (2006). GD2014 D1-B (GZ32 and GZ84 strain) was almost identical to those strains obtained in Guangdong from 2006 to 2013, and clustered together with isolates obtained in Thailand (2008). The most recent origins of GD2014 D1-C (GZ01, GZ02, GZ09, GZ27, GZ33, GZ37, GZ44, GZ48 and GZ81 strain) were isolates obtained from Guangdong in 2013 (DG D13459) and 2009, and showed high similarity with isolates obtained from Bangladesh and India in 2009.
