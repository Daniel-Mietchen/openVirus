<p>The acute phase serum was directly inoculated into C6/36 cells to isolate the pathogen. Five days post inoculation on the third passage in the cells, CPE caused by DENV infection, characterized by swelling, aggregation and cell fusion were observed. Finally, 14 DENV strains were isolated from the sera of acute-phase dengue patients. Furthermore, the complete envelope (E) gene of 12 DENV-1 strains and two DENV-2 strains were determined using RT-PCR assay and submitted to GenBank under the Accession number KU672341 (DENV-1/GZ01), KU672340 (DENV-1/GZ02), KU672339 (DENV-1/GZ09), KP723473 (DENV-1/GZ27), KP723474 (DENV-1/GZ32), KP723475 (DENV-1/GZ33), KP723476 (DENV-1/GZ35), KP723477 (DENV-1/GZ37), KU672338 (DENV-1/GZ44), KU672337 (DENV-1/GZ48), KU672336 (DENV-1/GZ81), KU672342 (DENV-1/GZ84), KP012546 (DENV-2/GZ05), KP723478 (DENV-2/GZ25), respectively.</p>
