<p>To identify whether there is any potential amino acid variation that would increase the virulence of DENV-1 genotype 1 isolates in the 2014 outbreak, the complete E gene of the isolates in 2014 was compared with other DENV-1 strains isolated in Guangdong, China, from 2001 to 2014. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0156548.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, all the amino acids retained identical among the strains isolated in 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2014, which was in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis results. Only 1 nonsynonymous mutation was identified in five isolates, and three nonsynonymous mutations were identified in two isolates. However, the biological effects of these mutations remain unknown. Current sequence analysis failed to identify any amino acid mutations in the E protein that would make an obvious connection between viral virulence and disease severity.
