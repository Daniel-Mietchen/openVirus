 <xref rid="pone.0156548.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, of those, 594 were positive for DENV (97.2%). Further, 570 cases were infected by DENV-1 (96%) and others by DENV-2, which demonstrated that two serotypes of DENV co-circulated during this outbreak: DENV-1 and DENV-2, with serotype 1 predominating. Among the severe dengue patients, 12% were infected with DENV-2, which was significantly higher than that in dengue fever cases (
