<p>Acute phase sera from 44 patients diagnosed positive with viral genomic RNA were inoculated in C6/36 mosquito cells obtained from ATCC for virus isolation as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0156548.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. When complete cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed, culture supernatants were collected for genome sequencing. In brief, viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of the virus-infected C6/36 cell culture using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. To amplify E gene, RT-PCR was performed using a SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System and the primers for E gene. The following two oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCA CAT GCC ATA GGA ACA TCC-3′ and 5′-CTC TCA CCA AAA GGC GGT TCT-3′, and 5′-AGG AAC AGA TGC ACC ATG CAA-3′ and 5′-ATC TTT CCT GTG ACT GTT GTG-3′ were used to amplify complete E gene of DENV-1. For complete E gene of DENV-2, two primer pairs 5′-CAA ACA CCC CGC CAC TCT AAG GA-3′ and 5′-ACA ATG TCA CGA CCC CCA CTA ATA-3′, and 5′-CCC CAT GCA AAG AAA CAG GAT-3′ and 5′-TTG AGG CCG CAG GGA ACG-3′ were used.
