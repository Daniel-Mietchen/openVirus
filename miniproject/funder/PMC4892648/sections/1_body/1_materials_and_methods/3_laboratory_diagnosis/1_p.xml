<p>All cases were confirmed according to the 2009 WHO guidelines associated with detection of nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and/or viral RNA on patients’ serum. Serum sample were collected on admission. Viral RNA was directly extracted from the serum sample using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Dengue genome was detected using real-time RT-PCR assay (DAAN, China) to determine specific serotype. Dengue NS1 antigen was determined in acute-phase serum samples by enzyme immunoassay (Diagnostic Kit for Dengue Virus NS1 Antigen, WANTAI, China). Serum IgG and IgM antibodies in acute-phase serum samples against DENV were detected by Dengue IgM and IgG capture ELISA (PanBio, Australia) according to the recommended protocol. The secondary infections distinguished from primary were defined as IgG positivity during the acute phase [
