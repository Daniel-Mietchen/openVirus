<p>During this outbreak, DENV-1 and DENV-2 were co-circulating, although serotype 1 was predominant with two genotypes (I and V), which increased the risk of secondary infection. In 2011, a severe dengue case due to secondary DENV-1 infection, following primary DENV-2 infection, has been reported in Guangdong province [
