<p>The 2014 dengue outbreak in Guangdong province is the largest one in China, and has raised the concern of public health authorities for the etiology of the novel DENV. However, current research has not yet explained the correlation between the scale and severity of this outbreak and genetic characterization of newly isolate [

Further phenotype and virulence analyses should be carried out in the future, to identify the emergence of a “new” DENV stain with increased pathogenicity or replicative fitness in native mosquitoes for transmission. In this unexpected epidemic, the majority of severe cases felled the group with 65 years of age or older. Of those, 60.3% (73/121) cases had co-morbid conditions, which was also found in the dengue epidemic with a significant proportion of severe dengue case in Yunnan province, China[
