<p>It is concern whether such outbreak re-emergence in the following years. Polygenetic analysis showed that the clinical DENV E sequences during this outbreak have high homology with the recent reported isolates in Guangdong, suggesting the possibility of dengue becoming endemic in Guangdong, China, although most researches suggested that the prevalence of dengue is attributed by the imported cases in China [
