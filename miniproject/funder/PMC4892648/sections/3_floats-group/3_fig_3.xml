  <title>Phylogenetic tree of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) sequences from Guangzhou compared with other DENV-2 sequences deposited in GenBank.</title>
  <p>The tree was constructed on the basis of complete sequence of the E gene. Sequences from different geographic areas are shown by different colors. For clarity, the GD2014 D2-A, B and C epidemic clade is shown enlarged in the inset at lower. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. Strains are labeled as follows: location strain name date (year) of collection. China GD GZ 2014 represent the newly obtained sequences (GZ05 and GZ25 strains) from this outbreak. Abbreviations: GD (Guangdong province); GZ (Guangzhou city); ZS (Zhongshan city); FS (Foshan city); JM (Jiangmen city).</p>
