  <title>Phylogenetic tree of dengue virus serotype 1 (DENV-1) sequences from Guangzhou compared with other DENV-1sequences deposited in GenBank.</title>
  <p>The tree was constructed on the basis of complete sequence of the E gene. Sequences from different geographic regions are shown by different colors. For clarity, the GD2014 D1-A, B and C epidemic clade is shown enlarged in the inset at right. Scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. Strains are labeled as follows: location strain name date (year) of collection. China GD GZ 2014 of the B clade represent a group of the newly obtained sequences from this outbreak, including GZ32 and GZ84 strains. China GD GZ 2014 of the C clade represent GZ01, GZ02, GZ09, GZ27, GZ33, GZ37, GZ44, GZ48 and GZ81 strains from this outbreak. Abbreviations: GD (Guangdong province); GZ (Guangzhou city); ZS (Zhongshan city); FS(Foshan city); JM (Jiangmen city).</p>
