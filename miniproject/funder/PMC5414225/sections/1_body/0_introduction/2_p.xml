<p>Many people with chronic HBV and/or HCV infection are go undiagnosed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Of those already diagnosed, many are not necessarily linked to parts of the healthcare system that are able to provide comprehensive care (e.g. to accurately classify the extent of liver disease and provide treatment when indicated) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, a large (but undetermined) proportion of the chronically infected population enters comprehensive care only after developing liver disease-related clinical symptoms.
