   <sup>a</sup>General comments: advanced liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C is a definition for capturing all cirrhotics and patients with pre-cirrhosis. On the basis of regular testing of the aspartate transaminase level (AST), alanine transaminase level (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase level (GGT), cholesterol and platelet count, it is possible to calculate the aspartate transaminase to platelets radio index (APRI) as: APRI = (AST/upper limit of normal [ULN])/platelet (109/L) x 100), or to calculate the FIB-4 as FIB-4 = (age x AST) / (platelets x (sqr (ALT) or with more extensive laboratory assessments the commercially available Fibrotest. APRI and FIB-4 may have lower sensitivity and specifity in calculating advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis patients with chronic hepatitis B compared to chronic hepatitis C. The APRI score may not be reliable if a patient suffers from another condition that affects the platelet count (e.g. HIV infection, immune thrombopenia etc), and therefore transient elastography (e.g. FibroScan) is preferred.
