  <title>Mixing selects for virulence.</title>
  <p>A 1:1 mixture of temperate 位 and its virulent mutant 位cI857 was used to seed spatial epidemics. Spatial structure was disturbed to different degree (
   <bold>
    <italic>undisturbed</italic>, 
    <italic>30s</italic>, 
    <italic>24h</italic>, 
    <italic>24h-wet</italic>
   </bold>) and transferred onto a fresh biofilm of susceptible hosts for 3 consecutive days. Disturbance of the epidemic structure has a strong effect on the competitive fitness of the virulent 位cI857. The 
   <bold>
    <italic>undisturbed</italic>
   </bold> environment strongly selects against virulence whereas in a well-mixed environment (
   <bold>
    <italic>24h-wet</italic>
   </bold>) virulence is beneficial. As expected, intermediate levels of mixing (
   <bold>
    <italic>30s</italic>, 
    <italic>24h</italic>
   </bold>) lead to intermediate fitness of 位cI857. Symbols represent 6 replications for each mixing treatment (with 3 independent replicates for each marker-mutant combination).
