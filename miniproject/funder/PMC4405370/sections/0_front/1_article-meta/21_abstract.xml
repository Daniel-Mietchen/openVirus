 <p>Why do some viruses use latent infection strategies and in which environments can such prudent host exploitation strategies evolve? Theory of mathematical epidemiology and social evolution predicts that prudent pathogens can evolve when they cluster in space and share the mutual benefits of prudent exploitation of the host population. Here we extend the theory to study the effect of spatial structure on the evolution of pathogens that can transmit both horizontally and vertically. We explore these effects experimentally by competing the latent bacteriophage λ and the virulent mutant λcI857 in spatially structured epidemics and gradually erode spatial structure. We show that the latent bacteriophage λ only wins in a spatially structured epidemic. Yet, a breakdown of the epidemic structure by long-range transmission reduces the benefit of latency by 500 fold. This demonstrates that long-rage transmission, as for example by air travel, might select for much more virulent types of previously latent viruses.</p>
