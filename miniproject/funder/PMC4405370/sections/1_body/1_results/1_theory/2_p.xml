 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] under different levels of mixing (see supporting information Theory in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). Note that, under all level of mixing, the frequency of the virulent mutant initially increases. Indeed, early on during the epidemics, parasites have access to a large density of susceptible hosts, which favours the spread of more transmissible mutants. This benefit, however, is only transient. As the pool of susceptible hosts is exhausted, more prudent pathogens end up being selected under all mixing treatments. Spatial structure, however, has a dramatic impact on the virulent mutant: less mixing drastically reduces the transient benefit of virulence. To understand this effect, we represent on 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> the effect of spatial structure on the different components of the selection coefficient in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.e003" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq (1)</xref>. Spatial structure acts through two different effects: (i) space reduces the horizontal transmission benefit (red curve in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) and (ii) space generates benefit for the virulence mutant through vertical transmission (blue curve in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). The first effect is the classical effect of space often discussed as a self-shading or kin selection argument [
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The second effect is due to the accumulation of empty sites near virulence mutants, which is caused by the death of hosts infected by related (and thus virulent) genotypes. In other words, virulence mutant have more opportunities to transmit vertically than avirulent genotypes.
