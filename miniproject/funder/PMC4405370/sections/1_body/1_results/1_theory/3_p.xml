<p>In addition, to better grasp the effect of space on pathogen evolution, we track the change in mutant frequency over two types of infected hosts: hosts that acquired the infection horizontally and hosts that acquired the infection vertically. 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> reveals the effect of mixing on the change in frequency of the mutant in these two compartments. In a well-mixed environment the frequency of the mutant is always higher in the horizontally infected hosts. In contrast, in a structured environment, the frequency of the virulent mutant can be higher in vertically infected hosts. This is due to the effect of spatial structure on the opportunities for vertical transmission. As explained above the virulent mutant has more opportunities for vertical transmission because the local density of empty sites is higher (see 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Another way to see this effect is to track the ratio W
 <sub>H</sub> / W
 <sub>V</sub> which provides a measure of the relative contribution of the two routes of transmission to mutant fitness. When this ratio is above 1 the change in mutant frequency is mainly governed by the horizontal transmission route. In contrast, when it is below one the vertical transmission route contributes more to the mutant fitness. 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows that during the early stage of the epidemics horizontal transmission drives the evolution of the virulent mutant under all mixing treatments but that the contribution of vertical transmission is always increased by spatial structure.
