<p>The above model is an attempt to capture the interplay between the effects of spatial structure and vertical transmission on the evolution of pathogen virulence. To test these predictions experimentally we followed competition of the avirulent λ and virulent λcI857 in spatial epidemics after an initial inoculation of a 1:1 ratio of cells infected by λ or λcI857 onto a biofilm of susceptible cells. Thereupon spatial structure was either left

  <italic>undisturbed</italic>
 </bold> or disturbed for 
 <bold>
  <italic>30s</italic>
 </bold> or 
 <bold>
  <italic>24h</italic>
 </bold> in the absence of liquid, or 24h in the presence of liquid (
 <bold>
  <italic>24h-wet</italic>
 </bold>). By engineering fluorescent protein expression cassettes (CFP and YFP) into the viral genome we tagged infected cells by a fluorescent colour. This enabled us to directly visualize pathogen-host structure and spatial prevalence in these four environments (see 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In the 
 <bold>
  <italic>undisturbed</italic>
 </bold> treatment the epidemic spreads in a circular front segregating by viral types (λCFP or λYFP) but large areas remain uninfected (see 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In the 
 <bold>
  <italic>30s</italic>
 </bold> disturbance treatment the epidemic spreads through the entire biofilm and creates epidemic clusters dominated by a single type of virus (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). After 
 <bold>
  <italic>24h</italic>
 </bold> disturbance epidemic clusters disappear, but the biofilm remains structured (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). In the 
 <bold>
  <italic>24h-wet</italic>
 </bold> treatment epidemic structure is completely homogenized (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Thus, as expected from our model simulation (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), higher mixing is associated with a significant increase in overall prevalence of infection (χ
