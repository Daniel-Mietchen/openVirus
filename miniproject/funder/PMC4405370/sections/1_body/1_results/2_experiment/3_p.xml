<p>To disentangle the contribution of horizontal and vertical transmission to the fitness of λcI857 we repeated the experiment for the first round of spatial transfer with uninfected cells marked by the red fluorescent protein mCherry. This way we identified new infections from horizontal transmission as doubly coloured cells (mCherry and colour of the new infecting virus) and vertical transmission from the initial lysogen as singly coloured cells (colour of the originally integrated virus). From these data we calculated the competitive fitness of λcI857 among all new infections (horizontal fitness W
 <sub>H</sub>) and fitness among all vertical transmission events (vertical fitness W
 <sub>V</sub>) in each spatial environment. 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> presents the effect of mixing on the ratio W
 <sub>H</sub> / W
 <sub>V</sub> between horizontal and vertical fitness components of λcI857. In the absence of mixing both routes of transmission contribute to λcI857 fitness. Interestingly, in agreement with our theoretical prediction (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), we found that higher levels of mixing promote horizontal transmission (χ
 <sub>1</sub>
 <sup>2</sup> = 14,82, p = 0.002). For instance, in the highly mixed environment (
