  <italic>30s</italic>
 </bold> and 
 <bold>
  <italic>24h</italic>
 </bold>) yield intermediate levels of λcI857 fitness (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). This demonstrates that erosion of the spatial structure increases the fitness of the virulent λcI857 by ~500 fold. Note that additional transfers did not affect this pattern except for the treatment 30s where λcI857 fitness increases with time (
 <italic>t</italic> = 5.08, p&lt;10–4).
