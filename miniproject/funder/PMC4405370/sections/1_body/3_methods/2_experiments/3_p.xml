 <bold>Horizontal and vertical transmission</bold> was estimated by repeating the spatial epidemics for a single cycle with lysogens of λCFP, λYFP, λcI857CFP and λcI857YFP carrying pBAD18 and uninfected E.coli MG1655 carrying plasmid pRSET-mCherry. 20μg/ml Ampicillin was added to the medium to prevent spontaneous plasmid loss. Horizontal transmission events were scored by double coloration (mCherry+CFP and mCherry+YFP). Horizontal and vertical fitness were calculated as mentioned above by only considering mCherry+ or mCherry- cells.
