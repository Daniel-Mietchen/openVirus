 <bold>The relative fitness of Î»cI857</bold> was calculated as 
 <italic>W</italic> = (
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> /(1- 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>t</sub>))/ (
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> /(1- 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>)) where 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>t</sub> measures the frequency at time 
 <italic>t</italic>. In general the frequency was calculated over the whole host population. In 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> we distinguish horizontal fitness, W
 <sub>H</sub>, and vertical fitness, W
 <sub>V</sub>, by focusing either on the frequency in newly infected bacteria (bacteria carrying the plasmid pRSET-mCherry) or on the frequency in previously infected bacteria (bacteria that do not carry the plasmid pRSET-mCherry), respectively. In 
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> we present the ratio W
 <sub>H</sub> / W
 <sub>V</sub> for different mixing treatments.
