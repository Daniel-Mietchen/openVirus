<p>Host exploitation strategies of λ and λcI857 were quantified by three independent assays. 
 <bold>(1) Virus production (PFU/mL)</bold>: Lysogens were grown to OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> = 0.6 at 30°C and shifted to 35°C for 2h until lysis occurred. Viral titers were determined by qPCR (Roche LightCycler480 primers F:5’
 <monospace>AATGAAGGCAGGAAGTA</monospace>3’ R:5’
 <monospace>GCTTTCCATTCCATCGG</monospace>3’) on filtered lysates (Millipore 96-well filtration plate Multiscreen HTS). CP values were calibrated to PFU/ml by top-agar plating a dilution series of a λvir (3x10
 <sup>9</sup> pfu). 
 <bold>(2) Growth of infected hosts (CFU/mL)</bold>: Lysogens were diluted to OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> = 0.07 and grown for 6h at 35°C in eight replicates in 96-well plates (900 rpm, Titramax shaker (Heidolph, Germany)). Final OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> was measured in an Infinity200 microplate reader (Tecan, Austria). OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> values were calibrated to CFU/ml by plating a dilution curve. 
 <bold>(3) Lysogenization rate</bold> was determined by challenging non-infected E.coli MG1655 of OD
 <sub>600nm</sub> = 0.1 with 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/mL free virus particles of λCFP, λYFP, λcI857CFP and λcI857YFP for 24h. After 24h, the proportion of lysogenized (fluorescent) cells was determined by flow cytometry (Fig S2 in
