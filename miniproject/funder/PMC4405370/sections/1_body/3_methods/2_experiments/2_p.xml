<p>Fluorescently labelled phage were constructed as described in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Spatial epidemics were started by spreading a 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/ml suspension of uninfected E.coli MG1655 (starved 24h in 0.2%Maltose, 10mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>) onto agar plates until dried. Thereafter a 1:1 mixture of cells infected by λ and λcI857 was inoculated in localized spots by an array of 0.4mm stainless steel tattooing needles at about 4mm distance. Epidemic structure was disturbed by rolling 4mm sterile stainless steel beads over the dry agar surface for 
 <italic>30s</italic> or 
 <italic>24h</italic> or over agar surface humidified by sterile saline solution (
 <italic>24h-wet</italic>) or kept 
 <italic>undisturbed</italic>. Agar plates were incubated at 35°C in agitation (250rpm), but only in the 
 <italic>24h</italic> and 
 <italic>24h-wet</italic> treatment steel beads remained on the agar surface. To control for marker effects all competitions were carried out with reciprocal marker-mutant combinations (λYFP vs. λcI857CFP and λCFP vs. λcI857YFP). Spatial structure was photographed on an Olympus BH-2 RCF microscope with a 2x fluorite objective and filter cube #69380 (Chroma Thechnology Corp., VT, USA). For the daily transfer of the epidemic structure the needle array described above was poked into plates that had been incubated for 24 hours and subsequently the needle array was poked into agar plates containing a layer of uninfected cells as described above. For flowcytometry the bacterial layer was washed off with 2 ml saline and analysed on a B&amp;D Fortessa flowcytometer (Excitation CFP, YFP, mCherry at 405, 488 and 561 nm).
