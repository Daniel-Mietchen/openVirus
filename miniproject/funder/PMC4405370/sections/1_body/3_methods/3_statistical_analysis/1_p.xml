Mixing (undisturbed, 30 s, 24h and 24h-wet) and transfer day (1, 2 and 3) were fitted as fixed effects while population was nested within the marker effect (the two reciprocal marker-mutant combinations) to account for the repeated measurements at different points in time. The ratio W

Maximal models, including all higher-order interactions, were simplified by sequentially eliminating non-significant terms and interactions to establish a minimal model. The significance of explanatory variables in mixed effect models was established using a likelihood ratio test which is approximately distributed as a chi-square distribution [
