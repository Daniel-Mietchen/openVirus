<p>The theoretical analysis is presented in the supporting information (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>). We examine the evolutionary dynamics of a vertically and horizontally transmitted pathogen in a spatially structured environment. The analytical model reveals that the change in frequency can be decomposed in different terms that characterize the local environment of competing variants of the pathogens. These terms can be tracked in numerical simulations (
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Further understanding of the evolutionary dynamics can be obtained by focusing on the change in frequency of a mutant pathogen in hosts that have acquired the pathogen horizontally (
