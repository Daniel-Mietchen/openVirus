<p>First, epidemic spread reduces the density of susceptible hosts and can feed back on the selective pressure that favours intermediate exploitation strategies [

 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, decreased availability of susceptible hosts weakens selection for higher transmission rates [

 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Ultimately, this may select for intermediate evolutionarily stable strategies, balancing the benefit (transmission) and the cost (virulence: induced host mortality) of host exploitation. We recently tested this idea using the bacteriophage λ in experimental epidemics spreading through well-mixed environments [
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We confirmed that more virulent strains are indeed selected for during early epidemics, when uninfected hosts are abundant, but also that natural selection favours latent strains of the virus as disease prevalence increases.
