<p>This new theoretical model generates predictions that we tested experimentally with bacteriophage λ. Unlike our previous experimental study in chemostats [
 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the present experiment has been realized on agar plates to manipulate the amount of spatial structuring. Yet, on a normal agar plate bacterial growth eventually enters stationary phase and the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics halt. Consequently, our experiments allow us to test predictions during the initial phase of the epidemics only. During this phase we made three qualitative predictions that we verified experimentally. First, we confirmed that lower levels of mixing reduce the speed of the epidemic. Second, we confirmed that a virulent strain is outcompeted by a more prudent strain when the environment becomes increasingly structured. This is our main result and it agrees well with previous experimental studies realized with horizontally transmitted pathogens [

 <xref rid="ppat.1004810.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Third, our experimental setup allows monitoring the relative contribution of horizontal and vertical transmission among new infections and confirms that mixing decreases the contribution of vertical transmission to pathogen fitness.
