    "Objectives: Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) with the large-scale multicenter data based on a US FDA-approved testing method is important to guide ongoing vaccination programs in China. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study based on data from 11 large hospitals in central and eastern China. From October 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016, a total of 480,034 cervical specimens were collected, and 414,540 eligible participants (14-80 years, mean age 39.9 years) were included and tested using Cervista High-Risk HPV Assay (Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass, USA). Results: The overall hrHPV prevalence in this study was 17.8% (73,713/414,540), with Wuhan slightly higher than Zhejiang (18.6% vs. 17.6%, P < 0.001). The prevalence showed a declining trend from 2012 to 2016. The most common hrHPV group was A9 (61.7%), followed by A5/A6 (29.4%) and A7 (25.6%). A U-shaped curve was observed for age-specific hrHPV prevalence: ≤19 years and ≥50 years were higher than other age groups. Conclusion: In pre-vaccination period, A9 was the most dominant hrHPV group, and infections were most likely to occur at younger and older ages. The prevalence of hrHPV varied by cities and age groups, suggesting vaccination programs should be propagated in a population-specific approach."
