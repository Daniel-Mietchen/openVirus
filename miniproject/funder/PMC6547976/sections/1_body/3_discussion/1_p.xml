<p>This study depicted the prevalence of hrHPV in Central and Eastern China from 8 municipalities. These regions do not share geographical boarders, thus representing totally different regions in this large country. Among all 414,540 tests, 17.8% (73,713/ 414,540) presented hrHPV positive, while reported hrHPV prevalence among Chinese populations varied from 16.51%-30.90%.

In most clinical guidelines, HPV DNA testing was recommended to include co-testing with cervical cytology in screening only for women â‰¥30 years, while women aged &lt;21 years are not advised to undergo cervical cancer screening.

It is necessary to regulate the specific scope of application and standard processes of HPV screening. Nevertheless, these data is valuable for tracking HPV epidemics, and its infection and immune mechanisms in teenagers. Furthermore, the lack of nationwide cervical cancer screening in China makes prophylactic vaccinations particularly important. The evidence of HPV prevalence in teenagers is essential and timely in light of the forthcoming implementation of national vaccination programs, especially for determining the optimal age for HPV vaccination in China.
