<p>A U-shaped hrHPV prevalence curve across different age groups was observed, with the prevalence peaking in the ≤19 and ≥50 age groups and staying relatively low through 20-49 years, which is consistent with the trend that has been observed in other developing countries.

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The first peak of HPV infection occurred within the younger age group just after the beginning of sexual activity. Younger women are sensitive to HPV because of the immature immune protection for HPV and frequent sexual intercourse. Zhao et al. 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> conducted a multicenter survey on age of sexual debut and sexual behavior in Chinese women and concluded a trend towards earlier sexual debut and riskier sexual behaviors. The second peak appeared in the ≥50-year-old group. This trend reflected the viral persistence or reactivation of latent HPV due to higher viral loads, higher proportion of multiple-group infection and higher load of integrated HPV16 caused by physiological and immunological disorders related to hormone fluctuations during menopausal transition.
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Since other studies have claimed that HPV incidence gradually declines with increasing age in developing countries,
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> this kind of difference may come from discrepancy in screening strategies and socioeconomic development. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms involved in the progression of HPV prevalence require more well-designed studies for validation.
