<p>The prevalence of hrHPV gradually decreased from 2012 to 2016. HPV DNA testing was recommended as a triage-reflex testing to further evaluate women with an atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cytology result in 2012.
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Primary hrHPV screening alone was recommended as an alternative to current screening method in 2015.
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, as the notable advancement in screening strategy and laboratory testing, the use of hrHPV DNA tests were expanded. Our data also suggested that the number of tested patients involved in the study has mushroomed over time. The annual visits increased tenfold from 2013 to 2016, and the exact visit numbers were 15,443, 101,309, 152,714, and 144,171 for 2013-2016, respectively. This trend indicated that the coverage of HPV DNA tests amplified remarkably and the market share of Cervista increased over time. The observed decline could be explained by either the improvement of the quality assurance/quality control for true positive diagnosis or the mixture of primary screening samples and opportunistic samples. Furthermore, the economic development and enhanced women's health awareness might have also contributed to the increase.
