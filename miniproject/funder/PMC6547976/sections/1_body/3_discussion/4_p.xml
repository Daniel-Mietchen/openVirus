<p>The study also compared the hrHPV prevalence in women residing in Wuhan district and Zhejiang district, which are located in central and eastern China. Although women in both districts displayed similar age-specific infection patterns, the fluctuation tendency of HPV prevalence was somewhat different across geographical regions. For the Zhejiang district, younger women aged ≤19 years seemed to have the highest hrHPV prevalence (28.2%), whereas the highest prevalence for the Wuhan district (21.4%) appeared in older women aged ≥50 years. The overall prevalence of hrHPV infection in women in the Wuhan district was slightly higher than that in the Zhejiang district (18.6% vs. 17.6%). In addition, the proportion of A9 group and multiple-group infection in hrHPV positives of the Wuhan district were higher than that of the Zhejiang district. The regional discrepancy of hrHPV prevalence may be attributed to different economic levels, lifestyle habits, and individual awareness of HPV screening in the two districts. Since the incidence of cervical cancer in the Wuhan district (27.1/100,000) was higher than that of Zhejiang (11.0/100,000),
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> the distribution of cervical cancer is consistent with the present hrHPV prevalence of these two districts. Moreover, the prevalence of sexual intercourse was higher among teenagers of the Zhejiang district than that of the Wuhan district,
