<p>In this study, the A9 HPV group, which included HPV types of 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58, accounted for 61.7% of all hrHPV positives and 11.1% of all tested people. This group was significantly greater than that of the A5/A6, A7 groups. When comparing HPV groups by age, the A9 group was the most prevalent, similar to other reports from China and other Asian regions.

Differences among the relative hrHPV groups infection might be related to the geographical and biological interactions between various groups, and the host immunological characteristics.
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The infection of A9 HPV group may show the latent persistence tendency, especially for HPV type 16, the most common HPV genotype in high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. A related study also proposed that using the Cervista A9 alone as the primary screening had reasonable sensitivity and specificity for CIN 2.
