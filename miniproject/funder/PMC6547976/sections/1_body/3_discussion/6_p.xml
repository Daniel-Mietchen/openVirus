<p>The advent of the prophylactic HPV vaccines is a significant public health milestone.
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, they were previously unavailable in mainland China until the recent licensing of the bivalent HPV vaccine which covers HPV 16 and 18, and the tetravalent HPV vaccine which covers HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11. Therefore, the current study may provide necessary information for related cost-effective analysis and regional and age-oriented vaccination programs in central and eastern China. Furthermore, the Cervista HPV DNA test was approved by the US FDA and recommended for clinical use in published guidelines, which makes our data more reliable, especially with a considerable database containing nearly half a million visit counts.

However, this analysis of HPV infection has also encountered several potential limitations. First, due to lack of organized cervical cancer screening program in mainland China, some samples recruited in the study came from women with opportunistic cervical lesions. Secondly, the exact prevalence may be biased because of the absence of supporting cytological data and sampling of tissue specimens. Nevertheless, large amounts of data were gathered to overcome these shortcomings. Thirdly, Cervista assay cannot distinguish the exact genotypes, and failed to show the estimated genotype-specific infections. Further analysis with cytological data and tissue specimens is planned.
