<p>The Cervista HPV HR test used the Invader Â® chemistry, a signal amplification method for detection of specific nucleic acid sequences.
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Based on the correlation among 14 types of hrHPV DNA gene sequences, the 14 HPV DNA types were tested in groups with three different oligonucleotide mixtures, A5/A6, A7, and A9. An A5/A6 oligonucleotide probe mixture (Oligo Mixes) was used for detecting HPV types 51, 56, and 66 (the A5/A6 group of HPV), an A7 oligonucleotide probe mixture was used for HPV types 18, 39, 45, 59, and 68 (the A7 group of HPV), and an A9 oligonucleotide mixture was used for HPV types of 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58 (the A9 group of HPV).
