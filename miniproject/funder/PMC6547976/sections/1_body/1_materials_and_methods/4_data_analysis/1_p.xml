<p>Numerical data were summarized as means ± standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables were presented as percentage (%). The overall and age-specific hrHPV prevalence were calculated by dividing positive cases by total or age-specific subjects. The hrHPV group-specific and single/multiple-group prevalence were calculated as the percentages of corresponding positive cases within total positive cases. Two-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was estimated for each calculation. We further stratified the data by age (≤19 years, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, and ≥50 years), specific Cervista groups and regions, and tested statistical significance using Chi-square tests. Raw data were entered into an Excel spread sheet and analyzed using SPSS 22.0 statistical software.
