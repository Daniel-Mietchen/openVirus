<p>Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A show the distribution of hrHPV infection subdivided into five age groups. In the study population, the age-specific prevalence appeared to be U-shaped with ≤19 years (28.2%, 95% CI: 25.6-30.7) and ≥50 years (21.4%, 95% CI: 21.1-21.7) groups exhibiting higher prevalence than any other age group (all 
 <italic>P</italic>s &lt; 0.001, Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">S3</xref>). Among hrHPV positive cases, A5/A6, A7, and A9 groups accounted for 29.4%, 25.6% and 61.7% respectively. A9 was the most common HPV group in each age group of women. The proportion of single-group infection in hrHPV positive was highest at 30-49 years (85.65%), while multiple-group was highest in the ≤19 and ≥50 years groups (25.2% and 21.1%, respectively). Age-specific hrHPV prevalence varied by regions. Women from Zhejiang district were more likely to contract hrHPV at a younger age (&lt;30 years), while after 30 years of age, hrHPV infection was more common among women from the Wuhan district (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). Additionally, the multiple-group infection proportion was higher in the Wuhan district than in the Zhejiang district except ≤19 years group (Figure
