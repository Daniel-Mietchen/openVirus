<p>This study included 480,034 hospital visits with a mean age of 39.9 ± 10.4 years (Zhejiang district, 40.2 ± 10.4 years; Wuhan district, 38.1 ± 10.1 years). As displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the overall hrHPV prevalence in this study was 17.8% (73,713/414,540), with the Wuhan district presenting a slightly higher rate than the Zhejiang district (18.6% vs. 17.6%;

However, great variability in hrHPV prevalence rate was observed among eight cities (14.0%-20.6%). hrHPV single-group infection accounted for 83.6% positive tests, and multiple-group accounted for 16.4%. The prevalence of single-group within hrHPV positive tests were higher than that of multiple-group in all cities. We also presented the prevalence of hrHPV by year in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. hrHPV prevalence seemed to have a declining trend from 2012 to 2016. (
