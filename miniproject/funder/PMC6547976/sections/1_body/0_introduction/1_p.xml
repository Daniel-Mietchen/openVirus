<p>As one of the most serious health concerns to women all around the world, cervical cancer ranks second in all diagnosed cancers in women from developing countries.
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Almost all cases of cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV), including HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68.
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Early hrHPV screening of the general population is essential for early detection and intervention of CIN and cervical cancers. According to a meta-analysis that studied 1 million women with negative cytology results, the estimated global HPV prevalence was 11.7%.
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Even though several studies have assessed the prevalence of HPV strains in mainland China,

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> most of them focused on HPV genotyping test approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). So far, NMPA has approved more than 100 HPV DNA test kits 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> with only five high-risk (HR) HPV DNA test kits approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) since 2003. To unveil HPV prevalence patterns in central and eastern China, we recorded 480,034 tests using Cervista High-Risk HPV Assay (Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass, USA) in eight large cities in China. Cervista HPV HR is widely used in primary cervical screening in China. It can detect the 14 types of HPV grouped according to phylogenetic relatedness, i.e., viral types with similar DNA sequences. These probe sets are A5/A6 (HPV types 51, 56, and 66), A7 (HPV types 18, 39, 45, 59, and 68), and A9 (HPV types 16, 31, 33, 35, 52, and 58).
