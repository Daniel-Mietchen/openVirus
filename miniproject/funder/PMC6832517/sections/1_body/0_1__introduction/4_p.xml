<p>In Italy, BTV appeared for the first time in Sardinia in 2000. This incursion, due to BTV-2, caused severe clinical signs and death in the affected sheep. BTV-2 then rapidly spread to Sicily and to other regions of South-Central Italy (Basilicata, Lazio, Campania, and Tuscany) [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Even if the most implicated vector of the Sardinian BTV-2 outbreaks was 
 <italic>C. imicola,</italic> other 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, including 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus,</italic> contributed to the BTV spread in Italy [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. BTV-2 was in fact isolated from species of the Obsoletus complex caught in Campania and Apulia regions [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. BTV-2 has never been reported in Central-Northern Europe. Since this first occurrence, several other BTV incursions were reported in the Italian territory, involving serotypes 1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 8, and 3 [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The second BTV strain selected for this study was the BTV-8 responsible for the most severe BT epidemic ever reported in Europe. After emerging in Central Europe in 2006, it further spread to Northern and Southern European countries. It appeared in Italy in 2008, invading Northern Italy and the Sardinia region in 2009. The third selected BTV strain was the BTV-4, originating from the Balkan peninsula, which has been responsible for the recent Italian (2014–2019) and French (2018–2019) epidemics. This strain has been detected in pools of the Obsoletus complex (Apulia) [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in pools of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> in Sardinia in 2017 (unpublished data). Finally, the fourth selected strain was a BTV-4 reassortant strain, containing sequences from previous BTV-1 (MOR2006/06) and BTV-4 (MOR 2004/02) strains that spread in Morocco and neighboring regions. It circulated in Morocco in 2009 [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but was never reported in Italy or in Central-Northern Europe. With a positive correlation between disease and its abundance/distribution, 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> was suggested to be the main vector species [
