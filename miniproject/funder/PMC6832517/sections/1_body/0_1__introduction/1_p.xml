 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are biological vectors of several important arboviruses such as those causing Bluetongue (BT), African horse sickness, and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Because of the direct effect of the disease on animals, but especially because of the ensuing ban on international trade of ruminants and their products between BTV-infected and non-infected areas, outbreaks of Bluetongue virus (BTV) continue to have significant economic impacts in Europe and worldwide. In relation to the spread of BTV strains, two distinct and interconnected epidemiological systems (episystems), with different ecological characteristics and vector species, have been identified in Europe. The concept of episystem includes the set of biological, environmental, and epidemiological elements of a disease in defined geographic and temporal scales [
