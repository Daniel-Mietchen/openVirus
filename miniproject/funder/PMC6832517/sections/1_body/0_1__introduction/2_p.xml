<p>One episystem is distributed in Southern Europe (Mediterranean Basin), where BTV is primarily spread by 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic>, and one in Southern, Central, and Northern Europe, in which species of the Obsoletus complex act as main vectors [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the recent European incursions, some BTV strains were able to successfully spread and adapt in both episystems, while some other strains remained confined to one episystem only. It has been hypothesized that this capacity to spread and adapt to different episystems is somehow related to the vector competence of the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species present. It has been observed that the BTV spreading in the US western states was strictly associated to the different distribution of the two more common indigenous species, 
 <italic>Culicoides sonorensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Culicoides variipennis</italic>, and to their different vector competence [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to its particular geographic position, Italy comprises both episystems. 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> and species of the Obsoletus complex are geographically complementary and together cover the whole Italian peninsula [
