<p>The Obsoletus complex is a monophyletic group. In Italy, it is composed almost exclusively by two species, 
 <italic>Culicoides obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culicoides scoticus</italic>, although a third species, 
 <italic>Culicoides montanus</italic>, is rarely recorded. This study aimed to investigate the vector competence of different Italian populations of 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> to some BTV strains responsible for recent incursions in the Mediterranean basin and Europe after artificial oral feeding. Four BTV strains (BTV-4 ITA 2014, BTV-2 2001, BTV-4 MOR, BTV-8 2006) were selected based on their ability to spread to one or two episystems.
