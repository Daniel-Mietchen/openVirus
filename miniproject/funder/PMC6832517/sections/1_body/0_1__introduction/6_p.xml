<p>In this study, two artificial blood feeding methods were used: the Hemotek membrane system and cotton wool pledgets. Because of their reluctance to feed under laboratory conditions, few artificial oral feeding and BTV vector competence studies have been carried out on species of the Obsoletus complex [
