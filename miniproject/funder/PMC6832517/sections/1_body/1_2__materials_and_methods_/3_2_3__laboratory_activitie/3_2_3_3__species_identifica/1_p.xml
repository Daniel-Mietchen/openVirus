<p>Identification keys, mainly based on wing morphology, and a multiplex PCR, based on internal transcribed spacer 2 ribosomal DNA sequences (ITS2), were used to identify midges [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The morphological identification was performed under the stereomicroscope on a chill table according to Delécolle, Campbell and Pelham-Clinton, and Goffredo and Meiswinkel [

 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, molecular techniques are required to identify 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> at species level [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. From each midge head homogenate, total nucleic acids were extracted using the Biosprint
 <sup>®</sup> 96 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA was used for midge identification while RNA for viral analysis. When species identification was inconclusive, DNA extraction was repeated with the automated Maxwell 16 system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with the DNA IQ Casework Sample kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The ITS-2 segment of ribosomal DNA was amplified using the primers 5.8 SF, 28 SR, Scoticus-194R, MOU-316F, and Montanus-227R [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In this study, we refer to “
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic>” or to “
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic>” depending on whether they have been identified by morphological or morphological/molecular tools, respectively. Once identified, midges were individually stored at −80 °C for virus detection.
