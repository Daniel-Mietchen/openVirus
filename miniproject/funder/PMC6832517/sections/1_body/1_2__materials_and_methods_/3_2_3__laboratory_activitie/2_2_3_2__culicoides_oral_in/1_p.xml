<p>All experimental infection phases were performed at IZSAM in a dedicated room within the BSL3 facilities. To obtain the blood meals for infecting 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>, BTV suspensions were diluted (1:3, 1:4 or 1:5) in defibrinated cattle or sheep blood. 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> were fed for 45 min using either the Hemotek blood feeding system with a Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> membrane or the cotton pledgets in accordance with the method described by Venter and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The Parafilm Hemotek system has already been successfully used for feeding field-collected 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> and vector competence studies, obtaining feeding rates comparable with those achieved when using one-day old-chick stretched skins [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Each feeder unit of the Hemotek system was set to warm the blood meal to 37 °C. A total of 73 feedings were carried out. After each meal, an aliquot of the blood used for feeding was retained and the BTV titer assessed using the Reed and Muench formula [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Fed 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> were immobilized on dry ice, and fully engorged females of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> were sorted and counted using a refrigerate chill-table and stereomicroscope. Six to thirty-five blooded midges were assayed after feeding (0 days post-infection, dpi) to establish baseline infection rates and to determine virus load in each midge. The remainder were incubated in cardboard boxes at 25 °C and 80% &gt; HR &gt; 40% for 10 days with ad libitum access to 10% sucrose solution. Those 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> which survived the incubation period were killed on dry ice and dissected. The heads and thorax/abdomens of each insect were stored separately at −80 °C until further analyses.
