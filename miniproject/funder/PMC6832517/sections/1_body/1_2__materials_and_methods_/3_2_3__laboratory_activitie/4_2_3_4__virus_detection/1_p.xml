<p>The RT-PCR described by Hofmann et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was used to detect BTV in midge heads. The VetMAX European BTV Typing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was instead used to determine the BTV serotype. The serogroup-specific RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] used in this study is the test recommended by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Its performance in the laboratory has been verified and validated for all known BTV serotypes and most of the strains circulating in the Mediterranean Basin according to the ISO 17025 validation guidelines. To control the entire process, Armored RNA West Nile Virus (HNY1999) (Asuragen, Austin, TX, USA) was included in each PCR reaction as an internal positive control. The threshold cycle value used as a cut off for best discriminating between positive and negative samples was 50. Ct values less than 50 were considered as positive, while those with Ct values equal to 50 as negative. With regard to the Typing kit, according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, the Ct value for the best discrimination between positive and negative samples was 40. For each population/strain, the recovery rate (number of BTV positive heads/number of tested heads) was calculated using both the serogroup- and the serotype-specific RT-PCR. The inclusion of the serotype-specific RT-PCR in this trial was necessary since in Sardinia, on the farm where 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> midges were trapped for BTV-8 competence studies, BTV-4 was circulating at the time of collection. Being a highly specific test, the typing kit has been used to rule out natural infection with BTV-4; therefore, its results were considered when comparing rates involving BTV-8 from the Sardinian population. On the other hand, results obtained with the serogroup-specific RT-PCR, which is more sensitive than the type-specific RT-PCR, were used in most of the recovery rate comparisons made in this study. In analyzing the recovery rate data, more or less conservative approaches were evaluated based on the RT-PCRs cut off levels. The mean Ct values detected immediately after feeding (0 dpi) were also compared with those achieved after the incubation period (10 dpi), and any reduction was interpreted as further evidence of virus replication in the salivary glands [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], midge heads were used to detect the virus and determine the recovery rates. Though unlikely, there was a chance that salivary glands remained in the thorax when heads were separated. However, since salivary gland barriers have not been described for 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], presence of BTV in the head, expressing the complete virus dissemination in the midge, can still be considered a valid indicator of BTV vector competency [
