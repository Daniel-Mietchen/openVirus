<p>Statistical differences on recovery and feeding rates were investigated through a Bayesian approach, using the Beta distribution. Beta distribution is a type of probability distribution. This distribution represents a family of probabilities and is a versatile way to represent outcomes for percentages or proportions [

The comparisons between the recovery and feeding rates were considered significant when the confidence intervals, calculated through the beta distribution, did not overlap.
