<p>Another important element to take into consideration for the evaluation of the vector competency is the RT-PCR Ct value at 0 and 10 dpi. Ct values at 10 dpi lower than those found at 0 dpi may imply virus replication in the salivary glands [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and, ultimately, a role for oral transmission. In analyzing the recovery rate data, more or less conservative approaches have been evaluated based on the RT-PCR cut off levels. Because of the great variations of the RT-PCR results and the Ct values observed, to have solid competence data and avoid possible overestimation, a more conservative approach was taken, and only those cases where the RT-PCR Ct values at 10 dpi were lower than the Ct mean values observed at 0 dpi were included in the analysis. Apart from the Abruzzo population of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/C. scoticus</italic>, which was refractory to BTV-4 MOR infection, all orally infected vector populations tested in this study were able to sustain the BTV strain replication, even that of BTV-4 MOR, a strain which has never been reported in Italy. Unfortunately, the rather low proportion of infected midges obtained after the artificial feeding precluded some competence evaluations and reduced the statistical power of the comparisons.
