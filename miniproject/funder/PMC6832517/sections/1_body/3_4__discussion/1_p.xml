<p>Vector competence is the susceptibility of the vector to infection with the pathogen and the ability of the infected vector to transmit the pathogen to a host during blood feeding. Vector competence is a key component in the vectorâ€“pathogen cycle. This study describes the vector competence of different field-collected populations of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> from different sites of Italy, after oral exposure to four bluetongue virus strains (BTV-2, BTV-4 ITA, BTV-4 MOR, and BTV-8). These strains were selected on the basis of their spread and adaptation to different episystems in Europe and the Mediterranean basin. Artificial feeding systems are valuable tools that can be used to investigate vector competence of blood feeding arthropods and have been previously utilized to investigate the vector of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges and various BTV strains [
