<p>Overall, BTV recovery rates from 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> were significantly higher than those recovered from species of the Obsoletus complex. In other words, this study indicated a probably higher susceptibility of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> to the selected BTV strains in comparison to the Obsoletus complex populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it was possible to compare the competences of either 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species. Considering the Obsoletus complex populations, 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> were present with a predominance of 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> in either populations. Both species were susceptible to all BTV without any significant difference of recovery rates. Differences of recovery rate among 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations could definitely influence the distribution of BTV strains [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Regardless, it must be taken into account that a low susceptibility does not necessarily imply a low vector capacity. Vector competence is just a component of vector capacity, so other elements (high abundance, wide distribution, high biting rate, etc.) are important for virus spread. A low susceptibility could be compensated for by the abundance and wide distribution, as in the case of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and species of the Obsoletus complex in Italy. Susceptibility to infection with BTV can vary in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> at species and populations levels [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is difficult to understand the cause of the variation in recovery rates between different populations, especially of the same species, since interactions between virus and midge are very complex and poorly investigated. Vector competence could be influenced by hereditary and environmental factors, including the composition of gut microbiota [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It has been observed that a blood meal on its own alters the composition/abundance of gut microbiota and influences the expression of antimicrobial peptides [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Further studies about transcriptomic analysis and virome and microbiome composition of the Italian populations of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> analyzed in this work might allow better understanding these complex and dynamic mechanisms of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> infection and vector competence.
