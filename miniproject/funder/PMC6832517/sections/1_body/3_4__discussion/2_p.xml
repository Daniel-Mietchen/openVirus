<p>Midges were orally infected using the Hemotek blood feeding system through Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> membrane and the cotton wool pledgets. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> membrane is suitable for 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> even though, because of its low feeding rate (1–2.03%), a great number of midges should be used for feeding (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00941-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The same cannot be said for species of the Obsoletus complex, since even a great number of midges was not enough to achieve low feeding rates (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00941-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The reluctance of this complex to blood-feed through membrane-based systems has been previously documented [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because of the low feeding rates achieved using the Hemotek system, vector competence comparisons were mostly made on the data obtained when midges were fed on cotton pledgets. The Hemotek membrane data were used for comparing the susceptibility of the Sardinia population of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> to the various BTV strains only. The high feeding rate via the cotton method for both 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> is in line with the results of other research groups [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Higher feeding rates, however, do not mean recovery rates. Although acquiring significantly lower feeding rates, the BTV recovery rates from the Sardinian population of 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> fed through the Hemotek membrane were significantly higher than those fed on cotton pledgets. Venter [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] also found BTV recovery rates from 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. bolitinos</italic> fed on cotton pads significantly lower than those fed through the membrane system. The authors hypothesized that the lower recovery rate was probably a consequence of the reduced blood intake (by about 30%) of the midges fed on cotton pads. In their study, the blood meal size was calculated for each method by weighting fed (partially/full engorged not specified) and unfed midges. In this study, only the full engorged females were taken and, thus, the lower dissemination rates cannot be ascribed to a reduced blood intake but to other factors associated to the cotton wool fibers, in particular to their possible interaction with the virus, making it less accessible for midges during feeding.
