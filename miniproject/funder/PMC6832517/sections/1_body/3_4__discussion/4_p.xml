<p>The vector competence of the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations involved in this trial was determined by testing the heads of midges using serogroup-specific and serotype-specific RT-PCRs after an incubation period of ten days. Positive heads implicated a potential competence for BTV transmission due to the absence of a salivary gland barrier to BTV in 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As expected, the serogroup-specific RT-PCR was more sensitive than the type-specific RT-PCR. However, in Sardinia, in the farm where field 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> midges were trapped for BTV-8 competence studies, BTV-4 was circulating at the time of collection. Thus, to avoid false positive results which could be derived from the use of serogroup-specific RT-PCR in testing BTV-4 positive midges, the type-specific RT-PCR was included in this study. Its results were used in all vector competence comparisons, which included BTV-8 and the Sardinian population of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>. For the remainder of the recovery rate comparisons, the results of the serotype-specific RT-PCR assay were used.
