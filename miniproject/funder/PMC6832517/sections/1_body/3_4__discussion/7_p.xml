<p>Significant differences were also observed between the BTV recovery rates from the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations tested in this trial. Particularly interesting are the results obtained in the Sardinian population of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> after feeding through the Hemotek membrane system. Sardinia has represented and represents the main entrance for most of the Italian BTV incursions. From the Sardinian midge population, the recovery rates of BTV-2, BTV-4 ITAm and BTV-8 were higher than the rate observed for BTV-4 MOR. The higher competence shown by the Sardinian population of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> for these 3 BTV strains could explain their successful spread in the island during the BTV-2, BTV-8, and BTV-4 incursions occurring in 2000–2001, 2009, and 2016–2017, respectively [

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges on cotton wool also evidenced differences in the BTV-4ITA recovery rates from the Sardinian and Abruzzo 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations. The recovery rate from the Sardinia 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> population (5%, 95%CI 2.99–8.43%) was significantly higher than that obtained from the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> of Abruzzo (0.53%, 95%CI 0.13–2.88%%). This different susceptibility might have contributed to the different impact that the 2016–2017 BTV-4ITA incursion had on the livestock of the two regions. More than 70,000 animals were affected in Sardinia, with an infectious rate of 13.62% (95%CI: 13.53–13.72%), while the affected animals in Abruzzo were only 31, with an infectious rate of 2.84% (95%CI: 2.01–4.01%).
