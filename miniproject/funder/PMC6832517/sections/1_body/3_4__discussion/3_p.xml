<p>Another important variable that has been shown to influence the recovery rate following artificial feeding is the virus titer of the blood meal. Paweska [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00941" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] stated that there is a strong linear correlation between the virus recovery rates from midges tested immediately after feeding and the virus titer of the blood meal. In this trial, high blood meal titers were used (ranging between 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL and 10
 <sup>6.54</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) which are similar to the realistic viremic host titers (10
 <sup>4</sup>â€“10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) [
