 <italic>C. imicola</italic> fed via the Hemotek system achieved the best recovery rates regardless of BTV strains. The BTV recovery rate resulting from the serotype-specific RT-PCR at 10 dpi from the Sardinian population of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> (66.39%, 95%CI = 62.87–69.74%) fed through the Hemotek membrane was significantly higher than the rate obtained when the same population was fed on cotton wool (3.60%, 95%CI = 2.40–5.39%) (

The recovery rates remained significantly higher when the more conservative approach, which considered cases where RT-PCR Ct values decreased after the 10–day incubation period, was taken (48.41%, 95%CI = 44.78–52.05% vs. 2.78%, 95% CI = 1.75–4.41%) (
