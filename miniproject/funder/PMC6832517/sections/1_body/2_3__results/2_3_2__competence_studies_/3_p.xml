<p>When midges fed on cotton wool pledgets soaked in infected blood, all 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations tested were susceptible to the BTV strains selected for this trial, with the exception of the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> population of Abruzzo and BTV-4 MOR. However, the BTV recovery rates obtained from 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> were significantly higher than those from 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> (0.83%, 95%CI = 0.41–1.69%; 0.35%, 95%CI = 0.13–1.03%;) when either the serotype-specific RT-PCR (2.55%, 95%CI = 1.81–3.60%) or the 0–10 dpi Ct value reduction (1.64%, 95%CI = 1.07–2.53%) were used as criteria for determining the vector competence. If considered individually, the recovery rate of BTV-2 from the 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> population of Lazio (12%; 95%CI = 6.5–21.3%) was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than those from the Abruzzo (2.7%; 95%CI = 1.2–5.7%) and Calabria (3.2%; 95%CI = 1.6–6.4%) midge populations. Similarly, the BTV-4 MOR recovery rate from the Abruzzo 
 <italic>Culicoides obsoletus/scoticus</italic> population (0%; 95%CI = 0–2.3%) was significantly lower than those from 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> of Lazio (6.3%; 95%CI = 2.5–15%) and 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> of Calabria (6.9%; 95%CI = 3.6–13%) (

 <italic>C. imicola</italic> population of Sardinia compared to those determined for 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> of Abruzzo.
