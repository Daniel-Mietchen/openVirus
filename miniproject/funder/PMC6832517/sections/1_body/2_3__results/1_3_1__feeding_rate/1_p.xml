<p>More than 250,000 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> were orally fed in 73 attempts. A total of 6013 midges were engorged after feeding (2203 by Hemotek membrane, 3810 using the cotton method). Of these, 262 were analyzed at 0 dpi and 3218 at 10 dpi. Feeding rates and surviving midges at 10 dpi are reported in 
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00941-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. They were grouped according to collection site, BTV strain, and feeding method. When the Hemotek membrane feeding system was used, not all the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations investigated were fed successfully. Due to the very low feeding rates obtained, the use of this system was limited to the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> populations of Sardinia, Abruzzo, and Calabria and to some BTV strains only (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00941-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The feeding method influenced the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> blood-feeding rates, with the cotton pledget (15.88%, 95%CI = 15.43–16.35%) resulting in a significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) blood-feeding rate than the Hemotek Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> membrane (0.97%, 95%CI = 0.93–1.01%). All feeding attempts made using the cotton pledget method were successful, with rates ranging from 9.6% for 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> (Sardinia BTV-8) to 41.62% for 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> of Lazio (BTV-8) (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00941-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). With regard to the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, the 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> population feeding success rates (1.02%, 95%CI = 0.98–1.07%) were significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than those of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> (0.07%, 95%CI = 0.04–0.13%) when the Hemotek system was used. Conversely, when cotton pledget was used, a significantly higher rate (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> (16.78%, 95%CI = 16.11–17.48%) was successfully fed compared to the 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> (15.06%, 95%CI = 14.45–15.70%).
