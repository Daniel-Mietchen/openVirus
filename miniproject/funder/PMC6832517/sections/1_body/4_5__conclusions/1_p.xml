<p>This study has provided some important data on the vector competence of different 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/scoticus</italic> populations in Italy in relation to four BTV strains. The results obtained prove that, except for the Abruzzo population of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus/C. scoticus</italic>, which was refractory to BTV-4 MOR infection, all the investigated populations were susceptible to the BTV strains used in the trial, showing, in some instances, significant differences in recovery rates depending on midge population and/or BTV strain. Considering the wide distribution of 
 <italic>C. obsoletus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. scoticus</italic> in Europe, these findings provided evidence that strains like BTV-2 and BTV-4 MOR could have spread all over Europe. Their dissemination failure might have been a consequence of successful vaccination programs and the correct application of restriction measures. Their success was a consequence of contemporaneous appliance of both vaccination of susceptible animals and restricting movement of viremic animals between BT-affected and BT-free zones. The BTV-2 and BTV-4 vaccination campaigns used either modified live vaccines (BTV-2 and BTV-4 outbreaks in Balearic Islands and Corsica in 2000 and 2001, Italy 2003â€“2004) or inactivated vaccines (BTV-4 outbreaks in Southwest Spain in 2004 and 2005). Both campaigns targeted all susceptible ruminant species, achieved a high degree of herd immunity, and included extensive areas surrounding any active BT outbreaks [
