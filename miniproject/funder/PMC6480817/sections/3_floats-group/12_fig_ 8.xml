  <p>Alignment of nucleotide sequences of 
   <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes. The sequences (
   <italic>c.</italic>300 bp in length) in each alignment are highly similar, differing by 1 or 2 nucleotides. Only the region with variations is showed in the figure. The intron is highlighted in yellow. The codons encoding the insecticide resistance related amino acid residues are underlined. Asterisks indicate identical nucleotides
