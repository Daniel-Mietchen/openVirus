  <p>Molecular phylogenetic analysis by the maximum likelihood method based on D2 sequences. The GenBank accessions for the sequences identified in this study (named as D2Hx) are provided in Table 
   <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−917.40) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with the superior log-likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 27 nucleotide sequences. There were a total of 317 positions in the final dataset
