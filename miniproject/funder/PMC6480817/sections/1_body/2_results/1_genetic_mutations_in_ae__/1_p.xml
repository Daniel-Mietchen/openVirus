<p id="Par21">The domain II fragment (D2) contained partial exon 20, the full intron 20 and partial exon 21 of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus VGSC</italic> gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Two non-synonymous mutations, S1000Y (TCC to TAC) and V1016G (GTA to GGA), were detected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 1000Y was found in seven individuals from TZ, and existed in the heterozygous form. 1016G was found in both heterozygotes and homozygotes.
