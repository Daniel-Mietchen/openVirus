<p id="Par22">The domain III fragment (D3) contained partial exon 28, the full intron 28 and partial exon 29 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Three non-synonymous mutations I1532T (ATC or ATA to ACC), F1534S (TTC to TCC) and F1534L (TTC to TTG) were identified in exon 29 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). 1532T and 1534S existed in both heterozygous and homozygous forms. 1534L was only found in one heterozygote from TZ. The 1534C allele was not detected in our samples.
