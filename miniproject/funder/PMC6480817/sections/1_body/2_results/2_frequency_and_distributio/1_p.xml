<p id="Par23">In the examined 17 populations, IR-related (
 <italic>kdr</italic>) mutations at three loci (1016, 1532 and 1534) were detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The difference in distribution of each 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutation is obvious in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. For example, diverse mutations at multiple sites were detected in TZ, while 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutation was not observed in HR. 1016G was detected in 13 of the 17 populations with a frequency ranging from 0.019 (MY) to 0.647 (HD). Specifically, the frequency of the 1016G allele was relatively high in the urban zones (e.g. DC, HD, SJS, FT), but low in rural areas. In particular, 1016G was not detected in four rural districts HR, YQ, PG and SY.
