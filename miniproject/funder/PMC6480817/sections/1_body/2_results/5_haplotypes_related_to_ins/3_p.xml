<p id="Par31">There was only one individual that harbored the 1534L in our samples, leading to the identification of one 1534L haplotype (D3H12). D3H12 was highly similar to MH384952.1 (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> voucher JN08 voltage-gated sodium channel gene) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; they encoded the same amino acid sequence with only one variation (G/A) in the third position of codon 1534 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). No haplotype harboring both 1532 and 1534 mutations was observed after examining all 12 specimens that carried both 1532T and 1534S.
