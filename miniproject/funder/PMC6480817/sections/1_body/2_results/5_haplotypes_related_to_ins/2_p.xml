<p id="Par30">The 1534S mutation was found in 20 individuals, of which 16 (12 from TZ, one each from DX, FS, OFP and SJS) were used for haplotype identification. Two different 1534S haplotypes (D3H03 and D3H13) were found. Sequence alignment showed that the two haplotypes differed in both exon and intron regions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, their distribution was different: D3H03 was found only in TZ, while D3H13 was exclusively detected in the other four sites (DX, FS, OFP and SJS). A BLAST search showed that the sequence of D3H03 was identical to that of MH384960.1 (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> voucher HK48 voltage-gated sodium channel gene), and D3H13 was identical to MH384956.1 (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> voucher YP01 voltage-gated sodium channel gene) [
