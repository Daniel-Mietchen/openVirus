<p id="Par28">Similarly, 19 haplotypes were identified based on 165 sequences of D3 from 124 individuals (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Length polymorphisms were also observed in intron-28 among these haplotypes. The shortest intron was 67 bp, while the longest one was 83 bp. In the coding region (246 bp in length), there were 10 polymorphic sites, leading to non-synonymous mutations at codons 1532 and 1534 (Fig.
