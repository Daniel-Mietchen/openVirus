 <italic>VGSC</italic> haplotypes were experimentally clarified from our samples. Seventeen haplotypes were identified based on 200 sequences of D2 from 151 individuals in this study (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Sequence analysis showed that there were length polymorphisms in intron-20 among these haplotypes; the shortest intron was 71 bp, while the longest one was 91 bp. In the exon region of D2 (230 bp in length), 11 sites were polymorphic. The nucleotide variations resulted in two amino acid substitutions (S1000Y and V1016G) (Fig.
