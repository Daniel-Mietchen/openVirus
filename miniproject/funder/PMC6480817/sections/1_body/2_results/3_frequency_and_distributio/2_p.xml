<p id="Par26">Triple-locus wild homozygotes (Type 1) were observed in 16 populations. This type occurred at high frequencies in HR (1.000), MY (0.963), YQ (0.917), FS (0.885), SY (0.833), MTG (0.800) and CP (0.733), but at low frequencies in TZ and OFP. The presence of single mutation was observed at loci 1016, 1532 and 1534 respectively (Types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). The combinations (Type 5 and Type 6) heterozygous at one IR-related locus (either 1016 or 1532) were widely distributed. Combinations (Types 9, 10 and 11) heterozygous at two of the three 
 <italic>kdr</italic> loci (i.e. 1016 + 1532, 1016 + 1534, or 1532 + 1534) were detected. Single mutant homozygotes 1016GG (Type 2), 1532TT (Type 3) and 1534SS (Type 4) were present, while there were no double-loci mutant homozygotes or triple-locus mutant individuals.
