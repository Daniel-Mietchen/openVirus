<p id="Par25">From our samples in a total of 426 individuals, we found 11 types of triple-locus genotype combinations in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The number of triple-locus genotype combinations observed in each sampling site ranged from 1 (HR) to 10 (TZ). Notably, similar genotype distribution patterns were observed between DC and XC, and between DX and SJS. In addition, two combinations (Type 4 and Type 8) were uniquely present in TZ.
