<p id="Par32">To investigate the phylogenetic relationship of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes with other wild counterparts, two maximum likelihood trees were constructed based on terminal-truncated D2 and D3 sequences, and some corresponding sequences retrieved from GenBank (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows that the D2H07 harboring 1016G substitution is closely clustered with D2H05 and D2H03 in an independent branch. Inferred from the tree in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, haplotypes carrying either 1532T or 1534L were clustered in one of the two major clades, respectively, while those with a 1534S mutation were divided into two different major clades. Although belonging to the same major clade, the two 1534L haplotypes were closely clustered, while 1534S2 and 1534S3 were located in different sub-clades.
