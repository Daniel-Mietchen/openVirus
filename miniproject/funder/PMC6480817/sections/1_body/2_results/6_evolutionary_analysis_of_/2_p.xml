<p id="Par33">To track the evolutionary origin of the 
 <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes, sequence alignments of the closely clustered haplotypes were conducted. The results, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, indicate that the resistant haplotypes D2H07 (1016G) might be derived from the wild one (D2H05) through one mutational step. Similarly, one nucleotide alternation in D3H02 could create three mutants (1534L1, 1534L2 and 1534S3), while one nucleotide replacement in D3H04 could lead to the formation of 1534S1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The double-mutation (1532T + 1534S) haplotype of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> voucher YP37 voltage-gated sodium channel gene (MH384958.1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] differed from either D3H01 (1532T) or D3H13 (1534S2) by only one nucleotide (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), suggesting that these 
 <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes share a common wild ancestor (D3H08).
