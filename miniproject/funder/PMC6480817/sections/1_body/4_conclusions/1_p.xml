<p id="Par43">This study delineates the distribution of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations in the dengue vector 
 <italic>Ae. albopictu</italic>s across Beijing, China. Amino acid substitutions at multiple sites (1000, 1016, 1532, 1534) and two variations at codon 1534 have been documented. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments have demonstrated multiple origins of 1534S. The presence of 1016G and 1534S/L alleles indicates a strong risk of pyrethroid resistance in Beijing 
 <italic>Ae. albopictu</italic>s. These findings highlight the importance to monitor and quantify the level of pyrethroid resistance in field mosquitoes in the urban districts. Taking action to limit the spread of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> alleles into the rural areas would be helpful to prevent the development of insecticide resistance.
