<p id="Par36">I1532T mutation has been previously reported in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and different areas of China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In this study, I1532T mutation was observed in 161 individuals from 15 of 17 populations with a frequency ranging from 0.038 to 0.537. These findings demonstrate that 1532T has a widespread geographical distribution in Chinese 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. Thus far, the association of phenotype with I1532T substitution remains unknown. Given the prevalence of this allele in China, it is important to pursue further studies on the biological and pharmacological effects of I1532T.
