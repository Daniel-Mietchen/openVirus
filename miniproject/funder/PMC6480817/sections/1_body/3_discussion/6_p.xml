<p id="Par39">Given that a significant association of V1016G and F1534S/C mutations in

 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The relatively high frequency of 1016G in the urban districts (especially in HD), and the prevalent co-occurrence of 1016G and 1534S in TZ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), strongly indicates a risk of pyrethroid resistance in these areas. In addition, it is worth noting that 1016G homozygotes were present in CP, DX, FT and SJS, strongly suggesting a pyrethroid resistance risk. Unfortunately, since no parallel susceptibility bioassays were performed on the samples used for genotyping, we could not establish a clear association of IR levels with specific 
 <italic>kdr</italic> alleles. However, a loss of susceptibility to beta cypermethrin was observed in HD, OFP and TZ (personal communications).
