<p id="Par40">The results from phylogenetic analysis and alignments of DNA sequences of wild and mutant haplotypes may help trace the origin of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations. Considering that only one 1016G and one 1532T haplotype was discovered, we are unable to determine if 1016G or 1532T is singly or multiply originated. To determine the number of origins of 1016G or 1532T alleles, examination of a sufficient number of samples from a broad geographical range is required. However, the sequence alignments (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) suggest that haplotypes D2H07 (1016G) and D3H01 (1532T) may have evolved from wild haplotypes D2H05 and D3H08, respectively.
