<p id="Par37">Different from 1016G and 1532T, mutations at codon 1534 are multiple. Two of the three previously documented amino acid substitutions at the 1534 locus (1534L and 1534S) were detected in Beijing. Notably, only one of 426 individuals was found to carry 1534L, suggesting that this mutation has just emerged in or was recently introduced into Beijing. Interestingly, the nucleotide alterations leading to F1534L varied among populations: a transversion at the third position occurred in our specimen (TT
 <underline>C</underline> to TT
 <underline>G</underline>), and another different transversion at the same position (i.e. TT
 <underline>C</underline> to TT
 <underline>A</underline>) was observed in mosquitoes from the JN population in a study covering five field populations from China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while the F1534L mutation identified in a survey in the USA resulted from a nucleotide transition at the first position (
 <underline>T</underline>TC to 
 <underline>C</underline>TC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The 1534C detected in Singapore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], Greece [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and even south China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], was not found in our samples. In contrast, 1534S mutation is widely distributed in China: it has been found in samples from southern, eastern, central and northern China in addition to this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].
