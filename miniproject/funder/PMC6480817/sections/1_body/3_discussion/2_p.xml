<p id="Par35">Sequence alignments of D2 revealed a mutation at loci 1016 (V1016G) in our 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> samples. Although a conserved V1016G 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutation has been documented in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], to our knowledge, this is the first identification of the V1016G mutation in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> Notably, 1016G was detected in 13 of the 17 populations with the highest frequency of 0.65 (65%), and 1016G/G homozygotes were found in five populations. These results indicate that 1016G resistant allele frequently occurs at least in Beijing. A literature review showed that most previous studies focused on genetic mutations in domain III [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the occurrence of 1016G in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is probably underestimated. Given that V1016G substitution in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> can lead to insensitivity to both Type I and Type II pyrethroids, a global survey of the distribution of the V1016G mutation in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is strongly suggested.
