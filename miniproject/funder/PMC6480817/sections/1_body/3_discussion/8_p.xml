<p id="Par41">Regarding codon 1534, multiple mutations have been documented. Moreover, it is already known that nucleotide mutations may happen at all the three positions of codon 1534 (i.e. T to C at the first position, T to G or C at the second position, and C to G or A at the third position), which leads to three different amino acid substitutions (F1534C/L/S). These observations indicate that codon 1534 is sensitive to mutation. The cross-continent distribution of conserved F1534C/L/S mutation may reflect the importance of this amino acid residue in adaptating to pyrethroid selection pressure. The large difference in DNA sequence between 1534S1 and 1534S2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) makes us conclude that 1534S has multiple independent origins. By contrast, the extremely high similarity among 1534L1, 1534L2 and 1534S3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) strongly suggests that these 
 <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes share a common origin. Similarly, we hypothesize that the three 
 <italic>kdr</italic> haplotypes 1534S2 and 1532T (D3H01), and 1532T and 1534S (MH384958) may evolve from a common susceptible progenitor.
