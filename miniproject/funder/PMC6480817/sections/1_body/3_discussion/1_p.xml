<p id="Par34">This study represents a comprehensive investigation of 
 <italic>kdr-</italic>related mutations in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes across Beijing. Besides the known mutations (I1532T, F1534S/L), we identified a novel V1016G substitution in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The information about the frequency and distribution of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations could help us to understand the genetic mechanism of insecticide resistance in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The defined 
 <italic>VGSC</italic> haplotypes are useful for tracing the evolutionary origin of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations.
