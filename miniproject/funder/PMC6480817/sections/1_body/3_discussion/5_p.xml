<p id="Par38">This study reveals obvious spatial heterogeneity of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations within Beijing 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. The number of mutations and frequency shows considerable geographical variations (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Such an irregular pattern reflects that factors affecting the evolution and distribution of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are complex. Overall, 1016G and 1532T alleles were commonly present in Beijing, with 1534S occurring mainly in TZ (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Compared to the rural districts, higher frequencies of 1016G were detected in the urban districts (DC, XC, CY, HD, FT, SJS), which is in-line with more intensive insecticide use and higher residential density.
