<p id="Par13">By contrast, fewer molecular and functional studies have been conducted on 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus.</italic> The first 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutation (F1534C) was discovered in a Singapore population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and two different mutations at codon 1534 (F1534S/L) were later described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, a mutation at codon 1532 (I1532T) was detected in Italy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. So far, although amino acid replacements at residues 1532 and 1534 of VGSC have been documented in Chinese 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, mutations at other IR-related loci have not been well examined.
