<p id="Par12">Pyrethroids are the frequently used insecticides for the control of adult mosquitoes because of its low mammalian toxicity and high and rapid activity in insects. This class of insecticide has been widely used as indoor/outdoor residual or space sprays for mosquito control in China since the 1980s [

 <italic>kdr</italic>) is the common and main cause of resistance to pyrethroids in insects. Previous studies on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> have documented several point mutations (V410L, S989P, I1011M/V, V1016G/I, I1532T, F1534S/L/C, D1763Y;

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], most of which locate in the S6 segment of domain II (IIS6) and IIIS6. These mutations are usually confined to specific geographical areas, and vary in frequency and effect on resistance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Co-occurrence of certain mutations is commonly associated with higher levels of resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. For example, the combination of S989P, V1016G and F1534C alters the sensitivity to permethrin and deltamethrin by 1100-fold and 90-fold, respectively [
