<p id="Par14">Beijing is the capital of China with a large human population. To reduce the risk of vector-borne diseases, mosquito control programs have been implemented for 65 years (since the patriotic health campaign was initiated in 1952 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]). In particular, pest (including mosquito, fly, rat and cockroach) control campaigns have been conducted in order to build “healthy district” in all 16 districts of Beijing Municipality in the last 10 years. It is very likely that insecticide-resistant alleles have been selected in the field due to the regular and continual application of pyrethroids. However, no comprehensive study on IR status and IR associated genetic mutation has been reported on field 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations in Beijing. In this study, we sequenced partial DNA sequences of the 
 <italic>VGSC</italic> gene from field-caught 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> samples, and evaluated the frequencies of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> alleles within seventeen 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations. In addition, we attempted to examine the origin of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutations by haplotype clarification and phylogenetic analysis.
