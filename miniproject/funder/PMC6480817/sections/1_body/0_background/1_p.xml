 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is a major vector of four important arboviruses, chikungunya virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus and Zika virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is native to Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific islands and islands of the Indian Ocean, it has gradually spread in recent decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The current worldwide distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> greatly increases the risk of vector-borne disease outbreaks and poses a global threat to public health [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In China, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is the primary vector of dengue fever [
