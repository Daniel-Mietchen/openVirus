<p id="Par11">There are two major mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. One is metabolic resistance, mainly mediated by P450 monooxygenases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], glutathione transferases (GST) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and esterases (Est) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The other is called target resistance, which is caused by point mutations in target proteins of insecticides, such as voltage gated sodium channels (VGSC), acetylcholinesterases and gamma aminobutyric acid receptors [
