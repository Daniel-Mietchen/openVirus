<p id="Par16">Primers V2F (5′-GAC AAT GTG GAT CGC TTC CC-3′) and V2R (5′-GCA ATC TGG CTT GTT AAC TTG-3′) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used to amplify the partial sequence of domain II covering codons encoding amino acid residues 989, 1011 and 1016. The reaction was done in a final volume of 30 μl, comprising 0.3 μl of Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Dalian, China), 3 μl of 10× buffer, 2.4 μl of dNTP, 0.6 μl of 10 μM V2F, 0.6 μl of 10 μM V2R, 200 ng of DNA template, and ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O to make up to 30 μl. The reaction procedure was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 40 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were gel-purified and directly sequenced from both directions using the forward (V2F) and reverse (V2R) primers, respectively.
