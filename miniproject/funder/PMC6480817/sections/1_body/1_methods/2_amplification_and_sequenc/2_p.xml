<p id="Par17">Primers V3F (5′-GAG AAC TCG CCG ATG AAC TT-3′) and V3R (5′-TAG CTT TCA GCG GCT TCT TC-3′) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used to amplify the fragment of domain III containing codons 1532 and 1534. The reaction system comprised 0.3 μl of Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio), 3 μl of 10× buffer, 2.4 μl of dNTP, 1.2 μl of 10 μM V3F, 1.2 μl of 10 μM V3R, 200 ng of DNA template, and ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O, in a total volume of 30 μl. The reaction procedure was as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 38 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 40 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were sequenced using the reverse primer (V3R).
