<p id="Par19">The haplotypes of 
 <italic>VGSC</italic> alleles were identified by directly reading from homozygotes, or by splitting one from the other from heterozygotes carrying one-site variations, or by clone sequencing of heterozygotes with multiple-site variations. For clone sequencing, purified PCR products were ligated with the pEasy-T1 vector and transformed into competent cells of the 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Trans 5Î± strain (Transgen, Beijing, China). Then, three to ten clones were sequenced. The sequences obtained from clone sequencing and from direct PCR product sequencing were cross-checked to clarify the two haplotypes in each heterozygote.
