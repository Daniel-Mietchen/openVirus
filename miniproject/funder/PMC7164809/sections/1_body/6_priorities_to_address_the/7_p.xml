<p id="para3400">There are several factors in India and other developing countries that increase the risk of percutaneous needle stick injury and transmission of HBV and HCV. These include: severe disease requiring intravenous drugs; a preference to use injections over oral or other administration methods; use of hazardous equipment and procedures (eg, no disposable syringes, safe needle devices, and sharps disposal containers; inability or failure to use sharps containers immediately after injection; no personal protective equipment; inadequate staffing; reusing needles); and insufficient vaccination coverage against hepatitis B, availability of post-exposure prophylaxis against HBV, and adherence to standard precautions.
