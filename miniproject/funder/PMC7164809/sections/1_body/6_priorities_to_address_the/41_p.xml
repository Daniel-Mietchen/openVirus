<p id="para3740">In summary, the major barriers to the care of patients with liver diseases in Asia-Pacific countries with middle and high HDIs include lack of baseline epidemiological data on various liver disorders, low coverage of birth-dose HBV vaccination, lack of awareness in the general population and health-care workers about liver diseases, lack of trained health professionals, and low public health expenditure. By contrast, the major barriers to care in high-HDI countries in Asia-Pacific include geographical and social inequalities to access to care, delivering HBV vaccination to new high-risk groups, delivering care to people infected with HBV and HCV who inject drugs, and increasing awareness in the general population to adopt healthy life styles. Research priorities need to be country-specific and should focus on specific barriers.</p>
