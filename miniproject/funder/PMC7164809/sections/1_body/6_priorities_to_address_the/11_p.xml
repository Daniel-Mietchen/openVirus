<p id="para3440">Research priorities on liver diseases in India need to focus on the quality of data collection regarding the incidence and prevalence of common causes of liver disorders and their risk factors. Data need to be generated on morbidity and mortality related to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with various aetiologies. With the launch of the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program in 2018, research should also focus on the development of low-cost point-of-contact testing kits for viral hepatitis. The effectiveness of potential interventions to prevent and treat NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease needs to be investigated. Finally, implementation research to improve the coverage and effectiveness of potential interventions and to improve awareness of these diseases in the general population is also needed.</p>
