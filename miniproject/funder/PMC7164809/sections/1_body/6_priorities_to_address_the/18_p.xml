Studies are needed to develop cheap, accessible, point-of-care testing for HBV and HCV, and on preventive measures and new drug treatments for NAFLD. Research to improve coverage of HBV vaccination for high-risk groups, particularly preventing HBV transmission from mother to baby, is needed. Strategies should be developed to improve general awareness about liver disease among the public and medical staff and training of existing health-care workers on managing liver diseases.
