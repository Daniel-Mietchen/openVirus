<p id="para3730">Priority research areas in Taiwan include strategies to increase awareness and education on the need for screening and regular monitoring and treatment of HBV, both in the general population and physicians, and to continuously evaluate the quality and effect of HBV vaccination. Research is also needed into the natural history and evolving epidemiology of HBV in Taiwan, to ensure that vaccination programmes are not missing any new risk groups that might arise over time. For example, although waning immunity of the vaccine after 15â€“20 years has not yet been observed to the extent that a booster is generally recommended after this time period, the possibility that this situation might change should be monitored closely.
