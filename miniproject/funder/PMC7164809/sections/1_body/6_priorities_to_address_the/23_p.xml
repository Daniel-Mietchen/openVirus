<p id="para3560">According to KNHANES 2009â€“13,
 <xref rid="bib410" ref-type="bibr">410</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib411" ref-type="bibr">411</xref> the number of people participating in intense physical activity is decreasing in South Korea, whereas caloric intake and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome is increasing. According to the 2013 KASL survey (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 40% of respondents did not exercise even for 1 h per week, despite recognising that regular exercise is helpful for NAFLD management. Another issue is that national insurance does not support education programmes for optimal food intake and exercise, although lifestyle modification is the basis of NAFLD management. In many cases, doctors give patients who visit hospital general lifestyle modification recommendations, rather than specific guidelines. Priority areas for action for NAFLD in South Korea include research into noninvasive markers of NASH and fibrosis in NAFLD and on new therapies, ways to motivate people of all ages to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the pathological mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD.
