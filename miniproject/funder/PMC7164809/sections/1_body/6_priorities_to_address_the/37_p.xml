<p id="para3700">Priority research areas for NAFLD include finding a simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test capable of finding cases in a large at-risk population and investigating the most effective ways to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Research is also needed into the most effective ways of delivering health-care education and information about excessive alcohol consumption, the warning signs and risks of alcohol-related liver disease to different demographics (including young people), and the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of alcohol-related liver disease in heavy drinkers. Outcome measures of liver mortality, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer need to be accurately collected with annual reports of their frequency to determine whether any measures taken against liver disease are improving outcomes.</p>
