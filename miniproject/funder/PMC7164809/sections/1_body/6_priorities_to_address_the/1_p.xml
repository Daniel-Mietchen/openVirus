<p id="para3340">Health financing in China is not equitable. In 2011, the average total health expenditure per capita for urban areas was three times higher than it was for rural areas (¥2698 
 <italic>vs</italic> ¥879) but the share of out-of-pocket expenditure was 50% for urban residents and 36% for rural residents.

 </xref> Major disparities between the rural and urban health-care systems persist, mainly because of insufficient government stewardship and unequally distributed social determinants of health. The Chinese Government is moving the health-care system towards universal coverage for both rural and urban residents. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme is the major medical insurance scheme in rural China. It aims to protect households from falling into poverty because of high treatment costs (ie, catastrophic health expenditure), and its principal objective is to provide universal coverage and improve equity of access to health care.

With the vast expansion of coverage between 2004 and 2007, reimbursement is falling as medical expenditure is increasing. In 2007, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount divided by total expenditure on medical care) was around 19% for illnesses that required expenditures between ¥200 and ¥2000, but only 8% if expenditure was more than ¥10 000.

 </xref> The distribution of health workers is also uneven between rural and urban areas of China, with two-thirds of the health-care workforce situated in urban areas. Additionally, the educational or skill level of rural health workers is inferior to those in urban areas.
