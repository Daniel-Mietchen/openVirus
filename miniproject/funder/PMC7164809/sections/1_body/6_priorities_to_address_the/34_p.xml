<p id="para3670">In Singapore, identifying cases of hepatitis B and C is the biggest barrier to appropriate management of patients and control HBV and HCV infection. For hepatitis B, family screening is recommended under Singapore's hepatitis B guidelines. Once people are identified as having viral hepatitis, referring them to receive medical care might be difficult. Barriers to follow-up include insufficient reminders to patients, lack of physician time, cost of tests and treatment, and blood taking. In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who were offered health screening in 2003, 67% were not found to be followed up regularly.
