<p id="para3460">The Indonesian Government has increasingly committed to fighting liver diseases, particularly viral hepatitis, but has not made this commitment into a formal priority. There is a paucity of reliable epidemiological and other data related to various liver diseases; such data are crucial to guide evidence-based policy development. The country needs to invest in research on liver diseases such as monitoring the epidemiological patterns of communicable and non-communicable liver diseases, including their prevalence, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history. Studies are needed on the impact of interventions, including assessment of preventive measures, guidelines, drug efficacy, and treatment. New tools for prevention, diagnosis, care, and treatment (eg, a new pilot project of catch-up vaccination for hepatitis B in vulnerable and high-risk groups and hepatitis B treatment for pregnant women) are needed.</p>
