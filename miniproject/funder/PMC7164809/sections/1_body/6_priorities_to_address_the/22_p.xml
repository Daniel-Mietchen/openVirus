<p id="para3550">According to a survey done by KASL in 2013 (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 79% of respondents who visited tertiary hospitals due to alcohol-related liver disease had not had the chance to join an abstinence programme or receive consultation from a psychologist. Only 3% of patients with alcohol-related liver disease had received specialised rehabilitation, which assists patients with returning to a normal social life. Hospital visits and treatments are mainly dependent on the will of the patient. Priority areas for addressing the burden of alcohol-related liver diseases in South Korea include research into helping people to adopt healthy lifestyles (ie, avoiding alcohol consumption, early detection of alcohol overuse and alcohol-related liver disease), effective strategies in helping people with alcohol-related liver disease to stop their alcohol consumption, and new therapeutic targets for alcohol-related liver diseases including severe hepatitis.</p>
