<p id="para3370">Considering the current status of liver diseases in China, future research should focus on, but not be restricted to: improving the quality and completeness of incidence and prevalence reporting of acute and chronic hepatitis B and C; synthesising accurate disease burden information on the morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma attributable to HBV and HCV; and generating a definitive action plan with milestone targets and secured financing. It is also necessary to streamline clinical trials, to speed up approval for HBV and HCV drugs, and to substantially reduce their price and include them in reimbursement policies through independent cost-effectiveness analyses and negotiating with multiple stakeholders. Large-scale test-and-treat strategies for patients with hepatitis B and C must be optimised, and an optimal service delivery model and standard package for their diagnosis and treatment needs to be established and validated. Finally, accurate data generation on the prevalence of NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease and their related morbidity and mortality, and research on effectiveness of various interventions to prevent these diseases are also needed.</p>
