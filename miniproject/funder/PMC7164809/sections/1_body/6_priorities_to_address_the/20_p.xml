<p id="para3530">In South Korea, HBV represents a major medical burden. According to a survey of 3000 people done by the Korea Association Study of Liver Disease (KASL), approximately half of the respondents (45Â·4%), aged between 15 and 69 years, had not had a HBsAg test or did not know whether they had had the test. Additionally, although antiviral therapy has been well supported by the national insurance reimbursement policy, there is still a gap between the HBV management guidelines proposed by KASL and government policy. Although screening tests for HBV infection are done for women who are preparing for pregnancy, army recruits, adults aged 40 years and older, and groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, a continuous management programme after HBV diagnosis requires further consideration, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of screening adults older than 40 years must be re-evaluated.</p>
