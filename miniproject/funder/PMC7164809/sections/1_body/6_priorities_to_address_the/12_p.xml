<p id="para3450">In Indonesia, challenges persist in the programmes for control of viral hepatitis, including insufficient knowledge and awareness about viral hepatitis, inadequacy of available data, a large population spread over a vast archipelago, problems in diagnosis and treatment due to insufficient training of staff, few viral hepatitis specialists, and insufficiant health-care infrastructure and investment. Moreover, the need for viral quantification before, during, and after treatment, as well as the pretreatment determination of viral genotype as recommended by all existing guidelines, also pose problems that could threaten the success of Indonesia's National Health Insurance scheme. The scheme covers drugs for HBV and HCV, but does not cover the diagnostic tests needed to determine whether these drugs are needed. This discrepancy, along with the insufficient number of testing facilities, nullifies the potential benefit of accessible treatment for much of the population.
