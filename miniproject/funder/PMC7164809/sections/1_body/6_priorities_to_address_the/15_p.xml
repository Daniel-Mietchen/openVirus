<p id="para3480">It is important to establish an integrated hepatitis surveillance and response system in Pakistan, with multiple sites across the country that provide laboratory testing for diagnosis and treatment. A publicly funded programme for HBV and HCV treatment is already established. Sofosbuvir and its generic versions are registered by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan; it is cheap but is entirely covered by patients' out-of-pocket expenses. Generic versions of daclatasvir are in their registration phase. Harm reduction strategies need to be implemented to provide treatment to users of injectable drugs, particularly in prisons. The Ministry of Health should consider early approval of hepatitis C medications already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, monitoring the bioequivalence of generic drugs, and assessing the economic burden of hepatitis care, which is currently not being done. There is an urgent need for accurate epidemiological data assessing viral and other liver diseases. Developing strategies and studying their effect on prevention and treatment outcomes is another priority area of research. Research into ways to improve birth-dose HBV vaccination coverage is urgently required. Various modalities for training of the existing workforce in care of patients with liver diseases (on-site training, online training, teleconferencing, etc) also need to be investigated.</p>
