<p id="para3650">The focus of HBV and HCV research in Australia and New Zealand should be on preventing transmission in people who inject drugs, including: evaluating novel methods to improve population estimates of injected drug use and hepatitis infections; evaluating implementation, effectiveness, and scale-up of existing prevention interventions for this population; identifying barriers and facilitators associated with HBV and HCV testing at the levels of the patient, provider, and health-care system; evaluating novel, point-of-care assays for HBV and HCV testing and treatment uptake that are highly sensitive and specific, simple, quick, and cheap; and evaluating the scale-up of strategies for improving the linkage to care for patients newly diagnosed with HBV and HCV.</p>
