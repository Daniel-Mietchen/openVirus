Despite the high burden of hepatitis, less priority is given to it than to HIV, and there are no properly trained medical staff in small towns and villages. Therefore, improving compliance with HBV vaccination at birth is of great importance. An HAV vaccine is available but is not covered by any vaccination programmes, and there are no national guidelines on HAV vaccination. Donated blood is screened for hepatitis B and C but existing regulations for safe blood transfusion services are ineffective. Paid blood donation should be declared illegal. Community-based interventions to educate health-care providers and the public on the risks of HBV and HCV transmission associated with contaminated blood, unsafe injections, and reusing razors are needed. There are no widely available auto-disable or single-use syringes and strict implementation of strategies to avoid reusing needles or syringes. To prevent transmission, it is also important for the Government to provide safe drinking water and sanitation, and to educate the public on hygienic practices such as drinking boiled water. Opioid substitution programmes should be implemented, as should safe blood transfusion services that are easy to use and can be monitored according to international standards. Electronic media could be used to raise public awareness of viral hepatitis and to encourage patients to get screened and treated.
