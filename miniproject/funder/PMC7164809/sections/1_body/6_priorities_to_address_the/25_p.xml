<p id="para3580">Although support for research into liver diseases has increased substantially, it is still insufficient. Research priorities for liver diseases in South Korea include identifying barriers and facilitators, and developing strategies to increase awareness and education in the general population and physicians, for HBV and HCV testing and uptake of treatment, particularly in high-risk groups. A simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test for NASH and strategies to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles are needed. Promoting awareness and education about alcohol misuse and evaluating successes and errors of abstinence and rehabilitation programmes for patients with alcohol-related liver disease is also necessary. An accurate risk model that incorporates newly identified risk factors and biomarkers must be developed for primary care providers. Additionally, research into the development of a simple and organised surveillance system for groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma would facilitate making health care for these patients efficient and cost-effective.</p>
