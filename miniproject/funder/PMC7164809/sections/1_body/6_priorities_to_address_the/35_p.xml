<p id="para3680">Regarding the management of non-viral hepatitis liver disease in Singapore, a strategy to target high-risk groups, particularly those with diabetes and those who are obese, would be the first step. Lifestyle interventions can be challenging to implement but much can be done by the Government to maximise disease control by introducing health-promoting public policies, infrastrucutre changes to facilitate healthy choices for living, working, studying, and recreation, and collaborative publicâ€“private partnerships. Alcohol-related liver disease represents an area that has not been addressed extensively, and expertise of medical staff around alcohol management, addiction behaviour, and support facilities needs improvement. Such improvement strategies might include developing multidisciplinary teams of psychiatrists, counsellors, psychologists, nurses, and social workers to provide individual, group, and family therapy; increasing addiction awareness in the community; and training for health-care and social service professionals and promoting addiction on research.</p>
