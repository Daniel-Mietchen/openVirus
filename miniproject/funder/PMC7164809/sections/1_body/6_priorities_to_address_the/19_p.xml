<p id="para3520">In Japan, as the prevalence of viral hepatitis decreases, cases of NASH and NAFLD are increasing. It is currently impossible to estimate how long this increase will continue and what preventive measures would be effective. Efforts to tackle NAFLD centre on the Government's extensive focus on obesity prevention and hepatocellular carcinoma through screening programmes and advances in treatment. Japan has a budget of $400 billion per year for overall health-care expenditure, accounting for 38Â·8% of the national governmental budget. Research must focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and liver fibrosis, and on effective ways of delivering health-care education and information on prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Effective models of community-based care for patients with liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, need to be investigated. Also, developing novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma are major unmet needs. Research is needed into strategies to tackle increasing health costs and improve health equity.</p>
