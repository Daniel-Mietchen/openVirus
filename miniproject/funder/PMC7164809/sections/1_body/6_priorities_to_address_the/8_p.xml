<p id="para3410">Although HAV vaccination is not included in the national immunisation schedule, it is available privately in high-income settings, as it is difficult to convincingly argue for its country-wide use. India has traditionally been an area of high HAV endemicity; however, studies have found evidence of an epidemiological shift to intermediate endemicity for people with high incomes in various cities.

 <xref rid="bib400" ref-type="bibr">400</xref> In such cities, high-income areas are susceptible to HAV, but people living there are not likely to become infected, whereas most of the remaining population continue to get infected and transmit the virus. The hepatitis A vaccination strategy in susceptible high-income population groups would need to be reassessed. Introducing a hepatitis A vaccine in resource-poor populations is problematic because the resulting reduction in HAV transmission can have unintended consequences. Although it might reduce the risk of HAV infection, it also has the potential to increase the average age at which HAV infection occurs,

 </xref> thereby increasing the overall risk of acute disease. Thus, introducing vaccination with low coverage in a high-endemicity area would change the epidemiology to an intermediate-endemicity pattern, which is undesirable. By contrast, high-coverage vaccination in an intermediate-endemicity area would result in the desirable outcome of low endemicity.
