<p id="para3380">In India, improving sanitation and providing safe drinking water is important to prevent HAV and HEV. The rural Indian population (about 70% of the total population) has mostly low literacy, lacks basic sanitary facilities, and is thus at high risk of faecalâ€“oral transmission of hepatitis. Hygiene is also poor in urban areas, with poor disposal of solid and liquid waste (including excreta) and poor drainage systems. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (or Clean India Mission) is a nationwide campaign launched in 2014 for clean streets, roads, and other infrastructure. The campaign's objectives include eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountability mechanism to monitor toilet use (ie, through a dedicated workforce using mobile phones and tablets). According to the Government of India, which runs the mission, 99% of rural villages were free from open defecation as of Oct 2, 2019.
