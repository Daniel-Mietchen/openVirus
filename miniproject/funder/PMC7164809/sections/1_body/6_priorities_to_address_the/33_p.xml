<p id="para3660">New and effective therapies for patients with NAFLD and liver fibrosis need to be developed. An unmet clinical need is the identification of novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and liver cancer. Australia will also need to invest in research on liver diseases that are particularly common, including prevalence and risk factors, natural history, and effective methods for control and treatment. Further, there is a great need and potential for implementation research to improve the coverage and effectiveness of various interventions for liver diseases. Research needs to especially focus on Indigenous populations regarding prevention, treatment, models for engagement, and service delivery for various liver disorders.</p>
