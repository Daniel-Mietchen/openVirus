<p id="para3500">Although the cost of antiviral drugs has been reduced considerably in Bangladesh, the costs of diagnostic medical examinations are still extremely high. Additionally, patients are not sufficiently encouraged to get screened for hepatitis and to receive therapy. Awareness of hepatitis is increasing in urban areas, but rural areas are lagging in this respect. A study has shown that HBV DNA is prevalent in HBsAg-negative blood.

It might not be practical to test blood samples with nucleic-acid amplification as a preventive measure; however, testing for anti-HBc could be accommodated in Bangladesh to prevent HBV transmission through blood transfusion.
