<p id="para1620">Despite substantial progress in reducing HBV infection by a universal immunisation programme for infants, new cases in Indonesia still occur in early childhood, and the prevalence of HBsAg in children younger than 5 years can be as high as 4·2%.
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>35</sup>
 </xref> This high prevalence could be due to uneven coverage of birth-dose vaccination, which is low (&lt;50%) in areas that are difficult to access in the eastern part of Indonesia, and to the high HBsAg prevalence in pregnant women, which facilitates vertical or mother-to-child transmission.

 </xref> In parallel, HBV transmission also occurs horizontally, as shown by the increasing trend of the prevalence of anti-HBc antibodies by age.

 </xref> A 2016 study in 12 provinces observed a HBsAg prevalence of 2·76% in pregnant women. With 5 000 000 pregnancies per year in Indonesia, approximately 150 000 pregnant mothers could potentially transmit HBV to their babies annually, of whom 95% will develop chronic hepatitis B and be infectious for their entire lives. This transmission incidence is of serious concern, considering that coverage of HBV birth-dose vaccination is low, screening tests for HBV in pregnant women are not routinely done, and antiviral treatment for women infected with HBV has not been adopted as a preventive strategy for mother-to-child transmission.
