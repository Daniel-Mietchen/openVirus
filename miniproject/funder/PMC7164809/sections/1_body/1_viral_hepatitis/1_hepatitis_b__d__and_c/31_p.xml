<p id="para1840">A community study in 2010 reported that age-standardised HBsAg seroprevalence in Singapore was 3·6% (95% CI 2·9–4·3) in adults aged 18–69 years.

 </xref> Among the three main ethnic groups in Singapore, age-standardised HBsAg seroprevalence in Chinese people (4·2%, 3·4–5·0) was significantly higher than in Malay people (2·2%, 0·7–3·6) and Indian people (0·6%, 0·0–1·4). Regular surveys for chronic HBV show a steady decreasing trend in its seroprevalence. More than 90% of children aged up to 12 years have been immunised against hepatitis B. In 2001, a school immunisation programme against hepatitis B was initiated to screen and immunise all children who were not covered under the national programme. Both programmes have been very successful, as there have been no reports of acute childhood hepatitis B infections since 1997.
