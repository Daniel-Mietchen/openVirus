<p id="para1740">Hepatitis B is most commonly spread from mother to child in South Korea. During the 1980s, about 11% of neonates in South Korea were infected with HBV via vertical transmission. Particularly, many (ie, 65–93%) unvaccinated infants born to mothers positive for HBeAg and HBsAg became infected.

 </xref> Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented a prevention programme for HBV vertical transmission in July, 2002, which provides complete financial support for HBV vaccination and tests for neonates with mothers positive for HBsAg, irrespective of HBeAg status. Through these endeavours, 180 690 (96·0%) of 188 224 neonates born to carrier mothers participated in the prevention programme between 2002 and 2014. Overall, 98 293 (54·2%) of 180 690 neonates completed the 3-dose vaccination regimen. Of those who completed the regimen, 84 201 (85·7%) acquired immunity (ie, were negative for HBsAg and positive for anti-HB). Completion has increased from 92·9% in 2008 to 99·4% in 2013, and the prevalence of HBV infection in children decreased from 2·6% in 1994 to 0·2% in 2006.
