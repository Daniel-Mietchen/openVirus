<p id="para1560">The predominant routes of HCV infection in mainland China include transfusion of contaminated blood products, invasive medical procedures, and use of injectable drugs. Since the implementation of mandatory HCV screening for blood products, infection via transfusion has decreased significantly (eg, in Beijing, the proportion of new infections caused by blood transfusion was 84路2% before 1992 and 14路3% after 2004).

 </xref> With the adoption of mandatory nucleic acid testing for HBV and HCV in donated blood since 2013, transfusion-related HCV infections will decrease further. Infection via non-transfusion medical procedures procedures was infrequent in Beijing in the period before implementation of mandatory HCV screening for blood products (accounting for 7路0% of HCV infections before 1992), but this proportion has increased over time (accounting for 33路3% of HCV infections after 2004).

 </xref> Similar data showing continuously decreasing HCV transmission via blood transfusion and a concomitant increase in HCV transmission via intravenous drug use, unsafe sexual behaviour, and invasive procedures outside health-care settings (eg, piercings, tattoos, acupuncture, barbershop shaving, etc) have been reported in Beijing, as well as in other parts of mainland China.
