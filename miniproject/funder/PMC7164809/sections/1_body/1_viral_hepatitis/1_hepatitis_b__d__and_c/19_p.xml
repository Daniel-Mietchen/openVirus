<p id="para1720">In the absence of a nationwide seroprevalence study of HBV, high variability in the prevalence of HBsAg in Bangladesh has been shown. Several studies from the 2000s show variation from 0路7% to 5路5% in the general population.

 </xref> Most people who do not inject drugs but are infected with HCV have a history of any injection (treatment by non-qualified village doctors), sharing blades in barber shop, or of circumcision by traditional practitioners.
