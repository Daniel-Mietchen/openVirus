 </xref> found that the population-level burden of new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma per year has stabilised in people with HBV infection (52 in 2001 and 44 in 2013) but increased markedly in those with HCV infection (49 in 2001 and 151 in 2013). The age-standardised incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma per 1000 person-years decreased 2·3% (95% CI 1·4–3·1) in 2001 to 0·9 (0·6–1·2) in 2012 in patients with HBV and remained stable between 2001 (1·4, 0·8–1·9) and 2012 (1·5, 1·2–1·7) in those with HCV.

 </xref> Thus, individual-level risk of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma had decreased, suggesting that antiviral therapy introduced in the mid-2000s has been effective. By contrast, HCV treatment based on interferons had no effect on individual-level, HCV-related risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and has contributed to the increasing population burden of this cancer type.
