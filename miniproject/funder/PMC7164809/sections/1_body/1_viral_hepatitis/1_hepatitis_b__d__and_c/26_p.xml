<p id="para1790">Australia has required notification of all cases of viral hepatitis B and C since the early 1990s. This mandatory notification system has helped to monitor the epidemiology of viral hepatitis and, more importantly, has enabled a coordinated public health response. 218 000 (1%) of the Australian population (plausible range 192 000–284 000) are estimated to be living with chronic hepatitis B infection.

 </xref> Overall notification of newly acquired hepatitis B (ie, infection acquired within the preceding 24 months) has decreased from 1·2 per 100 000 individuals in 2009 to 0·7 per 100 000 in 2013.

 </xref> Notification of newly acquired HBV infection has been consistently low across this period in children younger than 15 years and has declined substantially in people aged 15–29 years. Adolescent catch-up immunisation programmes could have contributed to this decrease in young adults. However, there was an increase in complications related to chronic HBV such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma from 450 cases in 2008 to 1550 in 2017.

 </xref> The seroprevalence of HBsAg in Indigenous Australian adults was estimated to be 17% in a meta-analysis of studies done before 2000.

 </xref> Since then, HBsAg seroprevalence in Indigenous Australians is estimated to have declined to 3·7% of the 548 366 total population in 2011. This seroprevalence is still more than 10 times that in non-Indigenous Australians born in Australia (0·3% of 13 836 559, excluding people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men).
