<p id="para1890">In summary, hepatitis B and C still contribute to considerable morbidity and mortality due to liver diseases in almost all countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and some countries such as Taiwan and Singapore have addressed the problem better than others. The routes of transmission of HBV are predominantly perinatal, horizontal transmission during childhood, unsafe injection practices, and transfusion of blood products in countries with medium and high HDIs.
