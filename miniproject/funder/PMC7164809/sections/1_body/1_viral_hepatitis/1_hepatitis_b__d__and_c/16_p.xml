<p id="para1690">In Japan, mother-to-child transmission is the major route of establishing chronicity of HBV, but it is less common than in other Asian countries. From June, 1985, all pregnant women were screened for the presence of serum HBsAg, and from January, 1986, the Government started financing programmes for prevention of vertical transmission of HBV infection.

 </xref> A retrospective, nationwide, multicentre study in 430 patients born between 1976 and 2010 who were younger than 20 years when diagnosed with chronic HBV infection showed that the number of cases according to birth year increased within this timeframe. After the introduction of perinatal immunoprophylaxis of HBV vaccination plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin (IgG) in 1986, the proportion of chronic HBV infections caused by mother-to-child transmission decreased from 73% between 1981 and 1985 to 47% between 1986 and 1990. However, mother-to-child transmission then persistently increased from 62% between 1991 and 1995, to 64% between 1996 and 2000, 74% between 2001 and 2005, and finally to 86% (67 of 78 cases of HBV) between 2006 and 2010.
