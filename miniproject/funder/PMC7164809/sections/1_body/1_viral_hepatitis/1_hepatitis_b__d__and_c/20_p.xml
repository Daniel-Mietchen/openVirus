According to the GHE 2015 dataset, hepatitis B accounted for 56·3% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 60·5% of those due to liver cancer (

 </xref> The overall prevalence of HBV continues to decline; nonetheless, around 2 million people still carry the virus. In South Korea, HBV-HDV co-infection is very rare.
