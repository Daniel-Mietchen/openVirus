In this study, 56·1% of patients positive for anti-HCV had detectable HCV RNA. Another study of 207 patients with chronic HCV infection

A comparative study of 1173 patients with HCV and 534 healthy control participants in five university hospitals between 2007 and 2011 in South Korea reported several independent risk factors for infection, including use of illicit drugs, needle-stick injury, receiving blood transfusion before 1995, having a tattoo, and age.
