<p id="para1570">As is the case in China, the greatest contributing factor to the burden of liver disease in India is viral hepatitis, particularly HBV. According to estimates from the 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study,
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> hepatitis B infection accounted for 33% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 42% or all deaths due to liver cancer, whereas hepatitis C accounted for 22% and 20% of deaths, respectively. Acute hepatitis B and C infections accounted for 55% and 1·4% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in India in 2015 (

 </xref> Community data on the burden of disease caused by chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B and C are scarce. On the basis of a systematic review of published literature, the proportion of liver diseases attributable to HBV was 67%, 17–19% for HCV, and 71–72% for either virus (some patients had HBV-HCV co-infection).

 </xref> Further, the annual number of deaths from liver cancer attributable to these viruses was estimated to be approximately 17 000 for HBV, 4500 for HCV, and 18 500 for either or both viruses.
