<p id="para1700">To identify the causes of the increase in mother-to-child transmission despite perinatal immunoprophylaxis, the association between the implementation of immunoprophylaxis and chronic HBV infection was evaluated. The prevalence of confirmed lack of immunoprophylaxis decreased continuously from 38% between 1986 and 1990 to 9% between 2006 and 2010. Similarly, the proportion of patients with no medical record of immunoprophylaxis also decreased from 38% between 1986 and 1990 to 3% between 2006 and 2010. The prevalence of incomplete prophylaxis ranged from 30% to 50% across the 1986â€“2010 period. By contrast, the prevalence of complete prophylaxis increased continuously from 0% between 1986 and 1990 to 55% between 2006 and 2010. These findings indicate that the increase in chronic HBV infection due to mother-to-child transmission was probably caused by poor efficacy of the prophylaxis regimens or the antibodies used.</p>
