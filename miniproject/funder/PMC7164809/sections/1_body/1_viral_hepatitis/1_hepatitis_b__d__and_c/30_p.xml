 </xref> In the Singapore Burden of Disease Survey 2010, liver cancer contributed 5886 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), equivalent to 1·5% of total DALYs, and 5783 YLL (3·2% of the total).

 </xref> The aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma is not clearly documented, but in a large patient cohort who had surgical resection, 55·6% of cases were due to chronic HBV infection and 6·2% to chronic HCV infection.

 </xref> Between 1973 and 2012, the incidence of liver cancer declined steadily. The incidence in men decreased from 27·4 cases in 100 000 people in 1973–77 to 17·2 in 100 000 in 2008–12, whereas the incidence in women decreased from 6·9 in 100 000 in 1973–77 to 4·8 in 100 000 in 2008–12. This decrease is possibly due to the introduction of voluntary HBV vaccination in 1985 as an integral part of the national childhood immunisation programme and improved screening.
