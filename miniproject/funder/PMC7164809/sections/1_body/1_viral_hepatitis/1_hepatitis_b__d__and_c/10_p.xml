The study reported that the acquisition of HBV infection (indicated by anti-HBc prevalence) and the evidence of repeated natural boosting (indicated by anti-HBs prevalence together with either or both HBsAg and anti-HBc) increased significantly with the length of service period and the type of work (administrative, non-intervention, and intervention). Needle injury was confirmed to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring HBV among health-care workers.
