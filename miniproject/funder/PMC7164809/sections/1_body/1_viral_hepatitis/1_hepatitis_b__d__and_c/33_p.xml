 </xref> and Taiwan has been largely successful in controlling HBV infection. The programme focused on research and development and public education and hepatitis B immunisation. In 2002, treatment of chronic viral hepatitides was added to its aims. As part of the programme, a mass vaccination campaign was launched in 1984, with neonates being a top priority. The campaign also included infants born to mothers carrying hepatitis B. As of 1986, it was extended to all neonates and subsequently to adolescents and adults.
