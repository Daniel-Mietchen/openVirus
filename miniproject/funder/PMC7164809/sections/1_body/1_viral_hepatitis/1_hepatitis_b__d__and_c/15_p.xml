<p id="para1680">Since records began in 1958, until 1970, there were no drastic changes in mortality due to viral hepatitis-related hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan(

 </xref> This marked increase is most likely explained by an increase of HCV infection in the era after WW2 in the so-called baby-boomer generation.

 </xref> After plateauing in 2002–04, the number of deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma has started to decline and was 28 889 in 2015.

 </xref> The Japanese Government introduced a universal health insurance coverage system in the 1960s, which covered almost 90% of total overall medical costs.

 </xref> Consequently, expensive surgeries requiring blood transfusion (eg, total gastrectomy for peptic ulcer) were widely done.

 </xref> Contaminated syringes were frequently used in medical settings for intravenous infusion of vitamins, to supposedly counteract the common cold or to improve spirits.

 </xref> This practice continued until a few years after the discovery of HCV in 1989. Subsequently, introduction of nucleic-acid amplification testing for HCV, HBV, and HIV in blood products by the Japanese Red Cross in 1999, and screening of pregnant women for HBV infection, lead to a decline in hepatocellular carcinoma cases due to viruses transmitted by transfusion.
