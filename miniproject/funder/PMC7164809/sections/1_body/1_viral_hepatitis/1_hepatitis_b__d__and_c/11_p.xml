 </xref> A survey in 2012 showed that 2·5% of the population infected with HCV were active injecting drug users. Of an estimated 70 000 (95% CI 61 901–88 320) people who inject drugs, 77·3% (95% CI 40–80) had HCV infection. Assuming spontaneous clearance in 20% of cases, the number of viraemic people who inject drugs was estimated to be 22 400–43 680.
