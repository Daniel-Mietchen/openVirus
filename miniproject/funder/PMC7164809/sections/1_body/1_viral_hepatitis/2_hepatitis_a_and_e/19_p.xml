Hepatitis A accounted for 25·9% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015 in Australia, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E (

Occasional outbreaks due to consumption of contaminated shellfish have been reported. Hepatitis A vaccination is therefore recommended for high-risk groups.
