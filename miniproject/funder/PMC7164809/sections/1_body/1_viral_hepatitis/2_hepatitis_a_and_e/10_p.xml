<p id="para1990">There are few reports about hepatitis E in Indonesia. Only three outbreaks of HEV infection that occurred in 1987, 1991, and 1998 have been documented in restricted areas (west Kalimantan [Borneo] and east Java) and were presumably caused by faecal contamination.

 </xref> In addition to outbreaks, HEV infection accounts for a considerable proportion of sporadic hepatitis infections with varying prevalence of anti-HEV in apparently healthy individuals in some areas.

 </xref> The risk of infection has been found to increase in association with occupational contact with swine and swine excrement.
