<p id="para1970">The prevalence of HAV infection varies among islands in Indonesia. It is endemic in some areas with sporadic cases every year, but it also occurs as spontaneous outbreaks in other parts of the country. In the 1990s, nearly all children aged 10–14 years in Jayapura (Papua New Guinea), Mataram (Lombok), and Sumbawa Besar (Sumbawa) were infected with HAV, but only about 45–60% children in the same age group in Jakarta (Java), Bandung (Java), and Makassar (Sulawesi) had had this infection.

 </xref> In 2006, the prevalence of anti-HAV was 60% in young adults aged 18–20 years in Jayapura and Biak (Biak). However, the prevalence was still high (up to 90%) in isolated areas of Biak island, with predominantly indigenous populations.

 </xref> The decrease of anti-HAV prevalence was also observed in Lombok, where anti-HAV prevalence in students aged 12–14 years decreased from 64·8% to 13·6% over 30 years, from 1986 to 2016.
