In Singapore, the GHE 2015 dataset documented that hepatitis A accounted for 50·1% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E (

However, the overall number of cases has been declining and no deaths from acute hepatitis A and E have been reported between 2012 and 2016. For the entire 1997–2016 period, 1899 cases of hepatitis A and 961 cases of hepatitis E were reported.
