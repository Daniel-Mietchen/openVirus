<p id="para1940">HEV infection is hyperendemic in India and its neighbouring countries. The transmission is primarily through faecal contamination of water supplies. Outbreaks of acute hepatitis E are common; the largest recorded outbreak in the country, in 1990, had about 79 000 cases.

 </xref> Additionally, HEV infection accounts for 30–50% of cases of sporadic acute hepatitis. Only genotype 1 HEV has been isolated from human cases in India; genotype 4 has been isolated from pigs, but not from humans, suggesting that zoonotic transmission is rare. Chronic hepatitis E infection is infrequent. Transfusion-related and mother-to-child transmission appear to account for only a few cases. HEV mainly affects young adults, in whom spontaneous recovery is high. A few individuals (0·1–1·0%) develop acute liver failure with 30–70% mortality. HEV infection during pregnancy is particularly severe, and case-fatality rates in pregnant women can be as high as 25%.
