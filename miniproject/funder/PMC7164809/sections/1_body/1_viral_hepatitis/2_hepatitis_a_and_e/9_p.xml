<p id="para1980">Hepatitis A outbreaks, which occurred in several areas in Java (1998â€“2007) and in Sumatra and Borneo (2014), have been reported more frequently in areas with low prevalence of anti-HAV. Health education, as well as hygiene and sanitation promotion programmes, have been implemented in areas with hepatitis A endemicity. However, HAV vaccination is still not widespread and is not included in the national immunisation schedule, so it is only available to people in wealthy urban areas.</p>
