 </xref> Presently, zoonotic transmission with sporadic infections is the major mode of transmission, succeeding transmission through contaminated water or food, which was previously the main route of transmission. Large community-based epidemiology surveillance found that HEV genotype 4 was the dominant type, indicative of zoonotic transmission.
