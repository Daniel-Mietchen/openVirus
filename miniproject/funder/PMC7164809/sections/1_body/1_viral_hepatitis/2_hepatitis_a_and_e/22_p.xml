<p id="para2110">In summary, viral hepatitis A and E are a major cause of acute hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality in countries with medium and high HDIs in the Asia-Pacific region, the population of which has low access to clean drinking water and appropriate sanitation facilities. In these areas, acute HEV infection causes high mortality, especially in pregnant women and in patients with underlying chronic liver diseases. Acute HAV is increasingly leading to severe hepatitis in adults as the quality of sanitation is improving in certain localised areas of these regions, reducing earlier exposure and immunity to infection. In countries with very high HDIs, acute HAV, although rare, is seen predominantly in travellers to endemic areas, men who have sex with men, and people who inject drugs. Conversely, acute HEV infection is predominantly zoonotic and is acquired by eating infected meat or handling pigs.</p>
