<p id="para2060">Similar to Japan, HAV and HEV are rare causes of acute hepatitis-related mortality in South Korea: according to the GHE 2015 dataset, acute hepatitis A accounted for 0·8% of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in 2015, whereas there were no deaths due to acute hepatitis E (

 </xref> Improvements in sanitation and living standards have contributed to a change in the epidemiology of acute viral hepatitis in South Korea. The decrease in HAV infection in young children has resulted in a reduction in the seroprevalence of anti-HAV IgG, with a corresponding increase observed in the adult population.

 </xref> As a result, since 2000, hepatitis A has overtaken hepatitis B as the leading cause of acute viral hepatitis in adults in South Korea.

 </xref> In 2009, the incidence of hepatitis A was at its highest since 2000, and 15 231 cases were reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but in 2010 the number decreased to 7655.

 </xref> HAV infection was designated a national notifiable disease in 2001, and a surveillance system based on sentinel hospitals was established. The incidence has continuously decreased since 2011, the year when the surveillance system was expanded to every hospital. 7585 cases of HAV infection were reported through this National Infectious Diseases Surveillance system between 2011 and 2013, steadily declining in each of those years.
