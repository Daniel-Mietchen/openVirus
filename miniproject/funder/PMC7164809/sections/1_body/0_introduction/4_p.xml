<p id="para1520">The remaining major contributor to liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is acute viral hepatitis, which accounted for 108 276 (8·2%) of the total liver-related deaths in the region in 2015, compared with 929 (1·2%) of 72 437 in the USA and 4032 (0·3%) of 197 179 in Europe. Deaths in the Asia-Pacific region represented three-quarters of the global total number of deaths due to acute viral hepatitis. In 2015, the region accounted for three-quarters of the global total number of deaths related to acute HBV, almost two-thirds of those due to acute hepatitis A infection, and almost 80% of those due to acute hepatitis E infection. Of all deaths due to acute viral hepatitis in the region for that year, most were caused by acute hepatitis B infection (59·6%) and acute hepatitis E infection (32·1%), whereas only 6·3% were due to acute hepatitis A. By comparison, in 2015, of all deaths related to acute viral hepatitis, hepatitis B infection caused 81·7% in the USA and 70·0% in Europe, hepatitis E caused no deaths in the USA and 8·3% in Europe, and hepatitis A caused 13·4% in the USA and 18·0% in Europe (
