<p id="para1510">The second largest cause of liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is liver cancer, which accounted for 573 361 (43·6%) of all 2015 liver-related deaths in the region, compared with 24 565 (33·9%) of those in the USA and 78 072 (39·4%) of those in Europe. These deaths represent almost three-quarters of the estimated global number of deaths due to liver cancer for that year; the region accounted for more than 80% of the global total of HBV-related liver cancer deaths, just under half of those due to HCV, more than 70% of those that were alcohol-related, and more than three-quarters of those due to other causes including NAFLD. In 2015, HBV infection caused 49·1% of all deaths due to liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region (
