In this Commission, we document the burden of liver diseases in the region and formulate recommendations to tackle it. It was not feasible to cover every country in the Asia-Pacific region in this Commission. Thus, to maximise our scope by including territories at various stages of development, we divided countries according to their Human Development Index (HDI), selecting the top five most populous countries in the medium-to-high HDI category (China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and the top five in the very high HDI category (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand;

 </xref> Given its achievements in controlling HBV, we also included Taiwan when discussing HBV-related liver disease. Commissioners were invited from each of the selected countries and were provided with an outline for data collation and literature review. After this information was synthesised, a draft manuscript was circulated to all collaborators for suggestions, comments, and consensus-building. A final manuscript was then circulated for approval.
