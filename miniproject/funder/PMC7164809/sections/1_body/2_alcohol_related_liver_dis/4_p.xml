<p id="para2150">In India, alcohol consumption is also a common cause of liver disease-related mortality. Alcohol consumption accounted for 22·2% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 19·9% of all deaths due to liver cancer in India, as reported by the GHE 2015 dataset (

 </xref> According to 2016 WHO estimates, age-standardised deaths from cirrhosis in adult Indian men and women were 45·8 per 100 000 individuals per year and 14·7 per 100 000 individuals per year, respectively, with 60·0% (in men) and 33·3% (in women) of these attributed to alcohol consumption.

 </xref> This prevalence might be underestimated because of poor reporting, low social acceptance of drinking, and no insurance cover for alcohol-related diseases. Of all deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis worldwide in 2015, 19·8% were estimated to occur in India; this is a high proportion, given that the Indian population comprises 17·8% of the global population, has a smaller proportion (72·3%) of people aged at least 15 years than the global average, and has a very high proportion of lifetime alcohol abstainers (53·5% of individuals aged ≥15 years in 2016) compared with other countries.
