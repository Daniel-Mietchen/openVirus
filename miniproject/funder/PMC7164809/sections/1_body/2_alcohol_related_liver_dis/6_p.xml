<p id="para2170">By contrast with India, alcohol consumption is an uncommon cause of mortality from liver disease in Indonesia, although data about alcohol-related liver disease are scarce. According to 2016 WHO estimates, age-standardised deaths from cirrhosis in adult Indonesian men and women (aged ≥15 years) were 51·1 per 100 000 per year and 27·1 per 100 000 individuals per year, with 16·5% (in men) and 15·2% (in women) of these being attributable to alcohol.

 </xref> In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in people aged at least 15 years in Indonesia was 0·8 L of pure alcohol (1·4 L in men and 0·2 L in women) and total alcohol per capita in this age group, only for people who drink, was 3·4 L of pure alcohol (4·2 L in men and 1·5 L in women). Overall 57·2% of people aged 15 years and older (42·6% of men and 71·8% of women) in Indonesia are lifetime abstainers. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (≥15 years) was 28·6% (35·9% in men and 10·8% in women).

 </xref> Alcohol in Indonesia is expensive and difficult to obtain, so people in some areas drink five times more unrecorded (ie, unaccounted for in official statistics, taxation, or sales because it is produced, distributed, and sold outside channels under government control) than legally purchased alcohol.
