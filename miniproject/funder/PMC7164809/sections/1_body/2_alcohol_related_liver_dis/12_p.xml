In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in Australian adults aged at least 15 years was 10·6 L of pure alcohol (16·6 L in men and 4·7 L in women) and total alcohol consumption per capita for drinkers in this group was 13·4 L of pure alcohol (18·8 L in men and 6·6 L in women). Overall, 8·5% of Australian adults aged at least 15 years (4·1% of men and 12·9% of women) are lifetime abstainers from alcohol. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (≥15 years) was 45·3% (60·7% in men and 26·4% in women).
