In Japan, the consumption of alcohol per year per adult decreased by about 80% during the past 20 years. In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in Japanese adults aged at least 15 years was 8·0 L of pure alcohol (13·5 L in men and 2·9 L in women) and total alcohol consumption per capita in this age group for drinkers only was 14·1 L (19·0 L in men and 6·6 L in women). Overall, 9·1% of Japanese people aged at least 15 years (4·3% of men and 13·7% of women) are lifetime abstainers. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (≥15 years) was 40·0% (53·0% in men and 20·3% in women).
