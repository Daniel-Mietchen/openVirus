<p id="para2200">Because of religious beliefs and social taboos, alcohol use is uncommon in Bangladesh, although home-made alcohol is consumed by different tribes. The annual per capita consumption of pure alcohol in adults aged at least 15 years is very low in Bangladesh (0·2 L in 2010 and 0·0 L in 2016) compared with 4·5 L in the WHO-defined southeast Asia region in 2016.
