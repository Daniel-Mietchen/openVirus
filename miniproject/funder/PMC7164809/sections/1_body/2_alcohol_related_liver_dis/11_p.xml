The Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) is a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional health examination and survey done regularly by the Division of Chronic Disease Surveillance of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Ministry of Health and Welfare. KNHANES 2012 reported a significant proportion of individuals with high-risk alcohol consumption: 21·8% of men had more than seven glasses of alcohol more than twice a week, and 6·0% of women had five glasses.
