<p id="para2180">Similar to Indonesia, alcohol is an uncommon cause of liver disease-related mortality in Pakistan. According to the GHE 2015 dataset, alcohol consumption accounted for 5·6% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases and for 8·3% of all deaths due to liver cancer (

 </xref> According to WHO's 2016 estimates, age-standardised mortality from cirrhosis in adult Pakistani men was 28·7 cases per 100 000 people for that year, with 12·8% of these being attributable to alcohol. For women, these proportions were 30·1 cases per 100 000 people and 3·2%. In 2016, the projected estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita (people aged ≥15 years) in Pakistan was 0·3 L of pure alcohol (0·5 L in men and 0·1 L in women) and total alcohol per capita considering drinkers only was 26 L of pure alcohol (30·5 L in men and 11·3 L in women). Overall, 96·5% of Pakistani people aged at least 15 years (94·7% of men and 98·4% of women) are lifetime abstainers. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (≥15 years) was 5·3% (6·5% in men
