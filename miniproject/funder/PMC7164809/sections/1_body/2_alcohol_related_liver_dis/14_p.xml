In 2016, WHO's estimates of total alcohol consumption per capita in adults aged at least 15 years for New Zealand was 10·7 L of pure alcohol (17·2 L in men and 4·6 L in women) and total alcohol consumption per capita in drinkers from this age group was 14·3 L of pure alcohol (20·2 L in men and 7·1 L in women). Overall 10·6% of adults aged at least 15 years (5·1% of men and 15·8% of women) in New Zealand are life-time abstainers. The prevalence of heavy episodic drinking in 2016 for drinkers only (≥15 years) was 42·9% (58·0% in men and 24·4% in women).
