<p id="para2460">As with New Zealand, NAFLD is gaining prominence as a cause of liver mortality in Singapore. NAFLD and other causes accounted for 8·3% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases in the GHE 2015 dataset, and for 5·7% of all deaths due to liver cancer (

 </xref> There are no formal studies of prevalence of fatty liver disease in Singapore but at a 2012 public health forum, 40% of 227 attendees were diagnosed with a fatty liver.

 </xref> a large prospective cohort study, 63 257 patients were followed up since 1993–98 for an average of 14 years; of them, 499 developed hepatocellular carcinoma. People with diabetes in this study had a hazard ratio of 2·14 (95% CI 1·69–2·71) of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This effect was independent of markers for viral hepatitis. In the study, a history of diabetes was present in 8·9% of the population at baseline.

 </xref> Data from the Singapore Ministry of Health showed that 11·3% of Singaporeans had diabetes in 2010, representing an increase from 8·2% in 2004.

 </xref> Since diabetes is a major risk factor for fatty liver disease and NASH other than obesity, this increase provides some insight into the potential increase in burden of NAFLD. The Ministry of Health also found that there was an increasing trend of obesity from 6·9% in 2004 to 10·8% in 2010 and 8·6% in 2013.

 </xref> The general lifestyle of Singaporeans involves low physical activity and high-calorie diets, both of which increase the risk of obesity and diabetes, and thus the risk of NAFLD.
