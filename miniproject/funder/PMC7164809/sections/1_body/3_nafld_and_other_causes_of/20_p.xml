<p id="para2470">In summary, data on NALFD epidemiology in the Asia-Pacific region indicate a rapid increase in the disease's burden over the past three decades, which is supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis that assessed the prevalence, incidence, and outcomes of NAFLD in Asia.

 </xref> Obesity and NAFLD are being increasingly recognised and are an emerging epidemic in the region, irrespective of country or regional income. South Asia and the Indian subcontinent are currently undergoing rapid economic and social change. The whole Asia-Pacific region is shifting towards increased consumption of energy-dense food and reduced physical activity, leading to increasing prevalence of NAFLD risk factors, such as diabetes and obesity.
