<p id="para2430">As with South Korea, NAFLD is becoming an important cause of liver disease-related mortality in Australia. GHE 2015 data suggest that NAFLD and other causes accounted for 6·9% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 7·3% of all deaths due to liver cancer (

 </xref> NAFLD is by far the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease in Australia, estimated to affect 5·5 million people, including 40% of all adults aged 50 years and older, and representing about 90% of the liver disease burden.

 </xref> In 2014–15, 63·4% of Australians aged 18 years and older were overweight or obese (11·2 million people), comprising 35·5% who were overweight (6·3 million people) and 27·9% who were obese (4·9 million people).

 </xref> Furthermore, NAFLD currently affects 15% of school children, which will probably affect its future burden.

 </xref> Globally and in Australia, given the population prevalence of NAFLD, it is becoming an increasing risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, even in people without liver cirrhosis.
