<p id="para2280">Systematically collected data regarding the contribution of other liver diseases—including autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and IgG4-related liver disease—to liver disease-related morbidity and mortality in the Asia-Pacific region are insufficient; these conditions are categorised in the GHE 2015 dataset together with NAFLD as “other causes”.

 </xref> Autoimmune liver diseases are rare across Asia-Pacific. By contrast, drug-induced liver injury is relatively common in some areas—eg, China (where acute drug-induced liver injury accounts for approximately 20% of hospital admissions due to acute liver injury)

 </xref> and India (where anti-tuberculosis drugs, complementary medicines, and herbal drugs and supplements are common causes). Although often under-recognised and under-reported, drug-induced liver injury seems to be increasing in some areas of the Asia-Pacific region. The following section, however, focuses on NAFLD, given the relatively small contribution made by other causes of liver disease to the overall burden.
