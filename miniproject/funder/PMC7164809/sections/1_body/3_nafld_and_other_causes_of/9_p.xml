<p id="para2360">NAFLD is also becoming an important cause of liver disease-related mortality in Pakistan. NAFLD and other causes accounted for 21·6% of all deaths due to cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, and for 11·8% of all deaths due to liver cancer, according to GHE 2015 data (

 </xref> Increasing incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome could lead to high burden of NASH that causes cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Data on NAFLD from Pakistan are scarce. The prevalence of NAFLD has been reported as 9–27% in rural areas and as 21–42% in urban areas, reflecting the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on lifestyle and disease status.

 </xref> Presence of metabolic syndrome or its individual components were found to be major contributing factors associated with increased prevalence of NAFLD in communities, with most cases being found in women.

 </xref> the prevalence of NAFLD and the multiplicative effect of combinations of predictive factors associated with NAFLD were studied in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes; NAFLD was found in 71·9% of cases. Additionally, an increasing trend in the odds ratio of having NAFLD was observed as the number or risk factors increased. A combination of physical inactivity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, large waist circumference, high BMI, high HbA
 <sub>1c</sub>, high triglycerides, low HDL, high LDL, and high alanine aminotransferase predicted the highest odds of 10·8 for NAFLD (95% CI 4·9–24; p=0·001).
