<p id="para2380">The prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diabetes in Bangladesh has increased in the past three decades, thus increasing the NAFLD-related liver disease burden. Data from the 2011 Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey reported an overall prevalence of 18·9% (95% CI 17·9–19·9) of overweight and 4·6% (4·0–5·2) of obesity; people living in urban areas were more likely to be overweight or obese than those living in rural areas (odds ratio [OR] 1·27, 95% CI 1·05–1·55; p=0·02).
