<p id="para3300">There are four liver transplantation centres in Singapore: two private and two public. From 2007 to 2016, 261 liver transplantations were done,

 <xref rid="bib376" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>376</sup>
 </xref> It applied only to people aged 21â€“60 years who had died from unnatural causes, met the criteria of brain or cardiac death, were not Muslim, and had not formally dissented from organ donation. Implementation began in 1988 and applied only to kidney donation. A 2004 amendment to the Act also permitted living organ donation and included other organs, such as livers, hearts, and corneas. The 2004 amendment further included all causes of death rather than solely death by accidental causes. Further legislative amendments in 2007 and 2009 were made with the firm intent of expanding the supply of transplantable organs and ensuring that organ donors are not exploited, unlawfully induced, or forced into organ retrieval by non-government actors.

 </xref> which operates on an opt-in basis, allowing people to pledge their organs or body parts for transplantation, education, or research after death. Additionally, the Ministry of Health subsidises at least 50% of the cost of liver transplantations. Together with the MediShield programme for immunosuppression, patients receiving liver transplants are well supported financially.
