 </xref> There are many informal health-care providers in Pakistan, comprised of unqualified allopathic providers (eg, rural doctors or drug shop retailers), traditional healers, faith healers, Unani healers, and semi-qualified allopathic providers (eg, medical assistants, technicians, and community health workers). Although they are not a part of the mainstream health system, they are major health-care providers to poor rural populations, especially in remote and inaccessible areas. There are few medical professionals trained in managing liver diseases.
