 </xref> However, the number of health-care personnel (ie, doctors, nurses, technicians) trained to manage liver diseases is grossly insufficient. Several institutions in the country run 3-year training programmes in gastroenterology and hepatology (for internists or paediatricians), with a combined intake of around 200 students per year. Several academic centres in the country are also engaged in clinical and laboratory research in areas related to liver disease, and the country has a dedicated Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (New Delhi).
