 </xref> Since June, 2016, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease system has been used to match deceased liver donors to compatible patients, instead of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. 1-year graft survival in 1998 was 62% for patients with liver transplants from deceased donors and 80% for those with living donors. Survival outcomes had improved substantially by 2009, showing 1-year graft survival of 76% for patients with transplants from deceased donors and 90% for those with transplants from living donors, primarily because of developments in quality control and immunosuppression. In South Korea, liver transplantation from living donors is thought to be effective and feasible for patients needing a transplant. Transplantation from living donors has substantially increased over the past three decades because livers from deceased donors are scarce. Better understanding of the regeneration of partial grafts and various advances in surgical techniques have contributed to a marked improvement in patient and donor outcomes in cases of living-donor transplantation.
