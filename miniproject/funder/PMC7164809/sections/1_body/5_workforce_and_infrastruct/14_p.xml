<p id="para3190">Bangladesh has a long history of hepatology and related services and training programmes. Hepatology departments function in more than 15 public medical colleges and more are being developed. The country however, does not have a liver transplantation programme. Nevertheless, the hospital attendance of patients with liver disease has increased rapidly during the past couple of decades, and the sole medical university of Bangladesh experiences a tremendous burden of patients with hepatitis, at both its outpatient and inpatient departments.
