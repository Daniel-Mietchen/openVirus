<p id="para3140">Pakistan's health-care facilities, such as basic health units (ie, facilities that cover 10 000 individuals) and rural health centres (ie, covering 30 000–45 000 individuals), are poorly maintained, equipped, and staffed, especially in rural areas. The health-care delivery system, therefore, relies hugely on private organisations that have advanced facilities but are unaffordable to most people. Public health-care institutions that provide advanced care are often only located in major towns and cities and private tertiary care hospitals are extremely expensive. Poor people in rural areas tend to consult local private doctors, with 70% of the population served by the private sector.

 </xref> The private sector operates through a fee-for-service system of hospitals, general practitioners, and homeopathic and traditional healers. Very few mechanisms exist to regulate the quality, standards, protocols, ethics, or prices in the private health sector. Additionally, opportunities for health-related research are few, and not many advanced technologies, such as molecular diagnostics and advanced endoscopic techniques, have been introduced in public-sector institutions in Pakistan. Training of health-care providers in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases, improvement in relevant infrastructure, and health-care affordability are crucial challenges.
