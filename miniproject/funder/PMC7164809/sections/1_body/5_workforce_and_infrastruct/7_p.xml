<p id="para3120">In December, 2015, Indonesia had 9767 heath centres to deliver primary health care and 2488 hospitals (1593 public and 895 private hospitals). Specialised gastroenterology and hepatology services are available in tertiary care hospitals.

 </xref> In 2015, there were 876 984 health professionals in Indonesia, comprising 647 170 doctors and nurses (73·8%) and 229 814 (26·2%) health support workers. The few liver specialists (approximately 165) available to care for the more than 20 million patients with HBV or HCV represent a serious problem. Infrastructure capacity building, mentoring of health professionals, and technical training assistance to accelerate the decentralisation of service delivery from specialised medical centres to local hospitals and laboratories at or near the point of care has been proposed.

 </xref> In parallel, over 500 units of rapid molecular diagnostics with a point-of-care platform have been distributed to district laboratories to facilitate low-cost HCV detection and quantification and to scale up and converge testing in multiplex platforms with other diseases (eg, tuberculosis and HIV).
