 </xref> Since 2011, the China Organ Transplant Response System has begun to allocate donor livers, which is based only on urgency and compatibility. Until December, 2011, 20 877 liver transplantations done between 1980 and 2011 in 81 certified transplantation centres had been reported to China's Liver Transplant Registry. Of the donated livers, 19 338 (92·6%) were procured from deceased donors, and 1539 (7·4%) were procured from voluntary living donors.
