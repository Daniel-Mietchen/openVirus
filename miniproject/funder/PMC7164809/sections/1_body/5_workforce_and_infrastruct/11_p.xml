<p id="para3160">Pakistan's first liver transplantation was done in 2003 at the Sind Institute of Urology and Transplantation (Karachi). However, no other transplantations were done until 2011 when a single liver transplantation from a deceased donor was done in Lahore. From 2012 onward, several medical centres in Pakistan have attempted to develop programmes for transplantation from living donors.

 </xref> The most important impeding factor in developing high-volume transplantation programmes across Pakistan is the lack of skilled workforce. Shifa International Hospital (Islamabad) and the Shaikh Zayed Center of Liver Transplantation (Lahore) are the only two transplantation centres run by local teams, whereas others rely exclusively on international collaborators. Security concerns and visa delays make frequent travel by international teams difficult, and the reliance on international experts interrupts continuity of care. Thus, the presence of efficient local transplant teams is crucial to develop successful and sustainable transplantation programmes. Until February, 2017, only 539 liver transplantations had been done in Pakistan, and approximately 95% of these were done in the two locally run centres. A liver transplant from a living donor in Pakistan costs $35 000–45 000. Most patients are self-funded, and financial restrictions are one of the biggest hurdles to accessibility. The Human Organ and Transplantation Authority regulates legal and ethical aspects of liver transplantation in Pakistan, but its decentralisation with the 18th amendment of Pakistan's Constitution has moved various ministries, including the Ministry of Health, from central to provincial control.

 </xref> Those changes have given rise to five autonomous provincial bodies that regulate transplant activity, allowing for a stringent legal and regulatory process at the provincial level. Simultaneously, the current decentralised approach challenges the implementation of a future national transplant registry that might monitor transplantation activity and outcomes countrywide. The Government will have to consider innovative ideas including private–public sector partnerships and proper incentivisation of skilled medical personnel to make liver transplantation available in poor settings in Pakistan. The implementation of a national transplant registry is inevitable to ensure transparency in various steps of organ donation and outcome reporting while providing transplant services of international credibility.
