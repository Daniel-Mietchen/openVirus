<p id="para3320">The first successful liver transplantation from a deceased donor in Taiwan was done in 1984 in a patient with Wilson's disease. The first transplantation of a liver graft from a living donor to an adult patient was in 1999. Throughout the following decade, the number of transplantations from living donors in Taiwan increased much more quickly than those from deceased donors. Universal coverage by the Taiwan National Health Insurance enabled the establishment of clear guidelines for donor selection, indications, and transplantation timing. The Insurance's outcomes of organ transplantation to ensure public awareness and transparency were also regularly published.
