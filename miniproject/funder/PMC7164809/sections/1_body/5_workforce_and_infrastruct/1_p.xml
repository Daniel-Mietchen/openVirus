 </xref> Training programmes on liver diseases, as well as teleconsultation between primary care physicians and specialists, might improve the management of liver diseases. Most tertiary and some secondary hospitals are well equipped with materials and infrastructure needed to diagnose and treat liver diseases, such as biochemical, immunological, and nucleic acid assays; ultrasonography; CT and MRI scanning; and diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy. However, these facilities and expertise might still be far from sufficient in western China.
