 </xref> South Korea has a government-affiliated agency, the National Health Insurance Service, under the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare that covers about 97% of the country's population and supervises all medical services. Additionally, for patients registered in the country's rare intractable diseases registry with autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or post-liver transplantation, additional economic benefits, such as a reduction of their insurance excess is provided. Likewise, patients diagnosed with liver cancer receive additional economic assistance when registered with the Korea Central Cancer Registry.
