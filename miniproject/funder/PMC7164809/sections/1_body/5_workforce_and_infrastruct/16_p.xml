<p id="para3210">The Japan Organ Transplant Network is an intermediary between donor and recipient for deceased donors. Transplantation from deceased donors was done in only 321 cases from 1964 to 2015 because of insufficient donors. Conversely, 8066 people from 1989 to 2015 received liver transplants from live donors. These cases are far fewer than in other Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and India.</p>
