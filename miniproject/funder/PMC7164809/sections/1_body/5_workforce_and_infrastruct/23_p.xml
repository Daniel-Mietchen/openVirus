<p id="para3280">Liver transplantation is the one of the commonest solid organ transplants in Australia and New Zealand. Liver transplantation programmes were initiated in 1985 in Australia and in 1997 in New Zealand. 5000 liver transplants had been done in approximately 4500 patients from inception until January, 2015, with approximately 260 transplants annually. Liver transplant centres are based in major hospitals in five of Australia's states. Median survival in adult recipients is approximately 20 years, and more than 70% of paediatric recipients are alive 20 years after transplantation.
