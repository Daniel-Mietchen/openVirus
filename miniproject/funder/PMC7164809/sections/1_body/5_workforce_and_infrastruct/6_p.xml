<p id="para3110">Facilities for liver transplantation are available in major cities in India, with approximately 2500 transplants per year, mostly from living donors. To meet the need for liver transplant services, liver transplantation from deceased donors needs to be encouraged over living transplantation. The organ donation rate will need to increase from the current 0·5 per million people per year to 5–10 per million per year, and organ-sharing policies need to move from current ones that are based on waiting time or institutional rotation to a severity-based system. The Indian National Organ &amp; Tissue Transplant Organisation is engaged in these activities.</p>
