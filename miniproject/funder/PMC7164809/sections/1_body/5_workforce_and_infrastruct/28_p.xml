<p id="para3330">In summary, inexperienced health-care workers (doctors, nurses, and technicians) and inadequate infrastructure to care for patients with liver diseases (at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) is a problem in the Asia-Pacific, especially in countries with middle and high HDIs. There is very little information on the number of liver specialists in each country, which might represent a lack of focus on liver diseases and a paucity of hepatology specialists. Hepatology programmes urgently need to be established in most countries in the region. Few liver transplantation facilities are available in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Even in countries with good facilities, liver transplants from deceased donors represent only a small proportion of all liver transplants. Although liver transplantation from living donors is broadly successful in Asia, there is a huge demand for new centres and training in the procedure.</p>
