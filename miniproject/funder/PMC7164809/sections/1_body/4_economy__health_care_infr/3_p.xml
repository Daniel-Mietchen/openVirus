<p id="para2500">The public health system of mainland China consists of national and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has functioned well in the prevention of viral hepatitis, with current coverage and timely free universal vaccination of infants against HBV exceeding 90%. China has released national action plans for control of viral hepatitis that set clear targets on prevention. However, a specific, large-scale, test-and-treat financed programme for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C is still to be established. Guidelines for prevention and control of hepatitis B and hepatitis C have been published and are regularly updated, with most recommendations in line with the major international guidelines.
