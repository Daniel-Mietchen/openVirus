 </xref> which outlines national policies on alcohol tax rates, selling and serving of alcohol, alcohol advertisements, legal blood alcohol concentration when driving, and alcohol licensures. Although the Act restricts alcohol use, enforcement of its policies is minimal, so alcohol is still widely used in Bangladesh. Non-Muslim residents and foreign visitors are not affected by such restrictions, as long as they consume alcohol in private.
