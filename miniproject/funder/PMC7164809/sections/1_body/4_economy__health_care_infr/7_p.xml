 </xref> which aims to provide testing and treatment with antivirals to patients infected with hepatitis B and C and their sequelae of chronic liver diseases. With large-scale procurement, the current cost of a 12-week HCV treatment regimen of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is $70 and is expected to decrease (Sarin S K, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India, personal communication). This is one of the most comprehensive hepatitis control programmes globally, on the basis that it incorporates the sequelae of hepatitis infection together with hepatitis infection itself, and intends to reach out to primary health centres in a phased manner. It also features surveillance for acute hepatitis, including hepatitis A and E. Some ongoing related programmes are hepatitis B immunisation for infants, safe blood transfusion, policies on injection safety, safe disposal of biomedical waste, food safety, and, most recently, treatment of hepatitis C.

Alcohol is a subject in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, which defines the exclusive legislative powers of state governments. Therefore, the laws governing alcohol, such as the legal drinking age in India and the laws that regulate its sale and consumption, vary from state to state. In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar Gujarat, and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. There is a partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but have various legal drinking ages. In some states, the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverages.
