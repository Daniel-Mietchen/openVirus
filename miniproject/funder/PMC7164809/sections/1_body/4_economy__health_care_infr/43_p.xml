<p id="para2900">New Zealand's health system is predominantly tax-funded and provides universal coverage. Health expenditure as a proportion of GDP increased from 6·8% in 1990 to 10·1% in 2010 (slightly above the OECD average of 9·5%). The population has a high health status overall but health inequalities are substantial in Pacific peoples and Māori.</p>
