<p id="para2550">Current policies in India largely do not focus directly on overweight, obesity, and NAFLD (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>). However, in the context of ameliorating the burden of non-communicable diseases, certain government initiatives have been undertaken. The GBD statistics

 </xref> and the projected prevalence of death and disability due to non-communicable diseases (obesity being the major risk factor) led the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to reduce the overweight diagnostic threshold for BMI to 23 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup> (from 25), and the standard waist circumference indicative of abdominal obesity to 90 cm in men and 80 cm in women (internationally accepted waist circumference thresholds for abdominal obesity are 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women). These standards have been published in the ministry's Consensus Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome, which were released jointly with the Diabetes Foundation of India, the All-India Institute of Medical Science, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the National Institute of Nutrition, and 20 other health organisations.

 </xref> Considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and the risk factors common among the major non-communicable chronic conditions, the Government of India initiated the integrated National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Stroke.

 </xref> The programme focuses on health promotion and prevention, strengthening infrastructure and human resources, early diagnosis and management, and integration with the primary health-care system through non-communicable-disease cells at different levels for optimal operational synergies.

 </xref> Consumption of junk food has also increased rampantly in India over the past two decades, and the industry primarily targets children. Although the Indian Government has not yet established a policy to ban junk food in schools and their close perimeters, the state governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have instructed schools not to allow the sale of junk food in their canteens. In India, no specific laws or guidelines regulate the advertising or marketing of junk foods, but provisions under laws in other policy areas and some guidelines issued by the self-governing Advertising Standards Council of India could be used to regulate their advertising. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also produced the Guidelinesâ€“Code of Self-Regulation in Food Advertisement to control the objectivity and accuracy of food advertisements.

 </xref> Amendments regarding packaging and labelling of food under part VII of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules of 1955 mandate the disclosure of health claims alongside nutritional labeling.
 <xref rid="bib258" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>258</sup>
 </xref> However, stricter policies are required to prevent misleading information. For example, most packaged junk food in India does not mention trans fat because that is not required by the law. In 2010, the FSSAI expert group formulated guidelines that recommend less than 10% trans fats in food products.
