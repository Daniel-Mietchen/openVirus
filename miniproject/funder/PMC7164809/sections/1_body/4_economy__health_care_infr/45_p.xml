<p id="para2920">General practitioners in New Zealand are the primary health-care professionals responsible for monitoring patients for liver cancer, typically with a liver ultrasound. If cancer is suspected, a patient is referred for specialist care and further management. However, there are no data to indicate the quality of surveillance practices, even in specialist settings. Although a national registry would deal with this issue and improve surveillance, currently there is no political will to implement such a policy.</p>
