 </xref> Despite this estimate, treatment uptake was low (2000–4000 people per year, or 1–2% of the infected population) in the era of interferon-based regimens.

 </xref> However, uptake has substantially increased following the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which, since March 1, 2016, has listed interferon-free, all-oral regimens of direct-acting antiviral drugs with no restrictions on the basis of the stage of liver disease or drug and alcohol intake.

 </xref> By December, 2017, the number of patients starting therapy with direct-acting antiviral drugs had stabilised to about 1280 patients per month.

 </xref> Over the first 2 years of listing, 2016–18, 56 356 patients had been supplied with medication, and as of April 30, 2018, this number of patients was 58 941.

 </xref> The Australian Government has allocated $0·6 billion to fund this scheme over the subsequent 5 years. This treatment increase suggests that Australia could eliminate hepatitis C within the next 10–15 years if the current trend continues.
