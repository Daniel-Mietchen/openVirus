<p id="para2690">Local generics are available for tenofovir, entecavir, adefovir, lamivudine, and pegylated interferon at reduced costs. However, eliminating HBV remains a challenge because of factors such as an increase in HBeAg-negative infections, lack of adequate numbers of hepatologists, insufficient availability of laboratory facilities for viral load estimation, social taboos, lack of public awareness about hepatitis B and its preventability, and misconceptions about the mode of transmission and consequences of HBV infection. Regarding HCV, local generic direct-acting antiviral drugs such as sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and velpatasvir are available at low cost, offering HCV treatment of good quality. However, the challenges in the management of transmission resemble those for HBV.</p>
