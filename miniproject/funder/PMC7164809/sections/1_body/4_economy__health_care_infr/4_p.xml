<p id="para2510">Many aspects of alcohol policy are weaker in China than in its neighbouring countries (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref> ). For example, China has no enforceable legal drinking age and does not regulate when or where alcoholic products are sold. An advertising regulation on alcoholic beverages was issued in 1995, but its enforcement has also been weak. Moreover, taxation in China has not been used to improve public health. Few treatment programmes are available in China for people with alcohol use disorders. Although some psychiatric hospitals in China have special addiction units for the treatment of patients with alcohol-related mental disorders, most of these units, which were established in the 1990s, are in major cities.
