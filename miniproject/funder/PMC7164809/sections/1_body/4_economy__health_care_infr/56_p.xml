<p id="para3030">Although health insurance has been introduced in most countries of Asia-Pacific, overall coverage remains low in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, with consequent high out-of-pocket expenditure. HBV vaccination programmes for infants have been implemented by all countries. The administration of a birth dose of HBV vaccine is still inadequate in many countries, especially in low-income and rural settings. Policies regarding mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV and safe injection practices are available in all countries (although nucleic-acid amplification testing is not mandatory in a few countries). Most countries have put HBV and HCV drugs on essential medicines lists. The costs of antiviral drugs have been brought down considerably by the availability of generic versions.</p>
