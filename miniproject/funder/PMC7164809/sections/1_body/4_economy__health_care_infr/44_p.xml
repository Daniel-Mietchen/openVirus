<p id="para2910">In New Zealand, a hepatitis B vaccination programme started in 1985 and was first intended for infected expecting and lactating mothers. Universal vaccination of infants against hepatitis B was introduced in 1988. Lamivudine treatment was approved and funded for the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B in 2000 and, until 2015, almost 2500 patients had been treated. Adefovir was introduced in early 2003 and, subsequently, entecavir and tenofovir were also introduced.
