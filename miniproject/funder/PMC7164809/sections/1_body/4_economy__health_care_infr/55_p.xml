 </xref> Initially, the programme focused on prevention of hepatitis B through immunisation, public education to avoid transmission, encouraging the use of disposable syringes, and blood safety. Only babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers were vaccinated because of high costs but, as of 1986, all infants weighing 2500 g or more were eligible. In the late 1980s, the programme was extended to preschool children, medical personnel, and elementary-school children, and from 1992 onward, unvaccinated teenagers and adults have been encouraged to be vaccinated on a fee-for-service basis. Around 2000, because of the availability of effective treatments for hepatitis B and C, treatment of chronic viral hepatitis was added to the programme. In 2003, treatment for chronic hepatitis B and C was reimbursed by the national health insurance, which has had a tremendous impact on the outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis. A 2010 analysis showed a steady and substantial decrease of the mortality of patients with end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan.
