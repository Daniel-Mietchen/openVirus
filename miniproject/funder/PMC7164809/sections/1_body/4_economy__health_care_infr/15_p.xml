<p id="para2620">The current policies and national action plan that track liver diseases, such as food, nutrition, alcohol, and HBV policies, have largely not been acted on or adequately popularised. These policies need to be updated with result-oriented strategies that aim to improve accountability and effectiveness by clearly defining expected outcomes, facilitating monitoring and evaluation, and reflecting improvements resulting from performance assessment processes. For example, in 1997, Pakistan introduced a National Health Policy targeting non-communicable diseases, and in 2003, it introduced an integrated national plan for action on four major non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, injuries, and mental health. Both the Policy and plan could not be implemented properly because of a change in government.
