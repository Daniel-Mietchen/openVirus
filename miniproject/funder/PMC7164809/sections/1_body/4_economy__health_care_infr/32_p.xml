 </xref> Although the public sector is the main source of health funding in nearly all OECD countries, the private sector has a much more important role in South Korea and only 56% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2013, well below the average of 73% in OECD countries.

 </xref> Out-of-pocket spending is also an important component of overall health expenditure in South Korea. At 37% of health spending, its share is almost twice the overall OECD average (19·5%).
