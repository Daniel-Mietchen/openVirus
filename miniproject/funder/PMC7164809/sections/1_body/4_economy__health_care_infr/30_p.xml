<p id="para2770">Because of the universal health insurance system and the subsidy programme, the economic barrier to HCV eradication is very low in Japan, with all patients with HCV having access to direct-acting antiviral drugs (sofosbufir, sofosbufir–ledipasvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir–ritonavir, daclatasvir, elbasvir–grazoprevir, and sofosbufir–velpatasvir). In a 5-year retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2013 that estimated HCV in blood donors from their medical records, the incidence of HCV infection was 0·40 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 0·27–0·57) on the basis of viral RNA seroconversion.

 </xref> Additionally, the incidence of HCV infection is very low, and HCV is nearly eradicated. As discussed, deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma plateaued in 2002–04 and have declined since. Access to medical examinations is easy, so patients with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma can be regularly monitored and many cases are treatable because they are detected at an early stage. The production and off-premise sale of all alcoholic beverages based on the Liquor Tax Law requires a Government licence (

However, there is virtually no restriction on off-premise sales in Japan and there are no restrictions on the advertising alcoholic beverages.
