<p id="para2750">The Japanese Government has been providing free hepatitis testing since 2002 for all citizens aged 40–70 years as part of routine health examinations. In 2007, patient management was strengthened by the establishment of a community hepatitis care network that links primary care physicians with specialised regional centres to co-manage patients with liver disease. Treatment for hepatitis was expensive, so the Government introduced a subsidy programme in 2008 to reduce the burden of out-of-pocket expenses.

 </xref> The cost of subsidies is borne by the national and local governments. People living with hepatitis currently pay ¥10 000–20 000 (approximately $100–200) per month on the basis of their income to cover the cost of drugs, medical appointments, and laboratory tests.
