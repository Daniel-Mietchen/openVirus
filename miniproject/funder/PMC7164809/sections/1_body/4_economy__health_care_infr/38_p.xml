<p id="para2850">Health care in Australia is delivered as a mixed system via universal health care (public), which predominates, and private providers (insurance), who make a small contribution. Australia's universal health care is primarily funded by Medicare, a financing system that covers most costs of health services, including those in public hospitals. Medicare is funded partly by a 2% Medicare income levy (with exceptions for people with low incomes), with any shortfall being met by the Government from its general revenue.
