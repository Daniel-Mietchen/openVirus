For example, the Ministry of Health and Welfare provides budget support to local governments' obesity programmes, develops educational materials and publicises them, and provides vouchers for management services of physical activity and diets for obese children. The National School Lunch Act, introduced in 1981, has provisions on school dietitians, nutritional requirements, and dietary consultation. In July, 2018, the South Korean Government set a goal to keep the population's obesity prevalence lower than 35% by implementing measures on nutrition, exercise, obesity treatment, and improved awareness. Surgical procedures to treat obesity are covered by public health insurance. Starting in 2020, medical consultations and dietary training will also be eligible for partial coverage under the national insurance plan. Additionally, the Government will finance outdoor activities for students so that children will have access to activities outside their school gyms such as swimming, skating, bowling, climbing, and baseball. The Government plans to create a monitoring system for television programmes and advertisements that promote overeating; however, because of widespread critique, these plans have not yet been implemented.
