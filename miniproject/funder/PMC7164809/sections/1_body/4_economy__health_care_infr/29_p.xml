<p id="para2760">In 1985, Japan implemented public programmes for mandatory HBsAg tests for pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission. Infants who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers began receiving HBV vaccination plus IgG therapy in 1986. Further, the Japanese Red Cross implemented nucleic acid screening programmes for HBV and HCV in 1999. These national efforts markedly reduced the prevalence of childhood HBV infections. Nevertheless, about 200 new, primarily adult infections of acute HBV are reported annually.

 </xref> The distribution of HBV genotypes also appears to have changed on the basis of an observed increase of chronic infections but without obvious household transmission, which makes controlling infection challenging.

 </xref> The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare implemented routine immunisation of children for HBV in 2016 to prevent horizontal HBV transmission and to eradicate infection incidence, in line with WHO's target of eliminating the public health threat of viral hepatitis by 2030.
