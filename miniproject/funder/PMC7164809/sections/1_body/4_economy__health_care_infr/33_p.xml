<p id="para2800">South Korea achieved universal health coverage in 1989. The national health insurance covers about 97% of the population, and the remaining 3% are covered by the Medical Aid Program, a tax-funded programme for health-care access of citizens with low incomes. By contrast with public health financing, health-care delivery relies heavily on the private sector, although some public health facilities provide medical services at the central, regional, and municipal levels. As of 2012, almost all clinics and about 94% of hospitals were privately owned.
