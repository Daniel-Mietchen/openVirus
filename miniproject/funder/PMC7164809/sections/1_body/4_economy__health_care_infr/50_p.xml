<p id="para2970">Currently there is no national action plan for liver diseases in Singapore. Chronic hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver diseases and is primarily addressed the National Childhood Immunisation Programme implemented in 1987. Infant vaccination is given at birth followed by the second dose at 1 month of age and the third dose 6 months later. Hepatitis B serology is routinely tested as part of antenatal assessments. For surveillance, only acute hepatitis B and C are notifiable diseases to the Ministry of Health. Singapore's hepatitis B guidelines, which include chronic hepatitis B management, were introduced by the Ministry of Health in 2011.

 </xref> The Government also setup a Medication Assistance Fund to help eligible patients to pay for expensive drugs that are not in Singapore's standard drug list but have been assessed to be clinically cost-effective. Patients receive drug subsidies and assistance on the basis of their subsidy and means-test status and the scheme under which the drug is covered (ie, standard drug list 
 <italic>vs</italic> Medication Assistance Fund). For patients with chronic hepatitis B, adefovir and lamivudine are the only drugs listed under the standard drug list. Entecavir and tenofovir are listed under the Medication Assistance Fund. Drug subsidies are provided for patients with HCV, including for pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and sofosbufirâ€“velpatasvir.
