<p id="para2960">Although Government health-care spending as a proportion of GDP is relatively low, Singapore is among the 25 countries with the highest per-capita health-care spending. In 2015, Singapore's Government spent 2·1% of GDP or $6·3 billion on health. Health-care financing is based on Singapore's 3M framework: MediSave (a compulsory national health savings account), MediShield Life (a government-funded universal health insurance plan), and MediFund (an endowment fund set up by the government to help Singaporeans who are unable to pay for their medical expenses).

 </xref> Under MediShield Life, even people with pre-existing conditions will be covered. The national health-care plan covers the entire population and ensures that all Singaporeans have access to medical care. Although public hospitals provide 80% of expensive tertiary care services, private sector practitioners account for 80% of primary health care, with government polyclinics that operate under the Ministry of Health accounting for the other 20%.
