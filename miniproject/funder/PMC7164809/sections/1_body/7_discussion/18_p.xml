<p id="para3920">The agenda of expanding the domestic resource base of low-income countries is also important for generating finances for health-care programmes. Many low-income countries could increase domestic public finance by reducing capital flight, promoting more effective tax policy, and improving their tax collection systems. Such an agenda would have the added benefit of focusing attention on the broad challenges of economic development and improving democratic and accountable governance. High-income countries should adhere to their responsibility to allocate 0Â·7% of their GNI to development aid. Principles and mechanisms need to be established for a systematic transfer of resources from high-income to low-income countries.
