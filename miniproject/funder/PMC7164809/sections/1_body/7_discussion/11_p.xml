<p id="para3850">Obesity and NAFLD, although traditionally thought of as diseases of high-income countries, are increasingly recognised and have become epidemic in all countries of the Asia-Pacific region, irrespective of income status. Overall, 68% of deaths in Asia-Pacific due to NAFLD-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries, and 74% of deaths due to NAFLD-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Changing lifestyles and diet have contributed to the obesity and NAFLD epidemic in the Asia-Pacific. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prevalence, incidence, and outcome of NAFLD disease in Asia found that even in people without obesity, the prevalence of NAFLD was 11·76%.
 <xref rid="bib240" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>240</sup>
 </xref> A 2018 study suggested that so-called lean patients with NAFLD are more likely to develop progressive liver disease and die from causes related to liver disease than those with obesity-associated NAFLD, indicating that NAFLD is not a benign condition.
 <xref rid="bib434" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>434</sup>
 </xref> Therefore, when a patient without obesity has abnormal anthropometric and laboratory measurements, and as the environment in Asia-Pacific continues to change, such awareness might become even more prudent.
 <xref rid="bib240" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>240</sup>
 </xref> The prevalence of NAFLD in the Asia-Pacific is following similar trends to the prevalence reported in high-income countries, indicating that NAFLD is a global disease warranting the attention of primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers (
 <xref rid="box2" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 2</xref> ). The high frequency of metabolic comorbidities in patients with NAFLD indicates that management of the increasing number of these patients might increase the strain on health systems. Furthermore, many patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver disease, which creates challenges for screening.
