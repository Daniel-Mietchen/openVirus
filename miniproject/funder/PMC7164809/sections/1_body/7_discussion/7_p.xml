<p id="para3810">Mortality in the Asia-Pacific region from alcohol-related cirrhosis correlates with per-capita alcohol consumption. Commensurate with an increase in mean incomes, per-capita alcohol consumption has increased in countries of the Asia-Pacific, such as China and India, which will increase their burden of alcohol-related liver disease. Overall, 65% of deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries and 80% of deaths due to alcohol-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (

The largest increases in exposure have been in countries in the low-middle quintile of the SDI.

Alcohol use is ranked as one of the leading risk factors, surpassing cholesterol, for total DALYs globally since 2010 compared with previous iterations of the GBD Study.
