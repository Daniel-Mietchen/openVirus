<p id="para3790">International organisations have a key part in supporting national progress and they need to ensure that viral hepatitis is part of their remit, equal to other major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. Some organisations have led in this regard—notably WHO, Unitaid, and Clinton Health Access Initiative—but more can be done. There are several areas that organisations can prioritise to support viral hepatitis elimination efforts. Some are specific to viral hepatitis, for example the need to support the scale-up of birth-dose vaccination, which should be included in the remit of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for support. Several other areas can leverage existing mechanisms that support other disease responses, notably HIV, to improve access to care and treatment for patients with viral hepatitis.

 </xref> We believe that governments should be increasingly accountable and take timely measures toward national viral hepatitis elimination strategies. Adequate enforcement of policies is also needed. Funding bodies should ask for evidence of the outcomes of their investments to improve accountability. Data on progress of achieving elimination targets should be regularly reported by WHO and other funders but more attention needs to be paid to each country's performance relative to others. Countries need to develop new fiscal spaces to accelerate the elimination of viral hepatitis, which will require innovative means of financing.
