<p id="para3770">Hepatitis B and C are still responsible for a considerable fraction of morbidity and mortality due to liver diseases in almost all countries of the Asia-Pacific, although Taiwan has shown great success with HBV vaccination and reducing the burden of HBV in the past two decades. Overall, 86% of deaths related to acute HBV occur in medium-HDI countries (

 </xref> Preventing transmission of HBV and HCV is entirely achievable. HBV vaccination programmes for infants have been implemented by all countries. The administration of a birth dose of the HBV vaccine is still inadequate in many countries, especially in low-income and rural settings. Implementing policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV and safe injection practices is still a challenge in many countries (eg, India and Pakistan). We strongly recommend a focus on harm reduction strategies that target people who inject drugs in all countries of the Asia-Pacific where these practices are prevalent. There has been progress in improving access to generic medications and reducing costs. The governments of many countries have put HBV and HCV drugs on their lists of essential medicines. There is an urgent need to make generic drugs available in all countries of the region and bring the costs of hepatitis C drugs to less than a dollar a day, following India's example.
