Abstract</div> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Summary</div> <p>The Asia-Pacific region is home to more than half of the global population and accounted for 62·6% of global deaths due to liver diseases in 2015. 54·3% of global deaths due to cirrhosis, 72·7% of global deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma, and more than two-thirds of the global burden of acute viral hepatitis occurred in this region in 2015. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20·8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12·1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15·7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p id="para1490">According to the third round of WHO's 2015 Global Health Estimates (GHE),<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> liver diseases caused 1 312 480 (4·6%) of 28 444 814 deaths in the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, compared with 72 437 (2·7%) of 2 649 742 in the USA and 197 179 (2·1%) of 9 278 557 in Europe. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 62·6% of 2 095 207 deaths due to liver diseases globally for that year. In Asian countries, the median proportion of deaths attributable to liver disease was 3·9% (range 1·86–13·9). By contrast, liver diseases caused 2·05% of all deaths in Australia and 1·33% of those in New Zealand in 2015 (<a href="#fig1">figure 1</a> ), with underlying aetiologies varying between countries (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Liver-related deaths as proportion of overall deaths in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span></a></div>   <p>Causes of liver-related deaths by country in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="para1500">Cirrhosis is the leading cause of liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 630 843 (48·2%) of such deaths in 2015, compared with 46 941 (64·8%) of those in the USA and 115 075 (58·4%) of those in Europe. Deaths due to cirrhosis in the Asia-Pacific region in 2015 represented 54·3% of 1 161 914 cirrhosis-related deaths globally; the region accounted for almost 70% of global cirrhosis-related deaths due to HBV, almost 40% of those due to HCV, just under half of those related to alcohol consumption, and just over a half of those due to NAFLD or other causes (eg, autoimmune, cholestatic, metabolic, or drug-induced liver diseases). In the region, 51·3% of deaths due to cirrhosis were caused by HBV, compared with 18·4% in the USA and 24·3% in Europe; HCV caused 15·7% of deaths due to cirrhosis (<i>vs</i> 37·5% in the USA and 32·6% in Europe), alcohol consumption caused 20·8% (31·2% in the USA and 30·9% in Europe), and NAFLD and other diseases caused 12·1% (12·8% in the USA and 12·1% in Europe; <a href="#fig3">figure 3</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 3</span></a></div>   <p>Causes of cirrhosis-related deaths by country in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="para1510">The second largest cause of liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is liver cancer, which accounted for 573 361 (43·6%) of all 2015 liver-related deaths in the region, compared with 24 565 (33·9%) of those in the USA and 78 072 (39·4%) of those in Europe. These deaths represent almost three-quarters of the estimated global number of deaths due to liver cancer for that year; the region accounted for more than 80% of the global total of HBV-related liver cancer deaths, just under half of those due to HCV, more than 70% of those that were alcohol-related, and more than three-quarters of those due to other causes including NAFLD. In 2015, HBV infection caused 49·1% of all deaths due to liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region (<i>vs</i> 12·7% in the USA and 20·4% in Europe), HCV infection caused 10·8% (37·1% in the USA and 37·2% in Europe), 29·8% were due to alcohol consumption (38·1% in the USA and 37·1% in Europe), and NAFLD and other diseases caused 10·1% (12·1% in the USA and 5·3% in Europe; <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 4</span></a></div>   <p>Causes of liver cancer-related deaths by country in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="para1520">The remaining major contributor to liver-related deaths in the Asia-Pacific region is acute viral hepatitis, which accounted for 108 276 (8·2%) of the total liver-related deaths in the region in 2015, compared with 929 (1·2%) of 72 437 in the USA and 4032 (0·3%) of 197 179 in Europe. Deaths in the Asia-Pacific region represented three-quarters of the global total number of deaths due to acute viral hepatitis. In 2015, the region accounted for three-quarters of the global total number of deaths related to acute HBV, almost two-thirds of those due to acute hepatitis A infection, and almost 80% of those due to acute hepatitis E infection. Of all deaths due to acute viral hepatitis in the region for that year, most were caused by acute hepatitis B infection (59·6%) and acute hepatitis E infection (32·1%), whereas only 6·3% were due to acute hepatitis A. By comparison, in 2015, of all deaths related to acute viral hepatitis, hepatitis B infection caused 81·7% in the USA and 70·0% in Europe, hepatitis E caused no deaths in the USA and 8·3% in Europe, and hepatitis A caused 13·4% in the USA and 18·0% in Europe (<a href="#fig5">figure 5</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 5</span></a></div>   <p>Causes of acute hepatitis-related deaths by country in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>   </div> <p /> <p id="para1530">Given the large contribution of the Asia-Pacific region to the global burden of liver diseases, the epidemiology and aetiology of the region's burden need to be reviewed. In this Commission, we document the burden of liver diseases in the region and formulate recommendations to tackle it. It was not feasible to cover every country in the Asia-Pacific region in this Commission. Thus, to maximise our scope by including territories at various stages of development, we divided countries according to their Human Development Index (HDI), selecting the top five most populous countries in the medium-to-high HDI category (China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and the top five in the very high HDI category (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand; <a href="#tbl1">table 1</a> shows demographics and health and socioeconomic indicators).<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> Given its achievements in controlling HBV, we also included Taiwan when discussing HBV-related liver disease. Commissioners were invited from each of the selected countries and were provided with an outline for data collation and literature review. After this information was synthesised, a draft manuscript was circulated to all collaborators for suggestions, comments, and consensus-building. A final manuscript was then circulated for approval. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="tbl1"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> </div></p><p>Demographic

With 5 000 000 pregnancies per year in Indonesia, approximately 150 000 pregnant mothers could potentially transmit HBV to their babies annually, of whom 95% will develop chronic hepatitis B and be infectious for their entire lives. This transmission incidence is of serious concern, considering that coverage of HBV birth-dose vaccination is low, screening tests for HBV in pregnant women are not routinely done, and antiviral treatment for women infected with HBV has not been adopted as a preventive strategy for mother-to-child transmission.<a href="#bib31"><sup>31</sup></a></p> <p id="para1630">A 2018 study<a href="#bib37"><sup>37</sup></a> showed that hepatitis B is an important occupational hazard for health-care workers in Indonesia.

infants against HBV exceeding 90%. China has released national action plans for control of viral hepatitis that set clear targets on prevention. However, a specific, large-scale, test-and-treat financed programme for patients with chronic hepatitis B or C is still to be established.

For example, China has no enforceable legal drinking age and does not regulate when or where alcoholic products are sold. An advertising regulation on alcoholic beverages was issued in 1995, but its enforcement has also been weak. Moreover, taxation in China has not been used to improve public health. Few treatment programmes are available in China for people with alcohol use disorders. Although some psychiatric hospitals in China have special addiction units for the treatment of patients with alcohol-related mental disorders, most of these units, which were established in the 1990s,

With large-scale procurement, the current cost of a 12-week HCV treatment regimen of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir is $70 and is expected to decrease (Sarin S K, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi, India, personal communication). This is one of the most comprehensive hepatitis control programmes globally, on the basis that it incorporates the sequelae of hepatitis infection together with hepatitis infection itself, and intends to reach out to primary health centres in a phased manner.

Some ongoing related programmes are hepatitis B immunisation for infants, safe blood transfusion, policies on injection safety, safe disposal of biomedical waste, food safety, and, most recently, treatment of hepatitis C. India does not currently have a national alcohol policy, but it has several policies and interventions aimed at reducing the harmful effects of alcohol (<a href="#tbl4">table 4</a>). The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment also has reduction and prevention <a href="http://socialjustice.nic.in/SchemeList/Send/42?mid=48565">policies on alcohol and drugs</a>. Alcohol is a subject in the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, which defines the exclusive legislative powers of state governments. Therefore, the laws governing alcohol, such as the legal drinking age in India and the laws that regulate its sale and consumption, vary from state to state. In India, consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the states of Bihar Gujarat, and Nagaland, as well as the union territory of Lakshadweep. There is a partial ban on alcohol in some districts of Manipur. All other Indian states permit alcohol consumption but have various legal drinking ages. In some states, the legal drinking age can be different for different types of alcoholic beverages.</p> <p id="para2550">Current policies in India largely do not focus directly on overweight, obesity, and NAFLD (<a href="#tbl5">table 5</a>). However, in the context of ameliorating the burden of non-communicable diseases, certain government initiatives have been undertaken. The GBD statistics<a href="#bib253"><sup>253</sup></a> and the projected prevalence of death and disability due to non-communicable diseases (obesity being the major risk factor) led the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to reduce the overweight diagnostic threshold for BMI to 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (from 25), and the standard waist circumference indicative of abdominal obesity to 90 cm in men and 80 cm in women (internationally accepted waist circumference thresholds for abdominal obesity are 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women). These standards have been published in the ministry's Consensus Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome, which were released jointly with the Diabetes Foundation of India, the All-India Institute of Medical Science, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the National Institute of Nutrition, and 20 other health organisations.<a href="#bib254"><sup>254</sup></a> Considering the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and the risk factors common among the major non-communicable chronic conditions, the Government of India initiated the integrated National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Stroke.<a href="#bib255"><sup>255</sup></a> The programme focuses on health promotion and prevention, strengthening infrastructure and human resources, early diagnosis and management, and integration with the primary health-care system through non-communicable-disease cells at different levels for optimal operational synergies.<a href="#bib255"><sup>255</sup></a> Consumption of junk food has also increased rampantly in India over the past two decades, and the industry primarily targets children. Although the Indian Government has not yet established a policy to ban junk food in schools and their close perimeters, the state governments of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have instructed schools not to allow the sale of junk food in their canteens. In India, no specific laws or guidelines regulate the advertising or marketing of junk foods, but provisions under laws in other policy areas and some guidelines issued by the self-governing Advertising Standards Council of India could be used to regulate their advertising. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also produced the Guidelines–Code of Self-Regulation in Food Advertisement to control the objectivity and accuracy of food advertisements.<a href="#bib256"><sup>256</sup></a> However, all of these measures are recommendations rather than mandatory.<a href="#bib257"><sup>257</sup></a> Amendments regarding packaging and labelling of food under part VII of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Rules of 1955 mandate the disclosure of health claims alongside nutritional labeling.<a href="#bib258"><sup>258</sup></a> However, stricter policies are required to prevent misleading information. For example, most packaged junk food in India does not mention trans fat because that is not required by the law.

These policies need to be updated with result-oriented strategies that aim to improve accountability and effectiveness by clearly defining expected outcomes, facilitating monitoring and evaluation, and reflecting improvements resulting from performance assessment processes. For example, in 1997, Pakistan introduced a National Health Policy targeting non-communicable diseases, and in 2003, it introduced an integrated national plan for action on four major non-communicable diseases and their risk factors, injuries, and mental health. Both the Policy and plan could not be implemented properly because of a change in government.<a href="#bib269"><sup>269</sup></a></p> <p id="para2630">In Pakistan, vaccination against HBV was incorporated into WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunisation in 2002, providing the first vaccine dose at the age of 6 weeks; however, coverage for all three doses has reached 75% according to WHO-UNICEF estimates in 2018.<a href="#bib270"><sup>270</sup></a> National guidelines on treatment and surveillance, provision of screening kits, injection safety equipment, training for preventive measures, and campaigns to increase mass awareness and financial support for treatment have also been developed.<a href="#bib271"><sup>271</sup></a></p> <p id="para2640">The National Programme for Hepatitis Prevention and Control was launched in 2005, after which provincial implementation units were also set up.<a href="#bib272"><sup>272</sup></a> The Programme focused on screening and treatment for HCV infection and did not establish laboratory-based viral hepatitis surveillance.

In 2009, to monitor the effectiveness of the Programme's activities and guide the implementation of evidence-based preventative interventions, the Pakistan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme (under the akistani Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Ministry of Health) launched a hepatitis sentinel-site surveillance system (<a href="#sec1">appendix p 3</a>).

Regarding HCV, local generic direct-acting antiviral drugs such as sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and velpatasvir are available at low cost, offering HCV treatment of good quality. However, the challenges in the management of transmission resemble those for HBV.</p> <p id="para2700">Harm reduction interventions, particularly a needle syringe programme for people who inject drugs, have been implemented in Bangladesh since 1998.

Advocacy programmes on viral hepatitis and validated training modules for training health-care personnel have been developed. More than 3000 physicians serving the Health Cadre of the Bangladesh Civil Service have already received training about hepatitis and its management strategies.</p> <p id="para2720">The status of various policies and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol in Bangladesh is shown in <a href="#tbl4">table 4</a>. In 1990, the Ministry of Home Affairs in Bangladesh published the Narcotic Control Act,<a href="#bib282"><sup>282</sup></a> which outlines national policies on alcohol tax rates, selling and serving of alcohol, alcohol advertisements, legal blood alcohol concentration when driving, and alcohol licensures. Although the Act restricts alcohol use, enforcement of its policies is minimal, so alcohol is still widely used in Bangladesh. Non-Muslim residents and foreign visitors are not affected by such restrictions, as long as they consume alcohol in private.</p> <p id="para2730">The Bangladesh National Plan for Action on Nutrition was started in 1997,<a href="#bib283"><sup>283</sup></a> with a focus on targeting undernutrition (<a href="#tbl5">table 5</a>). Dietary guidelines for Bangladesh were introduced in 2013 that describe population goals for intake of various nutrients, including saturated fats, trans fats, and sugars, which represent the average nutrient intake needed to maintain a healthy population. Bangladesh also endorsed a second National Plan of Action for Nutrition for 2016–25 in March, 2017.<a href="#bib284"><sup>284</sup></a> Its goal is to improve the nutritional status of all citizens and reduce all forms of malnutrition, with a focus on children, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women.

Japan's health-care system is largely successful because of its wide availability, effectiveness, and efficiency.<a href="#bib289"><sup>289</sup></a> The Japanese population has the longest life expectancy of all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),<a href="#bib290"><sup>290</sup></a> and its health-care expenditure as a share of GDP is lower than most of the developed OECD countries. In 2013, health expenditure in Japan was 10·3% of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 8·9%.<a href="#bib291"><sup>291</sup></a> Health insurance is mandatory in principle, but there is no penalty for the 10% of individuals who evade the compulsory insurance premium contribution, making it optional in practice.<a href="#bib292"><sup>292</sup></a> Health insurance can be either national or provided by the employer. In 1958, a new citizens' health insurance law formally committed Japan to universal health coverage by making enrolment in governmental insurance systems mandatory for people not covered by employee-based plans, and by 1961 all municipalities had established insurance programmes with near-complete coverage.<a href="#bib52"><sup>52</sup></a></p> <p id="para2750">The Japanese Government has been providing free hepatitis testing since 2002 for all citizens aged 40–70 years as part of routine health examinations. In 2007, patient management was strengthened by the establishment of a community hepatitis care network that links primary care physicians with specialised regional centres to co-manage patients with liver disease. Treatment for hepatitis was expensive, so the Government introduced a subsidy programme in 2008 to reduce the burden of out-of-pocket expenses.<a href="#bib293"><sup>293</sup></a> The cost of subsidies is borne by the national and local governments. People living with hepatitis currently pay ¥10 000–20 000 (approximately $100–200) per month on the basis of their income to cover the cost of drugs, medical appointments, and laboratory tests.</p> <p id="para2760">In 1985, Japan implemented public programmes for mandatory HBsAg tests for pregnant women to prevent mother-to-child HBV transmission. Infants who were born to HBsAg-positive mothers began receiving HBV vaccination plus IgG therapy in 1986. Further, the Japanese Red Cross implemented nucleic acid screening programmes for HBV and HCV in 1999. These national efforts markedly reduced the prevalence of childhood HBV infections. Nevertheless, about 200 new, primarily adult infections of acute HBV are reported annually.<a href="#bib48"><sup>48</sup></a> The distribution of HBV genotypes also appears to have changed on the basis of an observed increase of chronic infections but without obvious household transmission, which makes controlling infection challenging.<a href="#bib294"><sup>294</sup></a> The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare implemented routine immunisation of children for HBV in 2016 to prevent horizontal HBV transmission and to eradicate infection incidence, in line with WHO's target of eliminating the public health threat of viral hepatitis by 2030.<a href="#bib294"><sup>294</sup></a></p> <p id="para2770">Because of the universal health insurance system and the subsidy programme, the economic barrier to HCV eradication is very low in Japan, with all patients with HCV having access to direct-acting antiviral drugs (sofosbufir, sofosbufir–ledipasvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir–ritonavir, daclatasvir, elbasvir–grazoprevir, and sofosbufir–velpatasvir). In a 5-year retrospective cohort study between 2008 and 2013 that estimated HCV in blood donors from their medical records, the incidence of HCV infection was 0·40 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 0·27–0·57) on the basis of viral RNA seroconversion.<a href="#bib295"><sup>295</sup></a> Incidence was as low as that reported between 1994 and 2004 (1·9 per 100 000 person-years, 95% CI 1·1–3·0).<a href="#bib296"><sup>296</sup></a> Additionally, the incidence of HCV infection is very low, and HCV is nearly eradicated. As discussed, deaths due to hepatocellular carcinoma plateaued in 2002–04 and have declined since. Access to medical examinations is easy, so patients with high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma can be regularly monitored and many cases are treatable because they are detected at an early stage. The production and off-premise sale of all alcoholic beverages based on the Liquor Tax Law requires a Government licence (<a href="#tbl4">table 4</a>). This licensing system has been strictly imposed over time and almost no home-brewed alcohol has been available on the market for the past 30 years. However, there is virtually no restriction on off-premise sales in Japan and there are no restrictions on the advertising alcoholic beverages.</p> <p id="para2780">Encouraging weight loss is a central aim of Healthy Japan 21, a series of 10-year public-health goals devised at the start of the millennium (<a href="#tbl5">table 5</a>).<a href="#bib297"><sup>297</sup></a> This reduction of overweight is to be achieved through public education campaigns on healthy eating and increased physical activity.<a href="#bib298"><sup>298</sup></a> Japan's school lunches programme has helped to slow the rise of child obesity in Japan. Lunches tend to be planned by a nutritionist, include locally grown and fresh ingredients, and tend to be dominated by rice, vegetables, soups, and fish. Childhood obesity has increased in Japan since the 1970s, but that increase has happened more slowly than in other economically developed countries. The Government has established healthy waistline thresholds for adults aged 40–74 years with the metabo law, which came into effect in 2008, and these are measured at annual checkups.<a href="#bib298"><sup>298</sup></a> The threshold for men is 33·5 inches or less and women, it is 35·4 inches. People who exceed those norms are required to attend counselling and support sessions. Companies are required to measure the waistlines of at least 80% of their employees along with their families, and of retired employees. Furthermore, at the time of introduction, companies were required to help 10% of those who were above the thresholds to lose weight by 2012, and 25% by 2015. Companies and local governments that failed to meet specific targets were liable for financial penalties, potentially as high as $19 million.<a href="#bib298"><sup>298</sup></a> The targets have not been updated, but companies are now required to increase their contributions to their welfare fund by 10% if they do not perform well. Men and women who exceed the waistline measurement threshold during their annual medical examinations are enrolled in diet programmes, fitness classes, or are asked to see a doctor. The long-term effectiveness of this controversial stringent approach are yet to be clarified.<a href="#bib299"><sup>299</sup></a></p> <p id="para2790">South Korea is a high-income country with nominal GNI per capita of $28 380 and annual GDP growth of 3·1%.<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a> By contrast with most OECD countries, health spending in South Korea has been growing continuously since the 1970s at a rate above the OECD average.

The national health insurance covers about 97% of the population, and the remaining 3% are covered by the Medical Aid Program, a tax-funded programme for health-care access of citizens with low incomes. By contrast with public health financing, health-care delivery relies heavily on the private sector, although some public health facilities provide medical services at the central, regional, and municipal levels.

Pegylated interferon can also be used. For HCV, the use of pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been covered by the national health insurance programme. Coverage is not complete for direct-acting antiviral drugs but is improving and the following drugs have been approved by the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for the treatment of HCV: sofosbuvir–ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir, elbasvir–grazoprevir, and glecaprevir–pibrentasvir.</p> <p id="para2820">South Korea has implemented a minimum age for purchasing alcohol, but other legally binding policies (eg, regulating promotion of the sales of alcoholic beverages or sale restriction in petrol stations and to intoxicated individuals) do not exist (<a href="#tbl4">table 4</a>).</p> <p id="para2830">South Korean ministries, especially the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ministry of Education, have introduced many interventions to improve diets and increase physical activity (<a href="#tbl5">table 5</a>). For example, the Ministry of Health and Welfare provides budget support to local governments' obesity programmes, develops educational materials and publicises them, and provides vouchers for management services of physical activity and diets for obese children. The National School Lunch Act, introduced in 1981, has provisions on school dietitians, nutritional requirements, and dietary consultation. In July, 2018, the South Korean Government set a goal to keep the population's obesity prevalence lower than 35% by implementing measures on nutrition, exercise, obesity treatment, and improved awareness. Surgical procedures to treat obesity are covered by public health insurance. Starting in 2020, medical consultations and dietary training will also be eligible for partial coverage under the national insurance plan. Additionally, the Government will finance outdoor activities for students so that children will have access to activities outside their school gyms such as swimming, skating, bowling, climbing, and baseball.

In the late 1980s, the programme was extended to preschool children, medical personnel, and elementary-school children, and from 1992 onward, unvaccinated teenagers and adults have been encouraged to be vaccinated on a fee-for-service basis. Around 2000, because of the availability of effective treatments for hepatitis B and C, treatment of chronic viral hepatitis was added to the programme. In 2003, treatment for chronic hepatitis B and C was reimbursed by the national health insurance, which has had a tremendous impact on the outcomes of patients with chronic hepatitis. A 2010 analysis showed a steady and substantial decrease of the mortality of patients with end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan.<a href="#bib348"><sup>348</sup></a> In 2017, some of the direct-acting antivirals against HCV infection were covered by the national health insurance for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.</p> <p id="para3030">Although health insurance has been introduced in most countries of Asia-Pacific, overall coverage remains low in countries like India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, with consequent high out-of-pocket expenditure.

To meet the need for liver transplant services, liver transplantation from deceased donors needs to be encouraged over living transplantation. The organ donation rate will need to increase from the current 0·5 per million people per year to 5–10 per million per year, and organ-sharing policies need to move from current ones that are based on waiting time or institutional rotation to a severity-based system.

The health-care delivery system, therefore, relies hugely on private organisations that have advanced facilities but are unaffordable to most people. Public health-care institutions that provide advanced care are often only located in major towns and cities and private tertiary care hospitals are extremely expensive.

However, no other transplantations were done until 2011 when a single liver transplantation from a deceased donor was done in Lahore. From 2012 onward, several medical centres in Pakistan have attempted to develop programmes for transplantation from living donors.<a href="#bib357"><sup>357</sup></a> The most important impeding factor in developing high-volume transplantation programmes across Pakistan is the lack of skilled workforce. Shifa International Hospital (Islamabad) and the Shaikh Zayed Center of Liver Transplantation (Lahore) are the only two transplantation centres run by local teams, whereas others rely exclusively on international collaborators. Security concerns and visa delays make frequent travel by international teams difficult, and the reliance on international experts interrupts continuity of care. Thus, the presence of efficient local transplant teams is crucial to develop successful and sustainable transplantation programmes. Until February, 2017, only 539 liver transplantations had been done in Pakistan, and approximately 95% of these were done in the two locally run centres. A liver transplant from a living donor in Pakistan costs $35 000–45 000. Most patients are self-funded, and financial restrictions are one of the biggest hurdles to accessibility. The Human Organ and Transplantation Authority regulates legal and ethical aspects of liver transplantation in Pakistan, but its decentralisation with the 18th amendment of Pakistan's Constitution has moved various ministries, including the Ministry of Health, from central to provincial control.<a href="#bib358"><sup>358</sup></a> Those changes have given rise to five autonomous provincial bodies that regulate transplant activity, allowing for a stringent legal and regulatory process at the provincial level. Simultaneously, the current decentralised approach challenges the implementation of a future national transplant registry that might monitor transplantation activity and outcomes countrywide. The Government will have to consider innovative ideas including private–public sector partnerships and proper incentivisation of skilled medical personnel to make liver transplantation available in poor settings in Pakistan. The implementation of a national transplant registry is inevitable to ensure transparency in various steps of organ donation and outcome reporting while providing transplant services of international credibility.</p> <p id="para3170">A 2015 WHO report stated that there are 64 434 registered doctors, 6034 dentists, 30 516 nurses, and 27 000 nurse-midwives in Bangladesh.<a href="#bib359"><sup>359</sup></a> Additionally, the health workforce is skewed towards doctors, with a triple ratio of doctors to nurses to technologists of 1:0·4:0·24, by stark contrast with the WHO recommended ratio of 1:3:5.

Survival outcomes had improved substantially by 2009, showing 1-year graft survival of 76% for patients with transplants from deceased donors and 90% for those with transplants from living donors, primarily because of developments in quality control and immunosuppression. In South Korea, liver transplantation from living donors is thought to be effective and feasible for patients needing a transplant. Transplantation from living donors has substantially increased over the past three decades because livers from deceased donors are scarce. Better understanding of the regeneration of partial grafts and various advances in surgical techniques have contributed to a marked improvement in patient and donor outcomes in cases of living-donor transplantation.</p> <p id="para3260">In Australia, there were 3·6 physicians per 1000 people in 2016 and 12·6 midwives and nurses per 1000 people for the same year.<a href="#bib365">365</a>, <a href="#bib366">366</a> There were 3·9 hospital beds per 1000 people in 2010.<a href="#bib367"><sup>367</sup></a> The shortages of health-care professionals persist despite the growth of the workforce.

The current health workforce needs to increase to promote primary providers' awareness and knowledge of hepatitis B and C, and an increase in support, training, and mentorship for health-care professionals is needed to ensure successful testing, management, and treatment in primary health care. Community organisations and the health-care workforce need to be supported to increase appropriate engagement with at-risk populations, improve health literacy, and maximise positive health outcomes.

Liver transplantation programmes were initiated in 1985 in Australia and in 1997 in New Zealand. 5000 liver transplants had been done in approximately 4500 patients from inception until January, 2015, with approximately 260 transplants annually. Liver transplant centres are based in major hospitals in five of Australia's states.

Implementation began in 1988 and applied only to kidney donation. A 2004 amendment to the Act also permitted living organ donation and included other organs, such as livers, hearts, and corneas. The 2004 amendment further included all causes of death rather than solely death by accidental causes. Further legislative amendments in 2007 and 2009 were made with the firm intent of expanding the supply of transplantable organs and ensuring that organ donors are not exploited, unlawfully induced, or forced into organ retrieval by non-government actors.<a href="#bib377"><sup>377</sup></a> Another scheme is the Medical Therapy, Education, and Research,<a href="#bib378"><sup>378</sup></a> which operates on an opt-in basis, allowing people to pledge their organs or body parts for transplantation, education, or research after death. Additionally, the Ministry of Health subsidises at least 50% of the cost of liver transplantations. Together with the MediShield programme for immunosuppression, patients receiving liver transplants are well supported financially.</p> <p id="para3310">Taiwan has fewer doctors and nurses than OECD countries.

There is very little information on the number of liver specialists in each country, which might represent a lack of focus on liver diseases and a paucity of hepatology specialists. Hepatology programmes urgently need to be established in most countries in the region. Few liver transplantation facilities are available in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. Even in countries with good facilities, liver transplants from deceased donors represent only a small proportion of all liver transplants.

Priorities to address the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region</div> <p id="para3340">Health financing in China is not equitable. In 2011, the average total health expenditure per capita for urban areas was three times higher than it was for rural areas (¥2698 <i>vs</i> ¥879) but the share of out-of-pocket expenditure was 50% for urban residents and 36% for rural residents.<a href="#bib381"><sup>381</sup></a> Major disparities between the rural and urban health-care systems persist, mainly because of insufficient government stewardship and unequally distributed social determinants of health. The Chinese Government is moving the health-care system towards universal coverage for both rural and urban residents. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme is the major medical insurance scheme in rural China. It aims to protect households from falling into poverty because of high treatment costs (ie, catastrophic health expenditure), and its principal objective is to provide universal coverage and improve equity of access to health care.<a href="#bib382">382</a>, <a href="#bib383">383</a> However, the main goal of preventing rural residents from falling into poverty because of severe illness is still far off. With the vast expansion of coverage between 2004 and 2007, reimbursement is falling as medical expenditure is increasing. In 2007, the real reimbursement rate (reimbursement amount divided by total expenditure on medical care) was around 19% for illnesses that required expenditures between ¥200 and ¥2000, but only 8% if expenditure was more than ¥10 000.<a href="#bib384"><sup>384</sup></a> The distribution of health workers is also uneven between rural and urban areas of China, with two-thirds of the health-care workforce situated in urban areas. Additionally, the educational or skill level of rural health workers is inferior to those in urban areas.<a href="#bib385"><sup>385</sup></a> A 2011 web report in <i>Finance</i> showed that there were still more than 300 million people without access to safe drinking water in rural China.<a href="#bib386"><sup>386</sup></a> Further progress must be guided by the principle of health equity and fairness and supported by cross-sectoral cooperation.</p> <p id="para3350">Diagnosis, treatment, and choice of optimal therapy for patients with HBV and HCV need to be improved in China. For HBV, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues such as lamivudine, adefovir, and telbivudine are not preferred by international guidelines but are still used in low-income areas,<a href="#bib382">382</a>, <a href="#bib387">387</a> although the first-line antiviral drugs entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are recommended by practice guidelines and are already on the reimbursement list.<a href="#bib388"><sup>388</sup></a> As tenofovir becomes cheaper and generic versions of tenofovir and entecavir are approved, appropriate therapies should be increasingly prescribed.

The Government should also implement an operational policy to reduce unhealthy dietary practices and promote physical activity to prevent NAFLD.</p> <p id="para3370">Considering the current status of liver diseases in China, future research should focus on, but not be restricted to: improving the quality and completeness of incidence and prevalence reporting of acute and chronic hepatitis B and C; synthesising accurate disease burden information on the morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma attributable to HBV and HCV; and generating a definitive action plan with milestone targets and secured financing. It is also necessary to streamline clinical trials, to speed up approval for HBV and HCV drugs, and to substantially reduce their price and include them in reimbursement policies through independent cost-effectiveness analyses and negotiating with multiple stakeholders. Large-scale test-and-treat strategies for patients with hepatitis B and C must be optimised, and an optimal service delivery model and standard package for their diagnosis and treatment needs to be established and validated. Finally, accurate data generation on the prevalence of NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease and their related morbidity and mortality, and research on effectiveness of various interventions to prevent these diseases are also needed.</p> <p id="para3380">In India, improving sanitation and providing safe drinking water is important to prevent HAV and HEV. The rural Indian population (about 70% of the total population) has mostly low literacy, lacks basic sanitary facilities, and is thus at high risk of faecal–oral transmission of hepatitis. Hygiene is also poor in urban areas, with poor disposal of solid and liquid waste (including excreta) and poor drainage systems. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (or Clean India Mission) is a nationwide campaign launched in 2014 for clean streets, roads, and other infrastructure. The campaign's objectives include eliminating open defecation through the construction of household-owned and community-owned toilets and establishing an accountability mechanism to monitor toilet use (ie, through a dedicated workforce using mobile phones and tablets). According to the Government of India, which runs the mission, 99% of rural villages were free from open defecation as of Oct 2, 2019.<a href="#bib392">392</a>, <a href="#bib393">393</a></p> <p id="para3390">Birth-dose immunisation against hepatitis B in India is low. Blood safety is a challenge in India because of the high prevalence of HIV, HCV, and HBV, the relatively low proportion of volunteer donors, and unstandardised screening procedures across blood collection centres.<a href="#bib394"><sup>394</sup></a> One study has estimated that nucleic-acid amplification testing could prevent 3272 infectious donations a year (including 818 HIV, 409 HCV, and 2454 HBV) from the approximate 5 million annual donations.<a href="#bib395"><sup>395</sup></a> Centralised screening centres for nucleic-acid amplification testing that serve all blood banks in a given city and report results electronically are hugely successful globally. This model has worked very well in Thailand, which has a fragmented blood-banking system similar to India and other countries in the region.</p> <p id="para3400">There are several factors in India and other developing countries that increase the risk of percutaneous needle stick injury and transmission of HBV and HCV. These include: severe disease requiring intravenous drugs; a preference to use injections over oral or other administration methods; use of hazardous equipment and procedures (eg, no disposable syringes, safe needle devices, and sharps disposal containers; inability or failure to use sharps containers immediately after injection; no personal protective equipment; inadequate staffing; reusing needles); and insufficient vaccination coverage against hepatitis B, availability of post-exposure prophylaxis against HBV, and adherence to standard precautions.<a href="#bib396"><sup>396</sup></a> In India, more than 93% of injections are unsafe.<a href="#bib397"><sup>397</sup></a> Inadequately sterilised needles and syringes are an important cause of transmission of blood-borne hepatitis in India.<a href="#bib398"><sup>398</sup></a> A large proportion of health-care workers in India are unvaccinated, many are unaware of their vaccination status, and are thus vulnerable to blood-borne infections.<a href="#bib399"><sup>399</sup></a> The implementation of safe injection practices in the Indian health-care system is urgently needed.</p> <p id="para3410">Although HAV vaccination is not included in the national immunisation schedule, it is available privately in high-income settings, as it is difficult to convincingly argue for its country-wide use. India has traditionally been an area of high HAV endemicity; however, studies have found evidence of an epidemiological shift to intermediate endemicity for people with high incomes in various cities.<a href="#bib130">130</a>, <a href="#bib400">400</a> In such cities, high-income areas are susceptible to HAV, but people living there are not likely to become infected, whereas most of the remaining population continue to get infected and transmit the virus. The hepatitis A vaccination strategy in susceptible high-income population groups would need to be reassessed. Introducing a hepatitis A vaccine in resource-poor populations is problematic because the resulting reduction in HAV transmission can have unintended consequences. Although it might reduce the risk of HAV infection, it also has the potential to increase the average age at which HAV infection occurs,<a href="#bib401"><sup>401</sup></a> thereby increasing the overall risk of acute disease. Thus, introducing vaccination with low coverage in a high-endemicity area would change the epidemiology to an intermediate-endemicity pattern, which is undesirable. By contrast, high-coverage vaccination in an intermediate-endemicity area would result in the desirable outcome of low endemicity.</p> <p id="para3420">Licensed versions of several direct-acting antiviral drugs with anti-HCV activity (including sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir–ledipasvir, and sofosbuvir–velpatasvir) are available in India, and the price for a course of 3–6 months at the Government's expense is about $1 a day. A modelling study showed that treatment of HCV infection using generic direct-acting antiviral drugs is cost-saving.<a href="#bib402"><sup>402</sup></a> Provision of HBV oral drugs through the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program is currently in the planning stage.</p> <p id="para3430">Alcohol-related liver disease is likely to become an increasingly big problem, given that alcohol consumption in India is increasing. Measures to reduce alcohol-induced injuries are in place but are not strictly implemented. It might be possible to prevent NAFLD through various interventions at all societal levels, such as the 14·5% fat tax that the state of Kerala has already imposed on the consumption of certain foods.<a href="#bib403"><sup>403</sup></a> Far-reaching programmes to increase the awareness of the public and medical personnel on liver disease prevention are needed.</p> <p id="para3440">Research priorities on liver diseases in India need to focus on the quality of data collection regarding the incidence and prevalence of common causes of liver disorders and their risk factors. Data need to be generated on morbidity and mortality related to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with various aetiologies. With the launch of the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program in 2018, research should also focus on the development of low-cost point-of-contact testing kits for viral hepatitis. The effectiveness of potential interventions to prevent and treat NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease needs to be investigated. Finally, implementation research to improve the coverage and effectiveness of potential interventions and to improve awareness of these diseases in the general population is also needed.</p> <p id="para3450">In Indonesia, challenges persist in the programmes for control of viral hepatitis, including insufficient knowledge and awareness about viral hepatitis, inadequacy of available data, a large population spread over a vast archipelago, problems in diagnosis and treatment due to insufficient training of staff, few viral hepatitis specialists, and insufficiant health-care infrastructure and investment. Moreover, the need for viral quantification before, during, and after treatment, as well as the pretreatment determination of viral genotype as recommended by all existing guidelines, also pose problems that could threaten the success of Indonesia's National Health Insurance scheme. The scheme covers drugs for HBV and HCV, but does not cover the diagnostic tests needed to determine whether these drugs are needed. This discrepancy, along with the insufficient number of testing facilities, nullifies the potential benefit of accessible treatment for much of the population.<a href="#bib36"><sup>36</sup></a> A government strategic plan for disease prevention and increasing the uptake of services has been developed that integrates existing health programmes, such as mother-and-child health care, HIV-hepatitis co-infection management, public health-care insurance, public–private partnerships, and community engagement with civil society and the media.</p> <p id="para3460">The Indonesian Government has increasingly committed to fighting liver diseases, particularly viral hepatitis, but has not made this commitment into a formal priority. There is a paucity of reliable epidemiological and other data related to various liver diseases; such data are crucial to guide evidence-based policy development. The country needs to invest in research on liver diseases such as monitoring the epidemiological patterns of communicable and non-communicable liver diseases, including their prevalence, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history. Studies are needed on the impact of interventions, including assessment of preventive measures, guidelines, drug efficacy, and treatment. New tools for prevention, diagnosis, care, and treatment (eg, a new pilot project of catch-up vaccination for hepatitis B in vulnerable and high-risk groups and hepatitis B treatment for pregnant women) are needed.</p> <p id="para3470">In Pakistan, there are no publicly funded screening programmes for viral hepatitis. Such programmes are urgently needed to improve the National Hepatitis Strategic Framework<a href="#bib274">274</a>, <a href="#bib275">275</a> and implement prevention and treatment measures. Despite the high burden of hepatitis, less priority is given to it than to HIV, and there are no properly trained medical staff in small towns and villages. Therefore, improving compliance with HBV vaccination at birth is of great importance. An HAV vaccine is available but is not covered by any vaccination programmes, and there are no national guidelines on HAV vaccination. Donated blood is screened for hepatitis B and C but existing regulations for safe blood transfusion services are ineffective. Paid blood donation should be declared illegal. Community-based interventions to educate health-care providers and the public on the risks of HBV and HCV transmission associated with contaminated blood, unsafe injections, and reusing razors are needed. There are no widely available auto-disable or single-use syringes and strict implementation of strategies to avoid reusing needles or syringes. To prevent transmission, it is also important for the Government to provide safe drinking water and sanitation, and to educate the public on hygienic practices such as drinking boiled water. Opioid substitution programmes should be implemented, as should safe blood transfusion services that are easy to use and can be monitored according to international standards. Electronic media could be used to raise public awareness of viral hepatitis and to encourage patients to get screened and treated.</p> <p id="para3480">It is important to establish an integrated hepatitis surveillance and response system in Pakistan, with multiple sites across the country that provide laboratory testing for diagnosis and treatment. A publicly funded programme for HBV and HCV treatment is already established. Sofosbuvir and its generic versions are registered by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan; it is cheap but is entirely covered by patients' out-of-pocket expenses. Generic versions of daclatasvir are in their registration phase. Harm reduction strategies need to be implemented to provide treatment to users of injectable drugs, particularly in prisons. The Ministry of Health should consider early approval of hepatitis C medications already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, monitoring the bioequivalence of generic drugs, and assessing the economic burden of hepatitis care, which is currently not being done. There is an urgent need for accurate epidemiological data assessing viral and other liver diseases. Developing strategies and studying their effect on prevention and treatment outcomes is another priority area of research. Research into ways to improve birth-dose HBV vaccination coverage is urgently required. Various modalities for training of the existing workforce in care of patients with liver diseases (on-site training, online training, teleconferencing, etc) also need to be investigated.</p> <p id="para3490">In Bangladesh, the prospect of achieving WHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on Eliminating Viral Hepatitis<a href="#bib404"><sup>404</sup></a> seems achievable and the Government has made it into an official priority. The Government is considering birth-dose and catch-up vaccination and vaccination of vulnerable groups against HBV, screening of at-risk groups such as pregnant women, and promoting access to health care by improving laboratory and imaging facilities in district-level government hospitals. Free treatment of individuals infected with HBV and HCV is pending pilot implementation and eventually expanded nationwide.</p> <p id="para3500">Although the cost of antiviral drugs has been reduced considerably in Bangladesh, the costs of diagnostic medical examinations are still extremely high. Additionally, patients are not sufficiently encouraged to get screened for hepatitis and to receive therapy. Awareness of hepatitis is increasing in urban areas, but rural areas are lagging in this respect. A study has shown that HBV DNA is prevalent in HBsAg-negative blood.<a href="#bib405"><sup>405</sup></a> Thus, the quality assurance of HBsAg testing kits and safety of HBsAg-negative blood, which has not been tested for anti-HBc or nucleic acids, needs Government attention. It might not be practical to test blood samples with nucleic-acid amplification as a preventive measure; however, testing for anti-HBc could be accommodated in Bangladesh to prevent HBV transmission through blood transfusion.</p> <p id="para3510">There have been substantial advances in research on liver diseases in Bangladesh and several epidemiological studies have been published in the past two decades.<a href="#bib56">56</a>, <a href="#bib57">57</a>, <a href="#bib58">58</a>, <a href="#bib59">59</a>, <a href="#bib60">60</a>, <a href="#bib61">61</a>, <a href="#bib62">62</a>, <a href="#bib149">149</a>, <a href="#bib150">150</a>, <a href="#bib152">152</a>, <a href="#bib153">153</a>, <a href="#bib154">154</a>, <a href="#bib155">155</a>, <a href="#bib156">156</a>, <a href="#bib218">218</a>, <a href="#bib219">219</a>, <a href="#bib220">220</a>, <a href="#bib223">223</a>, <a href="#bib406">406</a>, <a href="#bib407">407</a>, <a href="#bib408">408</a> Still, baseline data on incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history, and the changing epidemiology of various causes of liver diseases need to be generated. Studies are needed to develop cheap, accessible, point-of-care testing for HBV and HCV, and on preventive measures and new drug treatments for NAFLD. Research to improve coverage of HBV vaccination for high-risk groups, particularly preventing HBV transmission from mother to baby, is needed. Strategies should be developed to improve general awareness about liver disease among the public and medical staff and training of existing health-care workers on managing liver diseases.</p> <p id="para3520">In Japan, as the prevalence of viral hepatitis decreases, cases of NASH and NAFLD are increasing. It is currently impossible to estimate how long this increase will continue and what preventive measures would be effective. Efforts to tackle NAFLD centre on the Government's extensive focus on obesity prevention and hepatocellular carcinoma through screening programmes and advances in treatment. Japan has a budget of $400 billion per year for overall health-care expenditure, accounting for 38·8% of the national governmental budget. Research must focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and liver fibrosis, and on effective ways of delivering health-care education and information on prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Effective models of community-based care for patients with liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, need to be investigated. Also, developing novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma are major unmet needs. Research is needed into strategies to tackle increasing health costs and improve health equity.</p> <p id="para3530">In South Korea, HBV represents a major medical burden. According to a survey of 3000 people done by the Korea Association Study of Liver Disease (KASL), approximately half of the respondents (45·4%), aged between 15 and 69 years, had not had a HBsAg test or did not know whether they had had the test. Additionally, although antiviral therapy has been well supported by the national insurance reimbursement policy, there is still a gap between the HBV management guidelines proposed by KASL and government policy. Although screening tests for HBV infection are done for women who are preparing for pregnancy, army recruits, adults aged 40 years and older, and groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, a continuous management programme after HBV diagnosis requires further consideration, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of screening adults older than 40 years must be re-evaluated.</p> <p id="para3540">There is currently no screening programme for HCV in South Korea. One-off HCV screening and treatment of people aged 40–70 years is likely to be very cost-effective compared with the current practice of no screening.<a href="#bib409"><sup>409</sup></a> Importantly, to reduce the incidence of HCV-related end-stage liver-related complications and mortality, a national screening programme should include a national health policy aimed at managing HCV in the South Korean population.</p> <p id="para3550">According to a survey done by KASL in 2013 (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 79% of respondents who visited tertiary hospitals due to alcohol-related liver disease had not had the chance to join an abstinence programme or receive consultation from a psychologist. Only 3% of patients with alcohol-related liver disease had received specialised rehabilitation, which assists patients with returning to a normal social life. Hospital visits and treatments are mainly dependent on the will of the patient. Priority areas for addressing the burden of alcohol-related liver diseases in South Korea include research into helping people to adopt healthy lifestyles (ie, avoiding alcohol consumption, early detection of alcohol overuse and alcohol-related liver disease), effective strategies in helping people with alcohol-related liver disease to stop their alcohol consumption, and new therapeutic targets for alcohol-related liver diseases including severe hepatitis.</p> <p id="para3560">According to KNHANES 2009–13,<a href="#bib410">410</a>, <a href="#bib411">411</a> the number of people participating in intense physical activity is decreasing in South Korea, whereas caloric intake and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome is increasing. According to the 2013 KASL survey (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 40% of respondents did not exercise even for 1 h per week, despite recognising that regular exercise is helpful for NAFLD management. Another issue is that national insurance does not support education programmes for optimal food intake and exercise, although lifestyle modification is the basis of NAFLD management. In many cases, doctors give patients who visit hospital general lifestyle modification recommendations, rather than specific guidelines. Priority areas for action for NAFLD in South Korea include research into noninvasive markers of NASH and fibrosis in NAFLD and on new therapies, ways to motivate people of all ages to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the pathological mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD.</p> <p id="para3570">The Korean Government started a national hepatocellular carcinoma examination project in 2003.<a href="#bib412"><sup>412</sup></a> The following factors need to be considered to improve the project: the target population; proper classification of hepatocellular carcinoma, as the International Classification of Diseases-10 code is inaccurate and does not provide appropriate guidelines on alcohol intake; and supportive hospital care programmes. Finally, lifestyle modifications for healthy bodyweight must be emphasised in the general population to prevent NAFLD.</p> <p id="para3580">Although support for research into liver diseases has increased substantially, it is still insufficient. Research priorities for liver diseases in South Korea include identifying barriers and facilitators, and developing strategies to increase awareness and education in the general population and physicians, for HBV and HCV testing and uptake of treatment, particularly in high-risk groups. A simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test for NASH and strategies to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles are needed. Promoting awareness and education about alcohol misuse and evaluating successes and errors of abstinence and rehabilitation programmes for patients with alcohol-related liver disease is also necessary. An accurate risk model that incorporates newly identified risk factors and biomarkers must be developed for primary care providers. Additionally, research into the development of a simple and organised surveillance system for groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma would facilitate making health care for these patients efficient and cost-effective.</p> <p id="para3590">Australia and New Zealand are multicultural countries, which turns diagnosing and treating people with hepatitis infection into a major challenge. The principal barrier to expanding patient coverage is that refugees and asylum seekers living with chronic hepatitis B have many other priorities, such as reuniting with their families and establishing a life in Australia and New Zealand, that are more important to them than health-seeking behaviours.<a href="#bib396"><sup>396</sup></a> Multiple other challenges include language and cultural differences and little disease-specific knowledge.<a href="#bib413"><sup>413</sup></a></p> <p id="para3600">Australia and New Zealand have low population densities, vast stretches of uninhabited land, and several urban centres distributed sparsely along the coast. The countries have problems addressing the health-care needs of remote communities, where the proportion of Indigenous people is high and geographical distances are extremely large.<a href="#bib414"><sup>414</sup></a> Inequalities in the social determinants of health between metropolitan and rural and regional populations influence the need for health care.<a href="#bib415"><sup>415</sup></a></p> <p id="para3610">Access to comprehensive primary health care involving specialists is considered ideal for the early and ongoing management of illness in rural areas.<a href="#bib416"><sup>416</sup></a> However, only 15% of Australian specialists have their main practice outside metropolitan areas, whereas 30% of Australians reside in rural areas.<a href="#bib417"><sup>417</sup></a> Rural specialist outreach services could help to overcome complex barriers to service access, mainly due to language and cultural differences, and avoid the cost and effort of seeking care away from home.<a href="#bib418"><sup>418</sup></a> Visiting liver specialists can meet many of the health service needs of rural areas (including prevention and management of liver diseases). Additionally, visiting specialists can also provide periodic procedural support for rural generalists, thereby increasing the clinical confidence and reducing the professional isolation of rural practices.<a href="#bib419"><sup>419</sup></a> Australia is the only country that, since 2000, has had a sustained national outreach policy that subsidises the outreach of medical specialists to rural areas; still, there is scope to improve outreach in hepatology services.<a href="#bib420"><sup>420</sup></a></p> <p id="para3620">There is also insufficient knowledge among health professionals of risk factors for the presence and progression of liver disease and the effect of liver disease on health and life expectancy. Waiting times for specialised liver centres are long, so patients cannot access services in a timely manner. The inability of primary care physicians to provide effective guidance and the lack of a management toolbox for primary care might also lead to their reduced interest in early intervention.</p> <p id="para3630">Another impediment to controlling hepatitis B and C is late notification of hepatitis, defined as late hepatitis diagnosis, which is mainly associated with old age. Late notification increases the risk of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<a href="#bib421"><sup>421</sup></a> Further, there is cultural resistance in migrant populations to accepting dietary and health advice from health service providers.<a href="#bib422"><sup>422</sup></a></p> <p id="para3640">The price of drug treatment and medical services that are not supported by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme represents another barrier to tackling the burden of liver disease—eg, new obesity drugs such as naltrexone–bupropion. Policy makers need to recognise that liver diseases are chronic diseases and to establish nurse-led community-based models of care. Finally, enhancing funding for medical research to identify novel therapeutic targets for treating specific liver diseases, such as alcohol-related liver disease, NASH, and hepatitis B, and for implementation research is crucial.</p> <p id="para3650">The focus of HBV and HCV research in Australia and New Zealand should be on preventing transmission in people who inject drugs, including: evaluating novel methods to improve population estimates of injected drug use and hepatitis infections; evaluating implementation, effectiveness, and scale-up of existing prevention interventions for this population; identifying barriers and facilitators associated with HBV and HCV testing at the levels of the patient, provider, and health-care system; evaluating novel, point-of-care assays for HBV and HCV testing and treatment uptake that are highly sensitive and specific, simple, quick, and cheap; and evaluating the scale-up of strategies for improving the linkage to care for patients newly diagnosed with HBV and HCV.</p> <p id="para3660">New and effective therapies for patients with NAFLD and liver fibrosis need to be developed. An unmet clinical need is the identification of novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and liver cancer. Australia will also need to invest in research on liver diseases that are particularly common, including prevalence and risk factors, natural history, and effective methods for control and treatment. Further, there is a great need and potential for implementation research to improve the coverage and effectiveness of various interventions for liver diseases. Research needs to especially focus on Indigenous populations regarding prevention, treatment, models for engagement, and service delivery for various liver disorders.</p> <p id="para3670">In Singapore, identifying cases of hepatitis B and C is the biggest barrier to appropriate management of patients and control HBV and HCV infection. For hepatitis B, family screening is recommended under Singapore's hepatitis B guidelines. Once people are identified as having viral hepatitis, referring them to receive medical care might be difficult. Barriers to follow-up include insufficient reminders to patients, lack of physician time, cost of tests and treatment, and blood taking. In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who were offered health screening in 2003, 67% were not found to be followed up regularly.<a href="#bib423"><sup>423</sup></a> In a follow-up study, the barriers to regular follow-up included lack of education of the patient on the implications of not being followed up, cost of follow-up, blood taking, and lack of time.<a href="#bib424"><sup>424</sup></a></p> <p id="para3680">Regarding the management of non-viral hepatitis liver disease in Singapore, a strategy to target high-risk groups, particularly those with diabetes and those who are obese, would be the first step. Lifestyle interventions can be challenging to implement but much can be done by the Government to maximise disease control by introducing health-promoting public policies, infrastrucutre changes to facilitate healthy choices for living, working, studying, and recreation, and collaborative public–private partnerships. Alcohol-related liver disease represents an area that has not been addressed extensively, and expertise of medical staff around alcohol management, addiction behaviour, and support facilities needs improvement. Such improvement strategies might include developing multidisciplinary teams of psychiatrists, counsellors, psychologists, nurses, and social workers to provide individual, group, and family therapy; increasing addiction awareness in the community; and training for health-care and social service professionals and promoting addiction on research.</p> <p id="para3690">Research priorities for liver diseases in Singapore include: identifying barriers and facilitators associated with HBV and HCV testing and linkage to care and treatment; evaluating strategies that might be helpful in increasing testing (coverage and frequency) and uptake of treatment for HBV and HCV; and evaluating novel point-of-care assays and commercial serological and virological tests using dried blood-spot collection.</p> <p id="para3700">Priority research areas for NAFLD include finding a simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test capable of finding cases in a large at-risk population and investigating the most effective ways to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Research is also needed into the most effective ways of delivering health-care education and information about excessive alcohol consumption, the warning signs and risks of alcohol-related liver disease to different demographics (including young people), and the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of alcohol-related liver disease in heavy drinkers. Outcome measures of liver mortality, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer need to be accurately collected with annual reports of their frequency to determine whether any measures taken against liver disease are improving outcomes.</p> <p id="para3710">The barriers to care for people with liver diseases in Taiwan are mainly financial. The Government is currently considering a public health programme to treat most, if not all, people infected with HCV. Public awareness and education on hepatitis B and C should be strengthened.<a href="#bib425"><sup>425</sup></a> General screening for HCV and HBV infection needs further efforts. Additionally, the data on people who have already been screened for HBV infection need to be retrieved from various large databases for integration into current treatment promotion.</p> <p id="para3720">The public health delivery system in Taiwan is robust, as exemplified by the successful national hepatitis B control programme that was launched 36 years ago. Taiwan aims to exceed the targets set by WHO of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 but more efforts need to be made by the Government to reach this goal. The most urgent of them is treating patients with chronic HCV infection with direct-acting antiviral drugs.</p> <p id="para3730">Priority research areas in Taiwan include strategies to increase awareness and education on the need for screening and regular monitoring and treatment of HBV, both in the general population and physicians, and to continuously evaluate the quality and effect of HBV vaccination. Research is also needed into the natural history and evolving epidemiology of HBV in Taiwan, to ensure that vaccination programmes are not missing any new risk groups that might arise over time. For example, although waning immunity of the vaccine after 15–20 years has not yet been observed to the extent that a booster is generally recommended after this time period, the possibility that this situation might change should be monitored closely.<a href="#bib425"><sup>425</sup></a> Research is also needed for strategies to overcome geographic and social inequities in access to care.</p> <p id="para3740">In summary, the major barriers to the care of patients with liver diseases in Asia-Pacific countries with middle and high HDIs include lack of baseline epidemiological data on various liver disorders, low coverage of birth-dose HBV vaccination, lack of awareness in the general population and health-care workers about liver diseases, lack of trained health professionals, and low public health expenditure. By contrast, the major barriers to care in high-HDI countries in Asia-Pacific include geographical and social inequalities to access to care, delivering HBV vaccination to new high-risk groups, delivering care to people infected with HBV and HCV who inject drugs, and increasing awareness in the general population to adopt healthy life styles. Research priorities need to be country-specific and should focus on specific barriers.</p> </div> <div class="discussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Discussion</div> <p id="para3750">Liver diseases are increasingly recognised as a major health challenge in developing countries, especially those in the Asia-Pacific region. Although viral hepatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, the contribution of alcohol-related liver disease and NAFLD to the liver disease burden is rapidly increasing.</p> <p id="para3760">Viral hepatitis A and E are major causes of morbidity and mortality related to acute hepatitis in countries of the Asia-Pacific that have medium and high HDIs and whose populations have low access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities (see <a href="#box1">panel 1</a> for a list of priority areas for liver diseases related to viral hepatitis). Of all deaths due to acute hepatitis in the region, 89% occur in medium-HDI countries, 9% in high-HDI countries, and 2% in countries with very high HDIs (<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a> ). 95% of deaths related to acute HAV and HEV in the region occur in medium-HDI countries (<a href="#fig7">figure 7</a> ). The SDGs, as part of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, have ambitious goals in this regard. Goal 6 is to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. Goal 6.1 calls to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all, and Goal 6.2 aspires to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, as well as the end of open defecation.<a href="#bib404"><sup>404</sup></a> In the past decade, much progress has been made to increase access to drinking water and sanitation but still too many people lack access to a safe, sustainable water supply and sanitation services. </p><div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Panel 1</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

to liver diseases in almost all countries of the Asia-Pacific, although Taiwan has shown great success with HBV vaccination and reducing the burden of HBV in the past two decades. Overall, 86% of deaths related to acute HBV occur in medium-HDI countries (<a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> Of all deaths due to cirrhosis in the Asia-Pacific, 66% occur in medium-HDI countries, 30% in high-HDI countries, and 4% in countries with very high HDIs (<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> 63% of deaths due to HBV-related cirrhosis and 77% of deaths due to HCV-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries (<a href="#fig8">figure 8</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> Of all deaths due to liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific, 74% occur in high-HDI countries, 18% in medium-HDI countries, and 8% in countries with very high HDIs (<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>). 79% of those due to HBV-related liver cancer and 32% of those due to HCV-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (<a href="#fig9">figure 9</a> ).<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> Preventing transmission of HBV and HCV is entirely achievable. HBV vaccination programmes for infants have been implemented by all countries. The administration of a birth dose of the HBV vaccine is still inadequate in many countries, especially in low-income and rural settings. Implementing policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV and safe injection practices is still a challenge in many countries (eg, India and Pakistan). We strongly recommend a focus on harm reduction strategies that target people who inject drugs in all countries of the Asia-Pacific where these practices are prevalent. There has been progress in improving access to generic medications and reducing costs. The governments of many countries have put HBV and HCV drugs on their lists of essential medicines. There is an urgent need to make generic drugs available in all countries of the region and bring the costs of hepatitis C drugs to less than a dollar a day, following India's example. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 8</span></a></div>   <p>Distribution of deaths from cirrhosis due to (A) HBV infection, (B) HCV infection, (C) alcohol consumption, and (D) other causes per HDI in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p> <p>HDI=Human Development Index.</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 9</span></a></div>   <p>Distribution of deaths from liver cancer due to (A) HBV infection, (B) HCV infection, (C) alcohol consumption, and (D) other causes per HDI in the Asia-Pacific region<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a></p> <p>HDI=Human Development Index.</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="para3780">Since only a small proportion of patients with hepatitis B and C are ever diagnosed, the importance of screening and diagnostics need to be better emphasised. New approaches and tools are required for point-of-care diagnostics that are suitable for high-burden, low-resource countries. The 2018 establishment of a WHO Essential Diagnostics List<a href="#bib426"><sup>426</sup></a> is a welcome recognition of this importance. A greater focus is now needed on prequalification (ie, evaluating diagnostic tests with standardised protocols for their quality, performance, and safety to guide procurement decisions by actors such as WHO Member States or UN agencies) to ensure provision of high-quality diagnostics and clinical evidence for simplified management algorithms in settings where diagnostics are not available.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> We believe that governments should widely engage with all stakeholders, including individuals and organisations representing at-risk groups (eg, people who inject drugs, prisoners, and individuals with HIV), and also be liberal in approving and implementing new diagnostic devices.</p> <p id="para3790">International organisations have a key part in supporting national progress and they need to ensure that viral hepatitis is part of their remit, equal to other major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. Some organisations have led in this regard—notably WHO, Unitaid, and Clinton Health Access Initiative—but more can be done. There are several areas that organisations can prioritise to support viral hepatitis elimination efforts. Some are specific to viral hepatitis, for example the need to support the scale-up of birth-dose vaccination, which should be included in the remit of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for support. Several other areas can leverage existing mechanisms that support other disease responses, notably HIV, to improve access to care and treatment for patients with viral hepatitis.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> We believe that governments should be increasingly accountable and take timely measures toward national viral hepatitis elimination strategies. Adequate enforcement of policies is also needed. Funding bodies should ask for evidence of the outcomes of their investments to improve accountability. Data on progress of achieving elimination targets should be regularly reported by WHO and other funders but more attention needs to be paid to each country's performance relative to others. Countries need to develop new fiscal spaces to accelerate the elimination of viral hepatitis, which will require innovative means of financing.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> Sponsoring the scale-up of blood testing is a key challenge and sustaining progress will require not only financing but also strong political will and unrelenting advocacy.</p> <p id="para3800">In 2015, WHO issued a draft Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016–21, calling on all countries to aim to reach concrete targets towards the elimination of viral hepatitis.<a href="#bib404"><sup>404</sup></a> The policy response to viral hepatitis until now has been inadequate and considerable challenges exist, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, which bear most of the burden of viral hepatitis (<a href="#tbl3">table 3</a>). The Asia-Pacific region experiences a greater challenge from HBV and HCV infection than any other global region, having half of the 20 most heavily burdened countries.<a href="#bib427"><sup>427</sup></a> Countries in the Asia-Pacific with a high burden of viral hepatitis span the economic spectrum and there is a negative correlation between GNI and the prevalence of both HBV and HCV, with a greater burden in low-income countries.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> Countries need to define target screening populations, improve awareness among health-care workers regarding treatment options, subsidise the costs of drugs, and enhance access to them. Emulating Egypt and Georgia in managing HCV could be useful for countries in the Asia-Pacific region.<a href="#bib428">428</a>, <a href="#bib429">429</a> Infant HBV vaccination programmes have been implemented by all countries but often fall short of administering birth doses; Taiwan can be a positive example for HBV vaccination. Although policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV are in place in all countries in the Asia-Pacific region (although nucleic-acid amplification testing is not mandatory in all), as are policies on safe injection practices, the lack of strong political commitment and effective regulations in low-to-middle income countries, especially in southeast Asia, limits the outcomes. Reuse of contaminated needles continues to cause outbreaks of hepatitis B and C in southeast Asia.<a href="#bib46">46</a>, <a href="#bib398">398</a> Harm reduction strategies targeting people who inject drugs need to be implemented, as has been done in Malaysia using the "Support. Don't punish�? philosophy.<a href="#bib430"><sup>430</sup></a> The WHO's Global Health Sector Strategy<a href="#bib404"><sup>404</sup></a> on viral hepatitis called for elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 (ie, 90% reduction in incidence and 65% in mortality). Various targets have been proposed to achieve this, including three-dose coverage of hepatitis B vaccination in infancy (90%), receiving a timely birth dose (90%), blood safety (100%), injection safety (unsafe injections target of 0%), harm reduction (target for syringe and needle per person who injects drugs per year of 300), awareness of status of people infected with HBV and HCV (90%), and awareness of the status of infected people who were on HBV treatment or had started HCV treatment (80%). All countries in the Asia-Pacific should work towards achieving these targets in a time-bound manner.</p> <p id="para3810">Mortality in the Asia-Pacific region from alcohol-related cirrhosis correlates with per-capita alcohol consumption. Commensurate with an increase in mean incomes, per-capita alcohol consumption has increased in countries of the Asia-Pacific, such as China and India, which will increase their burden of alcohol-related liver disease. Overall, 65% of deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries and 80% of deaths due to alcohol-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>, <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). A systematic review<a href="#bib182"><sup>182</sup></a> reported that DALYs attributable to alcohol use have increased by more than 25% over 1990–2016 globally, driven primarily by increased consumption in south, southeast, and central Asia, in both men and women. The largest increases in exposure have been in countries in the low-middle quintile of the SDI.<a href="#bib182"><sup>182</sup></a> In 2016, alcohol use accounted for 4·0% (3·4–4·6) of age-standardised DALYs in southeast Asia.<a href="#bib182"><sup>182</sup></a> Unlike tobacco or drugs, governments have been discouraged from efforts to limit the availability of alcohol by trade agreements and disputes. Alcohol use is ranked as one of the leading risk factors, surpassing cholesterol, for total DALYs globally since 2010 compared with previous iterations of the GBD Study.<a href="#bib182"><sup>182</sup></a></p> <p id="para3820">The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be ameliorated through government policies to control consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use (<a href="#tbl4">table 4</a>). Alcohol policies can exist at the global, regional, international, national, or subnational levels. Effective alcohol strategies incorporate a multilevel, multicomponent approach, targeting multiple determinants of drinking and alcohol-related harms, such as availability, price, marketing, and criminalisation of drink-driving. We believe that these policies must be well implemented, enforced, and evaluated to be effective. We recommend that countries should develop their own capacities and set up national monitoring systems to complement national surveys and provide crucial information that allows them to evaluate alcohol policies and track alcohol consumption trends over time. Mongolia is a good example, where the President initiated the Alcohol Free Mongolia programme by advocating drinking a glass of milk instead of alcohol.<a href="#bib431"><sup>431</sup></a> SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages by 2030, and SDG 3.5 calls for strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug use and harmful alcohol consumption. Although it is difficult to control alcohol use, several countries have added additional taxes on alcohol.</p> <p id="para3830">The Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol,<a href="#bib432"><sup>432</sup></a> negotiated and agreed by WHO Member States in 2010, represents international consensus that reducing the harmful use of alcohol and its associated health and social burden is a public health priority. The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including ten recommended target areas for policy and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at the country level.<a href="#bib165"><sup>165</sup></a></p> <p id="para3840">Given the magnitude and the complexity of the problem of reducing overall alcohol consumption in communities, concerted global and regional efforts must be in place to support countries and communities to reduce their harmful use of alcohol. International coordination and collaboration can create the necessary synergies and provide increased leverage for states to implement evidence-based measures. Local, national, and international monitoring and surveillance frameworks are needed to track the magnitude and trends of alcohol consumption and related harm, as well as monitor policy responses and analyse trends in alcohol consumption and its related disease burden. Such frameworks would be crucial to strengthen advocacy, adjust policy, and programme responses to the trends in alcohol-related harms and assess the effect of interventions. The ultimate goal of monitoring and surveillance is to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and reliable information to policy makers and decision makers for the effective prioritisation, implementation, and evaluation of policy options and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. WHO's Global Information System on Alcohol and Health serves that purpose and enables these processes.<a href="#bib165"><sup>165</sup></a> The UN's 2011 Political Declaration of the High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases mandated the development of a global monitoring framework, including indicators, and a set of voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.<a href="#bib433"><sup>433</sup></a> This work yielded one voluntary target related to alcohol use: including at least a 10% relative reduction, as appropriate within the national context, in the harmful use of alcohol by 2025.</p> <p id="para3850">Obesity and NAFLD, although traditionally thought of as diseases of high-income countries, are increasingly recognised and have become epidemic in all countries of the Asia-Pacific region, irrespective of income status. Overall, 68% of deaths in Asia-Pacific due to NAFLD-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries, and 74% of deaths due to NAFLD-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>, <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>). Changing lifestyles and diet have contributed to the obesity and NAFLD epidemic in the Asia-Pacific. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prevalence, incidence, and outcome of NAFLD disease in Asia found that even in people without obesity, the prevalence of NAFLD was 11·76%.<a href="#bib240"><sup>240</sup></a> A 2018 study suggested that so-called lean patients with NAFLD are more likely to develop progressive liver disease and die from causes related to liver disease than those with obesity-associated NAFLD, indicating that NAFLD is not a benign condition.<a href="#bib434"><sup>434</sup></a> Therefore, when a patient without obesity has abnormal anthropometric and laboratory measurements, and as the environment in Asia-Pacific continues to change, such awareness might become even more prudent.<a href="#bib240"><sup>240</sup></a> The prevalence of NAFLD in the Asia-Pacific is following similar trends to the prevalence reported in high-income countries, indicating that NAFLD is a global disease warranting the attention of primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers (<a href="#box2">panel 2</a> ). The high frequency of metabolic comorbidities in patients with NAFLD indicates that management of the increasing number of these patients might increase the strain on health systems. Furthermore, many patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver disease, which creates challenges for screening.<a href="#bib240"><sup>240</sup></a></p><div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Panel 2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

or obesity by increasing physical activity in schools and offices and regulating the food industry (eg, restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, increasing taxation on unhealthy foods and beverages, labelling food with nutritional information and health facts, regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods, and promoting healthy foods; <a href="#tbl5">table 5</a>). SDG 3.4 calls to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third through prevention and treatment by 2030. The 2011 UN high-level political declaration on non-communicable diseases<a href="#bib433"><sup>433</sup></a> included two voluntary targets potentially related to NAFLD, a 10% relative reduction, as appropriate nationally, in prevalence of insufficient physical activity and halting the increase of diabetes and obesity by 2025. Actions and interventions against NAFLD need to be urgently incorporated into WHO's Global Action Plan on non-communicable diseases,<a href="#bib435"><sup>435</sup></a> including public awareness (under Objective 1 of the Plan); screening for NAFLD; using simple, non-invasive biochemical markers to detect fibrosis in patients with NAFLD; early detection and weight management strategies including lifestyle modifications (dietary and physical activity); and interventions to prevent progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p> <p id="para3870">The primary responsibility to prevent and control obesity and NAFLD lies with governments, although the engagement of all sectors of society, international collaboration, and cooperation are essential for success. Effective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (including NAFLD) require leadership, coordinated multistakeholder engagement, and multisectoral action for health, both at the government level and at actor level. Such efforts would include health-in-all-policies and whole-of-government approaches across sectors such as health, agriculture, communication, education, employment, energy, environment, finance, food, foreign affairs, housing, justice and security, legislature, social welfare, social and economic development, sports, tax and revenue, trade and industry, transport, urban planning, and youth affairs, and partnership with relevant civil society and private sector entities. Opportunities to prevent and control NAFLD and its risk factors occur at multiple stages of life and interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention. People and communities should be empowered and involved in activities for prevention and control, including advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, education and training, monitoring, and research and evaluation of the effects of measures for the control and prevention of NAFLD. We believe that prevention is always better than cure; now is the time to push for prevention of NAFLD before its burden becomes overwhelming.</p> <p id="para3880">Other aspects that need urgent attention are inadequate infrastructure and facilities for liver transplantation and health-care personnel poorly trained in the management of liver diseases, including preventive aspects, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. The focus must be on early detection of liver diseases with timely referral and access to appropriate care by trained multidisciplinary teams. In this regard, SDG 3.9c calls to substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training, and retention of the health workforce in developing countries.</p> <p id="para3890">Access to health insurance, affordable health care, and affordable essential medicines are also important issues in low-and-middle-income countries in the Asia-Pacific. SDG 3.8 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including protection from financial risk, access to good-quality, essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, good-quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all by 2030. SDG 3.9b calls for the provision of access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health,<a href="#bib436"><sup>436</sup></a> which affirms the right of developing countries to fully use the provisions of the TRIPS agreement to provide access to medicines for all by 2030. To this end, health-financing systems should not only seek to raise sufficient funds for health provision but should also do so in a way that allows people to use services without risk of severe financial hardship or impoverishment.<a href="#bib437"><sup>437</sup></a> Three interrelated areas could bring health financing closer to universal health coverage: raising funds for health, reducing financial barriers to health-care access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds instead of direct out-of-pocket payments, and allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Public health systems and public–private partnerships need to be strengthened to face the challenges that an increasing burden of liver diseases could create, and measuring progress is an inherent part of any prevention and treatment strategy. We suggest a set of metrics to monitor the implementation of the various aspects of such a strategy (<a href="#tbl6">table 6</a> ). <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="tbl6"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 6</span> </div></p><p>Suggested metrics by target area to improve prevention, treatment, and care for patients with liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region</p>  <table frame="hsides" rules="groups"> <thead> <tr> <th /> <th align="left"><b>Metrics</b></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td colspan="2" align="left"><b>Viral hepatitis</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="left">Improve coverage of hepatitis B immunisation, including a timely birth dose</td> <td align="left">Hepatitis B birth-dose vaccination (% coverage);

Nevertheless, even when there is strong leadership and political will, the availability of finances, application of funds, and health-system capabilities will determine the magnitude and speed of the response. At the country level, public financing for health (as for any sector) is determined by the fiscal space available to the government. The fiscal space depends on the sources of finance available from improved economic growth that creates favourable macroeconomic conditions, such as revenues generated from new taxation or strengthened tax administration, borrowing from domestic and international sources, reprioritisation of health within the existing government budget, more effective and efficient allocation of available health resources, and innovative domestic and international financing.<a href="#bib438"><sup>438</sup></a></p> <p id="para3910">The high-level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems was set up in 2008.<a href="#bib439"><sup>439</sup></a> It recommended the creation of a common funding platform to strengthen health systems across the three global-scale innovative financing mechanisms—ie, the Global Fund, Gavi, and the World Bank. These innovative financing mechanisms link different elements of the financing value chain to mobilise funding from multiple sources (eg, governments, foundations, and the private sector), pool finances, and channel and allocate funds to health programmes through organisations and governments in low-income and middle-income countries. Outsourcing of services, such as diagnostic tests or management systems for health-care data, to non-government providers and encouraging the use of advanced market commitments (eg, vaccine purchases) can also be used to secure investment in health-care services from the private sector.<a href="#bib439"><sup>439</sup></a> The opportunity to link revenue generation to a global redistributive and environmental agenda should be sought via taxes on carbon, luxury items, or capital flow, and leveraging an increased domestic return on the natural resources and primary commodities of poor countries.<a href="#bib440"><sup>440</sup></a> Other financing mechanisms including global health bonds, debt-conversion instruments, market commitment instruments, social and development impact bonds, and global solidarity taxes and levies need to be invoked. Opportunity can be seized in the current political momentum within the G20 countries that is in favour of increased levies on currency transactions and additional financial transaction taxes that could be used to regulate the global financial system.<a href="#bib440"><sup>440</sup></a></p> <p id="para3920">The agenda of expanding the domestic resource base of low-income countries is also important for generating finances for health-care programmes. Many low-income countries could increase domestic public finance by reducing capital flight, promoting more effective tax policy, and improving their tax collection systems. Such an agenda would have the added benefit of focusing attention on the broad challenges of economic development and improving democratic and accountable governance. High-income countries should adhere to their responsibility to allocate 0·7% of their GNI to development aid. Principles and mechanisms need to be established for a systematic transfer of resources from high-income to low-income countries.<a href="#bib440"><sup>440</sup></a></p> <p id="para3930">There are some limitations to our analysis. First is the paucity and patchiness of data on liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. We did not include any countries with low HDI and thus our analysis is not wholly representative. Second, the tools for collecting, analysing, and reporting data in different countries are not homogenous. Therefore, it is possible that there are additional demands and concerns about staffing and financing needs and the requirements and timelines to reduce the burden of liver diseases. Despite these limitations, the Commission defines the unmet gaps and lays the foundation for collective thinking to eliminate viral hepatitis and control other liver disaeses, including NAFLD and alcohol-related disease, in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.</p> <p id="para3940">In summary, this Commission provides an insight into the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region and identifies potential causes of change in their underlying epidemiology and aetiology. Although viral hepatitis (both acute and chronic) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality related to liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region, efforts towards its elimination as a public health threat by 2030 should reduce this burden. Nevertheless, mortality from alcohol-related liver diseases remains high in mostly non-Muslim countries, especially China and India, and is expected to increase. Similarly, obesity and NAFLD-related liver diseases are common in all countries, irrespective of HDI, and are also expected to increase. We hope that the Commission provides an opportunity for countries to learn from each other to tackle the changing landscape of the burden of liver disease in the Asia-Pacific region and to achieve the targets set by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p> <p id="para3950"> </p><div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p id="para3960">For <b>e-Stat</b> see <a href="https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en">https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en</a></p> </div> <p /> <p id="para3961"> </p><div class="boxed-text" tagx="boxed-text" title="boxed-text"> <p id="para3965"><b>This online publication has been corrected.
