Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused more than half of the deaths due to cirrhosis in the region, followed by alcohol consumption (20&#x000b7;8%), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; 12&#x000b7;1%), and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV; 15&#x000b7;7%). In 2015, HBV accounted for about half the cases of hepatocellular carcinoma in the region. Preventive strategies for viral hepatitis-related liver disease include increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation. HBV vaccination programmes for neonates have been implemented by all countries, although birth-dose coverage is extremely suboptimal in some. Availability of screening tests for blood and tissue, donor recall policies, and harm reduction strategies are in their initial stages in most countries. Many governments have put HBV and HCV drugs on their essential medicines lists and the availability of generic versions of these drugs has reduced costs. Efforts to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat, together with the rapid increase in per-capita alcohol consumption in countries and the epidemic of obesity, are expected to change the spectrum of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region in the near future. The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be contained through government policies to limit consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use, which are in place in some countries but need to be enforced more strictly. Steps are needed to control obesity and NAFLD, including policies to promote healthy lifestyles and regulate the food industry. Inadequate infrastructure and insufficient health-care personnel trained in liver diseases are issues that also need to be addressed in the Asia-Pacific region. The policy response of most governments to liver diseases has thus far been inadequate and poorly funded. There must be a renewed focus on prevention, early detection, timely referral, and research into the best means to introduce and improve health interventions to reduce the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="cesec10"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para1490">According to the third round of WHO's 2015 Global Health Estimates (GHE),<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> liver diseases caused 1&#x02008;312&#x02008;480 (4&#x000b7;6%) of 28&#x02008;444&#x02008;814 deaths in the Asia-Pacific region in 2015, compared with 72&#x02008;437 (2&#x000b7;7%) of 2&#x02008;649&#x02008;742 in the USA and 197&#x02008;179 (2&#x000b7;1%) of 9&#x02008;278&#x02008;557 in Europe.

Thus, to maximise our scope by including territories at various stages of development, we divided countries according to their Human Development Index (HDI), selecting the top five most populous countries in the medium-to-high HDI category (China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh) and the top five in the very high HDI category (Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>

Security concerns and visa delays make frequent travel by international teams difficult, and the reliance on international experts interrupts continuity of care. Thus, the presence of efficient local transplant teams is crucial to develop successful and sustainable transplantation programmes. Until February, 2017, only 539 liver transplantations had been done in Pakistan, and approximately 95% of these were done in the two locally run centres. A liver transplant from a living donor in Pakistan costs $35&#x02008;000&#x02013;45&#x02008;000. Most patients are self-funded, and financial restrictions are one of the biggest hurdles to accessibility. The Human Organ and Transplantation Authority regulates legal and ethical aspects of liver transplantation in Pakistan, but its decentralisation with the 18th amendment of Pakistan's Constitution has moved various ministries, including the Ministry of Health, from central to provincial control.<xref rid="bib358" ref-type="bibr"><sup>358</sup></xref> Those changes have given rise to five autonomous provincial bodies that regulate transplant activity, allowing for a stringent legal and regulatory process at the provincial level. Simultaneously, the current decentralised approach challenges the implementation of a future national transplant registry that might monitor transplantation activity and outcomes countrywide. The Government will have to consider innovative ideas including private&#x02013;public sector partnerships and proper incentivisation of skilled medical personnel to make liver transplantation available in poor settings in Pakistan. The implementation of a national transplant registry is inevitable to ensure transparency in various steps of organ donation and outcome reporting while providing transplant services of international credibility.</p><p id="para3170">A 2015 WHO report stated that there are 64&#x02008;434 registered doctors, 6034 dentists, 30&#x02008;516 nurses, and 27&#x02008;000 nurse-midwives in Bangladesh.<xref rid="bib359" ref-type="bibr"><sup>359</sup></xref> Additionally, the health workforce is skewed towards doctors, with a triple ratio of doctors to nurses to technologists of 1:0&#x000b7;4:0&#x000b7;24, by stark contrast with the WHO recommended ratio of 1:3:5.

Electronic media could be used to raise public awareness of viral hepatitis and to encourage patients to get screened and treated.</p><p id="para3480">It is important to establish an integrated hepatitis surveillance and response system in Pakistan, with multiple sites across the country that provide laboratory testing for diagnosis and treatment. A publicly funded programme for HBV and HCV treatment is already established. Sofosbuvir and its generic versions are registered by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan; it is cheap but is entirely covered by patients' out-of-pocket expenses. Generic versions of daclatasvir are in their registration phase. Harm reduction strategies need to be implemented to provide treatment to users of injectable drugs, particularly in prisons. The Ministry of Health should consider early approval of hepatitis C medications already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, monitoring the bioequivalence of generic drugs, and assessing the economic burden of hepatitis care, which is currently not being done. There is an urgent need for accurate epidemiological data assessing viral and other liver diseases. Developing strategies and studying their effect on prevention and treatment outcomes is another priority area of research. Research into ways to improve birth-dose HBV vaccination coverage is urgently required. Various modalities for training of the existing workforce in care of patients with liver diseases (on-site training, online training, teleconferencing, etc) also need to be investigated.</p><p id="para3490">In Bangladesh, the prospect of achieving WHO's Global Health Sector Strategy on Eliminating Viral Hepatitis<xref rid="bib404" ref-type="bibr"><sup>404</sup></xref> seems achievable and the Government has made it into an official priority. The Government is considering birth-dose and catch-up vaccination and vaccination of vulnerable groups against HBV, screening of at-risk groups such as pregnant women, and promoting access to health care by improving laboratory and imaging facilities in district-level government hospitals. Free treatment of individuals infected with HBV and HCV is pending pilot implementation and eventually expanded nationwide.</p><p id="para3500">Although the cost of antiviral drugs has been reduced considerably in Bangladesh, the costs of diagnostic medical examinations are still extremely high. Additionally, patients are not sufficiently encouraged to get screened for hepatitis and to receive therapy. Awareness of hepatitis is increasing in urban areas, but rural areas are lagging in this respect. A study has shown that HBV DNA is prevalent in HBsAg-negative blood.<xref rid="bib405" ref-type="bibr"><sup>405</sup></xref> Thus, the quality assurance of HBsAg testing kits and safety of HBsAg-negative blood, which has not been tested for anti-HBc or nucleic acids, needs Government attention. It might not be practical to test blood samples with nucleic-acid amplification as a preventive measure; however, testing for anti-HBc could be accommodated in Bangladesh to prevent HBV transmission through blood transfusion.</p><p id="para3510">There have been substantial advances in research on liver diseases in Bangladesh and several epidemiological studies have been published in the past two decades.<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>, <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>, <xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>, <xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>, <xref rid="bib154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>, <xref rid="bib155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>, <xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>, <xref rid="bib218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>, <xref rid="bib219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>, <xref rid="bib220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>, <xref rid="bib223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>, <xref rid="bib406" ref-type="bibr">406</xref>, <xref rid="bib407" ref-type="bibr">407</xref>, <xref rid="bib408" ref-type="bibr">408</xref> Still, baseline data on incidence, prevalence, risk factors, natural history, and the changing epidemiology of various causes of liver diseases need to be generated. Studies are needed to develop cheap, accessible, point-of-care testing for HBV and HCV, and on preventive measures and new drug treatments for NAFLD. Research to improve coverage of HBV vaccination for high-risk groups, particularly preventing HBV transmission from mother to baby, is needed. Strategies should be developed to improve general awareness about liver disease among the public and medical staff and training of existing health-care workers on managing liver diseases.</p><p id="para3520">In Japan, as the prevalence of viral hepatitis decreases, cases of NASH and NAFLD are increasing. It is currently impossible to estimate how long this increase will continue and what preventive measures would be effective. Efforts to tackle NAFLD centre on the Government's extensive focus on obesity prevention and hepatocellular carcinoma through screening programmes and advances in treatment. Japan has a budget of $400 billion per year for overall health-care expenditure, accounting for 38&#x000b7;8% of the national governmental budget. Research must focus on the pathogenesis and treatment of NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and liver fibrosis, and on effective ways of delivering health-care education and information on prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Effective models of community-based care for patients with liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, need to be investigated. Also, developing novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma are major unmet needs. Research is needed into strategies to tackle increasing health costs and improve health equity.</p><p id="para3530">In South Korea, HBV represents a major medical burden. According to a survey of 3000 people done by the Korea Association Study of Liver Disease (KASL), approximately half of the respondents (45&#x000b7;4%), aged between 15 and 69 years, had not had a HBsAg test or did not know whether they had had the test. Additionally, although antiviral therapy has been well supported by the national insurance reimbursement policy, there is still a gap between the HBV management guidelines proposed by KASL and government policy. Although screening tests for HBV infection are done for women who are preparing for pregnancy, army recruits, adults aged 40 years and older, and groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, a continuous management programme after HBV diagnosis requires further consideration, and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of screening adults older than 40 years must be re-evaluated.</p><p id="para3540">There is currently no screening programme for HCV in South Korea. One-off HCV screening and treatment of people aged 40&#x02013;70 years is likely to be very cost-effective compared with the current practice of no screening.<xref rid="bib409" ref-type="bibr"><sup>409</sup></xref> Importantly, to reduce the incidence of HCV-related end-stage liver-related complications and mortality, a national screening programme should include a national health policy aimed at managing HCV in the South Korean population.</p><p id="para3550">According to a survey done by KASL in 2013 (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 79% of respondents who visited tertiary hospitals due to alcohol-related liver disease had not had the chance to join an abstinence programme or receive consultation from a psychologist. Only 3% of patients with alcohol-related liver disease had received specialised rehabilitation, which assists patients with returning to a normal social life. Hospital visits and treatments are mainly dependent on the will of the patient. Priority areas for addressing the burden of alcohol-related liver diseases in South Korea include research into helping people to adopt healthy lifestyles (ie, avoiding alcohol consumption, early detection of alcohol overuse and alcohol-related liver disease), effective strategies in helping people with alcohol-related liver disease to stop their alcohol consumption, and new therapeutic targets for alcohol-related liver diseases including severe hepatitis.</p><p id="para3560">According to KNHANES 2009&#x02013;13,<xref rid="bib410" ref-type="bibr">410</xref>, <xref rid="bib411" ref-type="bibr">411</xref> the number of people participating in intense physical activity is decreasing in South Korea, whereas caloric intake and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome is increasing. According to the 2013 KASL survey (Won H W, Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, personal communication), 40% of respondents did not exercise even for 1 h per week, despite recognising that regular exercise is helpful for NAFLD management. Another issue is that national insurance does not support education programmes for optimal food intake and exercise, although lifestyle modification is the basis of NAFLD management. In many cases, doctors give patients who visit hospital general lifestyle modification recommendations, rather than specific guidelines. Priority areas for action for NAFLD in South Korea include research into noninvasive markers of NASH and fibrosis in NAFLD and on new therapies, ways to motivate people of all ages to adopt healthy lifestyles, and the pathological mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with NAFLD.</p><p id="para3570">The Korean Government started a national hepatocellular carcinoma examination project in 2003.<xref rid="bib412" ref-type="bibr"><sup>412</sup></xref> The following factors need to be considered to improve the project: the target population; proper classification of hepatocellular carcinoma, as the International Classification of Diseases-10 code is inaccurate and does not provide appropriate guidelines on alcohol intake; and supportive hospital care programmes. Finally, lifestyle modifications for healthy bodyweight must be emphasised in the general population to prevent NAFLD.</p><p id="para3580">Although support for research into liver diseases has increased substantially, it is still insufficient. Research priorities for liver diseases in South Korea include identifying barriers and facilitators, and developing strategies to increase awareness and education in the general population and physicians, for HBV and HCV testing and uptake of treatment, particularly in high-risk groups. A simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test for NASH and strategies to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles are needed. Promoting awareness and education about alcohol misuse and evaluating successes and errors of abstinence and rehabilitation programmes for patients with alcohol-related liver disease is also necessary. An accurate risk model that incorporates newly identified risk factors and biomarkers must be developed for primary care providers. Additionally, research into the development of a simple and organised surveillance system for groups at high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma would facilitate making health care for these patients efficient and cost-effective.</p><p id="para3590">Australia and New Zealand are multicultural countries, which turns diagnosing and treating people with hepatitis infection into a major challenge. The principal barrier to expanding patient coverage is that refugees and asylum seekers living with chronic hepatitis B have many other priorities, such as reuniting with their families and establishing a life in Australia and New Zealand, that are more important to them than health-seeking behaviours.<xref rid="bib396" ref-type="bibr"><sup>396</sup></xref> Multiple other challenges include language and cultural differences and little disease-specific knowledge.<xref rid="bib413" ref-type="bibr"><sup>413</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3600">Australia and New Zealand have low population densities, vast stretches of uninhabited land, and several urban centres distributed sparsely along the coast.

</p><p id="para3620">There is also insufficient knowledge among health professionals of risk factors for the presence and progression of liver disease and the effect of liver disease on health and life expectancy. Waiting times for specialised liver centres are long, so patients cannot access services in a timely manner. The inability of primary care physicians to provide effective guidance and the lack of a management toolbox for primary care might also lead to their reduced interest in early intervention.</p><p id="para3630">Another impediment to controlling hepatitis B and C is late notification of hepatitis, defined as late hepatitis diagnosis, which is mainly associated with old age. Late notification increases the risk of decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid="bib421" ref-type="bibr"><sup>421</sup></xref> Further, there is cultural resistance in migrant populations to accepting dietary and health advice from health service providers.<xref rid="bib422" ref-type="bibr"><sup>422</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3640">The price of drug treatment and medical services that are not supported by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme represents another barrier to tackling the burden of liver disease&#x02014;eg, new obesity drugs such as naltrexone&#x02013;bupropion. Policy makers need to recognise that liver diseases are chronic diseases and to establish nurse-led community-based models of care. Finally, enhancing funding for medical research to identify novel therapeutic targets for treating specific liver diseases, such as alcohol-related liver disease, NASH, and hepatitis B, and for implementation research is crucial.</p><p id="para3650">The focus of HBV and HCV research in Australia and New Zealand should be on preventing transmission in people who inject drugs, including: evaluating novel methods to improve population estimates of injected drug use and hepatitis infections; evaluating implementation, effectiveness, and scale-up of existing prevention interventions for this population; identifying barriers and facilitators associated with HBV and HCV testing at the levels of the patient, provider, and health-care system; evaluating novel, point-of-care assays for HBV and HCV testing and treatment uptake that are highly sensitive and specific, simple, quick, and cheap; and evaluating the scale-up of strategies for improving the linkage to care for patients newly diagnosed with HBV and HCV.</p><p id="para3660">New and effective therapies for patients with NAFLD and liver fibrosis need to be developed. An unmet clinical need is the identification of novel therapeutic targets for hepatitis B and liver cancer. Australia will also need to invest in research on liver diseases that are particularly common, including prevalence and risk factors, natural history, and effective methods for control and treatment. Further, there is a great need and potential for implementation research to improve the coverage and effectiveness of various interventions for liver diseases. Research needs to especially focus on Indigenous populations regarding prevention, treatment, models for engagement, and service delivery for various liver disorders.</p><p id="para3670">In Singapore, identifying cases of hepatitis B and C is the biggest barrier to appropriate management of patients and control HBV and HCV infection. For hepatitis B, family screening is recommended under Singapore's hepatitis B guidelines. Once people are identified as having viral hepatitis, referring them to receive medical care might be difficult. Barriers to follow-up include insufficient reminders to patients, lack of physician time, cost of tests and treatment, and blood taking. In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who were offered health screening in 2003, 67% were not found to be followed up regularly.<xref rid="bib423" ref-type="bibr"><sup>423</sup></xref> In a follow-up study, the barriers to regular follow-up included lack of education of the patient on the implications of not being followed up, cost of follow-up, blood taking, and lack of time.<xref rid="bib424" ref-type="bibr"><sup>424</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3680">Regarding the management of non-viral hepatitis liver disease in Singapore, a strategy to target high-risk groups, particularly those with diabetes and those who are obese, would be the first step. Lifestyle interventions can be challenging to implement but much can be done by the Government to maximise disease control by introducing health-promoting public policies, infrastrucutre changes to facilitate healthy choices for living, working, studying, and recreation, and collaborative public&#x02013;private partnerships. Alcohol-related liver disease represents an area that has not been addressed extensively, and expertise of medical staff around alcohol management, addiction behaviour, and support facilities needs improvement. Such improvement strategies might include developing multidisciplinary teams of psychiatrists, counsellors, psychologists, nurses, and social workers to provide individual, group, and family therapy; increasing addiction awareness in the community; and training for health-care and social service professionals and promoting addiction on research.</p><p id="para3690">Research priorities for liver diseases in Singapore include: identifying barriers and facilitators associated with HBV and HCV testing and linkage to care and treatment; evaluating strategies that might be helpful in increasing testing (coverage and frequency) and uptake of treatment for HBV and HCV; and evaluating novel point-of-care assays and commercial serological and virological tests using dried blood-spot collection.</p><p id="para3700">Priority research areas for NAFLD include finding a simple, accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive test capable of finding cases in a large at-risk population and investigating the most effective ways to help people to adopt healthy lifestyles for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Research is also needed into the most effective ways of delivering health-care education and information about excessive alcohol consumption, the warning signs and risks of alcohol-related liver disease to different demographics (including young people), and the most effective strategies to reduce the risk of alcohol-related liver disease in heavy drinkers. Outcome measures of liver mortality, liver cirrhosis, and liver cancer need to be accurately collected with annual reports of their frequency to determine whether any measures taken against liver disease are improving outcomes.</p><p id="para3710">The barriers to care for people with liver diseases in Taiwan are mainly financial. The Government is currently considering a public health programme to treat most, if not all, people infected with HCV. Public awareness and education on hepatitis B and C should be strengthened.<xref rid="bib425" ref-type="bibr"><sup>425</sup></xref> General screening for HCV and HBV infection needs further efforts. Additionally, the data on people who have already been screened for HBV infection need to be retrieved from various large databases for integration into current treatment promotion.</p><p id="para3720">The public health delivery system in Taiwan is robust, as exemplified by the successful national hepatitis B control programme that was launched 36 years ago. Taiwan aims to exceed the targets set by WHO of eliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 but more efforts need to be made by the Government to reach this goal. The most urgent of them is treating patients with chronic HCV infection with direct-acting antiviral drugs.</p><p id="para3730">Priority research areas in Taiwan include strategies to increase awareness and education on the need for screening and regular monitoring and treatment of HBV, both in the general population and physicians, and to continuously evaluate the quality and effect of HBV vaccination. Research is also needed into the natural history and evolving epidemiology of HBV in Taiwan, to ensure that vaccination programmes are not missing any new risk groups that might arise over time. For example, although waning immunity of the vaccine after 15&#x02013;20 years has not yet been observed to the extent that a booster is generally recommended after this time period, the possibility that this situation might change should be monitored closely.<xref rid="bib425" ref-type="bibr"><sup>425</sup></xref> Research is also needed for strategies to overcome geographic and social inequities in access to care.</p><p id="para3740">In summary, the major barriers to the care of patients with liver diseases in Asia-Pacific countries with middle and high HDIs include lack of baseline epidemiological data on various liver disorders, low coverage of birth-dose HBV vaccination, lack of awareness in the general population and health-care workers about liver diseases, lack of trained health professionals, and low public health expenditure. By contrast, the major barriers to care in high-HDI countries in Asia-Pacific include geographical and social inequalities to access to care, delivering HBV vaccination to new high-risk groups, delivering care to people infected with HBV and HCV who inject drugs, and increasing awareness in the general population to adopt healthy life styles.

The administration of a birth dose of the HBV vaccine is still inadequate in many countries, especially in low-income and rural settings. Implementing policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV and safe injection practices is still a challenge in many countries (eg, India and Pakistan). We strongly recommend a focus on harm reduction strategies that target people who inject drugs in all countries of the Asia-Pacific where these practices are prevalent. There has been progress in improving access to generic medications and reducing costs. The governments of many countries have put HBV and HCV drugs on their lists of essential medicines. There is an urgent need to make generic drugs available in all countries of the region and bring the costs of hepatitis C drugs to less than a dollar a day, following India's example.<fig id="fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Distribution of deaths from cirrhosis due to (A) HBV infection, (B) HCV infection, (C) alcohol consumption, and (D) other causes per HDI in the Asia-Pacific region<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>HDI=Human Development Index.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr8_lrg"/></fig><fig id="fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Distribution of deaths from liver cancer due to (A) HBV infection, (B) HCV infection, (C) alcohol consumption, and (D) other causes per HDI in the Asia-Pacific region<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref></p><p>HDI=Human Development Index.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr9_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="para3780">Since only a small proportion of patients with hepatitis B and C are ever diagnosed, the importance of screening and diagnostics need to be better emphasised. New approaches and tools are required for point-of-care diagnostics that are suitable for high-burden, low-resource countries. The 2018 establishment of a WHO Essential Diagnostics List<xref rid="bib426" ref-type="bibr"><sup>426</sup></xref> is a welcome recognition of this importance. A greater focus is now needed on prequalification (ie, evaluating diagnostic tests with standardised protocols for their quality, performance, and safety to guide procurement decisions by actors such as WHO Member States or UN agencies) to ensure provision of high-quality diagnostics and clinical evidence for simplified management algorithms in settings where diagnostics are not available.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> We believe that governments should widely engage with all stakeholders, including individuals and organisations representing at-risk groups (eg, people who inject drugs, prisoners, and individuals with HIV), and also be liberal in approving and implementing new diagnostic devices.</p><p id="para3790">International organisations have a key part in supporting national progress and they need to ensure that viral hepatitis is part of their remit, equal to other major infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV. Some organisations have led in this regard&#x02014;notably WHO, Unitaid, and Clinton Health Access Initiative&#x02014;but more can be done. There are several areas that organisations can prioritise to support viral hepatitis elimination efforts. Some are specific to viral hepatitis, for example the need to support the scale-up of birth-dose vaccination, which should be included in the remit of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for support. Several other areas can leverage existing mechanisms that support other disease responses, notably HIV, to improve access to care and treatment for patients with viral hepatitis.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> We believe that governments should be increasingly accountable and take timely measures toward national viral hepatitis elimination strategies. Adequate enforcement of policies is also needed. Funding bodies should ask for evidence of the outcomes of their investments to improve accountability. Data on progress of achieving elimination targets should be regularly reported by WHO and other funders but more attention needs to be paid to each country's performance relative to others. Countries need to develop new fiscal spaces to accelerate the elimination of viral hepatitis, which will require innovative means of financing.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Sponsoring the scale-up of blood testing is a key challenge and sustaining progress will require not only financing but also strong political will and unrelenting advocacy.</p><p id="para3800">In 2015, WHO issued a draft Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016&#x02013;21, calling on all countries to aim to reach concrete targets towards the elimination of viral hepatitis.<xref rid="bib404" ref-type="bibr"><sup>404</sup></xref> The policy response to viral hepatitis until now has been inadequate and considerable challenges exist, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, which bear most of the burden of viral hepatitis (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). The Asia-Pacific region experiences a greater challenge from HBV and HCV infection than any other global region, having half of the 20 most heavily burdened countries.<xref rid="bib427" ref-type="bibr"><sup>427</sup></xref> Countries in the Asia-Pacific with a high burden of viral hepatitis span the economic spectrum and there is a negative correlation between GNI and the prevalence of both HBV and HCV, with a greater burden in low-income countries.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Countries need to define target screening populations, improve awareness among health-care workers regarding treatment options, subsidise the costs of drugs, and enhance access to them.

Although policies on mandatory screening of blood and blood products for HBV and HCV are in place in all countries in the Asia-Pacific region (although nucleic-acid amplification testing is not mandatory in all), as are policies on safe injection practices, the lack of strong political commitment and effective regulations in low-to-middle income countries, especially in southeast Asia, limits the outcomes. Reuse of contaminated needles continues to cause outbreaks of hepatitis B and C in southeast Asia.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="bib398" ref-type="bibr">398</xref> Harm reduction strategies targeting people who inject drugs need to be implemented, as has been done in Malaysia using the &#x0201c;Support.

Various targets have been proposed to achieve this, including three-dose coverage of hepatitis B vaccination in infancy (90%), receiving a timely birth dose (90%), blood safety (100%), injection safety (unsafe injections target of 0%), harm reduction (target for syringe and needle per person who injects drugs per year of 300), awareness of status of people infected with HBV and HCV (90%), and awareness of the status of infected people who were on HBV treatment or had started HCV treatment (80%). All countries in the Asia-Pacific should work towards achieving these targets in a time-bound manner.</p><p id="para3810">Mortality in the Asia-Pacific region from alcohol-related cirrhosis correlates with per-capita alcohol consumption. Commensurate with an increase in mean incomes, per-capita alcohol consumption has increased in countries of the Asia-Pacific, such as China and India, which will increase their burden of alcohol-related liver disease. Overall, 65% of deaths due to alcohol-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries and 80% of deaths due to alcohol-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). A systematic review<xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr"><sup>182</sup></xref> reported that DALYs attributable to alcohol use have increased by more than 25% over 1990&#x02013;2016 globally, driven primarily by increased consumption in south, southeast, and central Asia, in both men and women. The largest increases in exposure have been in countries in the low-middle quintile of the SDI.<xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr"><sup>182</sup></xref> In 2016, alcohol use accounted for 4&#x000b7;0% (3&#x000b7;4&#x02013;4&#x000b7;6) of age-standardised DALYs in southeast Asia.<xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr"><sup>182</sup></xref> Unlike tobacco or drugs, governments have been discouraged from efforts to limit the availability of alcohol by trade agreements and disputes. Alcohol use is ranked as one of the leading risk factors, surpassing cholesterol, for total DALYs globally since 2010 compared with previous iterations of the GBD Study.<xref rid="bib182" ref-type="bibr"><sup>182</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3820">The increasing burden of alcohol-related liver diseases can be ameliorated through government policies to control consumption and promote less harmful patterns of alcohol use (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). Alcohol policies can exist at the global, regional, international, national, or subnational levels. Effective alcohol strategies incorporate a multilevel, multicomponent approach, targeting multiple determinants of drinking and alcohol-related harms, such as availability, price, marketing, and criminalisation of drink-driving. We believe that these policies must be well implemented, enforced, and evaluated to be effective. We recommend that countries should develop their own capacities and set up national monitoring systems to complement national surveys and provide crucial information that allows them to evaluate alcohol policies and track alcohol consumption trends over time. Mongolia is a good example, where the President initiated the Alcohol Free Mongolia programme by advocating drinking a glass of milk instead of alcohol.<xref rid="bib431" ref-type="bibr"><sup>431</sup></xref> SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages by 2030, and SDG 3.5 calls for strengthening the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug use and harmful alcohol consumption.

The strategy provides guidance for action at all levels, including ten recommended target areas for policy and interventions for national action to reduce the harmful use of alcohol, and the main components for global action to support and complement activities at the country level.<xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr"><sup>165</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3840">Given the magnitude and the complexity of the problem of reducing overall alcohol consumption in communities, concerted global and regional efforts must be in place to support countries and communities to reduce their harmful use of alcohol. International coordination and collaboration can create the necessary synergies and provide increased leverage for states to implement evidence-based measures. Local, national, and international monitoring and surveillance frameworks are needed to track the magnitude and trends of alcohol consumption and related harm, as well as monitor policy responses and analyse trends in alcohol consumption and its related disease burden. Such frameworks would be crucial to strengthen advocacy, adjust policy, and programme responses to the trends in alcohol-related harms and assess the effect of interventions. The ultimate goal of monitoring and surveillance is to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and reliable information to policy makers and decision makers for the effective prioritisation, implementation, and evaluation of policy options and interventions to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. WHO's Global Information System on Alcohol and Health serves that purpose and enables these processes.<xref rid="bib165" ref-type="bibr"><sup>165</sup></xref> The UN's 2011 Political Declaration of the High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases mandated the development of a global monitoring framework, including indicators, and a set of voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.<xref rid="bib433" ref-type="bibr"><sup>433</sup></xref> This work yielded one voluntary target related to alcohol use: including at least a 10% relative reduction, as appropriate within the national context, in the harmful use of alcohol by 2025.</p><p id="para3850">Obesity and NAFLD, although traditionally thought of as diseases of high-income countries, are increasingly recognised and have become epidemic in all countries of the Asia-Pacific region, irrespective of income status. Overall, 68% of deaths in Asia-Pacific due to NAFLD-related cirrhosis occur in medium-HDI countries, and 74% of deaths due to NAFLD-related liver cancer occur in high-HDI countries (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Changing lifestyles and diet have contributed to the obesity and NAFLD epidemic in the Asia-Pacific. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the prevalence, incidence, and outcome of NAFLD disease in Asia found that even in people without obesity, the prevalence of NAFLD was 11&#x000b7;76%.<xref rid="bib240" ref-type="bibr"><sup>240</sup></xref> A 2018 study suggested that so-called lean patients with NAFLD are more likely to develop progressive liver disease and die from causes related to liver disease than those with obesity-associated NAFLD, indicating that NAFLD is not a benign condition.<xref rid="bib434" ref-type="bibr"><sup>434</sup></xref> Therefore, when a patient without obesity has abnormal anthropometric and laboratory measurements, and as the environment in Asia-Pacific continues to change, such awareness might become even more prudent.<xref rid="bib240" ref-type="bibr"><sup>240</sup></xref> The prevalence of NAFLD in the Asia-Pacific is following similar trends to the prevalence reported in high-income countries, indicating that NAFLD is a global disease warranting the attention of primary care physicians, specialists, and health policy makers (<xref rid="box2" ref-type="boxed-text">panel 2</xref>

</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para3860">Various steps need to be taken to promote healthy lifestyles to avoid overweight or obesity by increasing physical activity in schools and offices and regulating the food industry (eg, restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, increasing taxation on unhealthy foods and beverages, labelling food with nutritional information and health facts, regulating the advertising of unhealthy foods, and promoting healthy foods; <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">table 5</xref>). SDG 3.4 calls to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by a third through prevention and treatment by 2030. The 2011 UN high-level political declaration on non-communicable diseases<xref rid="bib433" ref-type="bibr"><sup>433</sup></xref> included two voluntary targets potentially related to NAFLD, a 10% relative reduction, as appropriate nationally, in prevalence of insufficient physical activity and halting the increase of diabetes and obesity by 2025. Actions and interventions against NAFLD need to be urgently incorporated into WHO's Global Action Plan on non-communicable diseases,<xref rid="bib435" ref-type="bibr"><sup>435</sup></xref> including public awareness (under Objective 1 of the Plan); screening for NAFLD; using simple, non-invasive biochemical markers to detect fibrosis in patients with NAFLD; early detection and weight management strategies including lifestyle modifications (dietary and physical activity); and interventions to prevent progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><p id="para3870">The primary responsibility to prevent and control obesity and NAFLD lies with governments, although the engagement of all sectors of society, international collaboration, and cooperation are essential for success. Effective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (including NAFLD) require leadership, coordinated multistakeholder engagement, and multisectoral action for health, both at the government level and at actor level. Such efforts would include health-in-all-policies and whole-of-government approaches across sectors such as health, agriculture, communication, education, employment, energy, environment, finance, food, foreign affairs, housing, justice and security, legislature, social welfare, social and economic development, sports, tax and revenue, trade and industry, transport, urban planning, and youth affairs, and partnership with relevant civil society and private sector entities. Opportunities to prevent and control NAFLD and its risk factors occur at multiple stages of life and interventions in early life often offer the best chance for primary prevention. People and communities should be empowered and involved in activities for prevention and control, including advocacy, policy, planning, legislation, service provision, education and training, monitoring, and research and evaluation of the effects of measures for the control and prevention of NAFLD. We believe that prevention is always better than cure; now is the time to push for prevention of NAFLD before its burden becomes overwhelming.</p><p id="para3880">Other aspects that need urgent attention are inadequate infrastructure and facilities for liver transplantation and health-care personnel poorly trained in the management of liver diseases, including preventive aspects, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. The focus must be on early detection of liver diseases with timely referral and access to appropriate care by trained multidisciplinary teams. In this regard, SDG 3.9c calls to substantially increase health financing and the recruitment, development, training, and retention of the health workforce in developing countries.</p><p id="para3890">Access to health insurance, affordable health care, and affordable essential medicines are also important issues in low-and-middle-income countries in the Asia-Pacific. SDG 3.8 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including protection from financial risk, access to good-quality, essential health-care services, and access to safe, effective, good-quality, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all by 2030. SDG 3.9b calls for the provision of access to affordable essential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health,<xref rid="bib436" ref-type="bibr"><sup>436</sup></xref> which affirms the right of developing countries to fully use the provisions of the TRIPS agreement to provide access to medicines for all by 2030. To this end, health-financing systems should not only seek to raise sufficient funds for health provision but should also do so in a way that allows people to use services without risk of severe financial hardship or impoverishment.<xref rid="bib437" ref-type="bibr"><sup>437</sup></xref> Three interrelated areas could bring health financing closer to universal health coverage: raising funds for health, reducing financial barriers to health-care access through prepayment and subsequent pooling of funds instead of direct out-of-pocket payments, and allocating or using funds in a way that promotes efficiency and equity. Public health systems and public&#x02013;private partnerships need to be strengthened to face the challenges that an increasing burden of liver diseases could create, and measuring progress is an inherent part of any prevention and treatment strategy. We suggest a set of metrics to monitor the implementation of the various aspects of such a strategy (<xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">table 6</xref>

Nevertheless, even when there is strong leadership and political will, the availability of finances, application of funds, and health-system capabilities will determine the magnitude and speed of the response. At the country level, public financing for health (as for any sector) is determined by the fiscal space available to the government. The fiscal space depends on the sources of finance available from improved economic growth that creates favourable macroeconomic conditions, such as revenues generated from new taxation or strengthened tax administration, borrowing from domestic and international sources, reprioritisation of health within the existing government budget, more effective and efficient allocation of available health resources, and innovative domestic and international financing.<xref rid="bib438" ref-type="bibr"><sup>438</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3910">The high-level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems was set up in 2008.<xref rid="bib439" ref-type="bibr"><sup>439</sup></xref> It recommended the creation of a common funding platform to strengthen health systems across the three global-scale innovative financing mechanisms&#x02014;ie, the Global Fund, Gavi, and the World Bank. These innovative financing mechanisms link different elements of the financing value chain to mobilise funding from multiple sources (eg, governments, foundations, and the private sector), pool finances, and channel and allocate funds to health programmes through organisations and governments in low-income and middle-income countries. Outsourcing of services, such as diagnostic tests or management systems for health-care data, to non-government providers and encouraging the use of advanced market commitments (eg, vaccine purchases) can also be used to secure investment in health-care services from the private sector.<xref rid="bib439" ref-type="bibr"><sup>439</sup></xref> The opportunity to link revenue generation to a global redistributive and environmental agenda should be sought via taxes on carbon, luxury items, or capital flow, and leveraging an increased domestic return on the natural resources and primary commodities of poor countries.<xref rid="bib440" ref-type="bibr"><sup>440</sup></xref> Other financing mechanisms including global health bonds, debt-conversion instruments, market commitment instruments, social and development impact bonds, and global solidarity taxes and levies need to be invoked. Opportunity can be seized in the current political momentum within the G20 countries that is in favour of increased levies on currency transactions and additional financial transaction taxes that could be used to regulate the global financial system.<xref rid="bib440" ref-type="bibr"><sup>440</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3920">The agenda of expanding the domestic resource base of low-income countries is also important for generating finances for health-care programmes. Many low-income countries could increase domestic public finance by reducing capital flight, promoting more effective tax policy, and improving their tax collection systems. Such an agenda would have the added benefit of focusing attention on the broad challenges of economic development and improving democratic and accountable governance. High-income countries should adhere to their responsibility to allocate 0&#x000b7;7% of their GNI to development aid. Principles and mechanisms need to be established for a systematic transfer of resources from high-income to low-income countries.<xref rid="bib440" ref-type="bibr"><sup>440</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para3930">There are some limitations to our analysis. First is the paucity and patchiness of data on liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. We did not include any countries with low HDI and thus our analysis is not wholly representative. Second, the tools for collecting, analysing, and reporting data in different countries are not homogenous. Therefore, it is possible that there are additional demands and concerns about staffing and financing needs and the requirements and timelines to reduce the burden of liver diseases. Despite these limitations, the Commission defines the unmet gaps and lays the foundation for collective thinking to eliminate viral hepatitis and control other liver disaeses, including NAFLD and alcohol-related disease, in the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p id="para3940">In summary, this Commission provides an insight into the burden of liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region and identifies potential causes of change in their underlying epidemiology and aetiology. Although viral hepatitis (both acute and chronic) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality related to liver diseases in the Asia-Pacific region, efforts towards its elimination as a public health threat by 2030 should reduce this burden. Nevertheless, mortality from alcohol-related liver diseases remains high in mostly non-Muslim countries, especially China and India, and is expected to increase. Similarly, obesity and NAFLD-related liver diseases are common in all countries, irrespective of HDI, and are also expected to increase. We hope that the Commission provides an opportunity for countries to learn from each other to tackle the changing landscape of the burden of liver disease in the Asia-Pacific region and to achieve the targets set by the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p id="para3950">
