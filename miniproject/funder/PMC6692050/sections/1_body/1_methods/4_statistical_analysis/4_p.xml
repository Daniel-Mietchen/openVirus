<p>In order to investigate the association between geolocation and the odds of canine vaccination we fitted Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to our data using the R package MapGAM [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. GAMs are an extension of linear regression models in which both parametric and non-parametric terms are used to estimate the outcome of interest. We used a two-dimensional locally weighted smooth (LOESS) of latitude and longitude for our non-parametric term. The LOESS smoother fits each data point by weighting it towards nearby points, where weighting is based on the distance to the point being fitted. The percentage of data points in the region that will be used to predict a particular point is referred to as the span. The optimal span size used for smoothing was determined by minimizing the AIC. We mapped the odds ratio for each point on pre-specified grids of each locality (from polygon data) and next tested the null hypothesis that the odds of each pointsâ€™ vaccination status did not depend on geolocation using permutation tests. For each test, the paired latitude and longitude coordinates were randomly permuted but vaccination status was held fixed. 1000 permutations were run for each locality and contour lines encircle areas with significantly increased or decreased vaccination odds as indicated by point wise p-values computed from the permutation ranks. All models and figures were created with R [
