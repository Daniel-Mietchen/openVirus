<p>We estimated the total vaccination coverage in the study area and compared the coverage in urban vs. peri-urban localities with a chi-squared test. We estimated the human to dog ratio and bootstrapped it 10,000 times to estimate its confidence interval. To evaluate the baseline characteristics of households and dog owners by participation in the MDVC, we defined an ordinal outcome for houses with dogs: 
 <italic>no participation</italic> (no dog vaccinated in the house), 
 <italic>partial participation</italic> (some, but not all dogs in the house, vaccinated), and 
 <italic>full participation</italic> in the MDVC (all dogs in the house vaccinated). We used a chi-square test to compare categorical variables with 10 or more observations per group, Fisher's exact test for categorical variables with fewer than 10 observations in any subgroup, and Mann–Whitney U test for age of the dog owner or interviewee, which did not follow a normal distribution and was truncated at 18 years. We compared the individual characteristics of vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs with chi-square for categorical variables and with Mann–Whitney U test for dog's age.
