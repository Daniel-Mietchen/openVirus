<p>We tested the spatial pattern of vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs in relation to vaccination tents for clustering using the bivariate cross K-function. This function estimates spatial dependence between two types of points (i.e. unvaccinated dogs and vaccination points) by measuring the expected number of points of type 
 <italic>i</italic> within a given distance to a point of type 
 <italic>j</italic> divided by the overall density of the points of type 
 <italic>i</italic>. We used the Kcross function in the R package spatstat [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] to estimate deviations between the K function estimated for our data and the theoretical K function corresponding to a completely random Poisson point process for vaccinated dogs to tents and unvaccinated dogs to tents. Deviations greater than the theoretical K function indicate that the mean point count is higher than expected under complete spatial randomness (CSR) and thus some degree of clustering is present between the two event types at the indicated distance. Similarly, deviations less than the theoretical K function indicate that the mean point count is lower than expected under CSR which therefore indicates that some degree of dispersion is present between the two event types at the indicated distance.
