<p>The study was conducted in Alto Selva Alegre (ASA) (human population for 2015: 82,412; density: 11,902 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>), one of the 14 districts of the city of Arequipa. Arequipa, Peruâ€™s second largest city, is home to 969,000 people and is situated at ~2,300 meters above sea level. The first detection of a rabid dog in the city of Arequipa occurred in March 2015 in ASA. By June 2016, when our data were collected, 43 rabid dogs had been detected in 8 districts, but it is assumed that number represents a small fraction of the total number of cases [

The 14 districts in Arequipa vary in human population size, house density, and socioeconomic status, among other variables related to canine rabies ecology. These districts are formed by contiguous neighborhoods that also vary in those characteristics, and this variation is usually associated to the level of urbanization of those neighborhoods. As new neighborhoods mature into established neighborhoods with wealthier residents, homes are improved with better quality construction material and permanent utility connections, and connectivity with the rest of the city increases with better sidewalks, roads, and transportation access. ASA spans the gradient of urban development, running from the center to the periphery, and the district continues to grow towards the outskirts of the city. In our study, participants represented either the urban or peri-urban residential areas of the city of Arequipa (
