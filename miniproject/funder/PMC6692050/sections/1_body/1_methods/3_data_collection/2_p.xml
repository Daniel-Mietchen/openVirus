<p>The door-to-door survey was designed based on the rabies literature and based on our qualitative studies of local communities, in which we found specific household-level barriers to vaccination [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We collected household variables (e.g. number of household members; number of children under 5 years old), dog owner or interviewee variables (e.g. gender; educational attainment), and dog variables (e.g. vaccination status; age). All houses in the study localities were geocoded and the survey data were linked to the household coordinates. We estimated the Euclidean distance between households and the closest vaccination point (fixed, mobile, or either).
