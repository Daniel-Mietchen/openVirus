<p>In collaboration with the MOH, we georeferenced every stationary and mobile vaccination team during the three weekends when the campaign was implemented in ASA. Due to volunteer assistance, some dogs were vaccinated in weekdays during the campaign; we did not georeference the location of those volunteering vaccinators, mainly because their schedule was haphazard and unpredictable. We started door-to-door surveys immediately after the vaccination campaign, visiting every household in the study area and consenting and surveying only one adult (â‰¥18) per household.</p>
