<p>Our study has a number of limitations. Other studies have focused attention on dog-level variables (e.g. sex, age, function) that might be associated to participation in MDVC [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We did not analyze these; rather we focus on owner and community characteristics that can be utilized by the health authorities (who rarely have the opportunity to collect detailed house-by-house information) to increase participation in MDVC. Vaccination status and access to the street were reported by the owner/interviewee and we did not request proof of vaccination (e.g. vaccination certificate). Given the bad publicity in the local media about owned free roaming unvaccinated dogs and the authorities’ threats to fine ‘irresponsible’ dog owners, there is potential for social desirability bias to inflate our estimate of vaccination coverage and deflate that of the proportion of dogs that have access to the street. We did not ask the interviewees to show the vaccination certificate they receive at the MDVC since many of them do not save these certificates. We used Euclidean distances, which are only a proxy for the real distance traveled by individuals to a vaccination post, and we did not include terrain elevation or slope which might affect walkability and the effect of distance on participation in the MDVC. Additionally, it is important to note that the MDVC in Peru only targets owned dogs. Our objective was to evaluate barriers to participation in the MDVC, so we only estimated the vaccination coverage in the owned dog population. The MDVC ignores important subpopulations for which size estimates are lacking: community dogs, strays, and feral dogs. The minimum vaccination coverage established by WHO (70%) first with empirical data [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] was directed to dogs at risk of rabies so the low coverage we found must be even lower when unowned dogs are considered.
