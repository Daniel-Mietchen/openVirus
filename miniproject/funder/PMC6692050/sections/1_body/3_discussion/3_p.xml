<p>Our study area consisted of urban and peri-urban localities. Surprisingly, there were no clear differences in participation in the MDVC between these two groups. However, the distribution of other proximal rabies-related characteristics is different between them (e.g. more free-roaming dogs in peri-urban areas, more neutered/spayed dogs in urban areas). There are other social determinants that provide more distal explanations for participation in the MDVC. In previous focus groups conducted by our team, young females reported that having a baby at home could prevent them from participating in the campaign [

Similarly, we found that households with children under 5 years old were less likely to vaccinate their dogs compared to houses without children, and each additional child under 5 reduced the odds of vaccinating the dogs in the house. This insight suggests an opportunity to increase participation in the MDCV by framing the decision to vaccinate as an action taken to protect children in the household from rabies. There was also a clear difference in participation between those who lived in a dog rabies-endemic area before living in Arequipa. A possible explanation for that difference is higher awareness among that group. In our focus groups, we found low awareness and low perception of severity among residents of Arequipa [

This phenomenon has been observed for the utilization of other health services in different settings and populations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Migration, settlement and adaptation are processes that take time and are necessary for the uptake of health services [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and could be influencing the participation in the MDVC. Importantly, in the peri-urban localities there are more households with children under 5, more recent migrants, and more people whose previous residence was in a rabies-affected region.
