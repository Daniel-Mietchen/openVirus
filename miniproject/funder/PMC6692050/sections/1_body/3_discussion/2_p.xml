<p>Many studies have explored logistical, informational, social and structural barriers for dog rabies vaccination experienced by owners in rabies-affected areas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Two of the most common reasons identified are difficulty handling the dogs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and lack of time [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These two logistical barriers are correlated with a less studied element: the distance to the vaccination campaigns. Distance to health services has been fairly well studied in terms of availability of and access to health care and impact on health, especially for maternal health, treatment and prevention of chronic diseases and treatment adherence for infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but not as much for preventing infectious diseases. Some rural studies mention distance as a potential factor for low dog vaccination coverage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and two studies directly evaluated the association between distance and overall rural villages vaccination coverage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and the association between distance and attendance at the MDVC in Sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the sub-Saharan Africa study, researchers found that distance in dispersed communities have an impact on MDVC attendance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given the hilly landscape with rare direct paths between houses and vaccination points, they estimated the shortest-path distance for their analysis to take into consideration the long and tortuous routes dog owners had to follow to visit the vaccination sites. In our study area, with non-dispersed urbanized highly-populated localities and high density of street intersections that increase walkability, distance is still an important proximal explanation for low participation in the vaccination campaigns.
