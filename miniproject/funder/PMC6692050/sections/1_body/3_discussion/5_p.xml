<p>Dog rabies virus transmission continues in Arequipa, putting at risk millions of people in the city and the surrounding departments. Dog-focused public health strategies are not limited to rabies: deworming dogs to prevent human echinococcosis [

These programs, if they are to be successful, require high coverage and even spatial distribution in their implementation. The same approaches to reach the appropriate levels of community participation that might have worked in the 1980s are not working today. Understanding the barriers for dog ownersâ€™ participation in community-based programs will be crucial to implement effective zoonotic disease preventive activities. Distance to health services and the heterogeneous social composition of growing cities have to be examined when designing field programs to protect against zoonotic diseases.
