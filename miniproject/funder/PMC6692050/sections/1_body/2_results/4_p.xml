<p>In the multivariable regression analysis, we found that distance to the vaccination site is strongly associated with participation of the MDVC. The odds of participating in the MDVC were 16% lower for someone who lived 100 meters farther from the vaccination point after adjusting for other covariates and this difference was statistically significant (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Those having a dog leash at home had 35% higher odds of participation in the MDVC, either fully or partially, compared to those who did not have a dog leash after adjusting for other covariates. The odds of participating in the MDVC, either fully or partially, were 13% lower for each additional child under 5 years at home, after adjusting for other covariates. Migration history was associated with participating in the MDVC; participation was lower in those who migrated more recently to the study area (8% lower odds of participation for each decade less lived in the area, after adjusting for other covariates). Another component of migration history, the previous residence region, was also associated with participating in the MDVC: those whose previous residence was a rabies-free region or was any district within Arequipa were 23% to 32% less likely to participate in the campaign compared to those whose previous residence was a rabies-endemic region, after adjusting for other covariates (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Demographic variables such as owner’s/interviewee’s age, gender and educational attainment, and other household-level variables, such as number of dogs at the house, were dropped during model selection because they neither improved the fit of the model nor were statistically associated with participating in the MDVC.
