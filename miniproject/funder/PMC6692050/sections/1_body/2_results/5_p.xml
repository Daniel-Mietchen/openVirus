<p>The significant association between distance to the vaccination point and odds of participating in the MDVC has consequences for the distribution of unvaccinated dogs in the area. We observed spatial clustering of unvaccinated owned dogs as a function of the distance from the house to the vaccination point. These pockets of unvaccinated dogs closer to each other than expected by chance occur at 500 meters from the vaccination point or further (

We also analyzed the spatial odds of participating in the MDVC, that is, the association between their specific geolocation and the vaccination point. For areas served by fixed-point vaccination, there was a clear smooth spatial effect with higher odds of participating for houses closer to the vaccination point and a decreasing gradient farther away from the vaccination point. The spatial effect of the fixed-point vaccination strategy creates two clearly defined zones: a large zone with statistically significantly high odds of participation in the MDVC and another large zone with statistically significantly low odds of participation in the MDVC (

For areas served by mobile teams, there were more spots of significant low and high odds of participation in the MDVC and these spots were spread in the study area without a clear association between the spots and the locations where the vaccination teams stopped to wait for dogs or to vaccinate dogs (
