<p>When we compared the distance from each house to the closest fixed vaccination point, to the closest mobile vaccination point, and to either the closest fixed or mobile vaccination point, we found a clear gradient in distance from vaccination point from non-participant houses (farther) to houses that partially participated (closer) to houses that fully participated (closest) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The proportion of households with children under 5 was higher in households that did not participate in the campaign (36%) compared to houses that participated fully or partially in the campaign (31% and 29% respectively; p-value = 0.019). The proportion of houses with a dog leash increases from those who did not participate, to those who participated partially, to those that fully participated in the MDVC. There were some differences in MDVC participation by migration history: people who have lived longer in ASA tend to report higher participation in the MDVC compared to those who have lived fewer years in ASA. Also, there is a slight difference in participation in the MDVC depending on rabies status of previous residence, with more people participating in the campaign, partially or fully, if they were migrants from a rabies endemic area (

Other variables, such as educational attainment, the proportion of female dog owners or interviewees, and the proportion of households in urban localities were all similar in those households that participated fully or partially in the campaign compared to those households that did not participate of the campaign (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Having multiple dogs is a prerequisite to be in the partial participation group; therefore, houses with partial participation had on average more dogs, but the number of dogs per house was very similar in houses that participated fully compared to those that did not participate in the campaign (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Those who did not participate in the MDVC reported more frequently not knowing about the campaign before it happened (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but many of them reported learning about the campaign the same day it occurred. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007600.s002">S1 Table</xref>, we report the media channels through which they learned about the campaign either before it occurred or the same day it occurred.
