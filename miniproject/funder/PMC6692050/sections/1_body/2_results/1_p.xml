<p>Based on our survey, the estimated vaccination coverage of the MOH MDVC was only 58.1%, and it was low in both urban and peri-urban localities (58.0% vs. 58.6% respectively, chi2 = 0.086, p = 0.769). Only 3.4% of dogs were (reportedly) vaccinated in private clinics, bringing our estimated total coverage to 61.5%. Participation in our survey was higher in the urban area (88.8%) compared to the peri-urban area (61.6%) (mean = 82.0%, chi2 = 6458.5, p&lt;0.001). The total number of dogs in the surveyed houses was 5,292 and the human to dog ratio was 3.78:1 (95% CI: 3.69:1â€“3.89:1), much lower than the 6:1 ratio used by the MOH for planning and evaluating the MDVC. In total, 65.3% of surveyed houses had dogs, but this number was higher in peri-urban areas (70.0% compared to 64.6% in urban areas, chi2 = 6.529, p = 0.011). For 76.9% of vaccinated dogs in the area, the person who took them to the MDVC is the person who responded to the survey. In our study area the urbanization process involves new localities being founded and settlers moving in. Accordingly, we found that the time of residency (or the year people moved into this area) was clustered at the locality level. However, we found that people living in or founding a locality do not necessarily share the same place of origin or previous residence.</p>
