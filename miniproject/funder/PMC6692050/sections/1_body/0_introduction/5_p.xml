<p>In cities, the social and spatial aspects of urbanization can facilitate the emergence of dog rabies and complicate its control [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Within this gradient of development, young neighborhoods and recent invasions are often located on the periphery of the city (peri-urban area) and the older localities are nearer to the center (urban area) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Compared to the urban area, peri-urban areas generally have lower socioeconomic status, fewer community resources, more security problems, and often more rugged and uneven terrain (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and dog owners from areas with different levels of urbanization have reported distinct correlates of vaccinating their dogs against rabies [

The objectives of the present study were to quantitatively assess the association between distance to a vaccination point and dog owner participation in mass dog vaccination campaigns in an urban setting, and to evaluate the effect of such distance on overall vaccination coverage and spatial distribution of participation.
