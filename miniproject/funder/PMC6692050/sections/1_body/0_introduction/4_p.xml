<p>The fixed-point strategy has been extensively used in Latin America and Africa, even though it has frequently failed to attain coverage targets [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The main reasons for its extensive application are that fixed-point vaccination is easier to implement and less costly than other strategies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In many cases fixed-point is combined with other strategies, particularly when initial activities are unsuccessful [

It is necessary to understand barriers to community-based control strategies targeting dog populations in dog rabies-affected countries where coverage does not reach the minimum 70% recommended by the World Health Organization to attain herd immunity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007600.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], much less the 80% recommended by the Pan-American Health Organization for the region [
