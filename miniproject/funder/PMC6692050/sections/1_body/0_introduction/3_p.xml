<p>There are three non-mutually exclusive strategies used in Peru to implement MDVC: fixed vaccination posts, mobile teams setting up a temporary mobile post or conducting ‘street vaccination’, and door-to-door vaccination [

For the mobile team strategy, the vaccinators move from one location to another during the day, vaccinating dogs along their way and spending short periods (i.e. under an hour) in a location before moving on, waiting for the dog owners to bring the dogs to these moving locations. For the door-to-door strategy, vaccinators knock on doors asking to vaccinate dogs in the household. Locations of the fixed vaccination sites are typically determined by a combination of convenience and prominence of the location (e.g. the entrance to a health post, a well-known park) [
