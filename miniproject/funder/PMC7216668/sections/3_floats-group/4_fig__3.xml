  <p>Large-scale sequence-based maps of 13,591 non-identical human, swine, and avian H1 influenza A viruses (IAVs). Pairwise antigenic distances were inferred from hemagglutinin subunit HA1 sequences by using a linear scoring function combined with weights generated from the MTL-SGL model. The map was generated from pairwise distances by using a multidimensional scaling algorithm. Antigenic cluster: BE95, A/Beijing/262/1995(H1N1)-like virus; BR07, A/Beijing/262/1995(H1N1)-like virus; NC99, A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1)-like virus; pdm09, A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus; pdm1918, 1918 pandemic H1N1-like virus; RU77, A/USSR/90/1977(H1N1)-like virus; SG86, A/Singapore/6/1986(H1N1)-like virus; SI06, A/Solomon Islands/3/2006(H1N1)-like virus</p>
