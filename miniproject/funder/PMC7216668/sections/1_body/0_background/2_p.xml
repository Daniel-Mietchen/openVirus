<p id="Par17">Among influenza viruses, antigenic drift is caused by gradual changes in the virus surface glycoproteins, HA and/or NA, whereas antigenic shift is caused by reassortment with HA and/or NA that is antigenically distinct from that in strains endemic to humans. Antigenic drift is often seen in seasonal IAVs [e.g., A(H1N1)season1977], whereas antigenic shift can lead to emergence of a pandemic virus [e.g., A(H1N1)pdm09] [

Antigenic changes by drift or shift allow IAVs to evade the accumulating herd immunity from prior influenza infections and/or vaccination, and thus present great challenges in influenza vaccine strain selection. During 1977–2017, such changes resulted in 12 updates for the human influenza vaccine [
