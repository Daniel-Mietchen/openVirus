<p id="Par22">The advantages of sparse learning over other conventional machine learning approaches are that its efficiency and generalizability generate accurate models using a small number of non-zero elements. Sparse learning also takes advantage of the sparsity of predominant features in influenza proteins. This is important because high dimensional features can be redundant and noisy, resulting in poor generalization performance [

Thus, we expect the sparse learning method will increase performance in feature selection and facilitate data interpretation. In addition, Lasso can be effective in handling small data size and this is fit for our application.
