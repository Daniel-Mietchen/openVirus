 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites at HA protein sequences were predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/</ext-link>). The evolution pattern of 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites on HA protein of H1N1 viruses was reported before; in this study, for all predicted potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, only non-conserved ones were included in the machine learning model, as described elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The non-conserved 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites at HA of A/Solomon Islands/03/2006(H1N1) (PDB accession number 5UG0) were further conserved using NGlycPred, which is a software predicting 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites incorporating structural information [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, all amino acid residues, with a variant rate &gt; 10%, will be considered as non-conserved sites and included in the machine learning model.
