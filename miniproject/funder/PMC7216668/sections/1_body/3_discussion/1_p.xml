 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, known as sequons, bear a consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except Pro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Prior studies suggested that ~â€‰50% of N-X-S/T sequons are 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. It has been well documented that changes in both mutations in protein sequences and glycosylation patterns affect antigenicity of influenza viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, the major computational models used in those studies focused solely on changes in amino acids or treated glycosylation as the same type of feature as amino acid changes. Changes in glycosylation and changes in biophysical properties would logically be grouped into different biological processes and, thus, into different types of features. Therefore, a computational model considering different types of features is needed to better predict antigenicity using genomic sequences.
