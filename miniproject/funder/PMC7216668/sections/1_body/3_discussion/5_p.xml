<p id="Par59">Through MTL-SGL based machine learning, a total of 73 residues have been identified as being associated with antigenicity in H1N1 IAVs. Among these residues, 9 (i.e. 153, 155, 163, 186, 187, 190, 194, 222, and 261) were reported under positive selection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, a few residues (e.g., 43, 71, 130, 141, and 187) were reported to affect antigenicity of H1N1 IAVs by prior studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Prior studies have demonstrated that changes of one or a small number of residues at antibody binding sites can lead to antigenic drift of H3N2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and many of these mutations are located in or close to the HA receptor binding sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Of interest, similar to those in H3N2 IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], nine of H1N1 IAV antigenicity associated residues identified by MTL-SGL are located in (i.e., 130, 132, 183, 187, 191, and 222) or close (i.e. 186, 128, 127) to the HA receptor binding sites. On the other hand, MTL-SGL did identify 16 residues outside reported antibody binding site and receptor binding sites of HA to be associated with antigenic changes in H1N1 IAVs (Figure S
