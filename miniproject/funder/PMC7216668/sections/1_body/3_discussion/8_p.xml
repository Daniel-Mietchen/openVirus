<p id="Par62">By using the MTL-SGL model, we constructed a large-scale antigenic evolution profile for a total of 13,591 H1N1 IAVs to represent the antigenic evolution history of H1N1 IAVs in the past 100 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Results showed that all H1N1 IAVs in swine and humans seem to be antigenically associated with A(H1N1)pdm1918, which was proposed to have originated directly from an avian species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The antigenic evolution profile suggested that avian H1N1 IAVs showed less antigenic diversity than swine and human H1N1 IAVs. However, after being introduced into swine and human populations, IAVs had different degrees of antigenic drift: the antigenic changes in humans (e.g., average antigenic distances between RU77 cluster in 1977 and SI06/BR07 cluster in 2007 was 8.7513 [±0.9110]) were much more extensive than those in swine population (e.g., average antigenic distances between SIV H1- 
 <italic>α</italic> cluster and H1- 
 <italic>γ</italic> cluster = 4.5198 [± 0. 8875]). Results also showed that multiple antigenic clusters (i.e., H1- 
 <italic>α</italic>, H1- 
 <italic>β</italic>, and H1- 
 <italic>γ</italic>) were maintained in swine for years but usually only one antigenic cluster could be maintained in humans. Of note, A(H1N1)season1977 IAVs co-circulated with A(H1N1)pdm09 IAVs for 1 year after A(H1N1)pdm09 emerged and then were rapidly eradicated in 2010. The sporadic spillovers of H1N1 IAVs at the avian–swine interface can lead to enzootic antigenic variants in swine; the sporadic spillovers of H1N1 at the human–swine interface could potentially introduce an enzootic antigenic variant among swine or a pandemic virus among humans. Although spillovers among avian, swine, and human interfaces are sporadic, antigenic variants present in avian species and swine continue to present risks to human public health.
