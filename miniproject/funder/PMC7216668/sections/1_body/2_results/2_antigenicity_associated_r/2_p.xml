<p id="Par51">Among the five non-conserved potential 
 <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation sites, all of them were determined to affect antigenicity of H1N1 IAVs (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Sites 54, 125, and 160 were predicted with high weights, indicating changes on those sites could greatly change the antigenicity and have the potential to result in antigenic drift.
