<p id="Par53">By using the MTL-SGL model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), we quantified antigenic distances for a total of 13,591 non-identical HA sequences [1 A(H1N1)pdm1918, 1426 A(H1N1)season1977, 6483 A(H1N1)pdm09, 3052 swine H1N1, 1771 swine H1N2, and 858 avian H1N1 viruses], as described above, and then constructed a sequence-based H1N1 IAV–specific antigenic map (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A total of 14 antigenic clusters were identified (see details in 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>); they include 7 clusters in human H1 IAVs [i.e., A(H1N1)pdm1918 (1918 pandemic H1N1-like virus), seasonal H1N1 from 1930 to 1957 and 1977–2009, 4 antigenic clusters in A(H1N1)season1977 [i.e., we names RU77 (A/USSR/90/1977(H1N1)-like virus), SG86 (A/Singapore/6/1986(H1N1)-like virus), BE95/NC99 (A/Beijing/262/1995(H1N1)-like and A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1)-like viruses), and SI06/BR07 (A/Singapore/6/1986(H1N1)-like virus and A/Solomon Islands/3/2006(H1N1)-like virus), and A(H1N1)pdm09 (A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus)]; 6 clusters in H1 SIVs (i.e., swine Eurasia avian-like H1N1, 3 clusters in classical swine H1 [α, β and γ], swine H1- 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1, and swine H1- 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2); and 1 cluster in avian H1N1 IAVs. Of note, the swine H1- 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2 cluster and the human A(H1N1)season1977-BE95/NC99 cluster were located in the same antigenic cluster. In addition, IAVs in most of those antigenic clusters could associate with multiple hosts (e.g., spillovers between humans and swine).
