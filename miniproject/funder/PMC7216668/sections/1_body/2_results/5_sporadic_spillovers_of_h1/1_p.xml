<p id="Par54">Antigenic cartography clearly showed the spillovers among the avian, swine, and human interfaces. Antigenic data clearly demonstrated that avian H1N1 IAV was introduced into swine and has been enzootic in the Eurasian swine population since 1979, the first year a virus was isolated. Of interest, few antigenic variations were observed after H1N1 IAV was introduced into swine. Compared with a single spillover case of H1N1 IAV from swine to an avian species, a total of three spillover events were observed between the interface of swine and humans; one of these events was from swine to humans and two were from humans to swine (Fig.Â
