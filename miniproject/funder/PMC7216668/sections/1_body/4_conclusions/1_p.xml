<p id="Par63">In summary, in this study, we developed and validated a sequence-based influenza antigenic variant detection method for H1 IAVs. This method is complementary to conventional serologic assays, such as HI and NI assays, which usually are medium or low throughput. Because genomic sequences can be achieved directly from clinical samples without virus isolation, this method can be high throughput and applied in large-scale antigenic characterization in influenza vaccine strain selection.</p>
