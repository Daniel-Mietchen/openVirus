<p>The chemical reagents and standards for HPLC were prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, HPLC-grade methanol, acetonitrile, chloroform, and isopropanol were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). A Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) was used to prepare HPLC-grade water. Analytical grade formic acid, ammonium formate, and commercial standards used for biomarker identification were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Internal standards (IS) including Arachidonic acid-d8, Platelet-activating factor C-16-d4 (PAF C-16-d4), 22:1 Cholesterol Ester, PE (17:0/17:0), PG (17:0/17:0), PC(17:0/0:0), C17 Sphingosine, C17 Ceramide, SM (d18:1/17:0), PC (12:0/13:0), Cholesterol (d7), TG (17:0/17:1/17:0) d5, DG (12:0/12:0/0:0), DG (18:1/2:0/0:0), and PE (17:1/0:0) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc (Alabaster, AL, USA).
