<p>RD (ATCC, CCL-136) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/mL penicillin, and 100g/mL streptomycin, and incubated in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Archived clinical isolates of EV-A71 and CV-A16 isolated from patients with HFMD were available at the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. The viruses were cultured in RD cells in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. The supernatants were harvested when cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed and centrifuged to generate the viral stocks. The virus stocks were titrated by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells and stored at −80°C, as previously described. Briefly, confluent VeroE6 cells were infected with 10-fold serial viral dilutions. The cells were incubated with diluted viruses at 37 °C for 1 h and subsequently overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde as the plaques were observed and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet. All experiments involving live EV-A71 and CV-A16 followed the approved standard operating procedures of the biosafety level 2 facility at the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, as previously described.
