<p>To investigate the lipid detection and extraction capacity of the current method, a total of 15 lipid internal standards were applied for sample preparation and LC-MS analysis for monitoring the lipids coverage and extraction efficiency. Additionally, to check the stability of the LC-MS system during the analytical batch, QC samples were injected at the beginning of the run and after every six samples for monitoring the system variation. QC samples were prepared by pooling equal aliquots of each sample in the current study [
