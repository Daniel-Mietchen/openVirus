<p>Confluent RD cells were infected with EV-A71 or CV-A16 (MOI = 10) and incubated in DMEM medium. Mock-infected RD cells were used as controls. The cells (four biological replicates per group) were collected for cellular lipid extraction at 4 hpi. Lipid extraction was performed for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis according to a previously described protocol with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Briefly, 550 µL of ice-cold 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added to dissociate cells and 50 µL of cell suspension was used for DNA extraction for normalization [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A total of 250 µL of methanol containing IS and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added to the wells. Then, 2 mL of chloroform/methanol (v/v 2:1) was added, followed by vortexing and centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The bottom phase was transferred to glass vials and dried in a Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator for storage at −80 ◦C. The dried samples were reconstituted in 25 µL of chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v) and diluted to 1:10 of the original concentration of cell lysate in 225 µL IPA-ACN-water (2:1:1, v/v/v) for LC-MS analysis [
