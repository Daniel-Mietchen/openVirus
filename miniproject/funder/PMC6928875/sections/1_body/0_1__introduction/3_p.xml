<p>In this study, we first established a robust platform for lipidomic analysis of enterovirus infections. We then applied this platform to perform an unbiased analysis of the host lipidome changes induced by EV-A71 and CV-A16 in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. We found that these enteroviruses perturbed the expression of multiple lipid classes in the host cells during infection. Importantly, exogenously supplying selected fatty acids significantly inhibited viral replication. These findings provided novel insights into the role of lipids in the pathogenesis and antiviral treatment of enterovirus infection.</p>
