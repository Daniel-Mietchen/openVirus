<p>Lipids are known to play crucial roles in multiple stages of the viral replication cycle. Viruses, including enteroviruses, may utilize lipids as receptors or entry co-factors for virus entry [

 <xref rid="B7-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as building blocks or regulators of the viral replication complex [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], as well as signaling factors to facilitate the cellular distribution of viral proteins, and the trafficking, assembly, and release of virus particles [

 <xref rid="B11-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Interestingly, viruses require a repertoire of host lipids to complete their life cycle. Inhibitions of key lipogenesis enzymes can downregulate virus replication [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, when supplied in excess, these lipids can similarly perturb efficient virus replication [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Together, these evidences suggest that the complete lipid landscape induced upon virus infection is required for optimal virus replication. The perturbations in the host cell lipidomic profiles upon enterovirus infection have not been fully characterized.
