<p>To establish a reliable platform for lipidomic analysis, we first validated the lipid coverage and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system stability. We applied 15 representative lipid internal standards that covered 14 lipid classes in the current study (

The coefficient of variation (CV) of all internal standards in cell samples and the QC samples were lower than 18% and 15%, respectively. These results indicated that the operation repeatability was satisfactory. To evaluate the stability of the analytical batch, the CV values of all mass features in the quality control (QC) samples were calculated. A total of 98.70% and 93.32% of the features measured in the negative and positive mode, respectively, exhibited CV values of &lt;30%, indicating that the analytical batch was stable with minimal variations. Taken together, these results showed that the analytical method was reliable and the observed differences among the test samples represented true physiological differences, rather than technical errors [
