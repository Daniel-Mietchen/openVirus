 <xref rid="B20-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We therefore investigated the potential antiviral effects of the identified FFAs against EV-A71 and CV-A16. These four FFAs included arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). We first confirmed the identities of AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA by matching their retention time (RT) and MS/MS fragmentation patterns with those of the authentic chemical standards. Our box-whisker plots showed that AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA indeed all exhibited significantly (
