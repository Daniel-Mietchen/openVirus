<p>To select the significantly perturbed lipid features in the lipid profiles of EV-A71 or CV-A16-infected RD cells, univariate and multivariate data analyses based on the lipid MS features list were performed. In the univariate analysis, a total of 622 features (215 known + 407 unknown lipid features) were detected in the negative mode and 1496 features (413 known + 1083 unknown lipid features) were detected in the positive mode. After applying the selection criteria of an adjusted

A total of 58 significantly different features (9.32%, negative mode) and 273 features (18.25%, positive mode) were identified between CV-A16-infected vs. mock-infected samples. In the multivariate analysis, these cross-validated parameters were satisfactory for the OPLS-DA model (
