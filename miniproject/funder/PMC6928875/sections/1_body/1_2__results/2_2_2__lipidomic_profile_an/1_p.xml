<p>To investigate the host cell lipid metabolism perturbations upon enterovirus infection, we compared the lipidomic profile of RD cells infected with EV-A71 or CV-A16 with that of the mock-infected cells. The lipid features in the mass spectrometry (MS) features list were first normalized with the DNA concentration of each sample. Then, the normalized list was imported into the MetaboAnalyst and SIMCA-P software for further analysis. The partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) score plots in both the negative and positive modes were applied to visualize the distribution of lipids and discrimination between virus-infected and mock-infected samples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the lipid profiles of the three types of samples were clearly separated in both the negative and positive modes. This indicated that many lipid MS features exhibited obvious changes and some MS features contributed to the discrimination pattern among the three groups under the PLS-DA pattern recognition. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) score plots were applied to visualize the distribution of the lipids and the relatedness of virus-infected and mock-infected samples. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-20-05952">Figure S1</xref>, all cell samples were distributed in the statistical confidence region based on the Hotellingâ€™s T2 test. The PCA results showed that the cell samples in the current study were not outliers.
