<p>To further characterize the lipidomic changes upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection, a heat map was constructed based on the lipid MS features list. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f002">Figure 2</xref>, different patterns of lipidomic changes were observed in the negative mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) and positive mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). While the lipid profiles of the three types of samples were less different in the negative mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), the lipid profiles of the EV-A71 and CV-A16-infected samples were markedly different from that of the mock-infected samples in the positive mode (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The common pattern of the two detection modes was that most lipid MS features in EV-A71-infected cells were in higher abundance than those of the mock-infected controls.
