<p>To further characterize the significant lipids perturbed in EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection, we next compared the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of the EV-A71- and CV-A16-induced lipid changes in RD cells with those of the mock-infected cells at four-hours post infection (hpi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-05952-f004">Figure 4</xref>). EV-A71-infected cells exhibited a total of 18 significantly perturbed lipids belonging to four lipid classes, including FFA, DAG, LPC, and TAG. All of them were significantly upregulated at 4 hpi (

 <xref rid="ijms-20-05952-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). CV-A16-infected cells exhibited a total of 41 perturbed lipids belonging to 10 lipid classes, including CL, FFA, EtherLPC, EtherLPE, EtherPE, LPC, LPE, TAG, PC, and SM. Except for PC, all of them were significantly upregulated in CV-A16 infection. Among the identified lipid classes, FFA, LPC, and TAG showed consistent upregulation in both EV-A71- and CV-A16-infected cells. These included a total of 15 lipids (4 FFAs, 2 LPCs, and 9 TAGs).
