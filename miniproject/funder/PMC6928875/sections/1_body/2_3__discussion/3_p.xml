<p>In addition to their immunomodulatory roles, the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs can also directly regulate virus replication. We previously demonstrated that AA and linoleic acids (LA) could inhibit the replication of coronaviruses including the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) [

On the other hand, inhibition of the PUFA synthesis pathway through depleting the delta 6-desaturase enzyme or by treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor impaired hepatitis C virus (HCV) production, indicating that PUFAs could also be required for virion morphogenesis [
