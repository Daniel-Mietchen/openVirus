<p>EV-A71 and CV-A16 are two of the most common causes of HFMD and repeatedly cause epidemics, especially among children in the Asiaâ€“Pacific region. While it is known that enteroviruses induce massive remodeling of intracellular membranes during viral replication [

 <xref rid="B23-ijms-20-05952" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], data on the cellular lipidomic profiles upon EV-A71 and CV-A16 infection are lacking. In this study, we established an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) MS-based lipidomics approach to characterize the host cell lipid perturbations upon enterovirus infection. Omics-based analytical method assessments and statistical analyses showed that our unbiased lipidomics approach was reliable in identifying significant differences in the host lipid profiles during enterovirus infection. We identified a total of 47 significantly changed lipids that belonged to the phospholipid, glycerolipid, fatty acyls, and sphingolipid categories among EV-A71-infected, CV-A16-infected, and mock-infected samples. These results showed that EV-A71 and CV-A16 infections significantly perturbed a wide range of host lipids.
