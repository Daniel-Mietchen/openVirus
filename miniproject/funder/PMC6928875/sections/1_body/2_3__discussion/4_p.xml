<p>To investigate the biological relevance of the significantly upregulated expression of PUFAs in the context of enterovirus infection, we evaluated the effects of AA, DHA, DPA, and EPA on the replication of EV-A71 and CV-A16. We showed that three of these four PUFAs (AA, DHA, and EPA) significantly inhibited the replication of both viruses. This corroborated with our previous observation that fatty acids, including AA, possesses antiviral activity against coronaviruses [

Taken together, these results suggested that like coronaviruses, EV-A71 and CV-A16 might modulate specific lipid pathways in the host lipid profile to achieve an intricate homeostasis to facilitate their replication. Excessive exogenous addition of lipids might therefore disrupt this delicate homeostatic state and prevent efficient viral replication. Corroborating with our recent identification of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) as a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment, precise manipulation of the host lipid profile might therefore be a potential host-targeting antiviral strategy for enterovirus infection [
