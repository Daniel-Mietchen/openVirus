 <caption>
  <p>Hierarchical clustering analysis generated by MetaboAnalyst based on the all lipid features list in the (
   <bold>A</bold>) negative and (
   <bold>B</bold>) positive modes. Each bar represented a lipid feature colored in its average intensity on a normalized scale from blue (decreased) to red (increased). The dendrograms at the top were constructed based on the lipid intensity (similarity measure using Euclidean and Ward clustering algorithm). Abbreviations: CA-4h, CV-A16-infected samples harvested at 4 hours post-infection; EV-4h, EV-A71-infected samples harvested at 4 hours post-infection; Mock-4h, mock-infected samples harvested at 4 hours post-infection.
