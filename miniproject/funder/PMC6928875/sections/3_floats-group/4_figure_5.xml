  <p>Box-whisker plots of the four fatty acid classes that were significantly upregulated in both EV-A71 and CV-A16-infected RD cells. The normalized peak heights were generated by LC-MS raw data after DNA normalization. Abbreviations: CV-A16, CV-A16-infected cells; EV-A71, EV-A71-infected cells; hpi, hours post-infection; Mock, mock-infect cells. * represented 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and ** represented
