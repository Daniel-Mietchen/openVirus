<p>To characterize the epitopes of DENV2 human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs), we used a panel of three DENV2-specific, strongly neutralizing hMAbs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006934.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The hMAbs were isolated from two donors infected in geographically distinct locations with different DENV2 genotypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The three hMAbs, 3F9, 2D22 and 1L12, bound to whole DENV2 virus (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Consonant with previously published results, DENV2 hMAb 2D22 did not bind rE or rEDIII, confirming the quaternary epitope specificity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). HMAb 1L12 was similar and did not bind to rE or rEDIII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>). In contrast, hMAb 3F9 weakly bound to rE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Because hMAb 3F9 bound well to DENV2 virions and weakly to rE, it is likely that the epitope is dependent on E protein assembly into virions for optimal display. In a blockade of binding assay, 2D22 interfered with 1L12 for binding to DENV2, suggesting that they recognize proximal or overlapping epitopes on the viral envelope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). In contrast, 3F9 only partially blocked the binding of 2D22 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) indicating the two hMAbs recognize distinct epitopes on the viral envelope.
