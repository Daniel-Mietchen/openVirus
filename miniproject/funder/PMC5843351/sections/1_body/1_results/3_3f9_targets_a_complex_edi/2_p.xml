<p>In summary, these studies define the location of epitopes recognized by DENV2 type-specific neutralizing hMAbs 2D22, 1L19 and 3F9. Both 2D22 and 1L19 bind to proximal but distinct quaternary epitopes centered on EDIII. hMAb 3F9, on the other hand, binds to an epitope on EDI of the E protein.</p>
