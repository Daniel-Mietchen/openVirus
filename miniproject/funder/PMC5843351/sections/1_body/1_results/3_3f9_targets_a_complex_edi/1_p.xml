<p>Competition assays with 2D22 indicated that 3F9 binds to an epitope that has minimal if any overlap with 2D22 or IL12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To map the epitope of hMAb 3F9, we evaluated its binding to a panel of chimeric recombinant DENVs (rDENVs) with alterations in specific domains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Our group has previously shown that strongly-neutralizing hMAbs for DENV1 and DENV3 use the EDI/II hinge region in their epitope [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. hMAb 3F9 bound to a DENV2 virus that had the EDI/II hinge residues replaced with those from DENV4 (rDENV2/4-EDI/II), suggesting it does not use this region in its epitope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Conversely, hMAb 3F9 lost most binding to and neutralization of a DENV2 with 11 of its EDI residues replaced with those from DENV4 (rDENV2/4-EDI), suggesting 3F9 uses an epitope that contains the replaced residues located in EDI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). To further characterize the 3F9 epitope, we tested its binding to and neutralization of a DENV4 virus that contained 22 surface-exposed EDI residues from DENV2 (rDENV4/2-EDI) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). 3F9 bound to and neutralized the EDI transplant virus, confirming EDI as the main target of this hMAb (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>), however gain of binding was not complete, suggesting there are other residues that are required for maximal binding. Our data underscore the importance of cryo-EM analyses to help elucidate the complete 3F9 binding epitope.
