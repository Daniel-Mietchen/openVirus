<p>To determine if epitopes defined using hMAbs were targets of polyclonal serum neutralizing antibodies, we first performed competition (blockade of binding) assays with human immune sera and hMAbs. Convalescent immune sera from primary DENV2 cases effectively blocked the binding of 2D22 to its epitope (

Two individuals (DT001 and DT158) were more effective at blocking 2D22 binding than 3F9 binding, whereas DT134 and DT155 were more effective at blocking 3F9 than 2D22 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), suggesting these individuals had different ratios of antibodies targeting each epitope. DENV2 monovalent vaccine sera also blocked 2D22 and 3F9 binding to their respective epitopes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), indicating that natural infection and monovalent DENV2 vaccine-elicited antibodies target both these epitopes. Interestingly, no DENV2 sera samples were able to completely inhibit either 2D22 or 3F9 from binding to their epitopes, suggesting a limit in the amount these blocking antibodies are present in the sera.
