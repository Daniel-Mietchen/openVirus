<p>Next, we performed studies to determine if 2D22 and 3F9 epitopes were targets of DENV2 neutralizing serum antibodies. Epitope exchanged recombinant viruses not only provide an approach to map hMAbs, but they can also be used to quantify epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies in immune sera. To measure the amount of neutralizing antibodies targeting 2D22 and 3F9 epitopes, we evaluated the ability of polyclonal DENV2 immune sera (10 samples) or vaccine sera (9 samples) to neutralize rDENV4/2-EDIII (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In some individuals (e.g. DT155) there are similar levels of neutralizing antibodies that target both epitopes, whereas in other individuals (e.g. DT128) few if any neutralizing antibodies target the 3F9 EDI epitope (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Overall, there is higher tracking of DENV2 specific responses with both the EDIII and EDI epitopes (80% and 54% respectively) in the natural infection sera, as compared with the vaccine sera (69% and 30% respectively), suggesting vaccination elicits a slightly different antibody response (
