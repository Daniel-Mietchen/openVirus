<p>The cryo-EM structure of hMAb 2D22 Fab in complex with DENV2 has been solved [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and the footprint of the antibody spans EDIII and EDII of two E molecules forming each homo-dimer. Although 2D22 did not bind rEDIII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), the antibody binds and neutralizes a DENV4 virus containing the entire EDIII from DENV2 (rDENV4/2-EDIII) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g003">Fig 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Introducing a single point mutation into this virus (rDENV4/2-EDIII R323G), previously identified as a 2D22 escape mutation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), resulted in a loss of binding and neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>), confirming 2D22 uses the transplanted EDIII region. HMAb 1L12, which was isolated from a different donor, showed nearly identical phenotypes, where it gained binding and neutralization to rDENV4/2-EDIII, indicating that it uses EDIII as part of its complex quaternary epitope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). Similarly, the R323G mutation in rDENV4/2-EDIII results in complete loss of 1L12 binding and neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>).
