<p>In addition to binding highly conserved residues in EDII, cryo-EM studies predict that hMAb 2D22 interacts with eight (307, 309, 310, 316, 318, 362, 363, 364) surface-exposed amino acids in DENV2 EDIII [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], five (307, 309, 316, 362, 364) of which differ between DENV2 and DENV4. To refine the map coordinates of 2D22 and 1L12 epitopes, we generated a new EDIII recombinant virus in which these five amino acids in DENV4 were replaced with those from DENV2 (rDENV4/2-EDIII 5aa) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Because the gain in function is only partial, these data suggest that the epitope requires other critical residues in EDIII for maximal binding and neutralization. In contrast, hMAb 1L12 did not bind or neutralize rDENV4 â€“EDIII 5aa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>), suggesting that its epitope overlaps with 2D22 but engages a different set of residues on EDIII.
