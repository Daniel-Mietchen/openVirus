<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a single stranded positive sense RNA virus that is transmitted by the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. There are four distinct DENV serotypes (DENV1-4), and infection results in a range of symptoms, from fever and rash to the more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Over a third of the worldâ€™s population is at risk for infection, and there are an estimated 390 million infections yearly [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A primary infection with DENV results in the induction of serotype cross-neutralizing antibodies which can provide temporary serotype cross-protective immunity that is not maintained [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the course of the following year, these cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies wane, leaving individuals susceptible to infection by the remaining three heterologous serotypes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies are maintained in circulation for decades following exposure and may play a critical role in providing subsequent protection against the infecting serotype [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and other mechanisms of cellular immunity are important for protection [
