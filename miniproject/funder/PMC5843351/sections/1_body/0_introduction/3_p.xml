<p>The DENV envelope glycoprotein (E) ectodomain, which is comprised of three domains (EDI, EDII and EDIII) is the major target of neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Two E monomers form a dimer in a head-to-tail arrangement, three dimers form a raft, and thirty rafts (180 monomers) cover the entire surface of the virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our group has previously characterized components of the antibody response to DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4 infection by mapping the epitopes of strongly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Importantly, many of these strongly neutralizing hMAbs target quaternary structure epitopes that form as the envelope glycoprotein is assembled on the virus surface [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, we have demonstrated that we can transplant these quaternary epitopes between DENV serotypes and maintain their biological functions [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While determining the properties of individual hMAbs is valuable, complex polyclonal antibody response governs protection against subsequent infection. Importantly, the epitope of a single DENV2 serotype-specific hMAb, 2D22, was shown by our group to be targeted by a large fraction of DENV2 neutralizing antibodies in many, but not all individuals after recovery from DENV2 infections, highlighting the potential role of this epitope in protective immunity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Despite this, there are additional DENV2 hMAbs that use other epitopes within E, suggesting that there are potentially multiple neutralizing antibody epitopes for each serotype. The goals of this study are to identify novel neutralizing epitopes in DENV2, to develop robust diagnostic reagents for evaluating epitope specific responses with recombinant DENVs (
