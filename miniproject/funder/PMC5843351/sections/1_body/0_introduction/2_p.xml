<p>The leading DENV vaccines are tetravalent formulations, designed to elicit independent, hopefully protective, neutralizing antibodies against all four serotypes simultaneously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Phase 3 efficacy trials in Asia and Latin America showed that the recently licensed tetravalent vaccine, Dengvaxia, had variable efficacy depending on immune status prior to vaccination and the serotype of infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In mixed populations of susceptibles and DENV-immunes, Dengvaxia was 50–80% efficacious against DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4, but only 35–42% against DENV2 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, younger vaccinated individuals were hospitalized for DENV more frequently than their unvaccinated counterparts, suggesting that poor immunogenicity in naïve subjects might place individuals at a greater risk of developing severe disease as antibody levels decline over time [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, based on long-term follow up data, Dengvaxia is no longer recommended for use in DENV-naive individuals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Dengvaxia clinical trials have revealed that even individuals with detectable neutralizing antibodies to a particular serotype experienced vaccine break-through infections indicating the mere presence of antibodies that neutralize infection in cell culture assays is not sufficient for protection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to the level of neutralizing antibodies to each serotype, it is critical to define other properties of human antibodies potentially responsible for durable, protective immunity. Importantly, while Dengvaxia contains the structural proteins from DENV, the non-structural proteins are from yellow fever virus. It is therefore possible that sufficient T-cell immunity towards DENV epitopes was not achieved [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. DENV vaccines that contain DENV non-structural proteins might generate a more robust T-cell response, and therefore more closely resemble a natural DENV infection, which results in a protective immune response [
