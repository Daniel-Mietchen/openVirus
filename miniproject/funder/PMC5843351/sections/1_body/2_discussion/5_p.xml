<p>Without a clear understanding of what constitutes a protective DENV antibody response to each serotype, it is challenging to evaluate current DENV vaccines. By defining the epitopes targeted by DENV2 hMAbs and polyclonal sera, we hope to determine if there are antibody based correlates of protection and use these to evaluate current vaccines in the pipeline, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines. Using recombinant DENVs that contain both gain of function and loss of function epitopes, we can rapidly map in high-throughput assays the epitopes of large panels of hMAbs, prioritizing targets for crystallographic studies and downstream analyses.</p>
