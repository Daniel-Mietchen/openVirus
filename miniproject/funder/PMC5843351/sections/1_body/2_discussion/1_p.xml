<p>People infected with DENVs develop robust and durable antibody responses that contribute to protection against re-infection against the homologous serotype; however, rare instances of re-infection with the same serotype do occur [

 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, this assumption has been challenged by recent results from DENV vaccine trials. Most notably, people who received a tetravalent live attenuated DENV vaccine and developed neutralizing antibodies experienced DENV2 breakthrough infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Breakthrough infections were also documented with the other serotypes despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This landmark vaccine trial has established that the presence of cell-culture neutralizing antibodies identified using FRNT assays, is not predictive of protection. Indeed, breakthrough DENV infections of vaccinated seronegative children underscore the urgency to understand the essential mechanisms of immune protection in DENV. Moving forward, we need to define key epitopes on DENVs targeted by neutralizing and potentially protective antibodies and develop assays to measure both the level and the molecular specificity of neutralizing antibodies.
