<p>HMAb 3F9 and 1L12, which were isolated from the same person, have distinct epitopes, consistent with bivalent recognition of the EDIII and EDI DENV epitopes in most DENV polyclonal immune sera. The 3F9 epitopes is centered on EDI at a site that overlaps with known DENV1 and DENV4 neutralizing hMAbs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, unlike 2D22, the region recognized by 3F9 is targeted by type-specific neutralizing antibodies to other serotypes as well.
