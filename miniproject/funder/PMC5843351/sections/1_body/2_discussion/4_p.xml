<p>Our previous work demonstrated that a majority of the polyclonal antibody response following DENV2 infection and vaccination appeared to be directed to a quaternary EDIII epitope [

In some individuals however, neutralization titers did not track as strongly with this epitope, suggesting that two or more neutralizing epitopes are targeted disproportionately after primary DENV2 infections. We propose that the EDI epitope defined by the hMAb 3F9 represents a second major neutralizing epitope on DENV2. Most individuals with naturally acquired DENV2 infections contained antibodies targeting both epitopes however some individuals targeted only one epitope, or had a skewed response. Similar results were observed in DENV2 vaccinated individuals, where there were antibodies targeting each epitope, however the overall response is dominant to the EDIII epitope. Overall, there was a higher response of antibodies tracking with the EDIII than the EDI epitope in both the natural infection and vaccinated sera (

Interestingly, some individuals had complete neutralizing antibody responses tracking with both epitopes, suggesting that they potentially generated redundant populations of antibodies. Generating populations of antibodies directed to different regions on E could be an important component of an effective antibody response. Viruses can mutate to escape antibody pressure, but simultaneously escaping antibody pressure to multiple sites on E would be more challenging [

As some individuals appear to mount preferential responses to one site or the other after natural infection or vaccination, it is possible that strains with natural variation within one of these epitopes may allow for repeat or breakthrough DENV2 infections.
