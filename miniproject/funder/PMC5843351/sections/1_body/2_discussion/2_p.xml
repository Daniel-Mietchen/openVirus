<p>In this study, we used a panel of hMAbs, human DENV polyclonal immune sera, and recombinant DENVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006934.g001">Fig 1</xref>) to map the location of epitopes recognized by DENV2 neutralizing antibodies. First, we used three DENV2 type-specific and strongly neutralizing hMAbs to map epitopes. hMAbs 2D22 and 1L12 isolated from different people had similar properties and recognized overlapping quaternary epitopes centered on EDIII. Recently Fibriansah

 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our data indicating that 2D22 recognizes an EDIII centered quaternary epitope are entirely consistent with the footprint determined by Fibriansah 
 <italic>et</italic>. 
 <italic>al</italic>. We suspect that 1L12 also binds a similar but not identical epitope because of subtle differences in the binding of 2D22 and 1L12 noted in this study. These findings highlight the importance of cryo-EM studies with IL12, which would provide a more comprehensive view of this larger DENV2 antigenic site. Nevertheless, our observation that two individuals infected with different DENV2 genotypes produced type-specific neutralizing hMAbs targeting a similar region suggests that EDIII is a dominant target of DENV2 neutralizing antibodies. The DENV1, 3 and 4 type-specific, neutralizing hMAbs identified to date do not map to the regions defined by 2D22 and 1L12 indicating that major targets to type-specific neutralizing Abs can differ between serotypes. However, several DENV serotype cross-neutralizing hMAbs that bind across the E homo-dimer have been described recently [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While these E dimer-dependent epitope (EDE) hMAbs partially overlap with the 2D22 epitope, they recognize patches that are highly conserved between serotypes unlike 2D22.
