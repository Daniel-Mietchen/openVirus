<p>For the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), hMAbs were diluted 4-fold and mixed with ~45 focus-forming units (FFU) of virus, and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. After incubation, virus:hMAb mixture was added to Vero-81 cells for 1 hour at 37°C or C6/36 cells for 1 hour at 32°C, then overlay was added and cells were incubated and fixed and stained as described above. Foci were counted and FRNT
 <sub>50</sub> titers were calculated as the concentration of antibody or sera dilution factor required to neutralize 50% of the virus. Neutralization assays are based on two (HMAbs) or one (immune sera) experiments performed in triplicate.
