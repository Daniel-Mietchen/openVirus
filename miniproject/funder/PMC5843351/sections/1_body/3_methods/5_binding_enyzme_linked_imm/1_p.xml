<p>For whole DENV ELISA, plates were coated with 100ng/well mouse MAb 4G2 and 2H2 overnight at 4Â°C. Plates were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween (TBST) and blocked in 3% non-fat dried milk in TBST (blocking buffer), and equal quantities of virus (as previously titrated by ELISA using cross-reactive polyclonal DENV immune sera) were added and incubated for 1 hour. For rE and rEDIII ELISA, plates were directly coated with protein and incubated. Plates were washed and primary human MAbs were diluted in blocking buffer and added to plate for 1 hour. Plates were washed and alkaline phosphate (AP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 hour. Plates were washed, developed using p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate and color changes were quantified by spectrophotometry. Assays were developed until OD values were within linear range of the assay, therefore absolute OD values may vary between graphs. All binding assays are based on two experiments performed in duplicate.</p>
