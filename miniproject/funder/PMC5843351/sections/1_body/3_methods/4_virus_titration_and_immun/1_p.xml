<p>One day prior to inoculation, 24-well cell culture plates were seeded with 5x10
 <sup>4</sup> Vero-81 cells. Virus stocks were serially diluted 10-fold then added to cells (after growth media was removed) for one hour at 37°C. After incubation, cells were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in OptiMEM I (Gibco) supplemented with 2% FBS, nonessential amino acids and 100U/ml penicillin, 100μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25μg/ml Amphotericin B, and incubated at 32°C. After four days incubation, overlay was removed, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 80% methanol. Cells were blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk (blocking buffer) then incubated with anti-prM MAb 2H2 and anti-E MAb 4G2 diluted in blocking buffer. Cells were washed with PBS, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) diluted in blocking buffer. Plates were washed and foci were developed using TrueBlue HRP substrate (KPL).
