<p>C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660) were grown in Gibco minimal essential medium (MEM) at 32°C. Vero-81 cells (ATCC CCL-81) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) at 37°C. Media were supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10% for Vero-81 and 5% for C6/36) which was lowered to 2% after infection. C6/36 media were supplemented with nonessential amino acids. All media were additionally supplemented with 100U/ml penicillin, 100μg/ml streptomycin and 0.25μg/ml Amphotericin B. All cells were incubated in 5% CO
