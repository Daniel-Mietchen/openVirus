<p>Recombinant viruses were constructed using a four-cDNA cloning strategy. The DENV genome was divided into four fragments, and subcloned into separate cDNA plasmids with unique type IIS restriction endonuclease cleavage sites at the 5’ and 3’ ends of each fragment. A T7 promoter was introduced into the 5’ end of the A fragment. Plasmid DNA was grown in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells, digested with the corresponding enzymes, gel purified, ligated together with T4 DNA ligase and transcribed with T7 polymerase to generate infectious genome-length capped viral RNA transcripts. RNA was electroporated into C6/36 cells, cell culture supernatant containing virus was harvested and passaged onto C6/36 cells to generate a passage one virus stock.
