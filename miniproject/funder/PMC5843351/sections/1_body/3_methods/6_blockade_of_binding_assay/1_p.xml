<p>Plates were coated with antibody, blocked, and virus was captured as described above. DENV polyclonal immune sera were depleted of cross-reactive antibodies as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006934.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, sera were incubated with beads coated with purified DENV4 antigen, then beads were pelleted to removed cross-reactive antibodies bound to bead:antigen complexes. Cross-reactive depleted sera were then diluted 1:10 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 hour. Plates were washed and alkaline phosphate (AP)-conjugated 2D22 (100ng/well) or 3F9 (50ng/well) were added for 1 hour. Plates were developed as described above. Percent blockade was calculated as follows = (100-[OD of sample/OD of negative control]*100). Blockade of binding assays are based on two experiments performed in duplicate.
