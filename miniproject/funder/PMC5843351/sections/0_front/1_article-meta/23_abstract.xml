 <p>Dengue viruses (DENV) are flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitos. There are approximately 390 million DENV infections every year, making dengue virus a major global public health concern. While there is a recently licensed DENV vaccine, it has low efficacy against preventing DENV2 infections. Individuals that are naturally infected with DENV2 generate neutralizing antibodies that can be protective against reinfection with DENV2. By studying three of these neutralizing antibodies, we found that they bind to two different locations on the surface of the virus. Additionally we found that most individuals that were naturally infected with DENV2, have antibodies circulating in their blood that target both of these regions. People who were vaccinated against DENV2 also make antibodies targeting both of these sites, suggesting they might also be protected against DENV2 infection. These studies reveal that human antibodies against DENV2 target the same two regions across multiple individuals. Additionally, for a DENV2 vaccine to be protective, it may be important to elicit antibodies directed to these regions as well.</p>
