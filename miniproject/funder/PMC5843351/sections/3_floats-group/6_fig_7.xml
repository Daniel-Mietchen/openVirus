  <title>DENV2 polyclonal neutralizing antibodies target two distinct epitopes.</title>
  <p>DENV2 immune sera (A) and monovalent vaccine sera (B) were evaluated for their ability to neutralize WT and rDENV in C6/36 Focus Reduction Neutralization Tests (FRNT). Dotted line represents limit of detection (20), samples with no neutralization were plotted at one half the limit of detection (10). Y-axis indicates sera dilution factor required to neutralize 50% of virus.</p>
