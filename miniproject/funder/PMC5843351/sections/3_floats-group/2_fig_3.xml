  <title>HMAbs 2D22 and 1L12 use EDIII in their epitopes.</title>
  <p>(A) rDENV4/2-EDIII is DENV4 virus containing entire EDIII from DENV2. rDENV4/2-EDIII R323G is rDENV4/2-EDIII virus with single point mutation at residue 323. 2D22 and 1L12 were assessed for their ability to bind (B and D) and neutralize (C and E) recombinant DENVs in ELISA binding assays and Vero-81 Focus Reduction Neutralization Tests (FRNT). Dotted line in ELISA represents the background signal. FRNT
   <sub>50</sub> represents the concentration of antibody required to neutralize 50% of infection. # = virus was not neutralized at highest concentration of hMAb tested (5ng/Î¼l).
