  <title>HMAbs 2D22 and 1L12 use different critical residues in their epitopes.</title>
  <p>(A) rDENV4/2-EDIII 5aa is a DENV4 virus with five EDIII residues from DENV2. 2D22 and 1L12 were assessed for their ability to bind (B and D) and neutralize (C and E) recombinant DENV in ELISA binding assays and Vero-81 Focus Reduction Neutralization Tests (FRNT). Dotted line in ELISA represents the background signal, determined as the OD value of wells containing all reagents except for viral antigen.</p>
