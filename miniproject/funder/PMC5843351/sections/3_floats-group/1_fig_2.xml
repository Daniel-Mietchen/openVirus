  <title>DENV2 serotype-specific hMAbs use multiple quaternary epitopes.</title>
  <p>DENV2 hMAbs 2D22, 1L12 and 3F9 were assessed for their ability to bind whole DENV2 virions (A), DENV2 rE (B), and DENV2 rEDIII (C). Positive control (+) hMAb is DVC10.16, a DENV2 hMAb that uses a simple A-strand epitope contained entirely within EDIII and 5J7 is a DENV3 serotype-specific hMAb as a negative control (-). (D) Blockade of binding assay where hMAbs 2D22, 1L12 or 3F9 were assessed for their ability to block 2D22-AP from binding to DENV2.</p>
