  <p id="Par5">For the 2017–2019 period, the available amounts were US$408 million (Tanzania), US$406 million (Zimbabwe), and US$318 million (Malawi). These countries also receive funds for TB and malaria programmes, the amounts for which are not included in this analysis but are much lower. See:

  <p id="Par24">Since 2014, the Global Fund has calculated on its own the total funds it is willing to offer a recipient country and informs the CCM of this amount in writing as the Fund Request development cycle begins. Countries are recommended to address their core HIV fundings needs within this allocated amount [

  <p id="Par26">Since 2014, the Global Fund has allowed its recipient countries to submit funding requests that exceed what it has nominally committed to provide through its main funding allocations. In the 2017 funding cycle, these were called Prioritised Above Allocation Requests. The reason for this is to allow countries to demonstrate that effective management of their epidemics requires additional investments. The Global Fund approves the technical merits of these additional requests and commits that, should additional resources become available over the three-year funding cycle, some of these additional items may be funded [
