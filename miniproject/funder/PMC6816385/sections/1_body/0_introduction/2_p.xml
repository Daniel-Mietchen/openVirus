<p>In a similar context, genetic information has been a rich source of information for viral species. Several studies show how phylogenetic information can be deployed for identifying the spatial and temporal origin of a virus, potential factors that trigger its dispersal, and other key epidemiological parameters (

 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Gire et al., 2014</xref>). In an era of high human mobility, such methods are important, as the increase of emerging and re-emerging epidemics is even more prominent than in the past (

 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Pybus, Tatem &amp; Lemey, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, phylogenetic information is still not used in the context of virus species classification or identification. As we have witnessed for other microorganisms, using or adapting already available methods for fast and automated delimitation or identification of virus species can greatly contribute to better understand their evolution.
