<p>The current taxonomy of HCV comprises seven genotypes, while mPTP yielded 16 genetic clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Figs. S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">S2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Appendix S1</xref>). From the 16 clusters, five were congruent with the current taxonomy, i.e, genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7. On the contrary, genotype 3 and genotype 6 were further split into three and eight sub-clusters correspondingly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), which corroborates former views that divergent variants of these genotypes may qualify as separate major genotypes (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the additional clusters identified by mPTP correspond to previously identified groups of subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref>). For genotype 6, these clusters consisted of the following subtype groups: 6a; 6b and 6xd; 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, 6g, 6o, 6p, 6q, 6r, 6s, 6t, 6u, 6w, 6xc and 6xf; 6 h, 6i, 6j, 6k, 6l, 6m, 6n, 6xb, 6xe; 6xa; 6v (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Fig. S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Appendix S1</xref>). Similarly, for genotype 3, the delimited clusters were (i) 3g, 3b, 3i, 3a, 3e, 3d, (ii) 3k, and (iii) 3 h and 3. All clusters were substantially supported by the MCMC sampling, except the split of 3k subtype from its sister group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1">Fig. 1</xref>), which may be due to the limited amount of corresponding sequences.
