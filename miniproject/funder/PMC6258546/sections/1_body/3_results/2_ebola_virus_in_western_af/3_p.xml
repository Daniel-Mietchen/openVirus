<p>Estimates of cumulative infections with the superspreading model are consistent with WHO data, whereas results with the SEIR model are not. The superspreading model accomodates an over-dispersed offspring distribution (the number of transmission per infection), thereby decreasing effective population size per number infected and yielding larger estimates for the number infected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We estimate the transmission risk ratio parameter (ratio of transmission rates between high and low compartments) to be 8.1 (95%CI: 6.68-10.73). This implies that a minority of 10% of infected individuals are responsible for 43%-54% of infections.
