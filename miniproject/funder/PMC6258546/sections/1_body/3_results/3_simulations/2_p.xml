<p>Good coverage of parameter estimates with estimated 95% credible intervals was observed with the 
 <italic>PL2</italic> model. Across 75 parameter estimates (three parameters not counting initial conditions and 25 simulations), estimates did not cover the true value 4 times. Bias of the mean posterior estimate was quite small; the largest bias was 0.228 for the 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub> parameter which varied across simulations between 1 and 9. In contrast, the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model failed to cover much more frequently, however errors were largely confined to larger risk ratios and 
 <italic>QL</italic> had a tendency to underestimate risk ratios. Greater bias was observed with the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model, with the greatest bias observed for the 
 <italic>w</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>h</italic>
 </sub> parameter (mean bias:-0.48). However the 
 <italic>QL</italic> model also had good precision with smaller risk ratios as evidenced in the simulation with smaller population size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006546.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). In that case, the 
 <italic>PL2</italic> model showed slight bias towards overestimating risk ratios which may be due to the deterministic approximation to the noisy epidemic. A similar but less pronounced pattern of bias and precision was observed for other parameters. A complete summary of simulation results is available at
