<p>The structured coalescent model in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which inspired the development of 
 <italic>PhyDyn</italic> did not account for all correlations between co-existing lineages or all effects stemming from disparate coalescent rates between demes. In [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a fast likelihood approximation was derived which better accounted for potential bias resulting from highly-disparate coalescent rates in different demes. This model, denoted 
 <italic>QL</italic>, also makes strong approximations regarding lineage independence: In every internode interval, all lineages are updated according to a linear transformation which varies through time but not between lineages. These issues were investigated as a source of bias in the context of phylogeographic models in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006546.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], where yet another likelihood approximation was proposed for models with constant population size and constant migration rates.
