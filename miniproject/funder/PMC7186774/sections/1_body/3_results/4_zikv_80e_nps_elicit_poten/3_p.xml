<p id="para0036">Next, we carried out an indirect ELISA using recombinant EDIII proteins (as MBP fusions) corresponding to the five viruses, ZIKV and DENVs 1–4 (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). This revealed that the antibody titres against recombinant ZIKV EDIII protein were quite high (serum log
 <sub>10</sub> titres were &gt;5) and very similar to titres against recombinant ZIKV-80E protein. This raised the question: what proportion of these antibodies would manifest cross-reactivity towards DENV EDIIIs? We addressed this by replacing ZIKV EDIII with DENV EDIII proteins as the coating antigen in indirect ELISA (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>c). The data revealed that DENV EDIII cross-reactive titres were virtually indiscernible for DENV serotypes 1 and 3 and significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) for the remaining serotypes, compared to ZIKV EDIII-specific titres (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S3b</italic>). Collectively the data lead to the conclusion that ZIKV-80E NP-elicited antibodies are predominantly (≥90%) specific to ZIKV EDIII. We interpret this as a reflection of efficient display of EDIII by the ZIKV-80E NPs. This interpretation is also consistent with the efficient recognition of EDIII on ZIKV-80E NPs by ZIKV EDIII-specific mAbs above (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The low levels (≤10%) of cross-reactivity towards DENV-80E proteins are presumably directed towards epitopes outside of EDIII. Interestingly, an alternate route and schedule of immunisation also resulted in similar indirect ELISA titers against recombinant 80E and EDIII proteins corresponding to ZIKV and DENV (
