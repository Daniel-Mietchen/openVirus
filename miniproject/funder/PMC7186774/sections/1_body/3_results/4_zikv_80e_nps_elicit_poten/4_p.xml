<p id="para0037">We next evaluated if the EDIII-specific antibodies elicited by ZIKV-80E NPs would be able to block the infectivity of ZIKV. This was addressed using a FACS-based ZIKV neutralisation assay. In this experiment we tested the capacity of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antisera to block the infectivity of two different ZIKV strains: the highly pathogenic MR766 strain and the mildly pathogenic PRVABC59. Both these ZIKV strains were efficiently blocked by the antibodies induced by ZIKV-80E NPs (NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres of 461 and 306, against MR766 and PRVABC59, respectively), as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>d. Mock-immune sera was ineffective against either virus (NT
 <sub>50</sub> &lt;10). We also measured ZIKV nAb titres of these sera using ZIKV RVPs, which are identical to ZIKV on the outside and infect susceptible cells once, but do not produce infectious progeny, as they lack the structural genes. Instead they encode

 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a revealed that the ZIKV-RVP assay resulted in quite similar nAb titre (NT
 <sub>50</sub>=335), consistent with earlier reports that NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres obtained with recombinant ZIKV RVPs and wild-type ZIKVs are comparable [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Analysing single mouse sera using the ZIKV-RVP assay, we found that pooling the immune sera did not mask non-responders or low responders (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S5</italic>). All individual sera tested manifested comparable NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres in the ZIKV RVP virus neutralisation assay, with the difference in maximal (mouse #1) and minimal (mouse #3) NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres being insignificant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.33, Mann–Whitney test). In parallel, we also determined the nAb titres against each of the four DENV serotypes using a flow cytometry-based assay 
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Interestingly, this experiment revealed that the antibodies elicited by ZIKV-80E NPs did not have any neutralising potency against any of the four DENVs (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S4d</italic>). Thus, the ZIKV-80E NPs elicit nAbs that are highly ZIKV-specific.
