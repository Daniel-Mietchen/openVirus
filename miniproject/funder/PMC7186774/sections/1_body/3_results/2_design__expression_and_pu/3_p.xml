<p id="para0031">As done for the DENV-80E proteins, we also appended nucleotide sequences at the 3′ end of the ZIKV-80E gene encoding a penta-glycine peptide linker followed by a hexa-histidine tag (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a and b). This gene is predicted to encode a protein of ∼49 KDa in its unprocessed form, which upon signal peptide cleavage exists as a ∼45 KDa protein (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Table S1</italic>). This gene, placed under the methanol-inducible 
 <italic>AOX1</italic> promoter of the pPICZ- A vector (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c), was integrated into the genome of 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> strain KM71H. The resultant transformants were subjected to an expression screening step to identify clones capable of expressing the ZIKV-80E protein. Recombinant ZIKV-80E protein was identified with an ‘in-house’ flavivirus E protein-specific mAb 24A12 in Western blots (
 <italic>Supplementary File, Fig. S2</italic>). Previously, we had observed that DENV-80E proteins expressed in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> are associated with the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate

 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. We therefore examined the localisation of the induced ZIKV-80E protein, by analysing the 
 <italic>S</italic> and denaturant-solubilised 
 <italic>P</italic> fractions of the induced lysate using the same Western blot assay (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d). This revealed that recombinant ZIKV-80E protein, like its DENV counterparts, is also exclusively present in the insoluble 
 <italic>P</italic> fraction of the total lysate. Therefore, we purified it under denaturing conditions.
