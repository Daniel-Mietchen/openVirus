<p id="para0041">In the context of the existence of the phenomenon of ADE in flaviviral infections, it is important to evaluate if the ZIKV-80E NP-induced DENV-80E-cross-reactive antibodies observed (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b, and 
 <italic>Supplementary File Fig. S4b,c</italic>) possess infection-enhancing potential. To this end, we assessed the ADE potential of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antiserum using both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment, we examined the capacity of DENVs of each of the 4 serotypes to infect K562 cells expressing the FcγII-R, in the presence of cross-reactive anti-DENV antibodies or anti-ZIKV-80E NP antibodies (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a–d). As a positive control in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ADE assay, we used the DENV cross-reactive pan-flavivirus-specific mAb 4G2. This mAb, specific to the highly conserved flaviviral FLE of EDI/EDII, is documented to manifest ADE activity [
 <xref rid="bib0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. As expected, pre-incubation of DENVs with mAb 4G2, followed by infection onto K562 cells, resulted in ADE of infection for each of the four DENV serotypes. This was evident from the typical bell-shaped infection profiles, as a function of mAb 4G2 concentration during the pre-incubation step, for each of the four DENV serotypes (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>a). Qualitatively similar, but relatively greater, levels of ADE behaviour was also observed when we used murine polyclonal anti-DENV-2 antiserum, instead of mAb 4G2, with peak enhancement occurring in the serum dilution range of 10
 <sup>2</sup>–10
 <sup>3</sup> (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b). It is interesting that this polyclonal anti-DENV-2 antiserum enhanced DENV-2, despite its DENV-2 specific NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre being &gt;2560. However, this antiserum also had the ability to cross-neutralise the remaining three DENV serotypes as well (NT
 <sub>50</sub> titres against DENVs-1, −3 and −4 were, 300, 798, and 421, respectively). As expected, when the DENVs were pre-incubated with polyclonal control antisera from mock-immunised mice (DENV-naive), using the same dilution range tested for the polyclonal anti-DENV-2 antiserum, no ADE of infection was discernible in K562 cells for any of the four DENV serotypes (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>c). Interestingly, none of the DENVs could infect K562 cells over a wide range of anti-ZIKV-80E NP antisera dilution (10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10
 <sup>5</sup>) tested (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>d).
