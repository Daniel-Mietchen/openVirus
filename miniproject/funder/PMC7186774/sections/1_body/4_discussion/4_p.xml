<p id="para0047">The size diversity in the ZIKV-80E NPs, evidenced by DLS and EM data, may be a consequence of particle assembly taking place during renaturation by dialysis, after purification of the recombinant ZIKV-80E under denaturing conditions. As the primary purpose of this work was to assess if 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic>-expressed ZIKV-80E protein possessed inherent self-assembling property to make immunogenic NPs, the conditions under which renaturation was implemented were empirically determined. Elucidation of the NP assembly mechanism and more rigorous optimisation of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> self-assembly step and/or ultra-sedimentation may help obtain a greater degree of size homogeneity.
