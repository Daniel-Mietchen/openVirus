<p id="para0046">Accordingly, we expressed recombinant ZIKV-80E in 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and purified it to near-homogeneity and found that it does indeed self-assemble into NPs, like its 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic>-expressed DENV-80E counterparts. Similarly, mammalian cell-expressed DENV-4 80E, which tends to associate with host membranes, also forms particles 
 <xref rid="bib0062" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. It is significant that the particle formation in these instances occurs in the absence of prM. The mechanism of assembly of 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic>-expressed ZIKV-80E into NPs needs to be elucidated. However, it is interesting that this particle assembly occurred during renaturation following purification of recombinant ZIKV-80E under denaturing conditions, and is likely to be different from the regular VLP assembly that occurs in mammalian cells expressing both prM and E proteins.
