   <title>Evidence before this study</title>
   <p id="para0007">Currently there is no vaccine to prevent infection by Zika virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to dengue viruses. The recent explosive Zika virus epidemics associated with severe neurological abnormalities, especially in infants, occurred in regions where dengue virus was prevalent. This observation, together with the known serological cross-reactivity that exists between Zika and dengue viruses, has led to the hypothesis that pre-existing dengue virus antibodies may have helped enhance the severity of Zika virus disease in these epidemics. Human sera from dengue patients can enhance Zika virus infection both in cultured cells and mice. Likewise, sera from Zika virus-infected patients can enhance dengue virus infection of cells in culture. The cross-reactivity underlying the infection enhancement phenomenon is linked to antibodies elicited by the pre-membrane protein and the fusion loop epitope of the envelope protein.</p>

   <title>Added value of this study</title>
   <p id="para0008">Our study shows for the first time that it is possible to create a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine for Zika in the absence of the pre-membrane protein implicated in the induction of cross-reactive, infection-enhancing antibodies. A further advantage is that the fusion loop epitope is not exposed on these nanoparticles. This experimental vaccine, which can produce potent virus-blocking antibodies capable of conferring significant protection against lethal challenge, does not cause enhancement of either dengue or Zika virus infection in mice.</p>

   <title>Implications of all the available evidence</title>
   <p id="para0009">None of the other Zika vaccine candidates being developed currently is designed to eliminate the induction of cross-reactive, infection-enhancing antibodies. An ideal Zika vaccine must induce antibodies which can prevent Zika virus infection, while at the same time being incapable of enhancing the severity of eventual dengue infection. As the incidence of new Zika infections is almost absent at the current time, clinical efficacy testing of vaccine candidates is not possible. Active pre-clinical development of Zika virus-blocking, infection enhancement-free vaccine candidates will ensure their availability for efficacy testing when Zika virus appears again.</p>
