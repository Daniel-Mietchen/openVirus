<p id="para0025">ZIKV nAb titres were also determined using single-round infectious ZIKV RVPs, encoding 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase reporter, as described earlier 
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In this assay, the NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre is defined as the serum dilution capable of causing a 50% reduction in ZIKV RVP-expressed luciferase activity, with reference to the luciferase activity expressed by ZIKV RVP in the absence of immune serum, taken as 100%. In some ZIKV RVP experiments, the immune serum was subjected to pre-depletion on a chromatographic matrix on which ZIKV EDIII was immobilised (
