<p id="para0024">ZIKV nAb titres in immune sera against two different ZIKV strains (MR766 and PRVABC59) were determined by using an appropriately modified fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based method, initially developed for determining DENV nAb titres 
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated (56 °C/30 min), filter-sterilised immune sera were pre-incubated with ZIKVs (adequate to infect 10–15% cells) for 1 h at 37 °C and titrated on Vero cells as described (
 <italic>Methods S1</italic>). The ZIKV neutralisation titre, NT
 <sub>50</sub>, is defined as the reciprocal of the serum dilution which reduced the number of ZIKV-infected cells by 50%, with reference to the number of ZIKV-infected cells in the absence of serum taken as 100%.
