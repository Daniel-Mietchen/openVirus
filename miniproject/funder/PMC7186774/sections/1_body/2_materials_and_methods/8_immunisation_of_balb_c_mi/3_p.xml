<p id="para0022">Polyclonal anti-DENV-2 antiserum as a control for ADE experiments was generated as follows. BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were immunised (i.m.) with ∼10
 <sup>5</sup> Infectious Units (IU) of purified DENV-2 (S16803), twice on days 0 and 21. Immune sera were collected on day 28, pooled and nAb titres determined against all four DENV serotypes. Additional details are provided in Methods S2 (
