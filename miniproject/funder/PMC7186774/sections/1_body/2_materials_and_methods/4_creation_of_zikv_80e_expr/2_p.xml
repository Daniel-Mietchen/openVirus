 <italic>ZIKV-80E</italic> gene was cloned under the control of alcohol oxidase 1 (
 <italic>AOX1</italic>) promoter of pPICZ-A vector and electroporated into 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> host (strain KM71H). Transformants were obtained through zeocin selection and screened for ZIKV-80E protein expression using mAb 24A12 in Western blot assays.
