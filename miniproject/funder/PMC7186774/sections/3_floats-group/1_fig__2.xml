   <bold>Physical characterisation of purified ZIKV-80E protein.</bold> (a) Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of pooled peaks 1 and 2 (from 
   <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>f) after dialysis. (b) Western blot analysis of the pooled peaks using mAb 24A12. In panels ‘a’ and ‘b’, protein markers were run in lanes ‘M’ and the purified ZIKV-80E protein was run in lanes marked ‘80E’. Their sizes (in KDa) are shown to the left of each panel. The arrow on the right, of both these panels, indicates the position of the ZIKV-80E protein. (c) The mass spectrometric N-glycan profile of recombinant ZIKV-80E protein, obtained using Bruker UltraFlex II MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The numbers in black above/across the peaks indicate the masses of the N-glycan species. The proposed structures of the N-glycan moieties, with the blue squares representing N-acetyl glucosamine and the green circles representing mannose residues, are shown for each of the peaks. The numbers in red shown in parentheses above the peaks denote the relative abundance (%) of the N-glycan moieties of the purified ZIKV-80E protein. (d) Analysis of volume distribution profile of particles in purified ZIKV-80E preparation. The left inset shows DLS parameter values, obtained based on size distribution by intensity, and the right inset depicts the transmission EM image of ZIKV-80E NPs (the scale is shown on the left lower edge).
