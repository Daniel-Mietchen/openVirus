<p>The relationships between time of infection and patient characteristics, as well as between origin (Belgian versus African) and patient characteristics were modeled using binary logistic regression models. Each potential risk factor was included in the univariate analysis and identified risk factors (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) were selected for multivariate logistic regression analyses using the stepwise method. At first, all risk factors identified in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Identified significant risk factors (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) in this first round were selected for a second round of multivariate analysis and this process was repeated until all remaining risk factors were significant. Only the risk factors that remained as significant after the last analysis were listed in the respective tables. The odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval is provided as a summary statistic. Significance was set at &lt; 0.05. All data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Released 2015; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).
