<p>HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were collected from 1185 treatment-naive patients who received baseline resistance testing after being diagnosed in Belgium in 2014 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 555) and 2016 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 630). Demographic data, collected within the framework of mandatory HIV surveillance, were linked to the individual patients using a pseudonymized identifier. For mode of transmission, the categories were MSM, heterosexual, and other (including intravenous drug use, blood transfusion, and perinatal infections). The 26 patients reporting bisexual behavior were all male. They were classified as MSM because male–male contact was presumed to be their most likely source of infection. HIV-1 subtyping was performed using Rega v3 and Comet [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The subtype was allocated in case of a concordant outcome of both tools and considered as undefined in all other cases. Time since infection was estimated for patients for whom sufficient leftover serum or plasma, collected within one month after diagnosis, was available (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1033, 87.2%). Infection timing was performed following an algorithm described before, with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Patients diagnosed during the pre-seroconversion stage were classified as early diagnosed and patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of 100 or less were classified as late diagnosed. For all other patients, the BED HIV-1 incidence enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the HIV-1 limiting antigen (LA)g-Avidity EIA (both from Sedia Biosciences Corporation, Portland, OR, USA) were performed. Patients for whom both assays reported ‘recent’, corresponding to a presumed infection ≤4 months before collection of the sample, were considered as ‘early diagnosed’ and patients for whom both assays reported ‘long-term’, corresponding to a presumed infection of more than 4 months before, were referred to as ‘late diagnosed’. Patients with discordant results for both assays were withdrawn from subsequent statistical analyses. Concordant results were obtained for 927 patients (i.e., 89.7% of the patients diagnosed in 2014 or 2016). The characteristics of the 927 study patients were fully comparable with the characteristics of the extended population of patients diagnosed between 2013 and 2017 used for phylogenetic analysis.
