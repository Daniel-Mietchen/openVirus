<p>Of the overall 265 early diagnosed patients, 50.9% were members of a cluster, a number that increased to 71.7% in case only individuals of Belgian origin were considered. These percentages are well above the 27% of early diagnosed with a phylogenetic link reported for a comparable study in Paris [

Although a close link in the phylogenetic tree is not a direct evidence for one-to-one forward transmission, the findings do indicate that the majority of early diagnosed patients in our study population were infected through contact with sexual networks that include already diagnosed individuals though more thorough studies on cluster dynamics will be needed to support this statement [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Only 22.8% (29/265) of the early diagnosed patients reporting infection in Belgium were located on isolated branches in the phylogenetic tree. Interestingly, these individuals showed a high prevalence of African subtypes (A, CRF02_AG, C, and D). This may suggest infection by an African partner not diagnosed in Belgium in the covered time frame. Referral to testing and care is known to be more problematic in migrants [
