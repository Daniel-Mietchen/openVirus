<p>Targeting the sexual networks behind transmission clusters will be key for a more impactful deployment of prevention measures to protect still uninfected network members. In this regard, the Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) is a promising initiative [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The goal of this initiative is to identify not yet diagnosed infections through partner tracing of the newly diagnosed individuals. The project has been successfully implemented in Ukraine, Greece, and the US [

 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The combination of partner tracing initiatives with real-time phylogenetics and infection time analysis may increase the effectiveness of the approach because it will allow to focus on the most active transmission clusters. Extensive partner tracing and network analysis may also provide opportunities to identify priority candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) [
