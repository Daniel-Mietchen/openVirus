<p>Late diagnosed patients constituted a heterogeneous group, but late diagnosed patients that reported infection in Belgium did not differ in characteristics from the early diagnosed locally infected individuals. Acute infection is generally considered the most critical period for transmission because of the high viral load, lack of awareness, and increased risk behavior around the time of infection. A high representation of recently infected patients in phylogenetic clusters is reported in many studies and considered as an important argument supporting this view [

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Others however have toned down this opinion or reported on the limitations of phylogenetic analysis to define timing of transmission [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The observed nearly equal involvement of early and late diagnosed patients in transmission clusters in the study presented (respectively 59.9% and 52.4%) is in-line with the observations of Robineau et al. who also reported a mix of early and late diagnosed individuals in transmission networks [
