<p>As HIV care and laboratory monitoring in Belgium is well centralized and baseline resistance testing is routinely performed for all newly diagnosed and treatment-naive individuals that enter care, we assume that our study population includes the majority of patients first-time diagnosed in our country over the intended period. Analyses for infection time were done for patients diagnosed in 2014 and 2016. The phylogenetic analysis however covered the years 2013 to 2017 to ensure that potential sources diagnosed the same year or the year before or after diagnosis of the study patients could be traced. Based on previous experience, we used stringent criteria to define phylogenetic clustering in order to maximize the chance that linkages identified resulted from recent transmission events [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For nearly half (48.3%) of the study population a close genetic link was found in the phylogenetic tree. This percentage is at the higher end of figures reported for comparable populations [

 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A one-to-one comparison of these studies is however hampered by differences in time period, depth of sampling, geographical region, degree of heterogeneity of the studied population, and lack of uniformity in methods and definition [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our population for instance, marked differences were observed between the patients of Belgian origin and the patients of African origin. Patients of African origin were more often diagnosed late and more frequently found on isolated branches in the phylogenetic tree. This is in line with the assumption that most Africans diagnosed in Belgium were infected abroad. Information on the time of migration to Belgium is unknown so it cannot be excluded that part of the Africans were infected locally by source partners not diagnosed in the covered time frame. Only a limited number of Africans were diagnosed early. These early diagnosed individuals showed high involvement in pairs and clusters, supporting local transmission and participation in existing sexual networks as reported before [
