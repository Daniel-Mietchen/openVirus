<p>The high number of newly diagnosed individuals that could be linked with a potential source of infection supports the belief that the diagnostic coverage in our country is high, at least for the patients infected locally. It also suggests that an important part of these infections could have been prevented because they occurred through contacts with sexual networks that include HIV diagnosed individuals. The high involvement of patients diagnosed more than four months after infection in these transmission clusters points to a need for more timely diagnosis in order to limit opportunities for transmission. Better understanding of the behavior of individuals in transmission clusters may help to define the reasons for delayed diagnosis. The observation that late diagnosed individuals are of older age is not new but interesting as several research groups have reported age-discrepant transmission, with the selection of older sexual partners being significantly associated with HIV infection in young MSM [
