<p>Important strengths of this study are the nationwide coverage, the dense sampling, the use of very recent data, and the combination of phylogenetic analysis and infection time analysis. A limitation however is that for some variables, such as the presumed location of the infection, the number of missing data is large. Another limitation is that conclusions on transmission were drawn from indirect links, as the phylogenetic methods used do not define direct transmission nor the order of transmission. Moreover, the contribution of undiagnosed individuals, diagnosed individuals without a baseline resistance test, and individuals diagnosed before 2013 or after 2017 could not be assessed. </p>
