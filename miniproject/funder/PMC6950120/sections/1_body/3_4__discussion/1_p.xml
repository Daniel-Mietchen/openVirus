<p>Study of the relationship between HIV sequences from patients of defined geographic regions can provide a unique insight into local epidemics. Combination of this information with demographic data and with information on the time between infection and diagnosis may help to better characterize the patients that were infected recently and thus escaped prevention measures. This information may help to increase the efficacy of prevention measures. Unless a seroconversion is demonstrated however, defining the time between infection and diagnosis is challenging. We used a previously validated algorithm that allows to discriminate between patients diagnosed less than four months after infection (early diagnosed) and patients diagnosed at least four months after infection (late diagnosed) [

The algorithm relies on two commercial HIV incidence assays, the Sedia BED HIV-1 EIA and the Sedia HIV-1 LAg-Avidity EIA that respectively assess HIV-1 specific antibody concentration and HIV-1 specific antibody affinity. Both assays have been extensively validated and proven to be reliable although the false prediction of an early infection cannot be fully ruled out [

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To minimize the number of false predictions, we therefore included in the study population only patients with a concordant result for both assays. Overall, a high percentage (28.6%) of the study patients were classified as early diagnosed.
