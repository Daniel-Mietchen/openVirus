<p>The study population consisted of 927 patients, 77.3% were male, 56.4% MSM, 49.9% of Belgian origin, 69.5% reported infection in Belgium, and 49.1% were infected with a subtype B strain. These characteristics fully matched those of the extended series of 2856 patients used to construct the phylogenetic tree and define clustering (77.1% male, 57.4% MSM, 48.2% of Belgian origin, 70.5% infected in Belgium and 46.4% infected with a subtype B strain). A close genetic link in the phylogenetic tree was found for 48.3% of the 927 patients with 11.4% involved in a pair and 36.9% in a transmission cluster. Infection time analysis classified 28.6% of the 927 patients as early diagnosed. The odds of being diagnosed early were significantly higher for clustered and paired individuals, for MSM and for patients reporting infection in Belgium (
