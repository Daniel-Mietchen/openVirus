<p>Overall, a close genetic counterpart in the phylogenetic tree was found for 448 (48.3%) of the 927 patients. Of the 265 early diagnosed, 67.2% were linked, and of the 662 late diagnosed, 40.8% were linked. When considering only patients of Belgian origin, 71.7% of the early diagnosed and 58.9% of the late diagnosed were linked.
