<p>For the 718 (77.5%) patients for whom the origin was known, 358 (49.9%) were of Belgian and 196 (27.3%) of Sub-Saharan African origin. The odds of being of African origin were significantly higher for females, heterosexuals, younger patients, patients reporting infection in Africa, and patients infected with the non-B subtypes A, C or CRF02_AG (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-01096-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Due to the important differences between HIV-infected patients of Belgian and African origin, further analysis of the characteristics associated with early diagnosis was done separately for both groups. Amongst the 358 patients of Belgian origin, 37.4% were diagnosed early. The only characteristic that distinguished early from late diagnosed Belgians was younger age (odds ratio of 0.958 per year of age increase;
