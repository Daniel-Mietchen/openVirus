<p>Of the 449 patients for whom information on the most likely location of infection was available, 312 (69.5%) reported being infected in Belgium. Patients infected locally were predominantly male (86.9%), of Belgian origin (75.2%), MSM (71.5%), and infected with HIV-1 subtype B (64.7%). A close link in the phylogenetic tree was found for 69.6% (14.1% paired and 55.4% clustered) and 40.7% were early diagnosed. Older age was found to be significantly associated with being diagnosed late (OR 0.975;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-01096-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution of positions in the phylogenetic tree for the early and late diagnosed, locally infected, individuals. Only 22.8% of the early diagnosed in Belgium resided on an isolated branch in the tree. These patients were more frequently infected with a subtype A, CRF02_AG, C or D virus (31.0% versus 11.8% in the clustered early diagnosed individuals).
