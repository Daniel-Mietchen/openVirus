<p>Previous phylogenetic analyses of the Belgian HIV epidemic showed that local HIV acquisition is almost exclusively driven by MSM and is concentrated in transmission clusters [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, knowledge on the specific characteristics of those individuals that contribute most to the transmission in these clusters is lacking. There is a general belief that particularly patients with early (acute) infection sustain virus spread because of the high viral loads during this stage of infection [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Modeling studies [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and phylodynamic studies [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-01096" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] support this hypothesis.
