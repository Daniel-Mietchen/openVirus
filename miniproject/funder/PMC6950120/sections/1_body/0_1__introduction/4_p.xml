<p>In order to further characterize the structure of the current Belgian epidemic, extend insight on the drivers of local transmission, and define gaps in prevention, we combined in this study phylogenetic and demographic analyses with information on the stage of infection at diagnosis. The results show that for the majority of individuals infected locally, a potential source partner was found and that a high percentage was involved in a transmission cluster. In these transmission clusters a nearly equal participation of early and late diagnosed individuals was observed. The sexual networks behind the transmission clusters should be the target of prevention focusing on earlier diagnosis and protection of the still uninfected.</p>
