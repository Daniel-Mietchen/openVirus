<p>Laboratory monitoring and drug resistance analysis is centralized in seven Belgian AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) Reference Laboratories. Baseline drug resistance testing of newly diagnosed, therapy-naive individuals is standard practice. As evidenced by many studies, the HIV sequence databases that result from baseline resistance testing may provide a wealth of information on the ongoing local spread of HIV [

To what extent the results inferred from these studies reflects the actual transmission dynamics however largely depend on the degree of representativeness of the samples analyzed, the depth of the sampling and the quality of the individual socio-demographic, laboratory and clinical information available, and the relevance of the results is the highest when targeting concentrated and densely sampled epidemics.
