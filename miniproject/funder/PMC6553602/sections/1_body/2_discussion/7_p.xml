<p>In summary, we identified and quantified the effect of two factors that drive the seasonality of LF epidemics in Nigeria. Combining the fit of the mechanistic model to the observed counts of LF disease in humans with the predictive model of the transmission dynamics of LF in rodents, we quantified the annual change in relative contact frequency between humans and infected rodents. A high seasonal amplitude was identified, and our model indicated the first nine weeks of the season as the high-risk period for LF transmission.</p>
