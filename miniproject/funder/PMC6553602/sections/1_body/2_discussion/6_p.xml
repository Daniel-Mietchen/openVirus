<p>Several technical limitations of our study must be noted. First, we did not consider a spatial component in our analysis which may involve geographical heterogeneity in reporting rates. Second, we used only the counts of suspected cases that included both laboratory-confirmed cases and cases that tested negative. However, the available dataset indicates that the majority of suspected cases involved specimens that tested negative. This becomes especially evident in low-risk exposure periods, and taking this into consideration in our analysis would further amplify the difference between high-risk and low-risk periods. Third, we did not account for temporal changes in the surveillance system and improvements in laboratory facilities for the detection of LF, both of which have been greatly improved in recent years. Fourth, we did not distinguish possible variations in population densities of rodents in habiting human houses and farm fields or, similarly, urban and rural areas.</p>
