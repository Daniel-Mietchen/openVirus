<p>Last, we calculated the relative frequency of contact of humans with infected rodents using the ratio of the estimated weekly exposure rate to the density of infected rodents predicted by our transmission model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSTB20180268F3">figureÂ 3</xref>). After assigning the average frequency of contact in the low-risk exposure period as 1, we determined that the relative risk of human exposure was 5.3 times higher on average during the high-risk exposure period. The maximal value of 6.7 was identified in the first week of the year.
