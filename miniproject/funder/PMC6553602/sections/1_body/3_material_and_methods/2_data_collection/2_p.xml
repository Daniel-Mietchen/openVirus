<p>Data were routinely collected from the weekly epidemiological report of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) for the period from 2016/week 4 to 2018/week 30. The extracted counts included newly suspected weekly cases for both positively and negatively testing specimens, as well as the number of fatal cases reported per week. For both cases and deaths, the corresponding week of the report represents the week in which the illness onset and death events occurred, respectively (i.e. fatal cases were not reported as a function of the week of illness onset). We did not use the available data for previous time periods (2012â€“2016) owing to irregular reporting and removal of reports from an official website of the NCDC. However, we provide all of the accumulated data as electronic supplementary material.</p>
