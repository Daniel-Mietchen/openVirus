<p>To access weekly data on climatological variables (i.e. precipitation, temperature, relative and specific humidity, precipitable water), we used publicly available gridded NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The chosen reference point was set to coordinates 6.75° N 6.25° E, located in Edo state, Nigeria. Historically, Edo state was characterized by a high prevalence of LF infection. It was also marked as highly hazardous for LF transmission owing to an average annual rainfall of 1786 mm [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While the former was used for correlative analysis of rainfall patterns and available incidence data from the last 6 years, the latter was used only to generate the historical characteristics of rainfall, as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S4.
