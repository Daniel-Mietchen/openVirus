<p>LF virus was first discovered in 1969, but its presence can be traced back for centuries [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Current viral hotspots are focused on West African countries, namely, Nigeria, Guinea, Benin, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The animal reservoir of the virus is 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>, also known as multimammate mouse, which is a rodent species that is widespread in the region. Although the main transmission route remains zoonotic, i.e. animal-to-human, contracting the virus through exposure to contaminated excreta or secretions from rodents [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], another frequently reported route is human-to-human transmission, via contact exposure to the virus from the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The latter contributes to approximately 19% of all reported cases and is usually observed during nosocomial outbreaks [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, the overall transmission pattern is primarily driven by environmental exposure to LF [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] rather than sustained human-to-human transmission chains, being different from Ebola virus disease [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Given the importance of the humanâ€“animal interface, we anticipate that environmental factors may be crucial driving forces contributing to the frequent recurrence of LF outbreaks.
