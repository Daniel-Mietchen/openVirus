<p>Published estimates of the case fatality risk (CFR) from LF of 1–2% have been proposed for previously healthy populations without underlying comorbidities [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, this rate varies considerably depending on the context, being for example 2–5% for hospital-treated cases and increased to 20–60% for laboratory-confirmed cases or during nosocomial outbreaks [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because higher estimates of the CFR are likely due to underreporting and ascertainment bias, we are able to account for this observational matter and estimate an underreporting factor. Similarly to our recent work [
 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we assume that fatal cases are certainly reported in the surveillance system throughout the whole year, while less severe, non-lethal cases are likely to be missed. Such variation may especially be the case during low-risk periods, when LF infections are not frequently reported.
