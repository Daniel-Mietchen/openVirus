<p>Here, we offer a unified epidemiological model that consists of two parts [

We derived the risk of exposure to the virus throughout the year. The second part employs the so-called susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model, which captures the transmission dynamics of the virus in rodents. Based on existing observations of rodent populations both in the field and in laboratory settings [

 <xref rid="RSTB20180268C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]), we have captured the seasonality in the numbers of infected rodents. Using the first and second parts of the model, we also estimated the relative contact frequency of humans with infected animals throughout the year.
