Many arboviruses, such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis, are endemic and mostly affect children in the country. This research sets out to evaluate vector relative abundance and diversity in primary schools in Cambodia in an attempt to explain the apparent burden of dengue fever, severe dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), other arboviral diseases and malaria among children, 15 years and under, attending selected primary schools through vector surveys. Entomological surveys were implemented in primary schools in two provinces of Cambodia to assess the potential risk of exposure of schoolchildren to mosquito vector species. Light traps and BG traps were used to collect adult mosquitoes in 24 schools during the rainy and dry seasons of 2017 and 2018 in Kampong Cham and Tboung Khmum provinces. A total of 61 species were described, including <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> species. The relative abundance and biodiversity of mosquito species were dependent on the month and school. Of the 37,725 mosquitoes caught during the study, three species accounted for three-quarters of the relative abundance: <italic>Culex vishnui</italic>, <italic>Anopheles indefinitus</italic> and <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. More importantly, nearly 90% of the mosquitoes caught in the schools were identified as potential vectors of pathogens including Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and malaria parasites. Our results showed that schools in Cambodia represent a risk for vector-borne disease transmission and highlight the importance of implementing vector control in schools in Cambodia to decrease the risk of transmission.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by ECOMORE 2 project, coordinated by Institut Pasteur and financially supported by AFD (Agence Fran&#x000e7;aise pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement).

Worldwide, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are the main vectors of malaria and despite an undeniable improvement of the situation [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], there was still an estimated 219 million cases and 435,000 death worldwide for the year 2017 (WHO [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], malaria report). The genera <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> mainly transmit arboviruses responsible for diseases in humans such as dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, Zika, Chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis. In recent years, an increase in the burden related to arboviruses has been reported worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Cambodia, dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, and Japanese encephalitis viruses circulate [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Dengue is probably the most important of these diseases and since the massive dengue epidemic in 1995 with more than 400 deaths, the number of cases has been monitored [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Major dengue epidemics occurred in 2007 with 39,618 cases (396 deaths) and 2012 with 42,362 cases (189 deaths); the estimated incidence among children less than 7 years-old of age is 41.1/1,000 person-seasons [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] with an incidence of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome of 4.1 per 1,000 children under 15 years old [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. During 2018, the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh faced a high circulation of dengue cases with 9,445 cases including 6 deaths reported by the National Dengue Control Program (Ministry of Health, Phnom Penh, Cambodia). Japanese encephalitis virus is also endemic in Cambodia with an incidence estimated at 0.1 case per 1,000 children under 15 years old [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 2017, malaria incidence was estimated to be between 186,000 and 236,000 cases per year [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There are 43 genera and 3,530 mosquito species currently described worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the presence of 20 genera and 243 species is estimated in Cambodia. This estimate is mainly based on institutional collections (Institut de Recherche pour le D&#x000e9;veloppement, Montpellier, France, and Smithsonian Institute, Washington D.C., United States) and on studies implemented before the Khmer rouge period (1975&#x02013;1979). Except studies specifically targeting dengue and malaria vectors [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], there is no comprehensive study on the biodiversity of other mosquitoes of medical importance in Cambodia. Specifically, there is a lack of knowledge on the Cambodian mosquito diversity potentially present in the school premises. Indeed, the classical infrastructure of school buildings, with open ventilation in the top of the walls allowing mosquitoes to enter the premises to access shade and cooler areas to rest but also to have a potential blood meal.</p><p>In this study, schools were chosen to carry out a first inventory based on the fact that schools are areas of high density of children in environments at risk of vector-borne pathogen transmission. In general, children of school attending age are from 4 to 15 years old, are more naive and sensitive to arboviruses and parasites and therefore are at risk to develop associated diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the mosquito species diversity and relative abundance in schools from two provinces of Cambodia known for the circulation of several dengue serotypes, and with potential risk of other arboviruses and parasites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p><xref rid="pone.0233669.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the characteristics of the schools selected for the study and their GPS coordinates.

traps&#x000ae; (Biogents, Regensburg, Germany) and 66 CDC light traps&#x000ae; (JWHock, Gainsville, USA) were used to collect adult mosquitoes. BG-sentinel traps were used with a lure designed by BioGents &#x000ae; Company consisting of a combination of substances such as lactic acid, ammonia, and fatty acids that can be found on human skin [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Traps were set up during 24 hours inside classrooms with 1 trap per classroom. Following the traditional Cambodian construction, all classes of all schools have openings in the tops of each wall to let the air circulates and reduce the high temperatures occurring during the daytime, allowing the free circulation of mosquitoes. Depending on the size of the schools and the number of classrooms, three (or less) BG traps and three (or less) CDC light traps were used with a limit of a total of six traps per school (<xref rid="pone.0233669.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After each collection, mosquitoes were conserved in an electric icebox at +4&#x000b0;C and first identified in the field the same day. Then, samples were brought back to the laboratory, still at +4&#x000b0;C, in Phnom Penh for a second identification. In the field and in the laboratory, mosquitoes were identified under stereomicroscope and microscope using morphological mosquito identification keys from Southeast Asia countries [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The association of the different parameters characterizing the schools and the period of collection, i.e. month, school, urbanization, presence of pagoda, school area, the number of classroom and children in the school and the relative densities of mosquito populations (i.e. all mosquitoes, all vector mosquitoes, Japanese encephalitis virus vectors, Dengue virus vectors, malaria plasmodium vectors) in the considered schools, were tested by a generalized linear mixed model using Template Model Builder with the assignation of &#x02018;school&#x02019; as random variables, in order to determine the main significant factors.

Based on the various specimens deposited in institutions for collections (IRD and Smithsonian), we estimated that at least 243 mosquito species are present in Cambodia. This estimate of the mosquito fauna biodiversity is important, but it may be underestimated as neighboring countries such as Thailand officially recorded 384 species [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Other neighboring countries such as Lao PDR and Vietnam have described recently 170 and 191 taxa, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but as in Cambodia they are probably underestimating the mosquito diversity. By collecting 61 species in 24 schools during our study, representing 23% of the country&#x02019;s species, we probably underestimate the number of mosquito species present in schools in Cambodia. Insofar as the majority of the species collected have been previously incriminated as vectors of pathogens of public health importance, a global inventory of the biodiversity of mosquitoes in schools should be undertaken in Cambodia and control strategies developed.</p><p>Little is known on the epidemiological importance of schools in arbovirus and other pathogen transmission. There are only few studies worldwide, describing the mosquito biodiversity in these specific places, thus making it difficult to compare with our results (i.e. number and index). For example, a study implemented in Thailand in 2012 in classrooms only showed the numbers of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> collected without describing the other potential vector species present. The authors described the presence of 66 adult <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> collected in 10 schools from 50 classrooms, after the use of vacuum aspirators for 15 minutes per room [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The total number of mosquitoes (278) was very low compared to our methods, likely due to the methodology used, even if the proportion of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> (24%) is higher [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Colombia, during a surveillance carried out in 34 schools, adult mosquitoes were collected twice a year during 10 minutes with electric aspirators in 191 and 188 classrooms in 2 municipalities, and 9 mosquito species were formally described including <italic>Aedes</italic>, <italic>Anopheles</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic> and other genera. [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, due to the geography, climate and other factors, it seems incoherent to compare our results to those of Colombia, where 324 mosquito species from 28 genera were recently described [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Diversity and relative abundance of mosquito potential vector species</title><p>Children spend their time at school during the day and consequently these specific places are most likely to be considered as hot spots for transmission of vector borne-diseases. In our study, almost nine out of ten mosquitoes could be considered as a potential vector and confirms the interest of carrying out surveillance or even vector control in and around schools in highly endemic diseases areas. It should also be noted that 17 species present in the 24 schools can be considered as a potential vectors.</p><p>The presence of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> in the 24 schools and during the 4 collection sessions implemented throughout the year illustrates the role that these species could play in the maintenance and transmission of viruses such as dengue in schools in general.

Moreover, in the studies carried out in Thailand and Colombia, in both cases the majority of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> females were collected in the classrooms, as in our study, and many mosquitoes were positive for the dengue by PCR detection confirming their possible role [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, these mosquitoes are known for their diurnal biting activity, increasing the chance to play a key role in schools for the transmission or maintenance of dengue fever in endemic areas.</p><p>A large majority of JEV vectors was observed with the notable presence of <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>vishnui</italic>, <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>, <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>gelidus</italic> and also of considered secondary vectors such as <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>fuscocephala</italic>, <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and <italic>Cx</italic>. <italic>bitaeniorhynchus</italic>. The proportion of these vectors (70%) in schools is comparable to the relative density found in a study of mosquito dynamics in rural and peri-urban areas in Cambodia (Boyer Pers. Com.). The presence of large numbers of these vectors in classrooms could also explain the high endemicity of Japanese encephalitis in Cambodia [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The large number of JEV vector species caught in classrooms suggests an anthropophagic behavior, and yet the main vectors of JEV are often considered to be highly zoophilic, accidentally biting humans [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. With their presence within the classrooms, the consideration of these species as opportunistic [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] seems more appropriate in Cambodia. However, contrary to <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, <italic>Culex</italic> spp. biting time is described as being nocturnal, which may minimize the importance of these potential mosquitoes in the transmission.</p><p>Also considered as night biting mosquitoes, 6 secondary vector species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. were described in 20 of the 24 schools, namely <italic>An</italic>. <italic>barbirostris</italic>, <italic>An</italic>. <italic>barbumbrosus</italic>, <italic>An</italic>. <italic>campestris</italic>, <italic>An</italic>. <italic>philippinensis</italic>, <italic>An</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic> and <italic>An</italic>. <italic>vagus</italic>. Considering the total number of these mosquitoes (325 mosquitoes representing only 0.91%), their role as only secondary vectors, the fact that malaria transmission occurs in the forest in Cambodia [<xref rid="pone.0233669.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the risk of malaria transmission is considered very low. Nevertheless, it is important to describe their presence in schools for any future evolution or dynamic of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The important biodiversity of mosquitoes discovered in schools in Cambodia is relevant and can represent a research axis, especially on the association between the different surrounding ecotypes (forest, culture, rice fields and urbanity) and the presence of specific mosquito species or vectors. Spatio-temporal analysis to study landscapes and weather effects should be considered to understand the distribution and abundance of different species in schools.</p><p>Such diversity was unexpected and inevitably leads to a diversity of potential vectors. The diversity of vectors, their dynamics, relative abundance, and distribution must be analyzed with mosquito behavioral studies to estimate the risk of transmission by evaluating the vector&#x02013;schoolchildren/teachers contact. To be exhaustive, a screening of pathogens carried by mosquitoes in schools should be implemented. The importance of JEV and DENV vectors in schools is in accordance with the main diseases circulating in Cambodia and affecting children. These findings are of particular importance and will help to recommend appropriate vector control strategies and program activities regarding specific locations such as schools and their environmental settings. Moreover, the description of the important presence of vectors in schools is an important step prior to vector control and for testing the implementation of new control methods adapted to schools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0233669.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>List of mosquito species caught in the different schools.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0233669.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0233669.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Results of Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) using Template Model Builder (TMB) using Family Poisson with &#x02018;school&#x02019; as a random effect reflecting the random choice of the schools on all mosquitoes, all vector mosquitoes, Japanese encephalitis virus vectors, Dengue virus vectors and Plasmodium spp. Vectors.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0233669.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors really want to thank the technicians that did the sampling in the field, Suor Kimhuor, Chhum Moeun, Chhuoy Kalyan and the different field authorities including all the Directors and Teachers of the 24 primary schools.

The data collection tools though not exhaustive (lacking in the survey of school environment for breeding sites) were appropriate and the data generated was adequate to address the set objective.</p><p>&#x02022; On the analysis of data, emphasis has been placed on expressing the diversity indices. The initial objective of explaining the burden of dengue and other arboviruses using the vector data in the diverse schools was clouded by the overemphasis on diversity indices. Additionally, interpretation of the diversity indices to explain the specific disease burden was not clearly brought (how will these indices inform decision towards reducing disease burden?). However, abundance of specific species to explain transmission of the target diseases, DEN, JE and malaria has been articulated</p><p>&#x02022; Key data sets mentioned in the manuscript (table 2) could not be found in the submitted manuscript hence the data referred to could not be verified to confirm the claims.</p><p>&#x02022; There is mention of an attempt to relate school characteristics (supposedly, the physical structures of the schools) to vector data but the table (table 1) referred to, which describes the characteristics could not be found in the manuscript. In addition, the data analysis presented in the results made no reference to the said school characteristics and weather there was any correlation to the vector data abundance or diversity.</p><p>Based on the above important major observation, the authors need to work further on the manuscript to improve on the listed issues and gaps before it can be considered further.</p><p>Specific comments Major</p><p>Abstract</p><p>&#x02022; The abstract is too thin on specific information that would be needed to get the real picture of what was found in terms of the specific target diseases. The information has been overgeneralized.</p><p>&#x02022; The conclusion missed the key point of how the data explains burden of the target diseases and what can be done about it. There was focus on biodiversity as a conclusion.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>&#x02022; The introduction has relevant information that pertains to the subject of investigation but its presentation is marred by numerous grammatical mistakes. It is suggests that if the authors are not usual English writers, they may need to identify someone to edit the manuscript for grammar.</p><p>&#x02022; Apart from Dengue, there is little information on the other arbovirus diseases like CHIK and JE and how they impacts on the population under 15. How is the incidence of DEN, CHIK and JE in the general population that suggests that children are disproportionately affected to rationalize focus on this age group.</p><p>Methods</p><p>&#x02022; How were the school characteristics classified and how were these used to define vector distribution and /or abundance?</p><p>&#x02022; How were the mosquitoes handled after trapping before identification? Were they identified in the field or in the lab? How were they transported? The methodology is very scanty with information.</p><p>&#x02022; Where were the CDC traps located within the school?</p><p>Results</p><p>&#x02022; As you discuss your data, explain how diversity indices measured (simpson and Shannon) influence the risk of dengue, JE or malaria transmission which seemed to have informed the selection of schools as implementation sites, arising from the burden of DEN and JE among children 15ys and below.</p><p>&#x02022; The tables detailing the data described.in the results is not accessible.</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript entitled &#x0201c;High diversity of mosquito vectors in Cambodian primary schools and consequences for arboviruses transmission&#x0201d; determined the mosquito diversity and abundance in 24 schools from two different provinces in Cambodia during the dry and rainy seasons in 2017-2018. The authors evaluated the mosquito diversity using light traps and BG traps Shannon and Simpson indexes. In the abstract, 61 species were described in schools, including Aedes, Anopheles and Culex genus. The manuscript proposal is interesting and promising to Cambodia authorities, especially because the authors mention that there are few data available on mosquito diversity in the country. However, the present manuscript needs to be thoroughly rewritten and more details should be given regarding experimental design, data analysis, results (e.g., Tables 1 and 2 are not present in the manuscript version that was sent to me), among others.</p><p>The authors should be more didactic in the analysis section: what were the independent variables? The authors mention that they analyze the data using a &#x0201c;The influences of parameters on Shannon and Simpson indexes were first determined by a general linear model with a stepwise method (lines 99-100)&#x0201d;. What was the model? Was it a GLM? What probability distribution was used? What are the &#x0201c;parameters&#x0201d; that authors mention? Why did they use two models to analyze the same data? How the authors managed to overcome pseudoreplication problems that are common with this kind of study? This section is confusing and is not clear. The authors should rethink their analysis strategy and probably update their results. The results are also very confusing as the authors use absolute abundance, relative abundance, the diversity indexes for the schools and seasons interchangeably and do not give depth to their analysis. They should focus on their results separating by sections. The results could be more explored, and they are not suitable for PloS One such as they are presented. I suggest the authors to explore a spatial approach in their data so that they have more interesting material. The discussion and conclusion sections are very interesting but should be updated after a new batch of analysis are done. Also, there are lots English mistakes and typos that need revision.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Please include your tables as part of your main manuscript and remove the individual files. Please note that supplementary tables (should remain/ be uploaded) as separate "supporting information" files.</p><p>Tables 1 &#x00026; 2 were incorporated in the main manuscript in the Results part.</p><p>We also add a Table 3 directly in the manuscript</p><p>ANSWER TO REVIEWERS&#x02019; COMMENTS</p><p>For the overall general comments, Reviewer 1 emphases our introduction and Reviewer 2 the discussion and conclusion, recommending to focus on Public Health areas. It seems that the biodiversity indices that we wanted to introduce through this article, bring too much perturbation to this article. We removed these common indices of biodiversity, but still talking about the unexpected biodiversity of mosquito species we found inside class rooms. Overall we add 3 tables in the text, we removed 4 figures and replaced them by 3 other.</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>Overall general comments</p><p>&#x02022; The research sets out to evaluate the vector abundance and diversity in primary schools in part of Cambodia in an attempt to explain the apparent burden of dengue fever, severe dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), other arboviruses and parasites like malaria among children, 15 years and below attending selected primary schools through vector surveys.</p><p>&#x02022; In the introduction the study is well justified and rationalized. The data collection tools though not exhaustive (lacking in the survey of school environment for breeding sites) were appropriate and the data generated was adequate to address the set objective.</p><p>&#x02022; On the analysis of data, emphasis has been placed on expressing the diversity indices. The initial objective of explaining the burden of dengue and other arboviruses using the vector data in the diverse schools was clouded by the overemphasis on diversity indices. Additionally, interpretation of the diversity indices to explain the specific disease burden was not clearly brought (how will these indices inform decision towards reducing disease burden?). </p><p>We deleted the results parts and the figures and maps related to the diversity indices that are not related to the different diseases and induced more confusion. But, we keep a result and discussion part on the diversity, even if we decrease the importance of this part, in order to illustrate also the huge diversity of mosquito species in the schools.</p><p>I am totally agree that there is no relationship between the diversity of all mosquito species and the different diseases. </p><p>However, abundance of specific species to explain transmission of the target diseases, DEN, JE and malaria has been articulated.</p><p>&#x02022; Key data sets mentioned in the manuscript (table 2) could not be found in the submitted manuscript hence the data referred to could not be verified to confirm the claims.</p><p>We are truly sorry with this major problem. AS usual, we add the tables as Excel files. But, in PLOS ONE, they ask to add the tables inside the text. It seems that the editors didn&#x02019;t check it and send you the file without the tables. We feel terribly sorry for the reviewers, and also a little disappointed against the editors work.</p><p>&#x02022; There is mention of an attempt to relate school characteristics (supposedly, the physical structures of the schools) to vector data but the table (table 1) referred to, which describes the characteristics could not be found in the manuscript. In addition, the data analysis presented in the results made no reference to the said school characteristics and weather there was any correlation to the vector data abundance or diversity.</p><p>These analysis were not made yet. The characterization of the landscape is very difficult and takes time. Regarding the objective characteristics obtained in the schools, such as the characteristics of the school, we wrote lines 108-117 &#x0201c;The association of the different parameters characterizing the schools and the period of collection, i.e. month, school, urbanization, district, province, presence of pagoda, school area, the number of classroom and children in the school and the relative densities of mosquito populations (i.e. all mosquitoes, all vector mosquitoes, Japanese encephalitis virus vectors, Dengue virus vectors, malaria plasmodium vectors) in the considered schools, were tested by a stepwise algorithm model, with backward elimination of non-significant parameters until a final minimum adequate model containing only significantly associated variables, in order to determine the main significant factors with the confirmation of residuals following the normality. A deeper characterization of month and school effects and their comparisons was carried out by using a Kruskal-Wallis test&#x0201d;.</p><p>Based on the above important major observation, the authors need to work further on the manuscript to improve on the listed issues and gaps before it can be considered further.</p><p>As you recommended, we reoriented the manuscript in regards of the observations you highlighted. Particularly, we focused more on the vector species, and we developed the conclusion on the possible ways of research.</p><p>Specific comments Major</p><p>Abstract</p><p>&#x02022; The abstract is too thin on specific information that would be needed to get the real picture of what was found in terms of the specific target diseases. The information has been overgeneralized.</p><p>In the abstract we add few sentences. A first sentence related to the main picture: &#x0201c;The research sets out to evaluate the vector relative abundance and diversity in primary schools in part of Cambodia in an attempt to explain the apparent burden of dengue fever, severe dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), other arboviruses and parasites like malaria among children, 15 years and below attending selected primary schools through vector surveys.&#x0201d;.</p><p>And we also add one sentence on the main results in terms of Public Health problematic: &#x0201c;Our results showed that schools in Cambodia represent a potential risk of vector born disease transmission and highlight the importance to implement vector control in schools in Cambodia to decrease the risk of transmission.&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; The conclusion missed the key point of how the data explains burden of the target diseases and what can be done about it. There was focus on biodiversity as a conclusion. </p><p>In the conclusion as at the end of the abstracts, we focused now mainly on the importance of implementing new methods for vector controls.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>&#x02022; The introduction has relevant information that pertains to the subject of investigation but its presentation is marred by numerous grammatical mistakes. It is suggests that if the authors are not usual English writers, they may need to identify someone to edit the manuscript for grammar.</p><p>The article was read again by a French native speaker that lived in U.S., and then, the article was read by an entomologist, Dr. Richard Paul, who is a English native speaker. </p><p>&#x02022; Apart from Dengue, there is little information on the other arbovirus diseases like CHIK and JE and how they impacts on the population under 15. How is the incidence of DEN, CHIK and JE in the general population that suggests that children are disproportionately affected to rationalize focus on this age group. </p><p>We choose to let these information in the Discussion part. But we had a sentence regarding the incidence of Dengue in children in Cambodia. About Japanese encephalitis, there is no data in Cambodia on the incidence of JEV in the population, incidence of JEV in children, neither a repartition of percentage children/total population. The only recent study is on the causes of acute meningoencephalitis in children population (with 24.4% of JEV). But there is no global data to add in the introduction. </p><p>Methods</p><p>&#x02022; How were the school characteristics classified and how were these used to define vector distribution and /or abundance?</p><p>The school characteristics are group in Table 1. You did not have this Table 1 in the previous version of the manuscript. I am sorry for that. Now, you can have access to these data. They were tested but none of them was influencing the data. There is another huge work to do for each species related to each factors, including temperature and spatial effect, but this is another huge analysis work that we need to begin.</p><p>&#x02022; How were the mosquitoes handled after trapping before identification? Were they identified in the field or in the lab? How were they transported? The methodology is very scanty with information.</p><p>LINES 95-105, we specified and detailed more our field protocol:</p><p>&#x0201c;Traps were set up during 24 hours inside classrooms with 1 trap per classroom. Following the traditional Cambodian construction, all classes of all schools have openings in the tops of each wall to let the air circulates and reduce the high temperatures occurring during the daytime, allowing the free circulation of mosquitoes. Depending on the size of the schools and the number of classrooms, three (or less) BG traps and three (or less) CDC light traps were used with a limit of a total of six traps per school (Table 1). After each collection, mosquitoes were conserved in an electric icebox at +4&#x000b0;C and first identified in the field the same day. Then, samples were brought back to the laboratory, still at +4&#x000b0;C, in Phnom Penh for a second identification. In the field and in the laboratory, mosquitoes were identified under stereomicroscope and microscope using morphological mosquito identification keys from Southeast Asia countries (Rattanarithikul et al. 2005; Stojanovich, and Scott 1966).&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x02022; Where were the CDC traps located within the school?</p><p>As writing in the previous sentence: &#x0201c;inside the classrooms&#x0201d;. But we also precised why : &#x0201c;raps were set up during 24 hours inside classrooms with 1 trap per classroom. Following the traditional Cambodian construction, all classes of all schools have openings in the tops of each wall to let the air circulates and reduce the high temperatures occurring during the daytime, allowing the free circulation of mosquitoes.&#x0201d; (LINES 95-99)</p><p>Results</p><p>&#x02022; As you discuss your data, explain how diversity indices measured (simpson and Shannon) influence the risk of dengue, JE or malaria transmission which seemed to have informed the selection of schools as implementation sites, arising from the burden of DEN and JE among children 15ys and below.</p><p>&#x02022; The tables detailing the data described.in the results is not accessible.</p><p>The diversity (as far as I know) did not influence the risks of dengue, Japanese encephalitis and so on. It doesn&#x02019;t mean it didn&#x02019;t, but I don&#x02019;t think so, and it was never prove. As I wrote before, regarding the comments of the reviewers, we removed the parts on the biodiversity indices to focus on the vector species.</p><p>And again, I really want to apologize for the absence of the table within the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #2: </p><p>The manuscript entitled &#x0201c;High diversity of mosquito vectors in Cambodian primary schools and consequences for arboviruses transmission&#x0201d; determined the mosquito diversity and abundance in 24 schools from two different provinces in Cambodia during the dry and rainy seasons in 2017-2018. The authors evaluated the mosquito diversity using light traps and BG traps Shannon and Simpson indexes. In the abstract, 61 species were described in schools, including Aedes, Anopheles and Culex genus. The manuscript proposal is interesting and promising to Cambodia authorities, especially because the authors mention that there are few data available on mosquito diversity in the country. However, the present manuscript needs to be thoroughly rewritten and more details should be given regarding experimental design, data analysis, results (e.g., Tables 1 and 2 are not present in the manuscript version that was sent to me), among others.</p><p>Following the recommendations, Tables 1, 2 &#x00026; 3 are now included within the body text of the article. As for the reviewer #1, I really want to apologize for the absence of the 2 previous tables. Generally, the tables are add in Excel files, but PLOS asked to put into the text. Deeply sorry for that inconvenient.</p><p>Following recommendations, some details were added in Material and Methods sections for experimental design, data analysis and also in the results part, as detailed before and below. </p><p>The authors should be more didactic in the analysis section: what were the independent variables? The authors mention that they analyze the data using a &#x0201c;The influences of parameters on Shannon and Simpson indexes were first determined by a general linear model with a stepwise method (lines 99-100)&#x0201d;. What was the model? Was it a GLM? </p><p>Yes. It was written &#x02018;general linear model&#x02019; meaning GLM.</p><p>What probability distribution was used? We used the What are the &#x0201c;parameters&#x0201d; that authors mention? Why did they use two models to analyze the same data? How the authors managed to overcome pseudoreplication problems that are common with this kind of study? This section is confusing and is not clear. The authors should rethink their analysis strategy and probably update their results. </p><p>The section statistical analysis was totally rewritten. You can no find lines 119-126:</p><p>&#x0201c;The influences of the different parameters characterizing the schools and the period of capture, i.e. month, school, urbanization, district, province, presence of pagoda, school area, the number of classroom and children in the school, the population in the considered village, were tested by first a general linear model (glm) with the confirmation of residuals following the normality, (2) then by a stepwise algorithm model to determine the main significant factors. None were significant except the month and school effects. A deeper characterization of month and school effects and their comparisons were realized by using a Kruskal-Wallis test.&#x0201d;</p><p>A Table 3 was added in the Result section to update the results, and discussed them.</p><p>The results are also very confusing as the authors use absolute abundance, relative abundance, the diversity indexes for the schools and seasons interchangeably and do not give depth to their analysis. They should focus on their results separating by sections. The results could be more explored, and they are not suitable for PloS One such as they are presented. I suggest the authors to explore a spatial approach in their data so that they have more interesting material. The discussion and conclusion sections are very interesting but should be updated after a new batch of analysis are done. Also, there are lots English mistakes and typos that need revision.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0233669.s003"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PLOS ONE Reviews.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0233669.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0233669.r003" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0233669.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Terenius</surname><given-names>Olle</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Olle Terenius</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Olle Terenius</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0233669" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

</p><p>PLOS ONE. ONE-D-19-20103 R1: High diversity of mosquito vectors in Cambodian primary schools and consequences for arbovirus transmission</p><p>ANSWERS TO REVIEWERS</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>Authors have collected mosquitoes in school and have observed high diversity.

We hope to have more projects in the future to be able to detect what is really circulating. Even if the entomological surveillance is difficult, with an estimation of less than 1 positive mosquito on 1,000 mosquitoes estimated, even during outbreak (few examples exist: Rift Valley fever in Madagascar, Zika in French Guyana&#x02026;).</p><p>One sentence was added in the conclusion line 265: &#x0201c;To be exhaustive, a screening of pathogens carried by mosquitoes in schools should be implemented&#x0201d;.</p><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is very important in providing the mosquito diversity in the country especially because authors mention that there are few data available on mosquito diversity in the country.

It might be the case that the characterization of the landscape is very difficult and takes time but incorporation of seasonality shouldn't take time.</p><p>Thank you for this remark. The reviewer was right: We indeed go back to the data by using glmm (function glmmTMB) in R, and observe significant effects, even if slight when looking at the data.</p><p>In fact, we have randomly selected our schools at the beginning, without taking into account the representativeness of all the schools in the region studied according to different parameters (number of students, pop dependent on this school, primary / college, urban / rural,% patients with the virus in the study area (or 5 km away, etc.). This is why we considered that the school is random. In fact, by putting the school in random effect, the GLMM calculated a regression for each school and the coefficients estimated for the other variables without the school bias. </p><p>At the end of the analysis, we repeat a shapiro.test on the residues, and we found a better result with residuals closer to normal. We also test the overdistention (surdispersion) of data and corrected it.</p><p>To summary, we finally did a glm analysis by taking schools as random effect.</p><p>The other random effect could have be the month of capture because, for organizational reasons, we did samplings every 3 months. So we also tested the month as a random factor. But there was no difference in the quality of the model (almost the same AIC) and we chose to include the month in the variables to be able to study its effect. </p><p>For the other point, as the observational study is on only one year, we are not able to study the seasonality as there is no replicates in time. We hope to be able to work on a several years&#x02019; observation database.</p><p>We precised in the text (Material and Method part, Statistical Analysis section) which analysis we did. We changed all this part. Regarding the results, we added the statistical effect in the text. Moreover we add a Supplementary file for the results of the analysis.</p><p>This manuscript could have been strong if the study also looked at the breeding sites in school surroundings and its correlations with mosquitoes caught in the classroom.</p><p>We also agree with that. We observed few breeding sites (in toilets schools, and few plastic garbage) for looking more specifically at Dengue vectors, but we did not do a complete characterization of all breeding sites in 24 schools (logistic and financial reasons). Also, this would have been another full study. </p><p>Authors should provide a clear recommendations of the vector control options and their justification. The options should be discussed in the discussion section stating why they are expected to work, how they will be implemented? etc? Especially in such a setting (i.e., classroom - school environment)</p><p>We remained global regarding recommendations for vector control because we did not study or characterize the insecticide resistance of the most dominant species, furthermore, we did not study their biology including the breeding sites as mentioned earlier.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0233669.s004"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">PLOS ONE ReviewsSM.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0233669.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0233669.r005" article-type="aggregated-review-documents"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0233669.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Terenius</surname><given-names>Olle</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Olle Terenius</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Olle Terenius</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj005" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0233669" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
