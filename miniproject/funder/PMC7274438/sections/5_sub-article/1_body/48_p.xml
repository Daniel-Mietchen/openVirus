<p>Reviewer #4: Overall, this manuscript is very important in providing the mosquito diversity in the country especially because authors mention that there are few data available on mosquito diversity in the country. In understanding that it might be referenced a lot in the future once published - it is important to make sure the manuscript is well written, the data analysis is appropriately and well performed, and the recommendations for vector control options are very clearer.</p>
