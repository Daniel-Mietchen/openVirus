<p>The results are also very confusing as the authors use absolute abundance, relative abundance, the diversity indexes for the schools and seasons interchangeably and do not give depth to their analysis. They should focus on their results separating by sections. The results could be more explored, and they are not suitable for PloS One such as they are presented. I suggest the authors to explore a spatial approach in their data so that they have more interesting material. The discussion and conclusion sections are very interesting but should be updated after a new batch of analysis are done. Also, there are lots English mistakes and typos that need revision.</p>
