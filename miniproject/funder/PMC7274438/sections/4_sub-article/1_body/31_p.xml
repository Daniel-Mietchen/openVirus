<p>For the overall general comments, Reviewer 1 emphases our introduction and Reviewer 2 the discussion and conclusion, recommending to focus on Public Health areas. It seems that the biodiversity indices that we wanted to introduce through this article, bring too much perturbation to this article. We removed these common indices of biodiversity, but still talking about the unexpected biodiversity of mosquito species we found inside class rooms. Overall we add 3 tables in the text, we removed 4 figures and replaced them by 3 other.</p>
