<p>The manuscript entitled “High diversity of mosquito vectors in Cambodian primary schools and consequences for arboviruses transmission” determined the mosquito diversity and abundance in 24 schools from two different provinces in Cambodia during the dry and rainy seasons in 2017-2018. The authors evaluated the mosquito diversity using light traps and BG traps Shannon and Simpson indexes. In the abstract, 61 species were described in schools, including Aedes, Anopheles and Culex genus. The manuscript proposal is interesting and promising to Cambodia authorities, especially because the authors mention that there are few data available on mosquito diversity in the country. However, the present manuscript needs to be thoroughly rewritten and more details should be given regarding experimental design, data analysis, results (e.g., Tables 1 and 2 are not present in the manuscript version that was sent to me), among others.</p>
