<p>Following the recommendations, Tables 1, 2 &amp; 3 are now included within the body text of the article. As for the reviewer #1, I really want to apologize for the absence of the 2 previous tables. Generally, the tables are add in Excel files, but PLOS asked to put into the text. Deeply sorry for that inconvenient.</p>
