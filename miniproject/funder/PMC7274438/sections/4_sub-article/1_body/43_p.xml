<p>These analysis were not made yet. The characterization of the landscape is very difficult and takes time. Regarding the objective characteristics obtained in the schools, such as the characteristics of the school, we wrote lines 108-117 “The association of the different parameters characterizing the schools and the period of collection, i.e. month, school, urbanization, district, province, presence of pagoda, school area, the number of classroom and children in the school and the relative densities of mosquito populations (i.e. all mosquitoes, all vector mosquitoes, Japanese encephalitis virus vectors, Dengue virus vectors, malaria plasmodium vectors) in the considered schools, were tested by a stepwise algorithm model, with backward elimination of non-significant parameters until a final minimum adequate model containing only significantly associated variables, in order to determine the main significant factors with the confirmation of residuals following the normality. A deeper characterization of month and school effects and their comparisons was carried out by using a Kruskal-Wallis test”.</p>
