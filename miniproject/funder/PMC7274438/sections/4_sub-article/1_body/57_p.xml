<p>We choose to let these information in the Discussion part. But we had a sentence regarding the incidence of Dengue in children in Cambodia. About Japanese encephalitis, there is no data in Cambodia on the incidence of JEV in the population, incidence of JEV in children, neither a repartition of percentage children/total population. The only recent study is on the causes of acute meningoencephalitis in children population (with 24.4% of JEV). But there is no global data to add in the introduction. </p>
