<p>Given that there are so many random effects â€“ I would have expected the analysis to be done using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) which takes into account random effects in addition to the usual fixed effects rather than using GLM. The statistician should check the analysis and the numbers presented. It might be the case that the characterization of the landscape is very difficult and takes time but incorporation of seasonality shouldn't take time.</p>
