<p>We agree with the reviewer comments about virus/parasites detection in the mosquitoes collected. This is mainly a financial issue. We hope to have more projects in the future to be able to detect what is really circulating. Even if the entomological surveillance is difficult, with an estimation of less than 1 positive mosquito on 1,000 mosquitoes estimated, even during outbreak (few examples exist: Rift Valley fever in Madagascar, Zika in French Guyanaâ€¦).</p>
