<p>Authors have collected mosquitoes in school and have observed high diversity. Some of mosquitoes collected are known to be vectors. However, authors don't report any evidence of presence of parasite or virus in mosquitoes collected but have largely discussed the transmission risk in schools. Since it is possible (not too difficult) to detect parasites (e.g. Plasmodium spp) and virus (e.g. DENV and other) in mosquitoes, I strongly suggest to authors to pool mosquitoes collected per species per school in order to search parasites and virus in these mosquitoes. Then, authors would be more consistent with their conclusion.</p>
