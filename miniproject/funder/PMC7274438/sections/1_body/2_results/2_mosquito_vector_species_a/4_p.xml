<p>The maps representing the distribution of all mosquitoes, all vectors, JEV vectors and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sp. vectors highlight the significant distribution of the different vectors regarding the different schools (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233669.g004">Fig 4</xref>). As an illustration, JEV vectors are present in important relative density in the majority of schools (with only 3 schools recording less than 100 mosquitoes with a minimum average of 67 JEV vectors per 4 days), especially important in three schools mainly in Angkor (relative density of 1,021 JEV vectors per 4 days), Koh Penh (796) and Punley (648) schools (
