<p>The list of the genera and mosquito taxa collected during the four collection sessions in the 24 schools is presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A total of 35,725 mosquitoes belonging to at least 55 mosquito species were collected. They were composed of 10 genera: 
 <italic>Aedeomyia</italic> (1 species), 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> (18), 
 <italic>Armigeres</italic> (1), 
 <italic>Coquillettidia</italic> (3) 
 <italic>Culex</italic> (16), 
 <italic>Lutzia</italic> (3), 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> (2), 
 <italic>Mimomyia</italic> (4), 
 <italic>Uranotaenia</italic> (4). On average, 25 Â± 4 mosquito species were found in all the schools, representing an important biodiversity of species compared to the 243 number of species already described in Cambodia. The genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and, 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> were collected in the 24 schools, and there were at least 8 different genera in 21 out of 24 schools. The genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> represented 71.7% of the total mosquitoes collected (25,609 mosquitoes/35,725) with 16 species identified. Sixteen 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species (18.6%; 6,643/35,725), and 5 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species (3.9%; 1,393/35,725) were collected (
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 3 most abundant species were 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>vishnui</italic> (18,422 mosquitoes, 51.6%), 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>indefinitus</italic> (4,614; 12.9%) and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic> (2,976; 8.3%), representing together 72.8% of all the mosquitoes caught during the 4 collections. These 3 species were present in all the 24 schools. Nine other species were also collected in all the schools: 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>peditaeniatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>bitaeniorhynchus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>brevipalpis</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>fuscocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>gelidus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ms</italic>. 
 <italic>uniformis</italic>. Schools with the largest number of species were Sre paing (37 species), Paprak (32) and Khvet Thom (30). The 2 schools with the least mosquito species were Ta Thok and Svay Areak, with 16 species each: they were the only two schools with less than 21 mosquito species. In August 2017, during the rainy season, we recorded the largest relative abundance of mosquitoes (10,196) with the highest number of species (48 species), while at the end of the dry season, May 2017, yielded the lowest relative abundance (6,713; 38 species). During the November (2017) and February (2018) collection sessions, the lowest number of mosquito species (35) was collected.
