<p>The presence of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in the 24 schools and during the 4 collection sessions implemented throughout the year illustrates the role that these species could play in the maintenance and transmission of viruses such as dengue in schools in general. In Thailand, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> was also collected in all rural, semi-rural and semi-urban schools [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> females were collected in the classrooms, as in our study, and many mosquitoes were positive for the dengue by PCR detection confirming their possible role [
