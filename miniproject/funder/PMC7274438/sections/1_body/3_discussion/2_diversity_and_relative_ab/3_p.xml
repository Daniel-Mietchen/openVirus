<p>A large majority of JEV vectors was observed with the notable presence of

 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>quinquefasciatus</italic>,

 <italic>fuscocephala</italic>, 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx</italic>. 
 <italic>bitaeniorhynchus</italic>. The proportion of these vectors (70%) in schools is comparable to the relative density found in a study of mosquito dynamics in rural and peri-urban areas in Cambodia (Boyer Pers. Com.). The presence of large numbers of these vectors in classrooms could also explain the high endemicity of Japanese encephalitis in Cambodia [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The large number of JEV vector species caught in classrooms suggests an anthropophagic behavior, and yet the main vectors of JEV are often considered to be highly zoophilic, accidentally biting humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. With their presence within the classrooms, the consideration of these species as opportunistic [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] seems more appropriate in Cambodia. However, contrary to

 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. biting time is described as being nocturnal, which may minimize the importance of these potential mosquitoes in the transmission.
