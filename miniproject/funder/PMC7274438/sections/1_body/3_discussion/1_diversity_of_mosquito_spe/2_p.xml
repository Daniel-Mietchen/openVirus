<p>Little is known on the epidemiological importance of schools in arbovirus and other pathogen transmission. There are only few studies worldwide, describing the mosquito biodiversity in these specific places, thus making it difficult to compare with our results (i.e. number and index). For example, a study implemented in Thailand in 2012 in classrooms only showed the numbers of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> collected without describing the other potential vector species present. The authors described the presence of 66 adult 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> collected in 10 schools from 50 classrooms, after the use of vacuum aspirators for 15 minutes per room [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The total number of mosquitoes (278) was very low compared to our methods, likely due to the methodology used, even if the proportion of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (24%) is higher [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In Colombia, during a surveillance carried out in 34 schools, adult mosquitoes were collected twice a year during 10 minutes with electric aspirators in 191 and 188 classrooms in 2 municipalities, and 9 mosquito species were formally described including 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and other genera. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, due to the geography, climate and other factors, it seems incoherent to compare our results to those of Colombia, where 324 mosquito species from 28 genera were recently described [
 <xref rid="pone.0233669.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
