<p>The authors should be more didactic in the analysis section: what were the independent variables? The authors mention that they analyze the data using a “The influences of parameters on Shannon and Simpson indexes were first determined by a general linear model with a stepwise method (lines 99-100)”. What was the model? Was it a GLM? What probability distribution was used? What are the “parameters” that authors mention? Why did they use two models to analyze the same data? How the authors managed to overcome pseudoreplication problems that are common with this kind of study? This section is confusing and is not clear. The authors should rethink their analysis strategy and probably update their results. The results are also very confusing as the authors use absolute abundance, relative abundance, the diversity indexes for the schools and seasons interchangeably and do not give depth to their analysis. They should focus on their results separating by sections. The results could be more explored, and they are not suitable for PloS One such as they are presented. I suggest the authors to explore a spatial approach in their data so that they have more interesting material. The discussion and conclusion sections are very interesting but should be updated after a new batch of analysis are done. Also, there are lots English mistakes and typos that need revision.</p>
