<p>Shortcomings of the study included potential for misclassification (bias) associated with the serological assays for characterizing the age of infection. Thus, there is chance that a few chronic infections might have been misclassified as RHI. To minimize this, we used recent infection testing algorithm (RITA), based on two serological assays and surrogate markers to provide information on recency [

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because RITA cannot eliminate all FPR, viral load measurements were included to reduce the FPR [
