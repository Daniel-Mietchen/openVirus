<p>Low CD4 cell count was significantly associated with TDR, a plausible indication of a rapid disease progression associated with drug-resistant strains. TDR has been shown to have a profound impact on HIV-1 pathogenesis in recently infected individuals. Individuals infected with HIV-1 strains with TDR have a rapid depletion of CD4 cell count during the first year of infection [
