<p>As reported from other studies, NNRTI mutations comprised a majority of the detected TDRMs [

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with K103N/S predominating. The high occurrence of this mutation is due to its ease of transmission compared with PI- and NRTI-associated TDRMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the tendency to persist for long durations [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Moreover, the observed high level could be due to the previous use of nevirapine monotherapy or nevirapine tail in short-course triple ART PMTCT, which has been associated with increased risk of resistance [

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Contrary to other studies in East Africa, we also observed a high frequency of M184V mutation [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The levels of observed NRTI mutations may suggest a change from the predominantly NNRTI to a combined RTI TDR epidemic, with majority of NRTI being M184V mutation. M184V is however generally highly revertant. Although studies have suggested a low fitness and hence transmission of M184V mutation, studies using more sensitive genotyping assays have shown that this mutation may still be transmitted [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] as minority variants. However, it is also likely that the observed mutations may be transmitted from patients on treatment who received non-standardized regimen or those failing treatment with resistance strains. Limited information exists pertaining acquired drug resistance from this population. Thus, more studies may be needed to verify whether the HIV TDR variants that we identified were transmitted from persons on HAART.
