<p>Phylogenetic analyses revealed that among persons with AHI/RHI, HIV-1 subtype A prevailed as the most frequent strain in circulation. HIV-1 subtypes C and G, and each of the variants of intersubtype recombinant mosaics (AD and A2D) were marginally present. Cumulatively, the frequency of CRFs was high. Some recombinants might indicate multiple infections [

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but further analyses are essential to validate these. Consistent with previous molecular epidemiological assessments, we found subtypes A and D to be the most predominant strains that drive the epidemics in Kenya [
