<p>We report the existence of a moderate level TDR in rural western Kenya, a level higher than the estimated prevalence (7.4%) in East Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and the overall weighted TDR prevalence (5.6%) in the high HIV prevalence sSA [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Global TDR estimates range from 8–22% [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The few independent studies in Kenya and East Africa have cited TDR prevalence of between 1–13% [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and 0–19%, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our results herein, including TDR prevalence, reflect information and activities as of 2012. Wide-scale and long duration of ARV use in this region could have contributed to the observed TDR prevalence [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Current ARV coverage among adults in this region is high, estimated at 50–69% [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] having been available for about nine years. Due to lack of temporal data especially after ARV scale-up [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], it remains unknown whether the 9.2% represents an increased TDR in this region. Published surveys have reported increasing TDR prevalence in Mombasa coastal Kenya: from 4.9% (2007/09) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to 13.2% (2009/10) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; Kampala central Uganda: from 7.0% (2002/04) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to 8.6% (2009/10) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; and Entebbe central Uganda: from 0.0% (2006/07) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to 19.2% (2006/09) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and decreasing TDR prevalence in Nairobi central Kenya: from 7.5% (2005) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] to 4.5% (2007/09) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The observed moderate TDR level in Ndhiwa is challenging to ART program due to increased risk of virological failure associated with pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The Stanford HIVdb revealed that about 9 of every 100 persons with AHI/RHI in Ndhiwa have viruses with mutations that confer at least potential low-level resistance to at least one of the ARV drug classes. Moreover, this together with the observed TDR have epidemiological consequences for further transmissions [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] owing to the high HIV incidence in this region [
