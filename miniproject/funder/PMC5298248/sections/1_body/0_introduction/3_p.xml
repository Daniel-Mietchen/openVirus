<p>WHO recommends that TDR should be assessed periodically among newly infected persons who are identified using a set of criteria that is likely to select persons who have AHI/RHI. These include drug-na√Øve young (&lt;25 years of age) and newly HIV diagnosed primagravida women visiting antenatal clinics, persons visiting voluntary counselling and testing/sexually transmitted infections clinics, or in high-risk populations, although limitations exist [
