<p>Only CD4 cell count was associated with the occurrence of TDR (p = 0.0145). Persons with TDR had a much lower CD4 median (cells/μL): 332 (IQR = 161.5–540.0) versus 589 (IQR = 420.5–726.0). No associations existed between TDR distribution and gender (p = 0.6750), participant’s age (p = 0.3068), acute vs recent HIV-1 infection (p = 1.0000), HIV-1 subtype (A: p = 1.0000, C: p = 0.4496, D: p = 1.0000, G: p = 1.0000, AD: p = 0.5535, A2D: p = 1.0000), and viral load (p = 0.8982).</p>
