<p>Our genotyping success rate was 94% (n = 87). Six (6%) samples (including two DBS) failed to amplify due to inadequate sample volume, poor sample integrity, or low viral load and were therefore excluded from the analyses. Eight of the genotyped samples had at least one TDR mutation (TDRM) resulting in an overall TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7–17.1). The distribution of class-specific TDRMs in the eight persons with TDR was quantified. Five (62.5%) had only one any class-specific TDRM (i.e., 1 person with PI TDRM, 1 with NRTI TDRM, and 3 with NNRTI TDRMs) while the rest had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Class-specific TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8–11.2) for NRTIs, 6.9% (95% CI 3.2–14.2) for NNRTIs, and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2–6.2) for PIs. In total, 10 TDRMs were observed: one in the protease (PR) gene and 9 in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene. The dominant TDRMs in the RT gene were K103N/S (n = 4, 4.6%) and M184V (n = 2, 2.3%), while in the PR gene only M46I/L (n = 1, 1.1%) occurred. We found no TDR among persons with AHI.</p>
