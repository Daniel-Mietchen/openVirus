<p>The TDR survey was nested within the Ndhiwa HIV Impact in Population Survey (NHIPS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], an incidence study conducted in Ndhiwa sub-county of Homa Bay County in Nyanza region of western Kenya, between September and November 2012. A multistage cluster sampling method was used to recruit study participants aged 15–59 years from 3,302 randomly selected households. Those who volunteered to participate in the study were interviewed and tested for HIV using a serial rapid testing algorithm. CD4 cell count, recency of HIV infection, and viral load for those who tested HIV positive were measured using validated laboratory procedures. Of the 6,076 persons eligible for NHIPS, 1,457 (24.1%) were confirmed as HIV-1 infected [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We collected the baseline characteristics of HIV-1 infected persons from the NHIPS records, and drug-naïve cases with AHI/RHI infection (n = 93) were included in the study.
