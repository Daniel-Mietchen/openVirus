<p>The NHIPS was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), Kenya; the Committee for the Protection of Persons, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France; and the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, US. All the participants provided written informed consent to be involved in the study. For participants younger than 18 years of age but older than 15 years of age and not a mature minor, the study details were explained to at least one parent/guardian for parental written permission and then to the minor for written consent. Mature minors are defined in the Kenya National voluntary counselling and testing guidelines as persons under 18 who are married, pregnant, parents, engage in behaviour that put them at HIV transmission risk or are child sex workers. However, mature minors were strongly advised to speak with and involve their parents/guardians in the study participation process if they felt it was safe to do so. All minors, unless matured, had parental/guardian written permission and also provided written consent.</p>
