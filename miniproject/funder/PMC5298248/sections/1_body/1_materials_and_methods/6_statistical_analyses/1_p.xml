<p>The overall TDR and drug-specific TDR prevalence were assessed in accordance with WHO standards [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and the 95% CI computed based on Wilson’s approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0171124.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Associations of TDR with categorical (gender, recency of HIV-1 infection, and HIV-1 subtype) and continuous (participant’s age, CD4 cell count, and viral load) variables were computed by Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, respectively. The overall TDR prevalence and patterns were descriptively compared to previous surveys in East Africa.
