<p>HIV status was determined using a parallel testing algorithm of two HIV rapid tests: Uni-Gold
 <sup>TM</sup> HIV (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) and Determine
 <sup>TM</sup> HIV-1/2 (Abbott Laboratories
 <sup>®</sup>, Tokyo, Japan). The recency of HIV infection was established by two serological assays: the Limiting Antigen (LAg) (Maxim Biomedical, Inc., Rockville, USA) and BioRad Avidity Index (AI) (Bio-Rad Laboratories, WA, USA) enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Assay cut-offs for the duration of recency were 1.5 normalized optical density (ODn) and 30% AI, respectively, for the two serological assays. Any sample that was identified as recently infected from either assay, was included in the study. Persons with AHI were identified by negative result with Determine
 <sup>TM</sup> (Abbott Laboratories
 <sup>®</sup>, Tokyo, Japan) and positive result with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) [

CD4 cell count and viral load were measured using PIMA point-of-care CD4 Analyzer (Alere, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan v2.0 (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ, USA), respectively, according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
