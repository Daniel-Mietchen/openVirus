<p>Dried blood spots (DBS) and plasma from persons with AHI and RHI, respectively, were used for HIV-1 genotyping. The partial 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (protease, PR: codons 6–99; reverse transcriptase, RT: codons 1–251) of the HIV-1 isolates was sequenced using a CDC-validated in-house genotyping assay utilizing a standard sequencing chemistry as previously described [

The predicted ARV drug responses in persons with TDR was assessed by the Stanford HIVdb v7.0 that is normalized to five drug response levels based on net drug score: Susceptible (≤9), Potential low-level resistance (10–14), Low-level resistance (15–30), Intermediate resistance (31–59), and High-level resistance (≥60) [
