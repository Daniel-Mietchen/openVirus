<p>HIV-1 subtyping was statistically done by maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstruction in MEGA6; a bootstrap of 1000 replicates was used to generate the consensus evolutionary tree and assess the strength of cluster from each node. Nineteen known reference sequences from Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database (

HIV-1 subtype K was used as an outgroup species. Multiple sequence alignment was achieved by MUSCLE program within MEGA6. The alignment was trimmed to a length of 1035 bp. According to the Bayesian Information Criterion scores of 24 different nucleotide substitution models, the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano with discrete Gamma distribution (0.42) (for non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites: 5 rate categories) and Invariable sites (0.54) (HKY+G+I) was selected as the ideal model to describe the substitution pattern. All positions containing gaps or missing data were completely eliminated. Subtree-Pruning-Regraftingâ€“Extensive (SPR level 5) method was used as the ML heuristic option for tree inference due to its effectiveness. The initial tree was automatically generated by BioNJ. A moderate branch swap filter was set in order to allow for a semi-stringent exhaustive optimization of the branch lengths and improvements in log likelihood values [
