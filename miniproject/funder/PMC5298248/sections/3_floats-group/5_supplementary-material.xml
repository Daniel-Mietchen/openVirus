  <title>MEGA phylogenetic maximum likelihood (ML) circular tree for HIV-1 subtyping of the partial 
   <italic>pol</italic> gene from AHI/RHI antiretroviral-naïve persons in the Ndhiwa cohort.
  </title>
  <p>The evolutionary history was inferred from bootstrap phylogeny test (1000 replicates) using ML phylogenetic reconstruction based on Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano with Gamma distribution and Invariable sites (HKY+G+I) model. The tree was rooted on HIV-1 subtype K (marked with ●). The 19 reference sequences used are marked with ▼ beside their names. The clustering of the 87 viral sequences with respect to the reference sequences allowed for the identity of the associated taxa.</p>
