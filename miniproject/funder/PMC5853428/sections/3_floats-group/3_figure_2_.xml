  <p>Predictive immune mediators determined from 6 pregnant women with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Level of immune mediators from 5 ZIKV-infected pregnant women with normal fetuses and 1 ZIKV-infected pregnant woman whose fetus had congenital anomalies, from serum samples collected during the acute (
   <italic>A</italic>) and convalescent (
   <italic>B</italic>) phases of disease were analyzed and presented in heat maps of normalized scores. In the heat-map presentation, the immune mediator concentrations were scaled between 0 and 1 for each measured immune mediator, and the average scaled value was then computed for each group. Blue shading represents the lowest average scaled value; pink shading, the highest average scaled value. Abbreviations: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; bNGF, beta-nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF-2, basic fibroblast growth factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GRO-α, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IFN, interferon; IL-1α (etc), interleukin 1α (etc); IP-10, interferon gamma-induced protein 10; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor, MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor; PIGF, placental growth factor; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-expressed, and presumably secreted; SCF, stem cell factor; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor 1α; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
