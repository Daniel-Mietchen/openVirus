  <p>Predictive immune mediators from 10 infants born to women with Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. 
   <italic>A,</italic> Level of immune mediators in serum samples collected from 5 normal infants and 5 infants with congenital central nervous system (CNS) deformities born to ZIKV-infected women were analyzed and presented in heat maps of normalized scores. 
   <italic>B,</italic> Cytokines from individual infants were compared between healthy normal infants and infants with congenital CNS deformities. Selected immune mediators are depicted as Tukey box plots. One-way analyses of variance were conducted on the logarithmically transformed concentrations with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc 
   <italic>t</italic> tests. Results were corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini and Hochberg; *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Abbreviations: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; bNGF, beta-nerve growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF-2, basic fibroblast growth factor; GRO-α, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IFN, interferon; IL-1β (etc), interleukin 1β (etc); IP-10, interferon gamma-induced protein 10; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor, MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor; PIGF, placental growth factor; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-expressed, and presumably secreted; SCF, stem cell factor; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor 1α; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
