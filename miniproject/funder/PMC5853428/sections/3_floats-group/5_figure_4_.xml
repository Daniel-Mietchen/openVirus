  <p>Signature of immune mediators in patients with acute Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. 
   <italic>A,</italic> All immune mediators up-regulated relative to healthy controls were analyzed, and the predicted network was depicted with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. 
   <italic>B,</italic> Relative levels of specific immune mediators between ZIKV-infected pregnant women carrying fetuses with or without congenital anomalies. 
   <italic>C,</italic> Relative levels of specific immune mediators infants born to these ZIKV-infected women. Abbreviations: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; bNGF, beta-nerve growth factor; FGF-2, basic fibroblast growth factor; GRO-α, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; IFN, interferon; IL-4 (etc), interleukin 4 (etc); IP-10, interferon gamma-induced protein 10; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor, MCP, monocyte chemoattractant protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PDGF-BB, platelet-derived growth factor; SCF, stem cell factor; SDF, stromal cell-derived factor 1α; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
