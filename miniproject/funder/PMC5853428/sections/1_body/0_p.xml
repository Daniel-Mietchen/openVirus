<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) has reemerged as an important flavivirus that has caused several Zika fever epidemics in various parts of the world. ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and is typically transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Since 2007, of 76 countries and territories that have reported evidence of mosquito-borne ZIKV local transmission, 29 countries have reported congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly, possibly associated with ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–6</xref>]. Most patients remain asymptomatic or suffer from mild symptoms that normally last 2–7 days. Symptoms include fever, arthritis/arthralgia, rash, conjunctivitis, joint pain, and headache [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, there is now evidence of ZIKV with Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–13</xref>]. Therefore, ZIKV infection represents a major public health concern with severe social and economic burden owing to a lack of commercial vaccines or effective antiviral treatments. Treatment is usually symptomatic and pain-relief medicine is the only available option during disease onset. Brazil, hit by the ZIKV epidemics since 2014, accounted &gt;200000 probable cases of ZIKV infection, with almost 2000 cases of microcephaly in 2015–2016.
