<p>Immune mediators can be detrimental to or protective of diseases [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Brazil has recently declared an end to ZIKV epidemics because the number of reported cases has decreased significantly since the later part of 2016; this may be linked to the development of herd immunity in populations [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but the effect of herd immunity (generation of protective antibodies against a particular pathogen after an epidemic) on the reemergence of ZIKV and/or DENV epidemics in the future is still unknown. In the current study, to better define ZIKV infection in patients, 95 patients were stratified according to their clinical features, and multiplex microbead-based immunoassays were carried out to determine the immune profiles of ZIKV-infected patients with different clinical features, ranging from mild symptoms to neurological complications. Most of the patients in this study displayed fever and rash only, confirming that Zika fever is generally self-limiting. However, in a small fraction of patients (11.6%), neurological complications developed 0â€“3 days after the appearance of acute symptoms, consistent with other observations [
