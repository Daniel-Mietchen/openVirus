<p>Given the observation that fetal development malformations could occur in a significant proportion of ZIKV-infected pregnant women, it is necessary to unravel the link between ZIKV and congenital CNS abnormalities, given the severe socioeconomic impacts. The differential levels of IL-22, MCP-1, IP-10, and TNF-α in pregnant women could serve as useful prognostic biomarkers to predict the possible outcome in infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers (

The independent detection of high levels of TNF-α (Supplementary Table S1) further strengthened the possibility of using this set of identified mediators as ZIKV prognostic biomarkers to improve clinical management and potential treatments in future ZIKV outbreaks.
