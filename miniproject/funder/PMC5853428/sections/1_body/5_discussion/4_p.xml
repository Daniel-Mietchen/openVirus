<p>Hypercytokinemia, more commonly known as “cytokine storm,” has been well reported in viral diseases [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the current study, ZIKV-infected patients had higher levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-18, GRO-α, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. Notably, IL-18 and IFN-γ have been shown to be important proinflammatory cytokines in host defense against infection and in natural killer (NK) cell activation [

Although little is known about the role of NK cells in patients infected by flaviviruses, the involvement of NK cells during the acute phase of ZIKV infection could be inferred from the high levels of IL-18 and IFN-γ. Moreover, studies in other flaviviruses have demonstrated the pathogenic role of IFN-γ in Japanese encephalitis virus infections through the down-regulation of a tight-junction protein within the blood-brain barrier [
