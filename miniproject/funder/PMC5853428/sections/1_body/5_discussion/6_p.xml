<p>The level of HGF was significantly lower in infants with congenital CNS deformities, suggesting an important role in the development of fetal CNS development in during gestation (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The presence of HGF typically activates the HGF/MET signaling pathway that further induces mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation [

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], while whereas role of HGF in neuroprotection has been indicated in both autoimmune and infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, it is now of prime importance to understand the mechanisms behind the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection that could lead to a down-regulation of HGF during gestation in developing fetuses.
