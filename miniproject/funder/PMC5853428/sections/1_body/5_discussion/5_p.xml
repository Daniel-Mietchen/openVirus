<p>Interestingly, higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4, IL-1RA, and IL-10, were observed in patients with mild disease outcome. Specifically, the level of IL-10 was higher in patients without any neurological complications. A similar pattern of the immune mediators’ network that contributes to the neurological status after pathogen infection has also been reported in various studies [
