<p>Currently, there is only 1 publication describing the cytokine profiles of 6 ZIKV-infected patients from acute to recovery phases [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Owing to the small number of patients, larger cohorts of patients should be accessed to strengthen the observations. In the current cohort, levels of 21 immune mediators were significantly higher in ZIKV-infected patients than in the healthy controls. This pattern is similar to an earlier study in another cohort that showed high levels of multiple immune mediators, including IL-1RA, IP-10, and HGF in DENV-infected patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. IPA analysis further revealed that these 21 mediators are highly interconnected and are involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). The NF-κB pathway has been reported to be activated in DENV infection and responsible for proinflammatory response [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, the exact mechanistic pathway involving NF-κB activation should be further explored.
