<p>Between February and August 2016, a total of 95 patients were recruited for this study, based on their clinical symptoms during hospital admission (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). All febrile patients’ serum samples (median interval between illness onset and sampling, 3 days) were screened with quantitative RT-PCR and/or in-house anti-ZIKV ELISA. According to the guidelines from the World Health Organization, ZIKV infection cannot be ruled out using only the PCR result [
