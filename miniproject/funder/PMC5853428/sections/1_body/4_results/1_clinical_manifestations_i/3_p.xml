<p>In this cohort, 6 of 83 patients who were positive for ZIKV at PCR were pregnant women. Of these 6 women, 1 (17%) was later found to be carrying a fetus with fetal growthâ€“associated malformations. The maternal and perinatal outcomes in these women and their newborns are listed in

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). As expected, of the 6 pregnant women, 5 delivered healthy newborns who tested negative for ZIKV by RT-PCR or ELISA. One woman delivered a newborn with congenital CNS deformities. In addition, 4 other newborn infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers (not part of the original 95 patients) were also included in this study. Of the total 10 infants born to ZIKV-infected mothers, 2 (20%) had intrauterine growth restrictions, 1 (10%) had paraplegia, 1 (10%) had microcephaly, and 1 (10%) had meningoencephalitis.
